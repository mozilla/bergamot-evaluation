What's he going to do? ČSSD in Prague does not know Voldemort or the confectionery
The new city councillors from the ČSSD will apparently have to overcome a certain language barrier in order to understand their old colleagues from the ODS in the Prague Council and the Council.
The Aktuálně.cz "tried" the members of the new board from the ČSSD, as they know the notoriously established slang that originated at the Town Hall during the last years when Prague was ruled by the current coalition partners.
The coded dictionary introduced by Prague's political elite during the previous era of Mayor Pavel Bém describes some of the most famous characters, situations and cases in the metropolis.
Surprisingly, it turns out that the new councillors don't understand the familiar terms very well.
At least that's what he says.
"Who is Voldemort?"
"I really don't know."
"I am more of a newcomer to Prague politics," lukáš Kaucký, the councillor for culture, responded to the test of the "godfather" vocabulary.
Although he is a political veteran, councilman Karel Březina reacted similarly.
Like the term "golf hole."
"It's the only term you give me that I sometimes use."
"Otherwise, I don't generally accept slang."
From the glossary, the expressions of which were published by the daily Aktuálně.cz in June this year before the ODS election congress, the editorial office selected six examples, mostly those notoriously associated with the Prague City Hall.
The Socialists should have explained the terms "Voldemort", "the largest golf hole in Prague", "go to the confectionery", "bull's isthing", "betrayal of the capital" and "rinsing".
The trio of councillors agreed to the quiz, while a fourth - Antonín Weinert, who is to head Prague's education system in the future - first promised an interview, but later did not return the phone.
The fifth councillor, Petr Dolínek, refused the test.
"I don't deal with these things at all, and I'm not going to judge how the citizens' democrats are having fun."
"I'm now figuring out how we're going to get along with our programs," he said.
As already mentioned, Councilman Lukáš Kaucký would not have recognized in the headline above that we are talking about an influential businessman and friend of the expressor Bém Roman Janoušek.
"Voldemort" does not mean anything to Kaucký and the only term he correctly guessed in the exam is "the largest golf hole in Prague".
"It's the Blanka Tunnel," kaucký says, adding, "But I know that from the newspapers."
"I'm going to have to pay for a language course," he jokes.
The golf hole is deciphered as the Blanka tunnel by not only matador Karel Březina, but also the councillor for the environment Lukáš Plachý.
Both Social Democrats then know who Voldemort really is, and Lukáš Plaché is also familiar with where to find this character - he knows the meaning of the term "go to the confectionery" .
"I think that means going to some Prague establishment," shy is close to deciphering that it is the headquarters of Janoušk's companies.
He recalls, in the same way as Březine, that he drew knowledge from newspapers rather than using such a dictionary.
In a social democracy, according to testers, there is no such well-run vocabulary of slang terms.
"I've consulted with my colleagues, but it looks like we don't really have anything like that."
"We call ourselves names, sometimes abbreviations and mischied names are used," says Petr Hulínský, chairman of the Prague ČSSD, whose party nicknamed Hulda.
"At school they called me Birch, but I don't know if my colleagues call me that," karel Březina confesses to his own nickname.
The journal Aktuálně.cz tried the name and it works.
Councillor Weinert is for party members Grandpa or less friendly Grandpa, representative Miroslav Poche, who drew attention to himself before the elections by fraud in party sponsorship, has the nickname "Igráček" among some colleagues.
Nicknames are also the only thing the Social Democrats allow in intra-party language.
Hulínský is said to be happy to hear Hulda, but the Aktuálně.cz also recorded another nickname for this Prague chairman.
The "doctor of tingly law" is said to recall that Petr Hulínský received his judr. degree from the Bratislava Police Academy.
Government wants to curb torture of 'witches', releases brochure
Women declared witches in Burkina Faso have several common traits.
They belong to the older generation, they cannot participate in work, for example, for health reasons, they are single and do not have children.
The one who "becomes" the witch is sent to isolation so as not to endanger the rest of the village.
"Men rarely make this fate."
"Young healthy women are not being removed because they help with work and give birth to children," says the order's sister, who cares for more than 100 women who have been expelled from their ranks in the West African capital of Burkina Faso.
The local government has now decided to crack down on the unusual "social measure."
She has published an informational brochure to help curb the witch hunt.
There's a catch.
"More than 70 percent of adults in Burkina Faso cannot read," die standard pointed out the disadvantage of written education.
Accusations of witchcraft are common in other African countries.
In Ghana, which borders Burkina Faso, 72-year-old Ammy Hemmah died last week after being tortured, dosed with kerosene and set on fire by three women and two men.
The case was reported by the BBC.
The perpetrators say it was an unfortunate coincidence.
According to their version, the woman ignited oil, which is used for ritual anointing.
It was said to have caught fire after the group wanted to "banish the evil spirit" from the woman.
The isolation of "witches" is supported by people regardless of the level of education attained.
Der Standard quoted a 42-year-old burkini businessman as saying: "The eaters of human souls have always been a danger," he said.
While in Burkina Faso the government is trying to moderate the witch hunt, in Gambia the president himself participated last year.
"After the death of his aunt, Gambian President Jammeh launched a large-scale witch hunt, which was supposed to have been involved in her death, and to try to kill the president himself with black magic."
"He ensued shamans from nearby Guinea to help, who, accompanied by police officers, soldiers and the president's personal bodyguards, forcibly took randomly selected men and women from Gambian villages to the president's farm in Kanilai," Amnesty International said in a report.
On the farm, trapped people had to drink a potion of herbs with hallucinogenic effects, which in addition caused intestinal and kidney problems.
Two trapped on the farm did not survive.
After international pressure, nearly 1,000 inmates were finally released.
Bakal's tenant: Drowns in stove, higher rent signed
An elderly stocky man stepped out the door of the client centre of RPG Byty "uhlobarona" Zdeněk Bakala, the largest private owner of rental apartments in the Czech Republic.
Under his arm he carried a file and in it new leases for three apartments: his, his daughter and his son, who is in prison.
All three have just been deregulated.
Instead of 3500 per month, from next year the son will pay CZK 4100 for a 2+1 second category apartment.
"And there's no hot water, and it has to be heating with petrama (solid fuel stove, nb.)," the man points the finger at his son's new contract, for which he has the power of attorney.
"But I signed it," he explains, half angry and half resigned.
The BytyOKD.cz, which called the new lease terms "incorrect and immoral," advises tenants not to sign new contracts and wait until December 7, when they will publish instructions on how to proceed against them.
But a man just waves his hand at it.
"One says it, the other says it," he frowns.
Ostrava is becoming a great laboratory of deregulation.
After the New Year, the vast majority of apartments that still have non-market rents in the Czech Republic await.
Aktuálně.cz therefore decided to visit the "laboratory" in person.
The Havířov waiting room RPG is one of four in ostrava and on Tuesday at 9 am it is already full.
Right next to the door is security from the security agency and a caller.
"Rent 2011", a special button on its touchscreen is on.
One knock and a piece of paper with a number comes out of the machine.
You won't even be able to read "157", and your number is already beeping on a large display under the ceiling of the waiting room.
In half a second, it's your turn.
After a while, an elderly married couple comes to ask about the rent, but the rush in the waiting room clearly does not apply to the new rents at all.
Most people came to solve common problems as usual - claims for repairs, insurance claims and the like.
Letters with new leases are received in ostrava's mailboxes by tenants of most of the 44,000 apartments in the RPG portfolio since about mid-November.
In letters, RPG Apartments proposes to increase their rent by 15 to 38 percent.
A special counter for new leases was opened at the client centre on 18 November.
"It runs through the week, so it's only in the run-up," the workers behind the counter respond after a moment's hesitation when the client introduces himself as a journalist.
Deregulation and Bakal's former mining apartments are a local hot topic.
Before the elections, the Deputy Speaker of parliament and Ostrava native Lubomír Zaorálek from the ČSSD took him in quite a bit, and even now the local newspaper is full of him.
"I want a new floor for 20 years."
"Not even a pos. and they didn't change my toilet board," the man says.
According to the workers, pensioners are coming most so far to see if they will get a rent discount if they sign on time, as RPG promises in the special offer.
Half the discount on february rent will also go to other tenants who sign the new contract by December 15.
However, the Havířov "deregulation" bulkhead is definitely not overwhelmed with questions.
"Of yesterday's 360 clients, only about 40 to 50 people were here for the 2011 rent," the workers behind the counter estimate.
The RPG proposes individual contracting where necessary on the website and its wall.
However, if both parties do not agree on the lease, it will have to be determined by an independent court.
"This is not a threat, but information about a possible and entirely legitimate legal procedure," the RPG warns on its website.
"No one's going to sue here," says one of the RPG Apartments workers, and the man on the street outside the client center partially rights her.
"I have a pension of 13,000 and I have 5,000 left to eat, I don't have what it takes to sue," he says.
But the worker is immediately unsuased.
"We'll see."
"Mr. Zaorálek is telling them in the media not to sign, so I guess people are waiting," he reflects.
Rent regulation ends in most of the Czech Republic with the New Year 2011 and according to RPG Byty, their increase is an economic necessity.
"The current rent is still below the level necessary for the simple maintenance of the housing stock," says Pavel Klimeš, Director of the Residential Portfolio at RPG Byty, noting that the neglect of the housing stock is the main reason for the increase in rents, according to homeowners.
While in the five years between 2005 and 2010, RPG could invest four billion in apartments, in the four years from 2011 to 2014 it is supposed to be 5.2 billion.
Meanwhile, the large screen hanging from the ceiling opposite the padded seats of the miners' waiting room repeats a few red highlights.
"Rent increases of 15% or less in 2011 affect 31,200 apartments, that's more than 90% of RPG apartments."
"And it will always be the most by CZK 7.50 per square meter per month," it appears on the screen.
For only 400 apartments in the RPG portfolio, the rent will increase by 38 percent.
"In these cases, this is an increase from an extremely low amount of CZK 19.66 per square metre," points out the RPG.
For 2,600 apartments, the rent will remain the same next year.
RPG Byty promises that deregulation will not drive out rents in leaps and down, but will be spread over four to eight years.
In addition, it adds another commitment: all the money from the rent increase (see chart) will be put back into the apartments, mainly in heat savings - new windows and insulation.
They should preferably be given to people who sign an agreement to increase rents.
The offices also include a kindergarten, the architects understood
The Avriopoint office building in Brno is the new headquarters of Arch.Design.
No one would expect it to also house a mini-school with everything that goes with it - with colorful walls, imaginative furniture, a pile of toys and even a miniature playground on the outdoor terrace.
Since October last year, children of Arch.Design employees have been able to visit it.
The project-architectural company Arch.Design, from which a number of important Brno buildings emerged, had been counting on space for its company mini-school since the first drawings of the Avriopoint building.
She employs almost 90 people, mostly babybooms, and cared that the women designers and architects could quickly return to work.
Together with the possibility of part-time work, the kindergarten is a benefit Arch.Design offers to its employees as part of the social program.
Builders and architects thus have the opportunity to combine demanding employment with childcare.
The mini-school was invented by arch.design employees themselves and with the support of the management they managed to get a subsidy from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
The company mini-school is financed by the European Social Fund through the Operational Programme Human Resources and Employment and the State Budget of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to grant financing (subsidy in the amount of CZK 2.8 million), they were able to purchase equipment and equipment and provide qualified staff and operations for two years.
After exhausting the financial subsidy (2 years), the company Arch.Design to operate a mini-school at its own expense for 3 years.
The project took one year to prepare and Economy Rating significantly helped with the grant application.
Care is provided by qualified staff, children are cared for all day by a nurse and a kindergarten teacher, so children can go to kindergarten without age restrictions, yet most of them are over 3 years of age.
Since it is a "mini-school", only 5 children can be present at the same time, but during the day more will be replaced.
The operation of the kindergarten is flexible according to the needs of parents and children of all employees have the same right to use the kindergarten regardless of the hierarchy of position in the company.
Although it is an individual education and care, the programme content in the mini-school is comparable to the framework programme of preschool education.
Children not only play here, but also provide them with quality teaching - from basic cognition to preparation for school benches, English language is also taught.
The class is equipped not only with toys, stimulating games, but also a computer that children can use.
The presence of young children directly in the company creates a friendly and positive environment.
Parents can check their child at any time and stressful situations with delayed pick-up of children from kindergartens away from the parents' workplace are removed.
Parents thus use working hours more productively.
No wonder an employee-employer relationship is created here.
Arch.Design, he has become one of the Czech companies that offer a significant benefit in recruiting new employees, are family-friendly and through this program has strengthened personnel marketing.
The house of bones still fascinates after 100 years. Check out Gaudí's interiors
The roof looks like the back of a prehistoric lizster, the staircase resembles the backbone of a dinosaur, and the balconies are an open fish mouth.
Such is casa batlló house in Barcelona by Catalan architect Antoni Gaudí.
Thanks to its organic shapes, the house earned the nickname House of Bones from the locals.
Organic shapes, wild colors, unusual use of stone, tile fragments and mosaics, a façade resembling scales and ubiquitous soft curves are all typical of Antoni Gaudí's Secession.
The façade of the house is played out by dream lines, tender colors and textures reminiscent of nature and animals.
In detailed observation, you can see geometry, rhythm and precisely thought-out order.
At night, the whole façade of the houses sounds even more dramatic, it is lighted so that the impression of the shine of the colors is enhanced.
The venting and twisting of shapes also appears in the interiors.
Wood in waves copies window frames, railings, decorative elements of doors, peephole and railings.
House Batlló, located in the Eixample district on the busy passeig de Grácia shopping street 43, was created by the reconstruction of the 1877 house by architect Emilio Sala Cortes.
The reconstruction took place for two years and the house was completed in 1906.
The investor, wealthy industrialist Josep Batlló, originally insisted on demolishing the old building and building a brand new one, but soon accepted Gaudi's idea for an unusual and cheaper redevelopment.
However, Antoni Gaudí did not design the Casa Batlló apartment building himself.
Architect Josep Maria Jujol collaborated with him.
It was on his design board that decorations were created for the representative apartment of the owner of the property and the use of mosaics on the façade.
A number of other artists and artists also worked on the façade.
Joint work on the designs of the Casa Batlló house started a successful cooperation between Jujol and Gaudí.
Jujol participated in the construction of Gaudí's Casa Milá house and Güell Park, which houses other works of Gaudí.
Soon after completion, the house earned the nickname "House of Bones" due to its organic shapes.
Others began to call it a "manly house" because of the specific window-opening mechanism.
It is also said that at the top of the building is depicted the sword of St. George, the patron saint of Catalonia.
Hidden religious motifs include other sculptural elements of the building.
Gaudí designed a unique central heating system with ventilation vents and typical chimneys for his time.
Bizarre may seem their forty-five-degree slope.
When creating Gaudí, he absolutely did not respect the building regulations of the time and did not allow himself to be bound by them.
At the beginning of the construction, he obtained a building permit from the city, but the data he provided about the planned reconstruction were so vague that two years later, during the completion, the city council was horrified by the result and asked for redress.
Councillors were annoyed, for example, that the building extended to the pillars and to the public sidewalk.
The correction never happened, on the contrary: only fifteen days after the city council's call, Josep Batlló applied for (and successfully obtained) permission to rent the two highest floors of the building.
The owner himself moved to the lower floors.
In the gallery on the second floor there was a social salon and on the third floor there was a bedroom and a private part of the apartment.
The ground floor was rented out to a jewelry store.
The whole six-storey house is interseed by a staircase, which can be climbed up to the roof terrace itself.
The essential elements of the reconstruction were the abolition of all right angles and straight lines and their replacement with curved walls.
Gaudí also worked with the modern concept of connecting spaces.
The social part can be completely connected by opening the salon door, and a larger society can communicate comfortably with each other without at the same time maintaining the privacy needed for more intimate conversations.
In addition to the new façade, the house with Gaudí's reconstruction also received unconventional roofing and two extra floors.
Gaudí's play with light, blue and white glazed tiles, which are lined with an inner courtyard, and skylights is also impressive.
The two-color game adds maximum light on all floors of the house.
It was enough to simply bet on the principle that white reflects light more than dark light, which, on the contrary, absorbs the sun's rays.
The Casa Batlló house, which was included in the Unesco World Heritage Fund in 2005, can be visited by everyone.
On the first floor of the house is the most transparent and opulsable apartment accessible to the public.
The owners decided to do this only in 2002, on the occasion of the celebration of the 150th anniversary of the birth of the famous creator.
They persisted in the tours as they found it to be a very profitable place and extended the tours to include common and attic areas, including a roof terrace.
Admission to the monument is certainly not negligible, at €16.50, and students, pensioners, groups and tourist card holders have a 20% discount.
The sum far exceeds the price of admission to other Gaudí buildings in the city.
If you want to experience the true atmosphere of a house with dragon turrets, you need to quickly make friends with one of the inhabitants of the apartment building and visit it directly at home.
How to choose a mattress and grate: women have different requirements than men
Not the sumptuous bed frame, but the quality of the lying area, i.e. the mattress and grate, give the basis of a really good bed.
However, they must be harmoniously complemented to suit a specific user.
When choosing, a lot of things decide, from weight, height, age, health status and gender of the owner.
Also important is the type of interior into which mattresses and grates are taken.
archetype?
For example, latex mattresses are not suitable for weekend cottages, where they do not heat regularly, because they "heat up" more slowly.
In addition, they have a significantly higher weight than a standard polyurethane mattress.
It is necessary to turn them over regularly.
If they don't have a lot of vent ducts in the core, and they're still lying on a solid plate, they're retaining moisture: Mold could also appear underneath.
When choosing, the habit also decides.
Those who have spent a long time abroad, where very tall mattresses with a softening layer are often used, will hardly feel comfortable on a low and hard surface.
"Perhaps all the hockey players who were coming back from the NHL complained to me that they wouldn't sleep here."
"For their beat-up shoulders, heels and hips, they needed mattresses with a softening layer of lazy foam."
"These are also recommended for people with diabetes who have a nervous system disorder, so they misinterpret "information" from joints and skin," explains Sylva Hadamczik, who specializes in upholstered furniture.
Many hockey players, as well as other customers, were looking for lazy foam mattresses years ago.
"Today it is fine, suitable mattresses have tempur, Italian Magniflex, but also Czech Tropico."
You don't have to be an NHL guy to appreciate lazy foam.
This "miracle" works simply.
It optimizes its stiffness and shape according to the absorbed heat or adapts to your warm body.
Nothing's pushing you, you're not going to roll over at night like you did after a tough fight.
You'll just get a better night's sleep.
Lazy foam also acts as a protection against lying down.
When choosing the size of the mattress, add the length of the foot to its height, which is usually about 21 to 34 cm.
Both male and female with a height of about 180 cm need a bed of 210 to 220 cm.
The minimum width for one should be 90 cm for a double bed, a total of 180 cm.
For single beds, for example singles, at least 120 to 140 cm are recommended.
For comfort and a possible visit.
"Otherwise, the rule for bed width is simple: when lying on your back, your hands should be comfortably slightly bent at the elbow," advises Helena Prokopová, Guild of Upholsterers and Decorators, who has been working on the issue of healthy sleeping and furniture ergonomics for many years and has been lecing her at vocational schools.
For a double bed, everyone needs their own grate and mattress, but be careful when shopping here to match the mattress heights.
Otherwise, you will have no choice but to mount the grates at different heights, but you may not be able to do that with each bed frame.
Foam mattresses should be at least 14 cm high, types with a spring frame of at least 15, of which at least three centimeters should be calculated on the forming and cultivating layer.
"When touching your hands or sitting on a mattress, you definitely must not feel the springs," warns Helena Prokopová.
Each mattress requires a certain type of grate.
Full-length beds, where mattresses and bases are like consaluous Siamese twins, have no place in the bedrooms.
Mattresses are poorly ventilated, their cover cannot be washed, which is already common today.
And since we normally sweat 0.2 to 0.75 l of sweat per night, it is clear that after five to seven years the mattress will begin to resemble one large (and clogged) sieve.
That is why experts reject advertising slogans about mattress lifespans of up to 25 years, or even lifetime guarantees.
But everything has its buts.
Therefore, practical advice from sellers: for mattresses with a width of 120 or 140 cm, do not give up the removable coating, but rather add a mattress protector that you can easily remove and wash.
Although mattress covers with run-offs are now commonly made around the perimeter, so that after unbuttoning we get two parts (very important for washing and washing machine size!), handling in larger types (and with one person) when shooting could resemble a light-heavyweight fight in the ring with a heavy one.
Do you have a sturdy board in bed instead of a grate?
never!
Maximum for a bed designed for one night visitors.
However, provide the board with ventilation holes (if it no longer has them) and use a mattress with a spring frame and a height of at least 15 cm with springs in the bags (from it). Taschenfederkern) and the cultivating layer.
Polyurethane mattresses do not belong on such a substrate.
Latex or sandwich mattresses (such as latex and coconut combinations) will be suitable for non-positioning slats with 14 to 18 slats, but you can always pay for grates with more slats, 28 or more, where the slats in the lumbar area are doubled and their stiffness can be regulated.
Reclining slats do not include mattresses with a spring frame, as they do not respond to positioning.
In addition to adjusting the slats' greasiness, you can also indulge in a so-called shoulder cradle.
It is a special attachment of the slats, which allows to push or even tilt the slat so that the sleeper's shoulder "sinks" nicely.
For men who have "shoulders all over their backs", definitely an important thing.
It is even remembered by mattress manufacturers, who in the "men's" began to use a softening zone precisely in the shoulder area.
They also remember women - they in turn give them a softer surface in the places of the hips.
For the most demanding customers are designed aileron or plate grates with multitore upholstery.
The pressure spreads over multiple points and the voltage decreases.
However, beware, once you use the wrong pillow (large and "phoous") on the right mattress and grate, most "plus" disappears.
The basic rule is simple: the pillow should support the head and with its tips to intervene only to the shoulders so that the shoulder muscles can relax.
As a suitable size, 50 x 60 cm is recommended, which they prefer, for example, in Scandinavia.
When lying on the side, the pillow should balance the height of the shoulder (along with the shoulder cradle of the grate or the softened zone in the mattress).
Modern mattresses have something to do with the original straw hats filled with grasses.
Their manufacturers are increasingly using natural materials, or at least admiss.
Organic mattresses are also a trend.
The raw materials from the oil from which polyurethane foams are produced are replaced by natural oils, such as jump and soybean.
Soybeans are used by almost all known manufacturers.
"Bio for mattresses means that the core is made of material of purely natural origin," explains Petr Vasicek from Tropico Plus.
Natural substances are also used in the production of mattress covers, one of the first was aloe vera.
But you can also indulge in micro-canps to release the fresh smell of forest or lavender.
There is also a division between men and women.
While the male is "cooled" by plant birch extract to absorb heat and cool the body, women, on the contrary, "drown" the covers.
Red pepper extract increases blood circulation, making it warmer for the weaker sex.
Today's favorites?
Mattresses made of cold foam (it has larger pores with a broken cell structure, it is thus more airy than ordinary polyurethane and offers better elasticity.
The combination of different cold foam and "lazy" foam creates multi-zone mattresses that know exactly where the head, loins and heels should be.
You can pay about 7,000 crowns or more for a quality mattress.
Those that meet health parameters tend to have a lower VAT rate, are taken as medical aids.
Gumotex was the first to achieve this advantage in the Czech Republic.
Saving on a mattress and grate is not easy.
Sometimes you can take advantage of actions of manufacturers or sellers who offer two mattresses for the price of one.
Magniflex, for example, offers a Duofreeze mattress with memory foam sewn into the cover for CZK 11,990.
However, the second can already be purchased for free.
Tempur started the era of lazy or viscoelastic foams with an open cell structure and high density at a "cosmic" pace.
It was originally created as material for NASA because astronauts were subjected to enormous overload during launches.
Tempur softens warmly, but strengthens in the cold.
Thus, it perfectly adapts to the warm human body and decomposes its pressure optimally.
It is therefore ideal against the development of bedtime, but also for increasing sleep comfort.
Viscoelastic foams are used not only for mattresses, but also for medical products, for example, on special pillows under the feet, which lighten the legs and venous system.
Local manufacturers use eucatherm C foam or Twinsaver foam and the like.
More and more parents want to watch people, so they want to keep an eye on their children.
Fear for your own child is driving more and more people to the idea of gps monitoring.
The system originally designed for car searches can also track the movement of people and thus help in cases such as the disappearance of nine-year-old Anna Janatková.
The device is about the size of a matchbox, but soon it can only be as big as a watch.
Many people were horrified by the case of missing Annie and began to look for means to better protect their children.
Even at the cost of intruding on their privacy.
"We try to tell everyone that this is not spying, but another means to reduce the likelihood of a tragedy happening," says Petr Pilin of Macro Weil, one of the suppliers of surveillance equipment to the Czech market.
"I admit that in some cases such devices can be misused, for example when they are put in a bag by someone who does not know about it, but we have not yet encountered such a case."
"Most of the time, customers actually buy it for safety reasons," Pilin added.
According to him, the child should always know what the purpose of the "box" is used and how it is used in an emergency.
Child psychologist Dana Bočková points out that if a child does not want to wear anything like this, they will simply get rid of it.
"Even very young children show great creativity in how to lose some things on purpose when they don't want to be in control."
"Mobile phones used to be very expected by parents, but they can be turned off just like these tracking devices," says Bočková.
According to it, it is also questionable whether such a device would actually help in the event of an attack.
"As far as the upcoming abduction is to be made, the perpetrator will almost always ensure that the child does not have any electronics on him that could reveal his location."
"It's a phone now."
"When the tracking devices start to expand, they'll be looking for them, too, because their sales will surely be boosted by massive advertising."
"In that case, criminals will always be one step ahead of the police," says the psychologist.
However, he admits that a similar device can help in the event of a call-up by a paedophile.
According to Robert Čech of RC Monitoring, which offers surveillance services for both cars and people, even if a tracking device is immediately destroyed after an attack, its presence can help.
"The device can be set to send location regularly after a certain period of time."
'Should it be damaged, at least the last position of the person concerned shall be available.'
"The more expensive devices have also built-in tiltometers, so even if one just slips and remains motionless, the device immediately sends a warning with a position," says The Czech.
According to him, smartphones with navigation can also take a similar service, where you can upload special software.
The problem with current tracking units is that they are either devices similar to pendants the size of matchboxes or smaller mobile phones.
They are always in danger of being lost.
According to Pilin of Macro Weil, therefore, devices that look like a regular digital watch are now being tested.
"This will have the greatest advantage in that any aggressor may not recognize the tracking device at all."
"Or he'll only know them after a while, and that can give the police extra time," he adds.
Whether the tracking devices develop into bracelets or pendants, they will still use the same technology that is used to guard cars.
It is a combination of gps location (which is used by common autonavigation) and the function of a mobile phone that reports the current position of the car.
The army has the incendiary cords to surround the Czech Republic. But it only lasts two years.
The Czech army has purchased 445 kilometers of lines that fire explosives.
Last year, the Ministry of Defence delivered 224 kilometers of lines to the warehouses.
The army has a supply for 225 years.
The problem is that the durability of the cords is two, four years at the most.
The army bought the fuse from the joint stock STV Group, a.s. for CZK 40 million.
In order to justify the purchase of such a huge amount of fuses, the General Staff wrote back to MF DNES that soldiers consume 60 kilometers of fuses per year during training.
However, the calculations of the army pyrotechnics contacted by MF DNES show that all generals, army command officers, secretaries or cleaners would then have to undergo very intensive pyrotechnic training every year.
Defense Minister Alexander Vondra and Army Chief Vlastimil Pick, including.
That's the only way to justify the army's annual consumption of sixty kilometers of fuses.
This length corresponds to 25,000 explosions.
And even if that were the case, the army's reserves would last more than a decade.
On the contrary, if it were true that a maximum of two meters of incendiary cord is enough to train each new professional, as experts say, the army has secured - even with increased consumption of professional or special forces - supplies for the aforementioned 225 years.
Meanwhile, soldiers of the Rapid Response Brigade recently complained personally to Minister Vondra that they had almost no small arms bullets, so shooting is also restricted due to a lack of money.
Not to mention a lack of underwear.
"I'm not sure they're buying so many fuses from us repeatedly."
"But it's their decision, and I'm sure they know what they're up to."
"For us, the army is a good customer, which we as traders try to accommodate," says Jan Děcký, sales manager of STV Group.
Defense Ministry spokesman Jan Pejšek also justifies hundreds of kilometers of purchased lines by saying that the army will have a supply of this "ammunition" for at least ten years.
Jan Děcký from the STV Group, however, talks only about the four-year lifespan of the fuser and police or army pyrotechnics even about two years.
"With perfect storage, it could be the four," says one of them, who, as a soldier, does not want to give his name because of criticism from the army.
At the end of its life, each ammunition must be carefully tested to see if it is still reliable and does not endanger soldiers' lives.
However, these tests are not free and cost additional money.
Another argument of the Ministry is a quantity discount on 445 kilometers of fuse.
"They cost us sixty percent less than last year's delivery of two hundred and forty-four kilometers," says spokesman Pejšek, interpreting the opinion of the buyers of the Ministry of Defence.
By way of comparison, the annual consumption of firing lines of police bomb squads destroying world war II or Soviet army ammunition has not exceeded 1,500 meters for several years.
And the police always order only enough to consume this ammunition before the end of its life.
It has proven itself for the safety of pyrotechnics, and it can also gain more modern and therefore more reliable types of cords more flexibly.
The Ministry of Defence is already having considerable difficulty in destroying tens of thousands of tons of ammunition from the Warsaw Pact, when the 200,000-strong Czechoslovak army was preparing to march on the Rhine.
According to the czech pyrotechnics contacted by MF DNES, the Czech one will face the same problem in a few years: it will dispose of hundreds of kilometers of old fuses, which it now "cheaply" buys.
To this day, I draw on the contacts I gained from the competition
The winning place in the Tradesman of the Year competition helped Lukáš Pytloun sell the franchise of his hotel.
The winner of last year's Tradesman of the Year competition was 28-year-old entrepreneur Lukáš Pytloun from Liberec.
His success story is like something out of a movie.
Lukáš Pytloun liked to travel.
And abroad he realized that liberec lacks quality accommodation at a reasonable price.
With savings from foreign brigades and bank loans, he bought a half-demolished house with five apartments.
For a third-year college student at the time, that was a lot of courage.
"At that time, he did not give me the ratio between quality and the price of accommodation in our country, so that I would not try to do something about it," says Lukáš Pytloun.
He began renting the first renovated apartment to foreign workers.
He invested all the profits back in the house, which he gradually turned into a 54-bed guesthouse.
Since then, in seven years of business, he has gradually managed to open four guesthouses, two stylish restaurants and two hotels in Liberec with a total capacity of over 300 beds of all categories of accommodation.
The most comfortable of them was until recently the four-star Pytloun design hotel.
This year, however, he was joined by another one of the same quality.
"We have just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrov near Tisá, where we sold our franchise concept and other bidders for the Pytloun hotel franchise are applying," says last year's number one sole trader.
"And it was the victory in the Tradesman of the Year competition that played a big part in this sale of the license to operate the hotel," adds Bagman.
The victory brought him greater acquaintance and popularity in Liberec and its surroundings.
"People recognized me on the streets, often congratulating me, and I have to say, it was nice," he recalls.
He definitely recommends participating in the competition to all those who are trying to do something.
It is not even necessary to win, every visibility is good.
He says he still draws on contacts and acquaintances that he might not have gotten to otherwise.
"I started doing regular business with some of the people I met because of the competition."
According to him, the fame associated with success fell on every employee.
And that he's in his 70s.
"I see them as more loyal and proud to be involved in something that has gained widespread recognition."
"It's not just my personal success, it's the result of all of us working together."
"Only my name is put to the forefront," lukáš Pytloun says modestly today.
I wish my successor a quieter year than we had in Farmet
The euphoria of victory was quickly replaced by the effects of the crisis.
Thanks to the winner's single-mindedness, however, Farmet has had a worse time.
The owner of farmet, Karel Žďárský, came to the slavonic house last year for the first place award in last year's Vodafone Company of the Year competition.
At that time, the jury appreciated the effort through which he built a company with hundreds of millions of turnovers from a small tool shop in Česká Skalice.
"I can say that the award has encouraged not only me, but all my co-workers and increased our confidence to compete with the competition," says last year's winner today.
At the beginning of Farmet's history, there was a desire to do something useful.
So when the state offered Karel Žďárský's father a small workshop to compensate for communist foreclosures, he did not hesitate for a long time, turned down a career in the company where he worked at the time, and he and a few friends around his father set up a plastic bath company.
Soon after, they began to specialize in vegetable oil presses.
After 18 years, they became the largest manufacturer of automatic presses in Central Europe.
Even among the unprofessional public, the company received greater awareness after its success in the competition through the media.
"Not only did our customers start to perceive the Farmet brand significantly better, but also foreign partners began to appreciate that they were working with a company that achieved greater success in their country," says Karel Žďárský.
Last year, however, was not only in Farmet in the sign of euphoria of victory.
The valuation was based on the company's economic results up to 2008 and only partially from 2009.
And it was 2009 that was the toughest year for the sale of engineering goods.
The crisis was culminating, which had not yet affected citizens so much, but companies were already stopping their investment projects and began to restrict purchases of new machinery and technology.
"Of course, this situation has not been avoided even by us."
"Sales fell by 40 percent, we had to cut production and there were also layoffs," explains Karel Žďárský.
A viable company must be able to take such unpopular measures from time to time.
But they managed the situation and kept the company profitable, though smaller than before the crisis.
What they have not made a promise of in Farmet, however, is investment in research and development.
"From the subsidies we built a research and training centre, we strengthened the presentation at international trade fairs, we won the main award in domestic exhibitions," says Žďárský.
All indications are that the crisis is behind them.
Sales are growing again and with them the number of new employees.
"I wish the new winner a pleasant feeling of victory, but in a calmer atmosphere," says Karel Žďárský.
A poll that removes meaningless regulations
The Absurdity of the Year poll is part of the business race for the fourth time.
Some nonsensical regulations have already been repealed.
The infamous winner of the next year's Absurdity of the Year survey was the obligation to carry documents to the office, which are also accessible to officials online.
More than a third of the nearly 4,000 voters voted.
For example, the Social Security Administration required a paper extract from the Commercial Register, although an official can obtain it with two clicks of a mouse.
The poll will change that.
"The Czech Social Security Administration will no longer require an extract from the Commercial Register during inspections with insurance payers," said Jana Buraňová, a spokeswoman for the ČSSZ.
To shine a light on all the regulations and regulations that companies and entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic have to comply with, and to cancel the nonsensical ones, is the purpose of the Absurdity of the Year competition.
This is the fourth time this year that it has been part of a business competition organized by the Economic Newspaper and is becoming increasingly popular among the public.
If about 3,000 voters took part in the vote last year, this year there were nearly 4,000.
And it's no wonder, there are still enough legal obligations that serve only to delay business.
"For example, in the number of tax return papers, we are at the top of the world," says Karel Havlíček from the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Sole Traders of the Czech Republic.
Simplifying business has become a stated goal of all governments in recent years.
Compared to the world, however, the situation in the Czech Republic is not improving much.
According to the World Bank, the Czech Republic ranked 74th in terms of business conditions, which is eight places worse than last year.
The Absurdity of the Year competition was first announced in 2006 and is held annually under the same scenario.
Anyone can sign up for administrative and bureaucratic nonsense every year from April to the end of September, when the competition deadline is.
The web address www.firmaroku.cz Then the organizer of the competition selects seven candidates for the "anti-price" and lets the public vote on it via the Internet on the www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz.
The absurdity that gets the most votes wins.
More than 100, 105 regulations and regulations lacking meaning, were entered in this year's survey.
Tips were sent by entrepreneurs, as well as professional associations and journalists.
Among the "finalists" of the competition was the requirement, for example, that cars for the maintenance of motorways and expressways pay tolls, or that entrepreneurs with twenty employees, two offices and two toilets paint every two years.
A list of this year's seven designs is published on the competition website.
The announcement of the competition, which always takes place at the beginning of November on Wenceslas Square in Prague, is part of hapenning, which is regularly attended by personalities of political and social life.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodová, director of the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Sole Traders of the Czech Republic, or Petr Kužel, President of the Czech Chamber of Commerce, assisted at this culmination of the competition.
"Economic prosperity cannot work where the state throws the ball over the bus, so my goal is to abolish at least three dozen paragraphs every year that are now only unnecessarily complicated by business," said Minister of Industry and Trade Martin Kocourek.
Trying to repeal meaningless regulations does not sound hollow.
In 2007, people were most concerned about the obligation of the entrepreneur to report three days in advance to the trade office in the place where the permanent establishment is located, the intention to go with the booth to an exhibition or fair.
This obligation was removed by an amendment to the Trade Licensing Act.
The second most voted duty in 2007, which was to report a business trip of up to 30 days to the Labour Office for its foreign employee, was removed by the So-called Green Card Act.
And for the third time, all good things.
The absurdity of 2009 was the ordinance for physiotherapists to have a large mirror, refrigerator and two thype scales in the office.
This was mitigated this year by decree of the Ministry of Health - the obligation to have a refrigerator has fallen away.
The new category appreciates socially responsible companies
Environmental, humanitarian, educational or sporting projects are evaluated.
A novelty in this year's fifth year of competitions of the Economic Newspaper is a category called Responsible Company of the Year 2010.
The mission of this competition is to promote a reasonable and fair business.
"In this way, we want to support companies that take into account the environmental impacts of their business and support socially responsible activities," says Patrik Bartholdy, regional manager of the mobile operator Vodafone, which is the announcer and guarantor of the competition as well as in the case of the rebel of the year competition.
This year's first year of this special subcategory of the main Vodafone Company of the Year 2010 competition was entered by companies for whom success in business is not the only long-term goal.
The story of each of them is very inspiring and would be published on a separate article.
Although the subject matter of their activities is diametrically opposed to each other, support and consideration can be considered as common denominators of their efforts.
In one case, it concerns, for example, disabled people, and elsewhere, for example, personal problems or the health of its own employees.
Among the 14 nationwide finalists was the Prague software company Et Netera, which supports the creation of informal sports teams among employees who then participate in a number of tournaments in various sports.
Another example of a responsible company from the Pardubice Region is Isolit-Bravo, which has been a major contributor to a foundation sponsoring handicapped children for 17 years.
Its disabled employees are cared for by a paper mill from Poděbrady, which has more than 70 percent of them, and therefore it has been awarded the title of Responsible Company of the Central Bohemian Region and ranked third in the Vodafone Company of the Year competition in the region.
MiRyz Soft, an accounting firm that introduced flexible working hours, won in Olomouc, reduced to an average of 35 hours per week, but without a proportionally reduced salary.
The jury also awarded her the title for giving priority to purchases from Czech manufacturers, supporting civic activities in the vicinity and saving the environment.
"We try to recycle as much as possible so that our business and our administration have the least impact on the environment," explains Managing Director Miluše Ryznarová.
The responsible IT company Enlogit from the Ústí Region, in turn, thinks about the health of its employees and has acquired ergonomic chairs and keyboards for each laptop, supports their work from home and uses catering services provided by a local sheltered workshop at its corporate events.
"In addition, we support the People in Need Foundation, which specifically helps the local Roma community," says ondřej Suchý, a representative of the company.
Last but not least, it is also worth mentioning the activity of the company Washing and Cleaning from the Karlovy Vary Region, which contributes to their employees in the form of above-standard bonuses to their supplementary pension insurance.
"In our country, we give contributions for food, transport, upskilling and recreation," says Josef Strapáč from the Bruntal construction company Czasch, winner in the Moravian-Silesian Region.
All regional finalists of the Vodafone Company of the Year competition were automatically entered into the Responsible Company of the Year category and answered the questions of the questionnaire attached to the application and sent it to the organizer no later than 15 August.
Incorrectly completed or incomplete questionnaire replies were then excluded from the evaluation by the organizer.
"If the representatives of the competing company did not answer the questions, they could not participate in the Responsible Company of the Year competition, but they are not disqualified from the "main" Vodafone Company of the Year competition."
"Self-registration is not possible only for this competition, as it is a subcategory of the main company of the year competition," explains Karel Goldman from bison &rose.
At the Land Fund in Pilsen, the police made arrests during a public tender
In recent days, anti-corruption police have been arresting in the Land Fund building in Pilsen.
The detectives handcuffed a local media entrepreneur and real estate trader, Luboš G.
He allegedly tried to manipulate the ongoing tender to settle restitution claims so that the land offered in the competition would win specific bidders.
He was to pay Luboš G. half a million crowns for it.
"For the time being, I can only confirm that the police are prosecuting one person for the offence of plots in a public contract and a public tender," Antonia Green, head of the Pilsen public prosecutor's office, told Pravo, noting that further details could not be provided in light of the ongoing investigation.
The 46-year-old businessman was released by police after 24 hours.
Given the minimum of official information, one can only speculate on how he might have influenced the tender.
When asked by Law, a spokeswoman for the Land Fund Lubomíra Černá stated that police officers were actually arrested at a separated workplace in Pilsen during a public tender.
"It was a client, not our employee," she said.
According to Black, the tender is entitled 'Call for tenders for land transfer claims under the Land Act' and takes place when more eligible applicants show interest in the land offered.
'These persons shall, as part of the call, offer a higher value of their restitution claims to be settled by transfer than the declared value of the land.'
"According to the claims offered, the order of the acquirers is determined and the Land Fund then transfers the land to the person who offered the highest claims," explained a spokeswoman for the fund.
Luboš G. probably had information about who entered the call, and since he himself is also a beneficiary, having purchased a number of restitution claims, he offered to the land interested party not to participate in the competition.
Apparently, he collected severance pay for that.
That would explain why he had such a large sum of money when he was detained.
Luboš G. had above-standard contacts at PF in Pilsen in the past.
He was involved in the case of former PF boss Václav Sanbot, who was prosecuted for issuing land in replacement restitution on which a decision on the location of the building had already been issued.
It was then that Luboš G. acquired from the fund, for example, land intended for the construction of public roads, specifically in the place where the access road to the Borská pole industrial zone was to be built.
Later, he exchanged them very conveniently with the municipality for a house in the very historical center of the city, which was worth much higher.
At that time, the town hall had to accept this, because otherwise it would have endangered the construction by blocking the land.
Households pay hundreds a month for housing
From January, households will have to pay extra not only for all kinds of energy, but also for water and sewerage, heat supplies and rents will rise somewhere.
From January, families will have to take up to hundreds of crowns a month more from their wallets than they do now.
Electricity will increase by up to 4.6 percent, gas will be about 2 percent more expensive, up to a tenth more in some cities you will have to pay extra for water supplies, and often it will also undercut the supply of central heat.
The increase in electricity prices should cost households in apartments 100 crowns more expensive per year than they do now.
At the same time, all major suppliers have reduced the prices of power electricity, so a significant increase in support for the production of energy from renewable sources, especially photovoltaics, is to blame.
Gas will increase slightly, but at a time when people are drowning the most and thus have the highest consumption.
Therefore, they must also count on hundreds of crowns extra per year.
While electricity and gas become more expensive across the country, changes in central heating prices vary from place to place.
The increase in prices is mainly planned by larger municipalities.
For example, households in Pardubice or Hradec Králové will pay about CZK 50 extra per month for central heating from January, while families in Liberec will pay more than CZK 1000 per year.
Prague residents are at risk of getting more than 9 percent more expensive water and sewerage if the city increases infrastructure rents.
If the rent doesn't change, roasted 6.8 percent will pay.
However, the price in Prague will still be among the lower in the nationwide comparison.
In the north of Bohemia, where prices are already among the highest, water and sewerage are to undercut by 7.4 percent.
For example, rent prices in 450,000 rental apartments, where regulation ends in January, may rise significantly.
For example, CPI Byty, which owns about 2,500 apartments in Usti nad Labem, intends to increase rents by up to 100% from January.
Those who do not agree to the new rent amount are going to take the company to court.
Regulated rents paid by people in about 300,000 apartments could rise by as much as 10 percent next year.
Czech children are drunk on fernet and rum. Beer is out of fashion, it works slowly
Fernet, rum, vodka, exceptionally a better brand of whiskey stolen from parents.
These are drinks, after which drinking most often ends in the care of doctors drunks who are not yet fifteen years old.
An exception are not children who are treated repeatedly in the hospital from the monkey.
This is based on the experience of doctors who encounter similar cases on the incomes of children's hospital wards.
"Some beers or wines are completely un fashionable because it takes a long time to get drunk with them."
"The trend is definitely hard alcohol," Luděk Pelikán, head of the children's department at Hořovice Hospital in Central Bohemia, told Pravo.
"If they manage to pull a bottle out of daddy's closet, it's whiskey, but fernet and vodka prevail."
"Vodka has the advantage of pouring it into their juice and it doesn't smell that much," said the chief medical director.
Eva Jurinová, spokesperson for motol University Hospital, also gives him the truth.
"Most often it's fernet or rum."
"This is modern alcohol today, especially in elementary schools."
"In some cases, it was slivovite that they brought home," Jurin said.
According to The Pelican Chief, 13 or 14-year-old drinkers are a fairly common phenomenon in hospital admissions.
Before Hořovice, where he has been working since this year, he worked for ten years in pediatrics in Motol, where ambulances bring under-embracing schoolchildren from a wide area.
"There was a girl lying with us about four times."
"She started her career at the age of 12, when she was brought to us with 3.5 extra blood alcohol in combination with ecstasy," the doctor described a particularly serious case.
"She was at the exhibition center in Holešovice for some dance party."
"Interestingly, her mother didn't find it strange that she didn't know about her daughter for 48 hours," said the chief.
It is the lack of interest of parents, or even their considerable tolerance to drinking their own offspring, that is considered the main cause of growing child drinking.
However, addiction in the true sense of the word cannot be talked about in children, according to experts.
"The term alcoholic means several years of chronic alcohol addiction with all the phenomena that belong to it, and this is not the case in children."
"For those who use alcohol repeatedly, it tends to be more likely to be a bad family-social background," explained Chief Pelican.
According to jurinová' spokeswoman, about forty drunk children were hospitalized this year at the pediatric clinic in Motol.
However, only those with severe intoxication who had to stay in the hospital will get into the statistics.
Child drunks who take their parents away after outpatient treatment or are brought home by the police do not count.
Except when children just sit down after school and drink a bottle of licht, according to Pelican, there are three seasonal fluctuations that can be relied upon: witch, New Year's Eve and the end of the school year.
"They either drink the grief of a bad report card or, on the contrary, celebrate the beginning of the holidays."
"But I've seen seven child drunks on the witch's line at the same time," pelican said.
A drunk who spends the night detoxing under the supervision of doctors is paradoxically at an advantage over one who suffers an unpleasant hangover the next day at home.
Morning headaches caused by dehydration and lack of glucose will drive away the water infusions with glucose and nutrients that the organism lacks.
"They're actually better off because they have a good wake-up call after that beautiful evening experience and nothing hurts them."
"They're just confused about where they are," pelican admitted, adding that sometimes they spoil patients' pleasant moods by at least listing the costs of their treatment.
Transport by ambulance and hospitalization in an acute bed will cost tens of thousands of crowns.
"Sometimes I used it as a means of education, calculating directly to the children how much their drunkenness cost and that they could also spend the whole summer on a part-time job to earn money for that one party," Pelican added.
But health insurance companies, he says, do not take regression procedures to exord on parents for treatment costs in cases of child drunks.
Two L-159s are in foreign hands for the first time in Spain
Two L-159s out of a total of five, for which the Czech Ministry of Defence replaced the Casa C-295M transport aircraft, flew to Seville, Spain, on Tuesday, where the aircraft manufacturer Casa - EADS is based.
This is the first time that machines of this type have appeared in the possession of someone other than the Czech army.
So far, they have only been abroad for exercises or demonstration years.
These are two-seat versions of the L-159T1, which were previously operated by the Czech army and which were airworthy.
The remaining three machines are single-seat L-159s.
So far, they are preserved in Aer Vodochody and the broker of the deal - Omnipol - took them over last week.
According to Jan Pejšek from the Defence Press Office, it is not yet known when the aircraft will physically take off from Vodochod.
"L-159 single-seat aircraft for shifting have been earmarked from long-term stored aircraft, without further deposits and investments by the Ministry Department."
"The two-seat L-159T1 was exchanged in its current state and form," Pejšek told Pravo.
He added that the army would not be left without two-seater aircraft, since in May 2009 the Ministry signed a contract with Aer Vodochody worth CZK 200 million to convert four unnecessary L-159s into two two-seaters.
One new aircraft was taken over by the army in July, the other will be taken over by the end of this year.
According to Pejšek, EADS has committed to armaments of some alliance countries.
"The contract clearly states that eads is a customer of L-159s and will be used to train pilots from NATO countries."
"It is therefore up to the customer how he will implement this matter," said Pejšek.
An economic newspaper reported some time ago that the Spanish army, for example, was not interested in the L-159.
The exchange of five L-159s for one Casa aircraft and the purchase of three more aircraft for CZK 3.5 billion was approved last year by the government of Mirek Topolánek.
The Ministry of Defence did not issue a tender for the purchase and addressed eads directly.
Defense officials at the time argued that the exchange would support future exports of the L-159 abroad.
The Czech Army bought 72 machines from Aer and uses only 24, the rest of which it would like to sell.
The purchase of Casa planes is likely to have a legal backing.
The European Commission sued the Czech Ministry of Defence in a European court because it should have selected the aircraft on the basis of a Pan-European tender and not by addressing one manufacturer.
The army has already taken over three Casa aircraft, the last of which is expected to arrive at Prague's Kbely Airport within a fortnight.
Longer index finger than ring finger signs lower risk of cancer
Men who have an index finger longer than their ring finger are at less risk of getting prostate cancer.
This is the surprising conclusion of a study published on Wednesday by the British Journal of Cancer.
It may be related to the level of the male hormone testosterone.
"Our results show that relative finger length can serve as a simple test for prostate cancer risk, especially for men under 60," said study co-author Ros Eeles, a professor at the Institute for Cancer Research at the University of Warwick.
The finger could help determine which men should undergo a prostate cancer test, especially when combined with genetic risk or other threatening factors such as family health burdens, Eeles added.
Between 1994 and 2009, she and her colleagues in Britain followed more than 1,500 prostate cancer patients and more than 3,000 healthy men in parallel.
More than half of the study participants had an index finger shorter than the ring finger on their right hand.
They were as likely to have prostate cancer as 19 percent of those whose fingers were the same length.
However, for those who had an index finger longer than their ring finger, this risk decreased by 33 percent, and for men under 60, the decrease was even 87 percent.
The ratio of the length of the two fingers mentioned - formed in the prenatal period - seems to reflect the different levels of sex hormones to which the baby is exposed in the womb.
Less testosterone corresponds to a longer index finger.
Previous research has shown that testosterone promotes growing prostate cancer.
The leading Czech geneticist and former Chairman of the Academy of Sciences, Professor Václav Pačes, told ČTK that he was briefly known about this study, but he did not think that the relationship between finger length and cancer was "fully proven".
The Czech Republic is under snow, D1 and D5 are closed
The Czech Republic, like most of Europe, is covered with snow on Thursday morning.
On roads and sidewalks lies mostly snow, road users in many places drove all night.
The D5 motorway between the 89th and 93rd kilometers in the direction of Rozvadov is closed in the morning due to several accidents of trucks and passenger cars, and there is also a D1 near Brno in the direction of Prague.
The dispatcher of the Central Automotoklub (ÚAMK) told the news.
A truck crashed there on the 91st kilometer, two trucks collided on the 93rd kilometer, the accident resulted in injuries.
Several cars also ended up in the ditch.
There are also problems on the D1 motorway on the 185th kilometer in the direction of Prague.
Two trucks collided there.
Drivers should go just after Brno at the 190th kilometer or drive through Brno and then drive on the 182nd kilometer at Kývalce.
There are several kilometers of columns forming there.
There is also an accident on the D11 motorway, right at the arrival in Prague.
In Prague lies a layer of snow of several centimeters, thermometers show minus seven degrees Celsius.
Motorcades are formed, for example, on Prosek, and Štěrboholská is also clogged.
The surest means of transport is the metro.
Trams run with delays, for example, on the line between Charles Square and Peace Square.
The Prague Crisis Staff is due to meet again at 8 a.m.
Railways and airports are also facing problems.
Czech Railways has already had to cancel seven express services due to snow.
For example, the line from Prague to Kralupy or from Prague to Beroun has problems.
Passengers should check the current situation.
Ruzyně Airport was closed from 11am on Wednesday until 5am.
Most roads in South Moravia are already passable, but only with caution.
In the Vyškov region there are impassable three secondary roads, in Brno snow tongues are formed in places, and in Blanensko snow chains are necessary to overcome some roads in higher places.
One of the most affected places was Vyškovsko.
There are still closed roads: Rousínov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Kučerov and also Šaratice - Milešovice.
You will need to put cutters on them.
It is not yet possible to estimate when they will be made clear.
In the Hodonín region, caution is required in the Area of the White Carpathians.
There is a layer of snow up to five centimeters on the roads, which are maintained there only by inert sprinkles for nature conservation, ČTK said.
In the Czech Republic, between two and ten centimeters of snow fell, the most falling in northern Bohemia, often up to 18 centimeters.
About 15 centimeters of snow fell in the Moravian-Silesian Region.
Snowfall in the Czech Republic is gradually coming to an ante.
U.S. soldiers have a new "smart weapon"
The U.S. military has deployed a new "smart" weapon in Afghanistan, known only as the XM-25 codenamed.
The generals hope that the new automatic rifle will affect the conflict with the Taliban there and "change the game" in their favor.
The new weapon is like a small super-accurate gun.
Its projectiles are laser-based with a precision of several meters.
Special 25 mm rounds, developed for this rifle and containing high explosive explosive, effectively act as small shells.
The hubs can be programmed to explode not only when hitting a target, but at any point in their ballistic trajectory.
So they can be used against an enemy hiding behind an obstacle, behind a wall or in a trench.
It is not usually protected from above, and when a deadly rain of steel shrapnel falls on it, it can knock it out of battle.
According to Richard Audett, who was involved in the development of the XM-25, the new rifle is the first infantry weapon to use "smart" technology.
"Basically, a soldier treats it by finding a target, sending a laser beam to determine the distance, thus getting a specified intentional point, adjusting the elm according to it, and pulling the trigger."
"Let's say you've measured 543 meters."
"When you pull the trigger, the gun is reloaded and fires the missile at a distance of 543 meters plus or minus one, two, or three meters," Audette said.
400 jobs will be relocated
The Fujitsu Group will move its branch from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
400 employees will move their jobs in July next year from the existing administrative building to Marienbader-square in Bad Homburg to Astro Park.
The Japanese concern Fujitsu will move its branch from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As the industry giant, which specializes in computers and computer maintenance, announced on Wednesday, 400 men and women will move their jobs in July next year from the existing office building on Marienbader-square in Bad Homburg to Astro Park, a large administrative complex on Lyon Street, in a part of Frankfurt called Niederrad.
Another 100 of the group's jobs, which are currently divided in the region, are expected to move there in the foreseeable future, according to a Fujist spokesperson.
The offer of rent was said to be very attractive, and the large-space offices in Astro Park are said to be more suited to the working way of employees.
Also in Bad Homburg, Fujitsu was only renting.
Competent managing director Bernd Wagner said, "in Frankfurt-Niederrad we found a central residence with excellent infrastructure".
Excellent connection to the airport is very important for a global company like Fujitsu.
The recent move of an important enterprise within the region yesterday caused joy among the winners and disappointment among the losers.
Markus Frank(CDU), chief economic officer in Frankfurt, said this had succeeded in winning over a "global player."
He said it was "a fantastic vote of confidence in the location."
Fujitsu is said to be a good fit for the city, edification is an important impulse for Niederrad.
The mayor of Bad Homburg, Michael Korwisi (Greens), regretted Fujitsu's decision.
The city was informed in time by the company's management of his intention.
"Of course we offered our help to the company," Korwisi said.
However, friendly contacts could not change the computer manufacturer's difficulties with the landlord of the marienbader-square property.
As a result, economic reasons were decisive.
Now it is about avoiding long non-occupant in such a prominent place.
"I hope the owner and landlord of the building will be cooperative."
The house on Rathaus-náměstí, which until now was used by Fujitsu, and the neighbouring "Kleine Vertikale" ten years ago, together with other buildings on Marienbader-náměstí, were among the most discussed building plans of the spa town.
Between the station and the town hall, a joint project between the city and a private designer of the so-called city entree was created, which was criticized both for the massive development of areas that previously served as a parking lot and also because of the height of the buildings.
In 2001, feri, a manufacturer of software for travel distribution systems, moved into the houses, as did computer manufacturer Fujitsu, which was still associated with Siemens at the time.
The buildings used by Fujitsu were jointly acquired in 2006 by frankfurter Deutsche Immobilien-Chancen-Group and Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund, and after a year they were sold to Spain's Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid.
The Tokyo-based Fujitsu-group describes itself as the third largest IT provider in the world.
For example, it offers computers and servers available to companies and also takes care of the necessary service.
The Rhine and Mohan branch is one of the largest in Germany, but most of Fujitsu's employees are in Munich.
A subsidiary of Fujitsu Technology Solutions is moving from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt-Niederrad, while Fujitsu Services and A TDS will be other subsidiaries in the location.
7000 square meters have been leased in the Astro Park administration building for this purpose.
In the complex - its name draws attention to the star plan, which is twenty years old, is also located by the central association of electrical and electronic industry.
Amazon shuts down server - threats against Assange
Wikileaks is in a tight spot.
Amazon's Internet service has turned off the detection platform on its servers.
It is possible that this was the result of political pressure following the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic dispatches.
Wikileaks founder Assange is reportedly staying in the UK.
Wikileaks, a detection platform, is coming under increasing pressure in the United States.
Internet activists have lost access to their previous home server in America and are now looking for an Internet home in Europe.
Meanwhile, prominent US Senator Joe Lieberman called on other countries and businesses to boycott Wikileaks.
And Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, who is listed on Interpol's wanted list, is to stay, according to a newspaper post in the UK.
"Wikileaks is no longer on amazon."
"Free speech in the land of the free," activists posted on Twitter on Wednesday (local time).
Shortly before that, the Internet company Amazon downloaded Wikileaks documents from its servers.
Internet activists used amazon web service (AWS) to publish secret diplomatic dispatches to handle the high number of accesses to documents.
Using Twitter, Wikileaks explained the move: "Fine - we will now spend our dollars by employing people in Europe."
When Amazon has such problems with freedom of expression, "then they should stop selling books."
Amazon stopped using its wikileaks servers after a reported investigation by Senator Joe Lieberman's associates, CNN reported, 911, based on lieberman's office.
The chairman of the Senate Home Defense Committee has threatened to boycott Amazon, the British Guardian reported.
"I would have liked Amazon to have taken this step sooner, given the earlier disclosures of classified information to Wikileaks," the senator said.
Lieberman, meanwhile, called for the platform to be prevented from using servers in other countries as well.
"Wikileaks is acting illegally, blatantly and recklessly, putting our national security at risk and endangering life across the globe," the nonpartially senator said in a statement.
"No responsible company - either American or foreign - should assist Wikileaks in their efforts to disseminate stolen material."
Wikileaks founder Assange, wanted by Swedish authorities on suspicion of rape, is on Interpol's wanted list.
According to a report in The Independent, a 39-year-old Australian man is in the UK, and Scotland Yard is said to know the exact location.
The internet activist has always called the investigation in Sweden the intrigue of his opponents.
Wikileaks spokesman Kristinn Hrafnsson in London said there had also been threats.
"There were even calls to assassinate Julian Assange."
That's why Assange is rightly worried about his safety, Hrafnsson said.
That's why the Wikileaks founder will continue to hide.
Hrafnsson seemed to be responding to statements from North America.
In America, the former Republican governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, demanded that the person responsible for wikileaks disclosures be indicted and executed for treason.
In Canada, one adviser to the head of government, Stephen Harper, said on television - ironically, Assange should be "murdered" and Obama could use a "target aircraft."
Meanwhile, a verbal firefight broke out between the White House and Assange.
US President Barack Obama's spokesman, Robert Gibbs, called it "ridiculous and absurd" that Assange demanded the resignation of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton if she was responsible for recently published spying calls to diplomats.
"I'm not entirely sure why we're interested in the opinion of one person with a website," Gibbs said.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are far more important than its website."
The U.S. government is now extensively investigating the security of its data.
Russell Travers, deputy director of the Center for Counterterrorism, was appointed special counsel, the White House said.
Travers became responsible for developing the "necessary structural reforms" needed after wikileaks published the embassy reports.
The White House also wants to review ways in which the entire government exchanges and protects information.
The US government has also announced that it wants to take care of the security of dissidents and activists if they are to be put in danger because of wikileaks disclosures.
"We have done everything we can to get in touch with them," state department spokesman Philip Crowley said.
"We're ready to protect them if necessary."
Ice Cream University
At "Gelato University" near Bologna, ice cream confectioners are preparing for a better season.
There is a lot of interest in the basic course for future ice cream makers, which lasts three days, and visitors come from all over the world.
Where does this ice cream come from, exactly?
Gelatiere and Gelataio.
Gelatiere, a slightly outdated ice cream maker in Czech, makes cream according to all the rules of Italian ice cream art.
Gelataio takes the ice cream out of the cooler with a s swab, wipes it in a wafer and sells it.
To find out, you don't have to go to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But those who want to know even more about ice cream will not avoid the "Gelato-University" of the Italian company Carpigiani.
In 2003, the ice cream machine manufacturer set up an ice cream university so that ice cream from its machines would fit high Italian ideals everywhere.
There is huge interest in the basic course for the future Gelatieri, which lasts three days, and visitors come from all over the world.
However, there are also several days of special courses on chocolate ice cream and a practice in your own ice cream shop.
Some yearn for a new career in their Midlife-Crisis, others venture to the thin ice of their unclear desires.
This time it is 40 participants from 19 countries of all continents - from Brazil to Hungary to Saudi Arabia.
Jacky, an art teacher from California, loves slow-food movement and would like to offer a quality European product in the country of industrial Ice-Cream in the future.
Anke, from Berlin, is a business consultant and would like to start something of her own after years of stressful work.
Two young Egyptian women dream of opening an ice cream parery in Kair.
One man from Malta and one from Brazil want to improve the quality of ice cream in their bars - and Canadian housewife Julia has arrived because her children love Italian ice cream.
Maestro-Gelatiere Luciano Ferrari first explains to the participants the ideal characteristics of perfect ice cream.
Decisive is not only good taste, but also silky softness and good consistency.
Luciano will not forget the Southern and patriotic icing on the cake during his training: "Italian Gelato is simply the best - and then there is a great dose of romance."
The first step of production seems quite simple.
Luciano puts the essential ingredients milk, whipped cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilizers in a large blender, which heats everything up to 85 degrees with an electronic program and then cools immediately to four degrees.
Then he turns the tap on the machine and a pasteurized white base cream flows out, the basis of all kinds of milk ice creams.
Immediately, the associate professor is filled with questions: Is it possible to make ice cream only from natural substances without a stabilizer?
How can a man experiment on his own?
Luciano warns against getting carried away by the spirit of the times into the unknown.
Those who talk about ice cream "only from natural ingredients" probably used stabilizers anyway - mostly a natural product, such as guar grain guar flour.
Of course, it is possible to make ice cream even without stabilizers, but it must be sold within a day, otherwise it will collide and the customer eats all the ice grains.
Certain variations of the base mass are allowed.
It will be more exciting with aromatic essences.
Maestro Luciano distinguishes the taste of ice cream by ingredients that are bought in the supermarket either in the fruit department or in the sweets department.
In addition, there are pills and creams.
"Suppliers will try to impose a lot of aromatized ingredients on you."
"But you should simply experiment."
Be with fruit sorbets with sugar and fresh fruit.
Or with white base ice cream, which turns eggs into yellow cream and cocoa as the basis for all sorts of chocolate temptations.
Now participants are allowed to take a course on ice cream machines.
Luciano has them made four different types of vanilla, chocolate, coffee and hazelnut ice cream - either with or without eggs in the base mass, with more or less vanilla aroma or other natural ingredients.
The same experiment will be carried out with fruit types of ice cream.
More aromatic substances, more fruit puree - due to the taste it is not always better.
Hazelnut ice cream may not taste more nutty when it contains more hazelnuts.
The most popular kiwi ice cream will be made by a group that uses more fruit, less water and a little less stabilizer.
Only when the balanced mixture correctly highlights the taste of Gelato, says Luciano.
Making ice cream is a purely numerical task: If a peach puree with a lot of sugar is used, the proportion of sugar in the basic recipe must be reduced.
Lemon ice cream requires an extra portion of sugar.
Luciano removes the apparatus by which it determines the sugar content of the fruit (the winemakers thus measure the must from the grapes).
Fortunately, the tables make the numbers easier.
Making ice cream no longer requires as much physical exert effort as before.
It is not only the automatic mass production device that is helping.
There is also a device that simultaneously stirs the finished ice cream mixture into the cream and cools to minus the temperature.
Despite all the automation, we can't avoid small accidents.
Brazilian Gustavo smears himself and his colleagues from top to bottom with fruit puree when a giant blender gets out of control.
"In every course," says Maestro Luciano, "it's only a matter of time before something like this happens."
Inspectors in two light
The European Food Authority Efsa is linked to an industry experimenting with genetic plants.
This accusation has now been made by a group of Testbiotech experts, which is considered an independent institute for estimating the consequences of biotechnology.
"It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we have documented it well," Testbiotech chief Christoph Then said in Munich on Wednesday.
The head of efsa's expert group on gentically altered plants, Harry Kuiper, and another Efsa expert have been under contract with the Ilsi Lobbying Association for several years.
It is funded by groups such as Monsanto, Nestle and Bayer.
Kuiper played a decisive role in Efsa's control regulations for genetic plants, and thus faces a clear conflict of interest, criticizes Then.
Efsa's regulations are said to be in line with the Ilsi documents throughout the paragraphs, bearing the manuscript of an industry that should be controlled by the Office in Parma, Italy.
This is the second time Testbiotech has highlighted a conflict of interest.
Recently, a senior manager moved from Efsa without additions or a transitional period to the Swiss agrarian concern Syngenta - and thus changed sides.
The Central Germany Radio (MDR) also recently revealed the EU-Control Authority's personal links with the industry lobby, which has piqued the interest of both the Ministry of the Environment and EU MPs.
Meanwhile, Efsa cannot identify a conflict of interest.
It works with all serious data, i.e. also those from industry, if they are of high professional quality, it is stated in one statement.
Experts working for Efsa are not required to have contacts with industry.
But he has to prove it.
Kuiper admits his work for the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the US.
It describes itself as a neutral forum for science, industry and policy experts - among other things, to estimate the risk of biotechnology without a lobbyist's contract.
Independent experts such as Then criticise the fact that gentically altered plants are currently allowed in animals without any feeding attempt, and that the reaction of genetic plants to environmental influences is not tested.
"We want to know what, for example, a gentically altered corn in a field will do," says Then.
Current practice is only to test isolated proteins and not the entire genetic plant, which will not show reliable results.
"If they are not looking for risks, how can they be found?", asks Then.
Angelika Hilbeck agrees.
The researcher has been researching gentechnics since 1994 and currently works at the Technical University of Zurich.
In this area, industry, as in the US, is now increasingly trying to influence or discredit critical scientists in Europe.
Therefore, there are hardly any scientists who are no longer connected to the groups.
Most studies that are critical to companies are not published.
"Industry controls security research," hilbeck believes.
Stone footprint
Uli Gsell also bought some, a total of about 400 kilograms.
On Monday night, he was standing in front of Stuttgart station, a tube on his back.
There was a demonstration.
snowed.
The story is known: In September, excavators arrived and began tearing down a large piece of the north wing.
The world in Stuttgart was no longer the same: Thousands demonstrated against the S21, a billion-dollar reduction in the railway station.
When the construction was stopped, most of the wing lay in ruins.
Broken into 6,000, 7,000 pieces.
Limestone from Crailsheim, a soft coarse stone that was used in 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a sculptor in Ostfildern, 43 years old.
He's secured a few of these pieces.
"These stones are relics."
"He mustn't disappear."
It melts away: "Cheap and poor stone, simple and original."
When he cut one open, he smelled of cigarette smoke.
He doesn't know what he's going to do with the pieces yet.
The stones have time.
So is Uli Gsell.
A trail of stones from Stuttgart leads to the forest near Tübingen on the former depot of the French Army's ammunition, where Manuel Rongen built his stone empire.
A 44-year-old man trades in old stones.
He bought all those that were created during the demolition in Stuttgart.
"It would be a shame if they were ground to gravel or disappeared into depot," he says in his office, a wooden box that was formerly a guard house.
He says he was called names and threatened when all the papers said in September that he had bought the remains of the north wing from a company that is carrying out the demolition.
But he talked to S-21 opponents for days.
And he explained to them that he wasn't responsible for the demolition at all.
And when that happens, then it's most sensual for the stones to be used anymore.
Then about 200 S-21-opponents took each of about 80 kilograms of heavy block, price per piece 6.50 to 14 euros.
As a memory, some also in the hope of returning it during re-construction.
Rongen bought 500 tons, a load of 25 large trucks.
About half of them are still in the woods, the rest sold a long time ago.
Gardeners, landscape gardeners, house builders.
They came from all corners and towed what fit in the trunk and the trailer.
The stones of the Stuttgart dispute have long since been transformed into "blocks" or as the edges of herb flowerbeds.
"This stone is actually nothing special," says Rongen.
"If it weren't for the political nipple."
He's got in his 4WD and goes for a ride in his 20-hectare kingdom.
He studied law first, interrupted his studies, later biology, then became interested in computers, and eventually became a stone trader.
And a stone lover.
It has 40,000 tons of stones stored.
He's bringing his treasures from all over Germany.
He says he's the biggest old stone dealer in the country.
Inhibit.
In the snow lies artfully worked sandstone.
"They once belonged to the Marien-bridge in Dresden," he says.
The sandstone of the Elbe, yellow, warm, is enthusiastic.
"My favorite stone."
We're going on our way up through the woods.
It points to a pile: red sandstone, formerly part of karlsruhe station.
And on.
"Nice travertine."
Once, those blocks belonged to the neckarstadion grandstand in Stuttgart.
Everywhere in the snow lie stones and stories, Cannstatt-travertine from the Stuttgart Police Presidium, red granite from the Temple of Sankt Blasien, tuf from the hospital in Heilbronn.
What work, what effort, what sweat.
When Rongen thinks about how stones used to be broken by hand and transported using simple hoists and bull carts, he becomes completely respectful.
"It would be a scandal if something like this were crushed."
He didn't become rich, not very rich at all.
Today, however, the stone merchant employs 14 people, and in addition, stonemasons, one sculptor, one blacksmith, one glassmaker and one gardener have settled up in the forest.
"We work hard, but it's satisfying," says the leftovers.
He has to go to Cologne soon.
That's where the stones will be saved.
Talent fight for High-potentials
There's a lot of people at the snack bar.
16 students push for salmon sandwiches, tomato soup and sweets.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and car manufacturer Volkswagen invited engineering and design students to a workshop.
Together with the developers of VW, they are here to talk about the car of the future - and just by the way, get to know Volkswagen.
Many companies are trying to succeed in the race for the smartest heads, as is VW, and are betting on cooperation with universities.
Their mission is: Recruit the most gifted graduates in the after-hours as soon as possible, before they reach the labour market and are of interest to others.
Since universities do not publish any success lists for their students, companies are trying to discover and acquire exceptional talents in practice-oriented projects.
At TU Braunschweig, the automotive concern tries to acquire talent the next day.
A young lady from the personal ward handing out pens, gummy teddy bear and VW logo boards.
He tells promising young talent about practice programs, student jobs, and tells them how to go to the group.
Nico Selle from TU Braunschweig is in charge of the project together with VW.
He sees advantages for both sides: "Students get in touch with industry and gain experience."
"At the same time, VW can get to know students, get to know interesting candidates, and think about who would be useful as a coworker."
Such cooperation, according to Selle, is not uncommon.
But the novelty is that there is such an open fight for students.
"Otherwise, it was more of a major professional project," says Selle.
The fight for fresh graduates is likely to get even tougher.
In many sectors, companies can no longer choose their employees from long lines of applicants.
On the contrary, it must try and try to attract a particularly highly skilled workforce.
In particular, graduates of engineering fields have an excellent negotiating position.
According to data from the Union of German Engineers VDI, 40,000 engineering positions remained vacant in October.
And according to the VDI's predictions, the so-called shortage of engineers will continue to grow.
Roman Dykta goes on a talent hunt for the auditing and consulting firm KPMG.
It organizes demanding Recruiting-events, such as KPMG-Race, a kind of modern treasure race in which participants must find their way according to GPS coordinates.
The company plans to send eight promising students across the U.S. next year.
Participants can also view KPMG branches and get acquainted with the company.
In advance, it will be decided in two selection rounds who will participate.
Only Crème de la Crème of many interested parties will fly to the USA.
According to Dykta, Dykta's high potentials will be challenged by increasingly tough laws.
"We want to be different from the others with our Race."
"A simple sailing trip was too little for us."
Talent hunter Dykta seems lucky.
"We stayed in touch with all participants in a similar event last year."
"Some of them are going to finish their studies soon and are planning to apply for a job with us," he says.
In addition to direct addressing on campus, small and medium-sized companies are primarily presenting themselves classically in labour markets.
"We try to contact graduates at professional exhibitions."
"Like Intersolar," says Sitha Stübe, head of human resources at solar technology manufacturer Solarworld.
The Bonn-based company employs around 1,500 people in Germany.
Stübe knows the issue with young workers.
There are currently 35 positions listed on the company's website.
"It's difficult at the moment to fill vacancies."
"It costs a lot of time and money," he says.
Another option is to contact professors at universities.
Solarworld cooperates with various universities, such as the University of Freiberg.
"Professors inform that it is possible to practice or write a thesis in our country."
The solar specialist doesn't hold any expensive promotions.
Instead, the company tries to attract other advantages: personal atmosphere, low hierarchy and light communication.
"Large corporations often cannot offer this," says Stübe, head of personal.
Money has not played a major role in finding a job for a long time.
Flexible working hours, cheddling or good progression options are other determinants.
Solarworld ranked 55th among the top 100 employers in Germany in a study by great place to work.
The Institute draws up an annual list of the best German employers.
In addition, it interviews co-workers how satisfied they are with their work and work environment and monitors the framework conditions of employees.
Stübe, the head of the personal department, hopes that the location will bring her points for job seekers.
"I think those interested are particularly interested in external assessments of a potential employer," he says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler from The Employer Branding Academy in Germany advises companies that want to build a long-term strategy of reputation as an employer.
He advises his customers to be more authentic.
And according to Mr. Kriegler, that means, above all, internal measures.
"The best way to make yourself visible as an attractive employer is through your own employees," he says.
Technically, this is called internal Employer Branding, i.e. the promotion of an employer on the market within its own employees.
"Satisfied employees are the best ambassadors."
If the company takes good care of its people and they identify with the company, then they will advertise themselves to their employer among friends and acquaintances.
"It's like a string game," says Kriegler.
Obama stops new oil wells
In the coming years, no new oil wells will be created off the coast of the US-Florida state in the Gulf of Mexico.
The government in Washington issued an appropriate ban - the way in which it definitively canceled earlier plans.
Also off the Atlantic coast, new wells are banned.
Interior Minister Ken Salazar made the statement Wednesday.
The reason for the strict ban, which is expected to last at least the next five years, is an explosion at the Deepwater Horizon drilling tower in April.
Before the disaster, which cost 11 workers their lives and led to the largest environmental disaster in the US, President Barack Obama signaled his willingness to allow new drilling in the eastern Gulf of Mexico, under pressure from the opposition and industry.
In doing so, proponents are trying to reduce US dependence on foreign oil supplies.
To date, it is not clearly explained who is responsible for the devastating oil disaster in the gulf.
At the centre of the criticism is British energy concern BP, which is confronted with billions in applications.
The commission of inquiry commissioned by Obama is expected to present the results by December.
In October, Interior Minister Ken Salazar lifted a drilling ban that had been in place since the explosion.
Subsequently, various oil companies submitted applications for new drilling projects.
Obama and Salazar want to prevent a similar disaster with tighter controls and strict safety regulations.
The Audit Office is currently being fundamentally reformed, which has drawn attention to itself with numerous corruption allegations.
At the same time, Obama announced that he would abolish lucrative tax evasion opportunities for oil and gas companies.
Industry is now openly warning that stricter regulation will significantly reduce the volume of oil being oil in the Gulf.
"The government's plans are the biggest drag on the growth of the gas and oil industries," reads the result of a recent industry survey by consultancy BDO - ahead of a drilling ban on Wednesday.
On top of that, the American Energy Alliance complains about industry uncertainty: "No one knows exactly what's going to change with regulation."
Investment in new mining projects is being made until further notice - at the expense of growth.
Ogoni region burned down
The water in the rivers is oily brown, it smells like a pump: billions of litres of leaked oil have destroyed nature in the Ogoni region of Nigeria.
People make a living stealing, corruption and illegally cooking oil.
Celestine Akpobari means well.
"Don't worry," the environmental activist reassures journalists: "You're going to get a lot of oil mud in front of your lens today."
The 37-year-old Nigerian watched an attempt to photograph a boy wading through the water surrounding his breasts with smudges: the scene feels almost pretty in a rainbow-colored water sheen.
You can't see that brown oil clots are floating beneath the surface.
She used to collect enough garnels in containers, says Esther Badom on the banks of the Bodo-Jetty River.
Meanwhile, the slow-flowing water became completely dead.
Five years ago, a large amount of oil spilled into a vast, balmy area from a broken line.
Fishermen from the nearby town of Bodo have to paddle for at least six hours to get to the waters where the fish are: the Ogoni area, located in the heart of the Niger Delta, is one of the worst-hit areas in the world.
On the way down the river through mangrove swamps with lots of lateral tributaries, the entire range of the trigger is only noticeable.
The boat's engine boils brown porridge instead of light water, and whoever dipes his hand in the water pulls out his oil fingers.
The roots of mangroves stick out of the ground like black licorice sticks, rare palm trees leave their leaves sadly hanging.
We search in vain for flocks of birds commonly found in humid areas: As soon as the boat's engine dies down, a haunting silence is broken in an earlier paradise, where it smells like a pump.
"What is happening here is the ecological conduct of war," says Celestine Akpobari sadly: "We live in constant fear for health."
The comparison with the war is justified.
The Ogoni settlement area is a battlefield where fighting has been fought for decades: more than 60 years ago, the first conquerors from Europe flocked here, here in the 1980s the first resistance with the later executed writer Ken Saro-Wiwa was formed, here shell had to stop its production in 1993 because it was too dangerous for employees.
To this day, the company is not allowed to return to the Ogoni region: while the entire three-size-sized Swiss delta region is extracted daily, with more than 5,000 drilling wells and 7,000 kilometers of line of more than two million barrels of black gold, the oil fields in the Ogoni region lie fallow, a situation that is too unstable for the group.
Every few hundred meters, steel structures stick out of the water like bizarre statues: "Christmas trees", so they are too tenderly called drill heads.
They're 50 years old, most rusty to the core.
Every now and then, such a drilling hole head breaks, Akpobari says, and then a constant stream of oil flows into the water.
According to experts' estimates, more than two billion liters have leaked into the delta ecosystem in 50 years: Every year, as much oil as spilled into the sea off Alaska in the "Exxon Valdez" supertanker crash 21 years ago - one of the greatest environmental disasters in human history.
There is controversy over who is responsible for the ongoing environmental disaster.
While shell calls sabotage and organized oil theft more than 90 percent pollution, environmentalists talk about cracking well heads and leaking lines as the root cause.
Shell requires much smaller safety regulations in Nigeria than is customary in the world, us-American scientist Richard Steiner said in 2008: Only the number of faults on the lines is said to be "several times higher than elsewhere."
In what looks like an abandoned, oil-sleaze-slewn open-air workshop from afar, characters emerge from the mangroves: completely naked and up to their necks of oil.
Under one of the many barrels that are partially connected by the line, partly arbitrarily scattered on the ground, there is a fire burning: an illegal small refinery.
Oil heats up in a barrel over the fire for several hours, explains Michael, the group's leader.
First, gasoline flows from the power line into the keg, later it drip kerosene at the end of the line, and finally diesel.
In this way, Michael and his four coworkers produce up to four barrels of 300 liters a day: "We'll make about 34,000 Naira" - about $22.
Delta residents are taking advantage of chronic fuel shortages in Black Africa's largest oil state.
Nigeria owns only one refinery.
The ridiculously low price of 40 cents a litre of diesel can still be beaten by illegal producers: because they have the raw material for free.
It comes from "bunkers" that connect to power lines everywhere in the Ogoni region: according to experts, at least 16 million litres of oil are lost to the country every day throughout the Niger Delta region.
But only a negligible portion of the provisionally stored raw material will be illegally re-embed: Organized criminal networks, including politicians and high-ranking military officials, will fill the largest share and sell it on the world market.
The debate over whether the population caused the disaster and their interventions or lax production is considered purely academic by the activist Akpobari.
"If oil companies were not considered invaders, and if they had not completely destroyed the life of fishermen, then there would be neither sabotage nor theft and illegal refineries."
In the meantime, however, Ogoni's relationship with Shell in particular is so damaged that only the group's departure is considered: "Perhaps other nations like the Chinese will show up to be better."
Michael's going to get upset.
"It's high time you disappeared," says the muscular manufacturer.
"Soldiers could be here any minute."
If a special military unit finds them, they're not in danger of jail, they're in danger of being bribed.
Soldiers, who mostly come from the north of the country - like all Nigerians - also want to profit from the raw material.
"This damn thing has taken our country to the bottom in every way," says Akpobari.
Investigators discover dangerous construction error in A380 engines
The A380 clearly has a major safety flaw.
Investigators discovered a possible construction error during a search of the machine that made the emergency landing, which could lead to a "catastrophic engine failure."
Qantas wants to sue the engine manufacturer.
Qantas Airbus passengers were probably luckier than previously known when they made an emergency landing in early November: the Australian Aviation Safety Authority identified a major safety defect in the engines of some A380s in its investigations - and is now warning of a possible construction error.
A possible defect would have severe consequences: one oil connection could cause cracks due to wear and tear, the ATSB said in a statement released this Thursday.
This could lead to a "catastrophic engine failure."
These are engines manufactured by Rolls-Royce in 20 A380 series aircraft.
Among them is a Qantas airbus that had to make an emergency landing in Singapore on November 4.
The Australian airline has now taken legal action against the British turbine manufacturer.
She has lodged a grounds for the action in the Australian Federal Court in Sydney, allowing further legal action against the company.
Qantas boss Alan Joyce said his company would seek compensation for the incident in early November.
During the engine fire, parts were released and they damaged the supporting surfaces.
Rolls-Royce cited burning oil as the cause of the damage.
After this event, up to 40 engines must be replaced worldwide.
Australian investigators have announced that they will conduct further safety tests with giant aircraft equipped with the engines in question.
The safety recommendation is the result of cooperation with Rolls-Royce, said ATSB spokesman Martin Dolan.
The security deficiency was considered important enough to inform all concerned.
After the Qantas emergency landing, the airline left its A380 fleet on the ground for several weeks.
Singapore Airlines has left three of its 11 A380s temporarily on the ground.
Lufthansa replaced the engine on one A380 as a safety measure.
The two-story aircraft is the largest passenger plane in the world.
Nationwide snowfall causes traffic chaos
Germany in white: it snowed almost all over the country overnight.
Chaos reigns on many roads, train and plane connections are disrupted.
At least three people died in traffic accidents.
Winter chills Germany: almost the entire republic fell into freezing snow at night on Thursday - leading to traffic chaos in many places.
In the north and east, in some places lies up to 15 centimeters of snow.
Traffic is severely restricted on several motorways and many roads.
On the A7 near Flensburg, the road service was still on the scene, but it couldn't handle the new snow.
On top of that, there was a strong gusty wind over the Baltic Sea.
The Federal Office for Navigation and Hydrography (BSH) expects a storm surge on the Baltic Coast in Schlesvik-Holstein in the morning with a water level 1.2 meters above normal.
Snowstorms have caused significant problems on motorways and state roads in Saxony.
According to the Meteomedia Bad Weather Centre, the alert level in Switzerland was therefore purple - the highest level ever.
In part, 30 centimeters of new snow fell there, strong and fresh winds caused snowdcks.
Several trucks and passenger cars remained there at night.
Also in Saxony-Anhalt, police authorities reported major road problems.
On the A2, wind and snow caused slow traffic and traffic jams.
There was trouble in Thuringia due to snow on the A4 and A9.
According to the German Railways, major problems occur in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia and northern Bavaria.
The main problems are snow on the tracks, overturned trees on the tracks or broken upper lines and switches.
In Saxony, long-distance traffic from Leipzig to Nuremberg had to be stopped.
In Thuringia, Saalfeld had to stop an ICE to Munich.
165 passengers were given wool blankets, food and drink by firefighters and paramedics on the train.
Snow wind blew across the roads.
Many flights were cancelled at major German airports due to snow winds.
According to a spokesperson for the Flight Information Centre, flights have already been reported to have been voided from Munich.
In Frankfurt, 40 flights have already been cancelled, according to a Fraport spokesman.
Road maintenance is in constant operation.
Although few passengers were left without a connection at the airport, 400 field beds are prepared for them.
There were accidents on many roads on Wednesday evening.
In the evening, a truck driver died in a collision with a train at a railway crossing in eastern Holstein.
The driver was slightly injured.
Due to a snowy road, a similar accident occurred near Nuremberg: a lorry was also caught at a railway crossing because the vehicle was stuck.
The driver died.
Four passengers were injured on the train - the route from Bayreuth to Nuremberg remained closed until the early hours of the morning.
A 30-year-old woman died after she overturned her car on a slippery road near Aschaffenburg.
But meteorologists have good news: snow will remain in the form of light powder, and therefore it will rise even with light gusts of wind.
But the wind will weaken.
Only by the Baltic Sea will there be fast winds of gale force.
But it will be very cold - locally up to minus 15 degrees.
Deutsche Bank looking for buyer for twin towers
Deutsche Bank wants to say goodbye to its sign: according to one newspaper post, the bank is looking for a buyer for two towers with offices in its headquarters in Frankfurt.
The property could 500 million euros.
Deutsche Bank has just renovated its headquarters: twin towers in Frankfurt's banking district have been upgraded; in the meantime, bankers were allowed back into their old jobs.
But now the financial concern seems to want the renovation costs back - and is looking for a buyer for both skyscrapers, as reported by the Financial Times Deutschland, citing a spokesman.
The spokesman did not name the reasons for the planned sale.
"We are still exploring whether it makes more sense to own or sell the property and then re-rent it," he said.
With this, the largest credit institution in Germany is giving up its corporate headquarters again after a short period of time.
The bank only took over the twin towers in mid-2007 for 272 million euros from investors of its own fund and subsequently renovated them costly.
According to the data, the energy conversion swallowed up around 200 million euros.
A sale would probably bring a lot of money to the bank.
Industry experts estimate the value of the towers renamed "Greentowers" to be around 500 million euros, according to the newspaper.
A spokesman said no decision was made on whether the building would be reschedued by the fund or an independent investor.
Thousands mourn dead miners
More than 10,000 people have paid tribute to the smourd-born miners in New Zealand who were declared dead after several explosions at the mine.
The dead have still not been rescued because the security situation in the shaft remains complicated.
Almost two weeks ago, there was a massive explosion at Pike River Mine near greymouth.
29 miners aged between 17 and 62 were trapped in the mine.
A probe was launched into the shaft where the accident occurred, but found no sign of life.
Due to high concentrations of toxic gases and subsequent explosions, rescue forces could not descend for safety reasons.
After the second strong detonation, authorities and experts were based on the fact that the miners had no chance of survival.
We still haven't been able to free the dead.
Now relatives and friends have paid tribute to the dead.
Ten thousand people gathered in Greymouth, on New Zealand's south island, in sunny weather.
They were silent for two minutes.
In honor of the miners, 29 tables were built, on which helmets, flashlights and the names of the miners were built.
Also pictures and personal items such as clothes and surfboards have found their place here.
Flags flew at half-mast on state government buildings.
New Zealand hoped the miners would rise from the "depths of the earth" to the surface again, New Zealand Prime Minister John Key said of the commemoration.
"But they never came home."
He can't say good-bye to his son until he saw his dead body, said Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was drenched in a mine.
In addition to the Prime Minister and relatives of the victims, several foreign diplomats also attended the commemoration.
British and South African miners were also killed in the november 19 explosion.
Rescuers started by putting out a fire inside a coal mine on New Zealand's South Island.
Once the toxic gases dissolve, high temperatures inside the mine begin to cool, Police President Gary Knowles told reporters.
To hell, warriors!
Does horror suit an art cinema?
Director Nicolas Winding Refn tries to re-conquer the old boundaries with his battle epic "Walhalla Rising".
What audience did Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn think of when he was shooting "Walhalla Rising"?
A captured Viking one-eyed warrior (Mads Mikkelsen) frees himself from his tormentors and kills his opponents with almost supernatural force - it sounds ideal for young male viewers looking for bloody actions, because our hero helps himself with cruel methods of killing and even snatches his enemies' guts alive when he is in a bad mood.
On the other hand, One-Eyed, as it is actually called, does not say a word throughout the film, and the other characters say no more than one or two sentences or let themselves be pulled down to the distressing dying screams.
Otherwise, it is silent and lavish in the gruesomely beautiful hilly landscape of Scotland, which offers a backdrop to the Viking world some thousands of years ago.
The film is ideal for adult cinema enthusiasts interested in existentialism and very calm camera shots.
It's good when a movie has multiple target groups, it's just a shame when they exclude each other.
Director Winding Refn, after filming his wild and stylized trilogy about drug dealers "Pusher," is considered the Danish version of director Quentin Tarantino, but stoically resists approaching his works either with more mainstream humor or less brutality to the artistic audience.
Most art cinema fans seem to be discouraged by the squirting brain and guts everywhere.
Fans of action films will be bored at the latest when One-Eyed sets off for a group of violent Christian missionaries by boat to Jerusalem for freely explainable reasons, and remains hanging in the wind and fog for eternity before the men apparently arrive in America and remain silent there.
No wonder, then, that "Walhalla Rising" didn't make it to cinemas in Germany and has now only been released on DVD.
It's a shame mainly because of the beautiful shots, but also because behind the distinctive façade, sometimes even collapsed with blood, there is an exciting cinema that deserved a little attention.
In this film, it's not about dialogue or the exact plot, it's all the atmosphere, the feverish dream that became the movie.
And that's not an escape for the viewer.
Refn doesn't give him a moment's relaxation and slowly suffocates him with his chilling shots and grim hypnotic soundtrack, but above all with the indescribable hatred that smourding from the characters' hearts.
Only a little blond boy who helps The One-Occal retains something of an innocence, everyone else is driven by anger.
Most of all, a one-eyed hero whose motives will never be explained, who will become a warrior from hell, perhaps an emissary of the devil, in time for enemies and transitional allies.
It depicts destruction, perhaps only for the wicked.
"Walhalla Rising" is a mysterious film that can be hated and admired, for anger, excitement and admiration.
experience.
Mysterious earthworks
The IAEA nuclear authority has new alerts about Syria's secret nuclear program.
But the country is resisting expression - and will not even allow controls.
Around midnight on September 5-6, 2007, at least four Israeli F-15 I fighter jets attacked a mysterious square building in Syria.
It stands on the shores of Euphrat; the nearest major town is 30 kilometers away and is called Dair as-Saur.
Documents from the International Nuclear Energy Agency (IAEA) state its name when it comes to a reactor allegedly built by Syria with the help of North Korea in this square, which is t detouring from the current.
Based on a us-U.S. Foreign Intelligence Service memo from the end of April 2008, the reactor, also known as the nearby village of el-Kibar, would be well suited to producing plutonium - from which nuclear weapons can be built.
The technology of the 1950s is not right for anything else.
The CIA presented a video with uns focused satellite imagery.
Using computer animation, she clarified where the reactor components might have been before the destruction, a scaled-down copy of North Korea's Yongbyon nuclear center model.
In addition, there were also photographs submitted that showed the building up close or even from the inside.
They say the reactor was shortly before launch, but still without fuel cells.
Today, more than three years after the bombing, not much more is known than then, even the riddles have increased over time.
Former US President George W. Bush recently disclosed in his memoirs that the CIA was very confident before the attack that Syria was building a reactor in el-Kibar, but it had virtually no evidence that there was an "active nuclear weapons program" in the country.
Some intelligence correspondents in Europe are even more cautious, talking only about an "alleged reactor," even though they consider the CIA's presentation "plausible."
They lack clear evidence, as does the IAEA.
Asked how sure he was of having a reactor in front of him, a senior UN diplomat replied this summer, saying the IAEA had "enough material to ask questions."
The scathing of what is said to be an "unused military building" was quickly cleared by the Syrians and also properly aligned the terrain.
Nevertheless, in June 2008, the IAEA team, led by former Chief Inspector Olli Heinonen in el-Kibar, managed to find traces of human-made uranium.
In addition, the IAEA received satellite photos of commercial vendors from the period immediately after the attack through a Member State, which should be more concising than those presented by the CIA.
Unfortunately, these images are not on the market because they were exclusively bought by an unknown customer - maybe Israel.
Therefore, the IAEA cannot confirm their authenticity.
Syria has always claimed that it never had a secret nuclear program or built a reactor.
Uranium comes from Israeli weapons, Damascus said.
But this was refuted by the IAEA after particle analysis.
Since then, Damascus has refused to discuss the matter - as well as satellite footage.
In addition, it banned inspectors from a second inspection in el-Kibar and access to the wreckage of the bombed-out building.
But Israel, too, is staily silent.
"We will never comment," Ehud Olmert, the ruling prime minister at the time, recently confirmed the official position.
The investigation into the case has been dragging on fruitlessly since June 2008 and is "growing into a serious problem given the credibility of the office," as a senior Western diplomat at the IAEA headquarters in Vienna admitted - a serious violation of the nuclear ban treaty overseen by the IAEA.
The IAEA considers three other devices to be "in functional contact" with the alleged reactor - and, unlike it, still exist - as the key to the move.
The inspectors have not yet stated which devices they are, or what their function is or why they are suspected.
According to information from the Süddeutsche Zeitung newspaper, the IAEA internally refers to them as Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah, derived again from nearby cities.
The Independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (Isis) identified these objects and found a complex of buildings in satellite imagery that is believed to be one of the suspicious objects.
It appears to be inside or in the immediate vicinity of a military base - precisely for this reason, Syria is denying the IAEA access to these three sites.
In Vienna, it was said that the Syrians were afraid of the so-called fishing expedition - that the IAEA would have been pre-sent by the US to track down military bases.
Nuclear detectives have been alerted to the device by the U.S. Secret Service.
The IAEA has the background, as well as satellite imagery, that material was transported back and forth between the three locations and a square near Euphrat.
In Vienna, a senior Western diplomat said that at least one of the furnished should be "in connection with fuel production."
However, there is 'no evidence of sensible activities', i.e. uranium enrichment and re-processing; processes necessary for the production of nuclear weapons.
The reactor type is powered by uranium that is not enriched.
But where the uranium comes from, and where plutonium should be detonated into a bomb later, there are only likely estimates of these central questions.
It is also not known whether the debris, which could hide important clues, is stored in these three locations.
As if hundreds of cargoes of trucks had disappeared from the face of the earth, no one seems to have any information as to where the steed has gone.
Only a few kilometres from el-Kibar, on the other side of Euphrat, the al-Tibni salt mine, which Syria had inspected in 1998 as a suitable depot for radioactive waste, is considered unlikely by the IAEA.
Former IAEA inspector Robert Kelley linked it to the reactor in an analysis of satellite imagery for the renowned Jane's Intelligence Review.
But space images show that after the IAEA requested access, Syria carried out earthworks at all suspicious sites and removed large containers.
It could have been a coincidence, but it didn't help clear up the suspicions.
Moreover, diplomatic circles say that the IAEA has spent many months working on a plan for inspectors that would allow Syria to keep any military secrets - only the effort shows how much interest the inspectors are.
Damascus, meanwhile, rejected this proposal.
If, a year ago, Western diplomats in Vienna were reassuring that the reactor was destroyed and therefore the matter was not burning, us Ambassador Glyn Davies has been talking for months about so-called special inspections, one of the toughest means for vienna's nuclear authority to enforce controls.
Yukiya Amano, the head of the IAEA, who would have to propose inspections, has already spoken of "the possibility I will be able to see in the future", but is hesitant.
This choice poses a big risk: On the one hand, it requires a majority on the IAEA's governing council, and many of the 35 countries represented are certainly not interested in escalation.
On the other hand, as one diplomat points out, "What happens if they don't find anything after all?"
Love in times of war
Since Angelina Jolie began working on the still-name directorial first film this summer, there have been difficulties.
She wrote the script herself, it is a love story of a woman from Bosnia and a man from Serbia.
Much more is not known yet - but even this causes unease.
There is persistent talk that the woman, who is Muslim, will fall in love with the Serbian man who raped her during the war in Yugoslavia.
Bosnian women's associations immediately protested, so the planned filming from Sarajevo to Hungary was hastily moved.
The film, meanwhile, has been filmed in Hungary and is in post-production, but there are still protests in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic of the Women's War Victims Organization wrote through UN refugee aid organization UNHCR Jolie asking to meet the actress, the Bosnian newspaper reported now - Jolie is also an ambassador for the UN refugee aid organization.
She is not exactly diplomatic - she offered the women a meeting in Hungary weeks ago, but they refused.
The meeting must take place in Bosnia, Hasecic said.
There were no love stories in rape camps, and Jolie's attitude towards the victims reveals a lot about the script.
So her organization recommended to the UN refugee aid organization that Jolie be released as ambassador, the Guardian reports.
What scenes exactly did Jolie write?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which was given the floor to read her script, allowed filming after a minor tug-of-war in Sarajevo - it is not entirely clear why Jolie did not come anyway.
The young author stresses that she does not pursue any political intentions in her film, that she has devoted herself with great effort to the conflict in Yugoslavia, that she wants to show the terrible consequences of the war and to give space to all the parties involved.
Due to the content, it remains indeterminate.
There is another version of the film circulating on the Internet that sounds very different: the lovers knew each other before the war began, and they meet again when she, as a Bosnian Muslim, is dragged into a Serbian camp where he serves as a guard.
Which really sounds a lot different than "a rape victim falls in love with his torturer."
The fact that jolie's film really begins before the war is true.
Jolie argues that there is pressure on her that "is not fair and based on meddly information."
Now hollywood hekers can rescue her: by illegally publishing her script on the Internet, as they have done many times before.
Nothing but gone
This evening is good for the Irish again.
No sign of grief.
The home team dominates the power of its guests from Sweden, Finland and the USA.
Fans roar with joy to the sound of loud music, stomping their feet.
Bailey-Pub in Cork, Southern Ireland, is on a whirn now because players throw tennis balls from three metres into beer cups - and hit them.
"Beer Pong" is called bizarre theater, and it is possible to win 500 euros as a winning bonus, plus tickets to Las Vegas for the World Beer Pong Championships in January.
Cian Tanner is a calm type; this screaming beer game and restrained computer scientist, it doesn't really work out.
Yet the 26-year-old is trying to have fun, to unwind from the ding erming question of what the future holds.
His plan is not a playing passion in Las Vegas, he's going to interview in New Zealand in January.
"I have this weird feeling about it," he says.
"It's so far away, and I don't have a job there yet."
Still: His girlfriend is already waiting for him in Auckland - "she immediately got her dream job as an Eventmanager, maybe that's a good sign" says the young man, smiling.
Due to poor prospects at home, two out of three Tanner siblings have already tried their luck abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sydney, and his brother Colin now has a job as an IT consultant in London.
The boys are leaving: As with the Tanners, it looks like many families on the island.
100,000 Irish people will leave the country anytime soon, predict experts at esri's Scientific Institute for Economics and Social Affairs in Dublin.
They even count 200,000 emigrants by 2015.
For such a small country of only 4.5 million inhabitants, this is a major loss.
If the predictions are confirmed, there will be an emigration wave similar to that suffered by Ireland in the 1980s.
After a decade of ascension that has brought great prosperity to the Irish, disisent is now spreading again.
The economic crisis is particularly tinging with young, educated Irish people, who have so far experienced only an upswing.
Job losses and social descent seemed absurd in these boom years.
Everyone was needed, money was wasted.
Meanwhile, three out of ten women and men under the age of 30 are out of work.
There are many letters in the Irish Times from readers complaining: "Everything is going downhill in Ireland."
"There should be an uprising against politicians and bankers - but who can, he goes away, and our country loses a whole generation."
"Last one, please turn off the lights."
Law student Leanne Caulfield, president of the Irish Student Union, sees the future as black because the government is said to be deceiving and offering young people no prospects for the future.
"They're reducing the minimum wage, but they have no strategy to create new jobs," says the 20-year-old.
She watches her classmates go from one unpaid practice to the next.
Her biggest concern is that she'll have to move out on her own in four years.
"This thought is sad and depressing."
Men like Stephen McLarnon try to see the subject positively.
McLarnon organizes "WorkingAbroadExpo", an exhibition that offers a total service on the topic of work abroad.
"For beginners in the labour market, working abroad is an excellent chance to take the first steps on the career ladder" says the manager.
On its website there are photos of surfers in Australia and snowboarders in Canada.
The message is clear: Working abroad is not galleys, but freedom and joy.
For six months, Seán O'Donovan has known what it's like to build something somewhere else.
Because the 29-year-old engineer had no job in Ireland, he is now employed along with 15 Irish colleagues on construction in Germany.
They're building a fashion house in Gelsenkirchen right now.
In January, it continues to Hanover or Berlin for another project.
O'Donovan, meanwhile, rarely gets home because he works extra shifts to pay off a home loan.
"Sometimes the situation is really a little crazy," he says, as he crosses the threshold of his own house for the first time in a long time.
"I make money in Germany for a house in Ireland that I'm not really in at all."
He laughs awkwardly and walks through the cold rooms.
The small house is located in a good neighborhood with well-kept gardens, with large expensive cars parked in the entrances.
O'Donovan bought the house with his sister four years ago for 380,000 euros - 100 percent financed by a loan.
"It was a crazy time, the easy money was without many questions," he says.
Is he worried that the loan might not go well?
O'Donovan thinks for a moment, pours hot tea, and says, "I don't have children to feed, and I'm young; even if everything goes wrong, I can start over."
The civil engineer doesn't like the weeping he hears so often now.
"No one has to starve - our situation is not as dramatic as it used to be on this island," he says.
"Working abroad for a while is not the worst thing that can happen - maybe then we'll feel like Irish."
He laughs and then tells of his father, who went to England during the last economic crisis.
"After seven years, he was back, and life went on in Ireland, quite simply."
Cian Tanner likes the idea.
Keep the future open and simply wait to see how life develops elsewhere.
He's had several years of work in London, too, and why shouldn't it be good for him and his girlfriend in New Zealand?
But there is one other thing that worries him a lot these days: his 27th birthday party in Dublin on Friday.
She's afraid she might go to a bachelor party.
"Just don't get emotional," he says, drinking a lot of beer.
"Goodbye, that sounds disturbing."
"Let's call it a celebration of leaving, quite simply, with a few friends, a few drinks, a few games."
Common practice of democracy
Support for democracy in Latin America is growing, as is support for private enterprise.
Crime is more of a concern than unemployment.
And Brazil is considered more influential by many regions than the United States.
These are some of the results of the current Latinobarómetro survey, which was conducted in 18 countries and was published exclusively in The Economist.
As the survey has been held regularly since 1995, it can monitor changes in attitudes across the region.
This year's survey, which took place in September and early October, is dominated by two related issues.
The first is that Latin America is in a rather cheerful mood.
The second is to increase the stability of attitudes towards democracy and its key institutions.
Support for democracy in several pacific rim countries in South America has increased significantly (see Table 1).
For example, in Peru, where economic growth has averaged 6% a year since 2002, support for democracy has risen from a low of 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
It also rose in Mexico, where the economy was recovering from a deep decline in production last year.
But only about half of those surveyed in Mexico and Brazil, the two most populous areas, are convinced Democrats, which drags down the regional average (see Chart 2).
Some 44% of respondents across the region expressed satisfaction with how democracy works in practice in their country, the same number as last year, but this is a big increase compared to 25% in 2001 (Chart 3).
Some 34% said they trust the Parliament in their country and 45% trust the government, again the same numbers as last year, but this is a big difference compared to 2003 (17% and 24%).
Ten years ago, the economic crisis undermined democracy in Latin America.
Support was probably incurred during the global financial crisis because many Latin American countries suffered only a brief recession and enjoyed a strong recovery.
In addition, a stronger social security network has helped protect poor people.
(The United Nations Economic Commission on Latin America reported this week that the ratio of Latinos living in poverty increased only slightly in 2009, falling again this year to 32.)
However, the mood changes in a wide range from country to country (see Chart 4).
Brazil's strong economic performance and the popularity of its outgoing president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, are reflected in a widely accepted sense of progress.
This situation is rarer in Mexico and Central America, where the recession has become more severe and violent crime has worsened.
For only the second time since surveys began, more respondents across Latin America see crime rather than unemployment as the most important problem (see Chart 5).
Some 31% say that either they or their close relatives were victims of crime last year, but this is down from 38% last year and is also the lowest figure since 1995.
More massive economic performance is reflected in growing support for private entrepreneurship and the market economy: around 71% of respondents across the region say that private entrepreneurship is essential for development, up from 56% in 2007 (see Chart 6).
About 58% agree that a market economy is the only system that will allow their country to develop, up from 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of respondents in Venezuela share the same opinion (and 80% support private business there), although their leftist President Hugo Chávez expropriate many private firms.
Brazil is a leading country in the region, as 19% of respondents mentioned (up from 18% last year), followed by the United States (9%, unchanged from last year) and Venezuela (9%, up from 11% last year)
However, the United States is considered the most influential country by respondents in Mexico and much of Central America, with Venezuela enjoying success in Ecuador, the Dominican Republic, and Nicaragua.
Criticized elections
No one expected haiti's general election on 28 November to be perfect.
But they were much worse than outsiders trying to help the affected country to be afraid.
The elections meant filling ballot boxes and repetitive voting, ballots scattered across sewers, broken polling stations and intimidation.
Polling stations open after hours of delay.
Many Haitians, including many displaced by the January earthquake, roamed around trying to figure out where they could vote.
Some of them eventually gave up.
More than a decade of presidential candidates, including several presumptive pre-election candidates, shouted that it was a hoax and called for the election to be canceled.
Protests, some of them violent, spread across the country.
Yet Edmond Mulet, a senior UN official in Haiti, said that "in many ways these were pretty good elections."
Observers from the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community cautiously said they "do not believe that these irregularities, however serious, did not necessarily cancel the process."
In other words, the show continues.
The electoral body, whose opposition votes are beholden to René Préval, the unpopular outgoing president and his candidate Jude Célestin, is due to announce preliminary results on 7 December.
The expected showdown is scheduled for January.
All electoral hopes are not lost.
Two leading opposition candidates, Michel Martelly, a rapper, and Mirlande Manigat, the former first lady, withdrew from their initial call for the vote to be declared invalid.
But the problem may arise if Mr Célestin, who has little or no support among voters, is identified by the Electoral Commission as having reached a decisive contest.
Due to the raging cholera epidemic and the more than 1 million people still living in tents after the earthquake, there were fears that turnout would be low.
In the end, many Haitians wanted to vote, but were prevented from doing so because of disorganization.
The roughly 250,000 identity cards required for voting remained undimmed shortly before the election.
The stakes are high.
Donors see the election of a legitimate and popular government as a major step in Haiti's reconstruction.
So it is clear that haitians will do it themselves.
Tiptoe to the center
In the weeks since she was suddenly turned into a douche, Cristina Fernández, Argentina's president, has benefited from public sympathy, with her popularity growing from 20% to more than 50%, the highest level since she was elected in 2007.
Yet reversing this success in a successful campaign for a second term in next year's elections may depend on the grieving Mrs Fernández giving up on the incompature of her late husband, predecessor and political partner Néstor Kirchner.
And on these types, everything will be based.
Mr. Kirchner, who continued economic policy even after his wife successfully became president, had a habit of drawing up budgets that understated tax revenues, economic growth, and inflation.
This allowed the first couple to spend additional income at will.
Mrs Fernández's government lost its majority in Congress last year.
But the opposition split and was further destabilised in Mr Kirchner's death from a heart attack on 27 October.
Some members of the ruling Peronist political movement joined Ms Fernández.
But after chaotic sessions (in which the government was slapped and accused of corruption), Congress failed to pass the 2011 budget.
"I'm not going to fight," the president said.
The 2010 budget will now also apply for next year, with the president having more room to spend at will.
The economy is overheating: growth is likely to be as high as 9% this year.
The official inflation rate now stands at 11.1%, but many private estimates and trade unionists are talking about a figure approaching 30%.
Mr Kirchner, who took office in 2003, when Argentina was plagued by economic collapse, has prioritizing growth and poverty reduction rather than controlling inflation.
He refused to negotiate with the IMF, burdened the private sector, and purged INDEC, the statistical agency that has agreed to monitor official inflation statistics.
Can President Fernández now moderate this policy?
It called for negotiations between private businesses and union leaders.
And its officials say they want to limit wage growth to 18% next year.
The economy was supported by a rise in world prices for exports of Argentine agricultural products.
But inflation was disrupted by growth based on a major devaluation in 2002.
This may be why President Fernández is making it clear that she wants to restore Argentina's financial ties to the rest of the world.
Earlier this year, the government struck an agreement with bondholders who had previously refused to restructure debt that Argentina had not paid in 2001.
Now President Fernández is facing a deal with the creditor governments, which are grouped together in the Paris Club, to which she owes about $6.7 billion.
Kirchners has always insisted that this should not be in the IMF's sight, as is customary.
But last month, Amado Boudou, the economy minister, announced that the fund would provide "technical assistance" to design a new national consumer-price index that would resemble an introduction to cleaning up the INDEC.
It is not yet clear whether President Fernández will want to stay in politics after her term ends when her husband is no longer by her side.
If he wants to stay, he needs to win the support of the middle class, which is tired of kirchnerism.
By the time argentines return from their summer vacation in March, the wave of sympathy will be falling.
If she wants to win another election, she will have to decide whether it will be necessary to quietly resote from many of her husband's views in politics.
Half encouragement for China
Taiwanese voters are closer to a closer connection to the mainland.
What does Taiwan think of its big brother across the sea?
More than 7.5 million voters, 70% of those eligible, voted for mayors and city councils in five boroughs on November 27, which may be seen as a broader assessment of President Ma Ying-jeou.
President Ma himself is a representative of the feelings that prevail on the mainland and have a strong place in business relations, including the Partially Free Trade Agreement, in the largest settlement of relations with China since 1949.
President Ma passed the test, but only narrowly.
Although his Kuomintang Party (KMT) ended up winning three of the five mayoral offices, it failed to win by a majority vote.
In addition, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which favors greater independence for Taiwan, won nearly 50% of the vote against the KMT's 45%.
If this were a presidential election, President Ma would be in trouble.
Since he was elected two years ago, his party's share of the vote has fallen by about 8%.
For the first time, the DPP, together with the KMT, was on city councils.
The elections took place like most taiwanese elections, which include noisy election trucks and mass rallies with flags with spasms of girls.
It even included a mandatory mysterious assassination attempt.
Sean Lien, son of Lien Chan, honorary chairman of the KMT, was agitating for KMT candidates on the eve of the election.
A man in the crowd shot young Mr. Lien cleanly over the face, wounding him and killing a bystander.
Bizarrely, it was not determined whether the gunman intended to injure Mr. Lien or settle a dispute with the candidate.
In any case, Tsai Ing-wen, head of the DPP, argues that the shooting influenced the election, suspicion falls on the DPP and leads voters towards the KMT.
Perhaps the only big winner of the campaign was China.
It was remarkable how the question of the mainland itself remained in the background.
Instead, the candidates struggled over plans for state housing and job creation.
Taiwan usually enjoys its de facto independence and hates China's military threats.
So the KMT tends to avoid ties to the government in Beijing.
But this time, the DPP also refrained from arousing anti-Chinese attitudes.
It is a response to reality and the realization that Chinese trade is crucial to Taiwan's economic survival.
President Ma, for his part, has confirmed that China's policy is acceptable to most of Taiwan.
The government in Beijing can be expected to continue commercial bribery, along with its strategy to lure Taiwan back into the fold.
China wasted no time in sending a negotiator to Taipei to arrange a summit on investment protection and medical cooperation.
I'm sure they'd also like to see political integration, but first and for all.
It will be better to wait for that after the 2012 presidential election.
In any case, the DPP has discovered itself.
Two years ago, she was on the wrong level: her former leader, Chen Shui-bian, was sent to prison on corruption charges.
The president in 2000-08 was a firebrand and a supporter of clear independence.
But under Ms Tsai's leadership, a new generation has evolved that is moderate and the DPP is working hard to attract experts and young people.
Ms Tsai was called as the DPP's candidate for president, such as Suu Tseng-chang, who held office under Mr Chen.
Their party is now doing everything it can to show that they can also work with Beijing.
Ms Tsai has published plans for research institutes that serve as a focal point between the DPP and China, provided that their negotiations can take place without prior conditions.
Ms Tsai is speaking to the Taiwanese public that her party represents a "credible alternative" to Mr Ma's hasty approach to China.
Mr. Chen seems angered by this shift.
In a statement issued from his cell, he said DPP candidates would be better off if they insisted that Taiwan was an independent country.
He even ordered Mr. Su, a pragmatist, not to run for president.
But even without Mr. Chen's intervention, the DPP will struggle to choose between potential candidates.
Kmt is entitled to search for its own people.
Mr Ma's assessments were poor, despite the rapid pace of economic growth; KMT candidates didn't want to go on the campaign trail with him.
Its unpopularity seems to be based primarily on unemployment and the widening gap between rich and poor.
A KMT spokesman says it will reorganise its cabinet, as well as local branches.
Strongly enforced proposals to support Taiwan for friendly relations are limited.
At the same time, most Taiwanese citizens consider economic integration with China inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent publicist, "the point from which there is no return has passed."
Grammy Nominations: Jazz Singer Esperanza Spalding Surprises in Best New Artist Category
Speaking at the request of the president and people inevitably need to notice.
Esperanza Spalding, the 26-year-old jazz bassist and singer chosen by President Obama to perform at the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize ceremony, is billed as one of the surprises of this year's Grammy Awards with a nomination in the best new artist category.
Since Spalding has been a celebrated figure on the jazz scene since her album "Esperanza" was released in 2008, the nomination came a little late, but it's in line with Grammy rules that an artist can't release more than three albums before "the artist's public identity is established."
Her ambitious 2010 album, "Chamber Music Society," certainly took a step forward, and thanks to her carefree vocal style and nimble hands with pop, funk and Latin influences, we can talk about Spalding as a success that Norah Jones, the closest equivalent to a Grammy voter in 2003, has seen looking for a similar jazz work in this category in recent years.
Elsewhere, Grammy judges rightly appreciate Vijay Iyer Trio's album "Historicity" in the instrumental album category, an exciting, refreshing ride on the album that was a hot favorite last year.
Iyer will compete against the album of experienced saxophonist James Moody "Moody 4B" and keyboardist John Beasley's "Positoote."
Trombone Shorty, a hoarse favorite from New Orleans and a frequent guest on HBO's "Treme," was honored in the current jazz category, which is otherwise in favor of stanley clark, john mclaughlin and jeff lorber albums.
Darcy James Argue's Secret Society, with knowledge of steampunk, gained some well-deserved recognition in the big ensemble category, with the chamber jazz Childs Ensemble and the ever-daring Dave Holland in competition, whose live album with the octate "Pathways" created a beautiful example of how a bassist can have a free hand as a bandleader.
Grammy Awards nominations: Michael Daugherty, Steve Mackey lead in classical music category
Classical music nominations have a wide range of musicians and composers from around the world at the 53rd Annual Grammy Awards.
Michael Daugherty and his "Deus Ex Machina" for piano and orchestra, with five points, and Steve Mackey with his album "Dreamhouse", an eclectic orchestral work, lead the nomination with three points.
Among the southern California nominees were Estonian composer Arvo Pärt and his Symphony No. 4 "Los Angeles," a work that was commissioned through the Los Angeles Philharmonic and debuted at Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
L.A.-based composer Avner Dorman and his Mandolin Concerto also have a shot at an award.
Nominations in classical music are divided into 13 categories, which include orchestral, opera, choral and solo recordings.
The category for classical music producer of the year has five nominees: Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
Bruckner and his Symphonies Nos. 3 and 4 by the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra received nominations for the classical album; Daugherty and his "Deus Ex Machina" and metropolis symphony by the Nashville Symphony Orchestra; Steven Mackey and his "Dreamhouse" from the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; "Sacrificium - the Art of the Castrati" featuring various artists; and Verdi's "Requiem" by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Chorus.
As for the category of opera, the nominees are Berg and "Lulu" by the Orchestra of the Royal Opera House; Adolf Hasse and "Marc Antonio e Cleopatra" by Ars Lyrica Houston; Kaija Saariaho and "L'Amour de Loin" by Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin; Rodion Shchedrin and "The Enchanted Wanderer" by orchestra and chorus of the Mariinsky Theatre; and Arthur Sullivan and "Ivanhoe" from the BBC National Orchestra of Wales.
Composers nominated for Grammys for contemporary compositions include Pärt for Symphony No. 4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina," Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionatamente Plus," Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti," and Shchedrin for "The Enchanted Wanderer."
Pärt's Symphony No. 4 premiered at Disney Hall in January 2009 for a performance recorded by the L.A. Philharmonic under the baton of Esa-Pekka Salonen.
The approximately 30-minute episode is called "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to former oil tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who is imprisoned in Russia.
Dorman and "Mandolin Concerto" were nominated for instrumental performances by a soloist with an orchestra.
The L.A. composer said he wrote a 15-minute work specifically for mandolin artist Avi Avital, who performed at a concert with the Metropolis Ensemble, based in New York.
"I wrote it using tones from the Middle East and many North African rhythms," Dorman said in a telephone interview.
Conductor Pierre Boulez, 85, received a nomination in the category for orchestral performance, for leading the Chicago Symphony in recording Stravinsky's work.
Instrumental soloists who received nominations include pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin; organist Paul Jacobs; violinist Julia Fischer; and harpist Sarah Schuster Ericsson.
This year's nominees included only women: Anne Sofia Von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucia Duchon, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the classic transition category, soprano Jessye Norman received a nomination for her recording "Roots - My Life, My Song."
Planned mosque in Temecula receives planning commission approval
A planned mosque in Temecula received unanimous support from the local planning commission after more than five hours of often passionate public testimony.
Critics attacked the project as promoting terrorism and leading to trade suspensions.
However, jurors ruled Wednesday night that the new religious center complies with local laws and will be aesthetically impressive.
"A lot of good people came to support this project - Christians, Jews, you name it," Hadi Nael, president of the Temecula Valley Islamic Center, said Thursday morning.
"I'm very proud of it as an American citizen."
"It means that justice always prevails."
"The opposition is minimal," he added.
"Those who oppose it only shout loudly."
"We have really good people in our valley."
The meeting began at 6 p.m. and lasted almost until midnight, when most of the time it took up discussions with people who were for or against the center. These votes were evenly distributed, press-enterprise reports.
The discussion continued on the newspaper's website.
"America doesn't exist anymore," one comment appeared.
"We are planet of the apes with the Statue of Liberty sunk into the sand."
"America has fallen."
Planned Islamic Centers has also sparked protests in other parts of the country, including near Ground Zero, the site of the September 11, 2001, tragedy that killed terrorists in New York City.
In Temecula Valley, Imam Mahmoud Harmoush condemned the violence.
His religious community of about 135 families had been living in Riverside County for years without incident, but he wanted a larger and more suitable space than the storage space he had been living in with the filter system manufacturer.
The new 24,943-square-foot Mosque in Mediterranean architecture will also have two minarets and will grow to 43 feet.
It should occupy a 4.32-acre site on Nicolas Road, about two miles east of Chaparral High School.
Opponents can still appeal the project to the city council.
Arsenic-resistant microbes increase the possibility of new life types on Earth or elsewhere
The discovery of a strange bacterium that can use arsenic as one of its nutrients expands the space for searching for new life forms on Earth and possibly beyond.
Researchers have discovered an unusual bacterium here on Earth, and they say it's a sign that life has possibilities that stand outside the main elements that have been considered and fundamental until now.
"This organism has a dual ability."
"It can grow either because of phosphorus or arsenic."
"This fact is very strange, but it is not evidence that it is some form of truly 'extraterrestrial' life," commented Paul C.W. Davies of Arizona State University, co-author of the report, which appeared Thursday in the online edition of the journal Science.
For a long time, six main elements were considered necessary for life - carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sieera.
However, scientists have found that bacteria discovered in Mono Lake, California, are able to continue to grow after phosphorus is replaced with arsenic.
"You start to wonder what else is possible," said Ariel D. Anbar of Arizona State University, co-author of the report.
This finding is important for finding life beyond Earth, because researchers must be able to recognize life and know what life can look like, Anbar said.
The study focuses on microbes found on Earth.
However, a report on the news, released to discuss it, which did not reveal details of the find, sparked widespread speculation online that the report reveals the discovery of extraterrestrial life.
This is not the case.
The discovery "shows that other planetary organisms may be able to harness other elements that drive biochemistry, and that a set of elements that we consider 'standard' may not be so absolutely necessary for life," explained Charles Cockell, a professor at the Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute, Open University, in Milton Keynes, United Kingdom.
Cockell wasn't part of the research team.
"This work is unusual because it shows the replacement of one element with another in basic biochemistry and biochemical structure," Cockell added.
It wasn't a random find.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of NASA's Astrobiology Institute, who led the study, focused on Mono Lake because it exhibits high levels of arsenic.
Arsenic and phosphorus are chemically very similar elements, so she considered that a microbe that is exposed to both elements may be able to replace one after another.
"Arsenic is poisonous mainly because its chemical behavior is very similar to phosphorus."
"As a result, organisms can very difficult to separate these elements from each other."
"However, arsenic is so different that, like phosphorus, it does not work. When it gets into the body, it starts working in biochemical processes," Anbar explained.
Scientists collect bacteria known as GFAJ-1 and expose them to increasing concentrations of arsenic, which bacteria are able to adapt to and grow.
Microbes grow better under phosphorus, but since they can also survive with arsenic replacement, the possibility increases that a life form that uses arsenic may appear naturally, either elsewhere on Earth or on another planet or moon where arsenic is more common.
Jamie S. Foster, an assistant professor of microbiology at the University of Florida, said the idea of arsenic that could be replaced by phosphorus is not new, but there has never been an example to prove it.
Arsenic was more common in earlier times on Earth, she said, so scientists speculated that it may have been used by earlier life forms.
"This suggests that there may have been other ways to create life, not just the way it was created in the early Earth period," said Foster, who was not part of Wolfe-Simon's research team.
The research was supported by NASA, the Department of Energy and the National Institutes of Health
The remaining stolen dogs were found in Compton
The remaining two of the four show dogs that were stolen from the Bellflower Motel were found. The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Office announced thursday.
Four show dogs - two akitas and a Welsh pembroke corgis - disappeared Tuesday when someone stole a 2006 Chevrolet Express van they were staying at the Bellflower 6 Motel, authorities said.
Two dogs were discovered Wednesday afternoon and the other two dogs were discovered late Wednesday night, said Steve Whitmore, a spokesman for the Los Angeles County Police Department.
"The good news is the dogs are fine," Whitmore said.
"They're in good shape."
"They have been handed over to their rightful owners."
Whitmore refused to say exactly where the dogs were found, what location, nor did he share detailed information regarding their discovery.
"The investigation is still ongoing."
"We don't want to talk about it," Whitmore said.
"We follow the rules."
The dog owners, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, could not be reached for comment on the case.
They were very happy when their two akitas were found at a shelter in Downey on Wednesday afternoon.
Sheriff's deputies found a bathtub and two dogs separately in Compton.
Akita Trace, Trace's 3-year-old dog and Didi, a 10-month-old female, were unharmed, authorities said.
But Bunny and Peter, the Welsh Corgi Pembroke Rickard and Peek breeds who had planned to participate in regional competitions this week on behalf of their Japanese owners, remained undiscovery until their discovery late Wednesday.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, are in town this weekend to participate in the AKC/Eukanuba National Championship in Long Beach, where they planned to show Trace.
The other dogs were to compete in other competitions planned in the days before the AKC/Eukanuba show, Peek told The Times on Wednesday.
Southern California is just one stop on the couple's nearly month-long dog show travel.
On Monday night, Peek and Rickard checked into a motel.
They often sleep in motels and park their car in front of the room window.
They also took with them three dogs - a boxer puppy, a Parson Russell terrier and a Brittany hound - who stayed with them in a motel room.
Akita and Pembroke Welsh left the corgis in the car, where it was supposed to be cooler.
They opened the windows a little so the dogs had enough fresh air in the car.
Peek and Rickard reported the car stolen at 6:00 a.m. on Tuesday.
Peek said he'd offer a reward to anyone who led them to the missing dogs. Dogs have microchips implanted to identify them.
On Thursday, it was unclear whether prizes would be awarded.
Lion ready to roar again as MGM restructuring gets final approval from court
After 18 months of upheaval and uncertainty, MGM has finally been given the green light to start over.
A Federal Insolvency Judge in New York on Thursday officially blessed creditors' "prepackaged" plan to settle about $5 billion in debt, clearing the way for an 86-year-old entertainment company that focuses on producing and producing movies and TV shows.
Thursday's decree that the plan meets the requirements of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code does not leave MGM with any legal hurdles to restart Spyglass Entertainment founders Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, who will become the main executives of the slimmed-down studio.
The number of employees will fall to about 320 from the original more than 400.
MGM will not emerge abruptly from Chapter 11 until JPMorgan Chase agrees on planned financial resources allowing a $500 million loan to finance MGM's new operations and productions.
It is now a merger with an investment bank that itself needs $75 million, and funding is expected around mid-December.
The studio's restructuring process began in May 2009, when investment bank Moelis &Co. was hired to advise management on how to resolve its finances, as management struggled to afford $300 million in interest payments a year.
That August, Chairman Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, enron's former CEO and turnaround expert known for his work for Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelis and Cooper's attempts to resolve MGM's financial problems and the studio's 140 creditors took much longer than expected.
After several months of discussions, the parties agreed to put the company up for sale at the end of 2009.
Although the auction attracted several bidders, none of them were willing to pay the $2 billion plus funds demanded by creditors.
In the spring of this year, everything was back on the drawing board and the MGM team began working on a restructuring plan. After months of discussion and internal disagreements, the plan was finally approved by creditors at the end of October.
When MGM officially comes out of bankruptcy in the coming weeks, Moelis and Cooper's companies will receive multimillion-dollar bonuses for their work.
Moelis &Co., which has already received $1.2 million, will receive a payment of $9.5 million.
Cooper's companies, which charge $375,000 a month for their services that run the company, will receive a success fee of $4 million.
Barber and Birnbaum plan to resume production at MGM, which released only one film this year, and put together a proposal for seven or eight films to be released in early 2012.
They also plan to participate in the financing of two films based on the book "The Hobbit", together with Warner Bros.
The studio needs to negotiate a special loan of between $265 million and $275 million to finance its share of the two films, which will be directed by Peter Jackson.
Investor Carl Icahn, who owns about 18% of MGM's debt, was looking for the possibility of merging the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, in which he is the largest shareholder.
However, recent negotiations between the two companies have not result in an agreement.
Tech toys to keep your gift budget in balance
This year's leading candidate is the most amazing iPad toy, followed by a video game system. In both cases, however, this is a significant intervention in the gift budget.
Consider that for the price of one iPad, you can buy five BMX bikes for $99, and one Kinect game costs the same as 10 beaded jump ropes or approximately 48 Cups of Play-Doh.
But there is a way to keep your gift budget in balance.
I recently visited three national toy retailers - Wal-Mart, Toys "R" Us and BJ's Wholesale Club - and watched what electronic toys I could buy for less than $80.
It was immediately clear that Moore's law was working; this year's technological toys have much more energy, at the same prices, if not slightly lower, compared to previous years.
While relatively fewer new toys with associated sites have appeared, the two most famous toys of this type, Webkinz and Club Penguin, offer more.
The number of toys with button batteries is increasing, as well as toys with rechargeable batteries.
Here are some recommendations.
(All prices listed are from Toys "R" Us, except in cases otherwise marked.)
Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13, from 3 years old) are stuffed animals that sing when you squeeze their tummy.
With one press, the animal emits a tone, and the other press begins to create a song.
If you buy more than one, they will sing together and harmoniously.
Note: Once you start squeezing, you can't stop.
The best choice in the combination of singing and dancing is Dance Star Mickey (Fisher-Price, $60, from 2 years old)
Last year, I rented a 14-inch animatrick doll on Elmo Live technology that can play Simon Says and can also walk for a month thanks to its innovative folding leg with wheel locking.
Children test mickey dance instructor's toy, although their parents complain about the lack of volume control.
If you're an 80s child, you might remember Alphie, one of the first computer educational toys.
He's back, (Hasbro/Playskool, $40, for kids 3 and up), with a backpack full of quiz cards designed to turn driving into fun with a self-correcting, witty workbook.
If you're squinting at a smartphone for your child, here are three independent alternatives.
VTech's MobiGo ($60, for children 3 to 8 years old) is the cheapest option with simple use, with a qwerty keyboard, although games don't have as effective learning as Leapster Explorer ($70, for kids 3 to 12 years old), leapster's first significant change from Leapster, with a newer and brighter display.
No version is compatible with older drive.
Fisher-Price's iXL ($90, for children 3 to 7 years old) uses iTunes-like to introduce games and e-books and has an SD card slot that allows you to view family photos.
Finally, Scrabble Flash ($30, Hasbro, for children from 8 years old) is a set of five bricks that are no larger than a matchbox, each with an LED display.
The goal is to create words by placing dice in a row before time runs out; it's great for competing in improvised word creation.
More and more toys have at least some kind of online connection.
Two Toys Webkinz and Club Penguin were represented to the highest extent in toy stores.
If you want to buy your child an online toy from Club Penguin, you can choose, for example, Disney Club Penguin 2" Mix 'N Match Figure Pack, $5, for children from 6 to 12 years old), which includes a coin with a hidden code.
When you activate the code online, your child will receive enough credits in the Club Penguin Store for any two items.
This could include roller skates or puffle animal.
Slightly larger than the brissue of your toothbrush is the Hexbug Nano ($10, for children from 5 years old), the latest in a line of microrobots for a button battery.
The beetle moves quickly on 12 vibrating silicone legs in random direction.
It's fun when you make a maze out of dice and see if he can find a way out.
It's also very durable.

Introducing more police control in China
As the city's military instructor, Tang Shenbin walked around the square, strictly following his orders and giving orders in a low-set position with military authority.
He wanted female members - China's burly city-order enforcers, feared and despised for their crackdowns and penchant for violence - to convey a certain impression on a crowd of bystanders.
"Stand up straight!"
"Hurry up!"
Show them, she whispers quietly, "what pretty girls look like!"
Four very young girls in white gloves and the same olive coats and trousers stood to attention.
Four pairs of black shoes are sorted by ruler.
The four headgear fits perfectly on the hair, which is perfectly tied with blue and white ribbons.
"Personally, I think they look mediocre," Mr. Tang said dismissively.
"The models are nice."
More than one government has tried to revive the image of city supervisors in China.
One city ordered the new conscripts to have a college degree.
Guangdong Province has changed its grey-green uniforms to supposedly more attractive blue.
Wuhan in central China replaced the fixed looks with heavy armament: in 2009, a report said that 50 officers had surrounded the snack cart and stared at the owner until the door-to-door salesman packed up and drove off after half an hour.
Xindu, a city district of 680,000 people in Chengdu, chose surgery as the main image.
Since 2003, the district has added 13 women to its city police force, who have been selected specifically based on their appearance, co-ability and young age.
The aim is to show, in addition to the rough side of the police, also a more beautiful, feminine side.
Unfortunately, Scarlett Johansson herself would struggle to get into china's secret urban groups.
Critics would argue for good reason.
Unlike the police, these officers are only allowed to enforce city ordinances, impose fines and other administrative penalties.
But chinese media routinely capture a different reality.
In January 2008, police inspectors from Hubei province bludgegimed an unincompeent spectator to death after he used his cellphone to film them taking action in a protest against the landfill.
Last year, police training took place in Beijing, the manual for this training was stolen and posted on the Internet. The manual described, among other things, how to effectively beat up the perpetrator with no signs of blood.
This year, a door-to-door melon trader in Shanghai got into a fight with five police officers and suffered a left brain injury.
One video game full of violence, which can be downloaded online, shows Chinese police officers attacking street vendors.
"Chengguan scared the government," China Daily, the national edition, lamented last year after another discussion about tactics.
The paper said "really thorough cleansing."
Skeptics say such an approach is not enough.
After the district advertised its interest in eight new female policewomen in October, The Beijing Evening News editorial addressed the question of whether women have real responsibilities or are merely distractions.
The answer seems to be a little bit of both.
The district requested female applicants between the ages of 18 and 22 with good physique and "five facial features in the right proportions."
Adeptkas should have a height higher than the diameter - that is, more than 1.6 meters.
Retirement at the age of 26 is mandatory.
Officials say the work is mentally too demanding for women over 25.
"Their image is an important thing," one unnamed police officer said on Rednet.com, as if on a government website.
"Candidates must first demonstrate external qualities, which are then determined by others, including height, weight, facial features, etc."
Then comes the nature and "inner qualities".
Women are like flower vases, he said, adding, "In addition to being vases, they will also have other responsibilities."
Zheng Lihua, deputy director of the district's management, disagrees with this description.
But he did point out that height requirements are also common in China for other jobs, both sexes.
As well as the requirement for proportional facial features.
Which means that the issue of good appearance is the subject of debate among the Chinese.
Disability or mutilation will certainly not apply.
"He can't allow a lame or hunchbacked man to serve with us," Mr. Zheng said.
"His image wouldn't be good."
Liu Yi, who is on patrol in Baoguang Square near the monastery, is 22 years old, with apple-like faces and a gently shaped mouth.
She doesn't think the emphasis on her appearance could be sexist, she said.
"Do you think I look sexy in this uniform?" she asked with an ironic look.
Her douche co-worker, 21-year-old Xu Yang, says,"Our job is to represent the image of the city."
They have no objection to their limited performance, they said, because their career ambitions are greater than just driving traders into the aisles where they can carry out their activities.
Every morning, the group faces more than 10 marketers running around on foot or on bicycles trying to sell as many dumplings and bowls of tofu as possible before being banished.
"Mr. Wang, you must leave."
"We've told you many times!" said Ms. Xu, as the marketer began to run, and for a time he left his bike with a noodle cart.
Police officers describe their duties as more monotonous than enending.
"Every day is basically the same thing," said Huang Jing, 20, who studies marketing on her day off.
"Great routine."
One reason is that female policewomen do not have the authority of their male counterparts to confiscate goods from sellers.
They can only threaten to report the fact to their male supervisors.
The tendency is then to protect them from sudden public displays of hostility against the official apparatus, which are common throughout China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in Kunming, the capital of Yunnan Province, rebelled after false rumors spread that police had killed the vendors.
More than ten police officers or police officers were injured at night; 14 government vehicles were overturned or set on fire.
So far, Xindu has escaped such violence.
But peace can hardly be guaranteed.
Just two blocks from the quiet Baoguang Square, where police were on patrol that morning, more than 50 people gathered on a street corner.
Officers confiscated a motorcycle that was being repaired on the sidewalk instead of inside the store, as required by regulations.
The bike owner could cry all he wanted.
A 15-minute stand-off in front of police officers, looking angry, elbowing vehicles and quickly gone with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, a coordinator adching with the men's group, stayed behind, his white badge turned to hide his name.
Like female policewomen, the coordinators are men over 40 who already have only an auxiliary role.
Unlike them, they are not educated in image maintenance and smoothing.
"Sometimes we fight verbally."
"Sometimes we fight physically," Mr. Li said matter-of-thingly.
"It's usually the public who start."
Prosecutors won't charge Senator Ensign
Justice Department prosecutors cleared Senator John Ensign of criminal charges related to his affair with a former campaign aide and his efforts to secure the lobby, the senator's lawyers announced Wednesday.
The decision ends the most serious legal threat mr. Ensign, a Nevada Republican, faced and who, until the scandal, was considered a possible Republican presidential candidate for 2012. His affair made national headlines and damaged his career.
Mr Ensign's office said it was "certainly pleased" with the decision, which followed almost a year of investigation.
The senator could still face disciplinary action before the Senate Ethics Committee.
Mr. Ensign's lawyers said that the Justice Department "has informed us that Senator Ensign will no longer be the target of an investigation and that there is no plan to press further charges against him in this matter."
The Justice Department declined to comment on the case.
The decision came as a surprise to many ethics lawyers outside the Justice Department, who argued that there was strong evidence that Mr. Ensign was preparing to violate a ban on federal lobbying.
Interviews, emails and other documents published in the New York Times in October 2009 stated that Mr. Ensign helped Douglas Hampton, one of his assistants, secure a lucrative lobby to keep Mr. Hampton and his wife, Cynthia, quiet about the senator's affair with her.
Mrs. Hampton once worked as a treasurer in the Ensign campaign.
Mr. Ensign contacted a number of political backers to find work for Mr. Hampton and support their views after Mr. Hampton was hired to lobby for them, according to documents and interviews.
Since Hampton was until recently Mr. Ensign's assistant, he was disquanified from lobbying his former employer or the Senate for a year.
Ethics experts say the unusual settlement between Mr. Ensign and Mr. Hampton, who were friends before the affair, appeared in violation of the lobbying ban.
The evidence that was released "has shown that this is a clear case of preparation for a violation of the law," said Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who specializes in defending clients who are under investigation by the government.
While Justice Department officials refused to explain the reasons for senator Ensign's decision, Mr. Brand and other ethics lawyers said the department was cautious about political lawsuits after a large number of setbacks, including last year's decision to suspend charges against former Senator Ted Stevens amid allegations of misconduct by the state's attorney's office.
Federal prosecutors "clearly hid their weapons," said Melanie Sloan, executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a advocacy group that has filed several complaints against Mr. Ensign in the case.
"It basically shows that high-ranking government officials are not covered by the law," she added.
Paul Coggins, Mr. Ensign's lead attorney, said in an interview that he received a call from the Justice Department's public prosecutor on Monday and then the next day, and told him that the department had found no charges against his client.
Mr. Ensign's defense team is cooperating with prosecutors in an effort to convince them that the senator, as his office reiterated in a statement on Wednesday, "acted lawfully."
Mr. Coggins refused to specify the legal arguments he had given to prosecutors.
"I'm not comfortable recounting the details of my discussions with the Justice Department, other than that we think they made the right decision," he said.
Last month, the Federal Election Commission decided to halt an investigation into a separate complaint in which an ethics group filed allegations that Ensign Hampton's parents' $96,000 payment to the Hamptons violated federal election law.
The Electoral Commission said it did not have enough evidence to prove that the money meant nothing but a donation.
One company for which Mr. Ensign helped Mr. Hampton find a lobbying job was NV Energy, a major Nevada company that had long supported the senator.
One email from December 2008 showed that after Mr. Hampton started working as a lobbyist at the company, Mr. Ensign's chief of staff - John Lopez - communicated with Mr. Hampton and told him that he had "pounded" the Department of the Interior on the subject under discussion.
Mr. Ensign also attended a luncheon with Mr. Hampton and another Nevada client, Allegiant Air, and called on the Transportation Secretary to set up a meeting on behalf of the airline after hiring Mr. Hampton for lobbying work.
When news of the affair first came to light last year, Mr. Ensign apologized to his constituents and resigned as the fourth Republican leader in the Senate.
After months of stagnation, Mr. Ensign told reporters two weeks ago that he planned to participate in a third term in the Senate.
In a statement that Mr. Ensign is no longer the target of a criminal investigation, his spokeswoman Jennifer Cooper said the senator hopes the Ethics Committee will quickly follow the Justice Department's lead and end the investigation.
"Senator Ensign looks forward to continuing his hard work on behalf of the People of Nevada," she said.
Cheshire village appeal turns to Twitter
Half a dozen of them wrote in the courtroom.
Minute by minute, they sent messages about the gruesome testimony via Twitter.
Finally, the defense says that more than 140,000 Twitter messages dealt with raping and tying children to beds in a house that was set on fire.
On Thursday, the trial of Steven J. Hayes, who was convicted of killing three Cheshire, Connecticut, family members, was scheduled to take place, and an official conclusion was to be held with the death penalty, which the jury voted for.
But Mr. Hayes' lawyers have already filed appeals with applications and arguments that would likely keep the court occupied for years.
One of the most provocative is that intensive reporting of the process - including the widespread use of Twitter by the main reporters - created a "circus atmosphere," and this widespread, immediate leaking of information with outrageous details then led the jury to decide in terms of influencing public opinion.
That claim could force judges to consider whether to apply for new rules in the courtroom with the advent of new technologies.
"As I experienced at this trial, I think there is a real danger that the inclusion of new technologies in the courtroom affects the rights of fair trial for individuals," said Thomas J. Ullmann, Mr. Hayes's lead defense attorney.
The trial's judge, Jon C. Blue, briefly rejected the claims regarding last week's ruling, saying that the media was "carefully controlled" and that there was no evidence to indicate that the jury acted under the influence of the public.
But this is probably not the last word in this case.
For decades, courts have recognized that reporting notorious cases can raise questions about the fairness of the trial.
In a 1966 court order, the United States Supreme Court overturned the conviction of Cleveland chiropractor Dr. Sam Sheppard for the murder of his wife, saying in his ruling that the Sheppard v. Maxwell case was a "carnival atmosphere" in the media trial.
Some believe that this crime was the inspiration for the TV show and the film "The Fugitive".
Some lawyers said the appeals courts that reviewed Hayes' ruling half a century later might be surprised by the argument that new rules that determine how to communicate from courtrooms might be necessary, which was unimaginable in Dr. Sheppard's case.
"There is general cause for concern about the impact of new media" in high-profile cases, said John J. Donohue III, a professor at Stanford Law School who studied the death penalty in Connecticut and wrote a report that said it was carried out arbitrarily.
Professor Donohue said some judges may be intrigued by the idea that restricting immediate communication from courtrooms can make the process fairer.
The Twitter case is just one of many outlined by Mr Hayes' lawyers, who would be able to argue for years to delay the execution of the sentence.
Defense attorneys also argue, for example, that Mr. Hayes' case may be biased when Judge Blue refused to allow him to test the reactions of potential jurors by showing them gruesome criminal photographs when selecting a jury.
Some of the jurors said they were horrified by the photos of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48, and her daughters Hayley, 17, and Michael, 11.
Defense attorneys say they will also reject the constitutionality of the death penalty, claiming that the judge wrongly removed a juror who was critical of prosecutors and that his decision improperly put more pressure on the verdict and directed the jury to think over the weekend.
The jurors weren't separated.
But their arguments about the impact of the scope of the process can attract the most interest.
They cited objections to a verdict filed last month that the case dominated news in Connecticut and was discussed during the election campaign by gubernatorial candidates and the United States Senate.
They argued that the media was constantly insuing the flames of emotion in the case.
"The daily rush of media, cameras, and reporters outside the courthouse," the lawyer wrote, "was something that has never been seen before here in New Haven, and may also be a national rarity."
Their focus on Twitter's actions is controversial.
In interviews, some journalists argued that the immediate reporting was more outrageous than the reports reported later, and from their point of view, the judicial police should manage the scope of other trials.
But some lawyers have called for appeals courts with frequently used arguments that social and technological changes require court adaptation.
Mr. Hayes' lawyers are seeking this right.
In their archives, they referred to the Supreme Court's 1966 decision in Dr. Sheppard's ruling because of the breadth of the trial and wanted to clarify the requirement that new media require new rules.
"This case," they wrote, "represents the case of Sheppard v. Maxwell of the 21st century."
Can courtesy bridge the gap?
After a campaign that was notable for its insults and negativity, a small amount of courtesy appeared in Washington this week.
Is this the first swallow of genuine bipartisan cooperation, or is it just an irrigation moment before a quick return to the party's struggle in the capital?
Tuesday's meeting between President Obama and house leaders made no major discoveries on the major issues that must be discussed during the session.
In any case, it was a polite discussion about the differences of opinion between the two parties, as well as defining their shared responsibilities, rather than another empty episode of partisan struggle.
Wednesday's public session of the president's deficit committee was also civilized, despite the political differences that remain between the members.
It seems clear that close cooperation over several months has built mutual respect that transcends the ideological divide that still divides members.
And it's kind of hard to say that a new era of cooperation has begun.
Both sides are now on probation - probing each other for signs of collegiality and compromise, trying to assess the limits of public opinion and voter patience for a renewed party war.
That is why Tuesday's meeting and its later evaluation by the participants were carried out with a minimum of demands or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too wide and too deep to suggest a rapid change in the circumstances that have been in place for the past two years.
Whether it's the issue of taxes, spending, health care, or rights, both sides are miles away.
However, Washington prepared the November elections at least quickly.
"It's not a question of whether regulatory issues have changed," said Pete Wehner, Bush's administrator, now at the Ethics and Public Policy Center.
"These are inevitable after the election.
The election stirred up the emotions of the party, and then they died down.
It's all right."
On several issues, especially those to be discussed in the session, Republicans and Democrats have little chance of finding a solution.
Bush's tax cut expired at the end of the year, and no one thinks it's favorable.
Both sides want to find a way to protect some or all of them, permanently or temporarily.
Like the likely compromise on unemployment benefits, only because Republicans cannot watch them support a tax cut for the wealthy while denying unemployment benefits to the unemployed.
After tuesday's White House meeting, there is already more optimism about a possible agreement on these issues, along with the ratification of the new inaugural treaty.
But William Galston of the Brookings Institution points out that successful cooperation on fundamental issues will not necessarily lead to a bipartisan relationship when the 112th Congress convenes for January.
Rather, a period of disagreement, or even inevitable, is likely, he said.
"After the things that have to be done are done, psychology returns to one of the confrontations in a short perspective," he said.
Wehner also expressed skepticism - which is largely widespread - that courtesy will lead to real cooperation.
"I look at everything going on between now and 2012 as a shadow box, when the main events will take place in 2012," he said.
The reasons are largely related to the establishment of a new Republican majority in the White House and the tea party voters who helped create it.
Republican leaders now face the danger of exaggeration, knowing that they must act on their promises and must cut government spending and repeal the new health care law.
These lines are clear in initial responses to deficit recommendations, which include reforming the tax code and raising some taxes, raising the retirement age, and reducing spending.
Joint chairmen Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have taken on one of the toughest tasks in Washington and are, in their view, to put the deficit issue under pressure on the public agenda in ways that cannot be ignored.
But they need 14 votes in an 18-member committee to present their plan as an official recommendation, and they have struggled to get as close to that number as possible.
The greatest resistance is among the elected officials on the jury, who suggest that, on financial issues, at least today, we have little foundation or will for compromise.
Galston predicts two phases in the battles between the White House and house Republicans.
The first will begin next year in the form of partisan conflicts, with Republicans inviting Obama to address budgets, taxes, and health care, followed by a period of greater partisan cooperation.
What's going to cause the shift?
public opinion.
There is a lot of evidence that, despite partisanness at the last election, most Americans still want to see two parties working together.
If it could be headed for a stalemate, as it was in 1995, then both sides will be watching the public's reactions very closely.
Anyone at risk of a reduction in votes is likely to change course and seek a compromise.
That can be an optimistic view.
Partisans and receding are now larger than they were in the mid-1990s, and it turns out that a larger ideological divide has been created between Obama and house Republicans than was the case with Republicans and Bill Clinton.
At the same time, activists on both sides see 2010 as a prelue to more important elections in 2012.
Based on this reality, the courtesy that emerged this week would be welcomed by many Americans.
But it will take a lot of efforts on both sides to find common ground on the issues that still divide them.
Leaked US document portrays Moscow as a haven for corruption
The city's management is in the hands of the "kleptocradia" and continues with some of the bribes and protection bribes that come on the way to the Kremlin, the U.S. Embassy in Russia said in a February statement.
Both the police and the Federal Security Service largely hold protective wings to help explain the high cost of living in Moscow.
They collect money not only from lawful trades, but also from organized criminal groups.
Every layer of bureaucracy - which Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has called the "verticals of the office" - takes its own when money starts to move up the ladder.
The footage, which was sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle, was posted via WikiLeaks on their website on Wednesday.
The record shall be based on sources whose names have been redacted.
The recording was written while Yuri Luzhkov was still mayor and accuses him of a large part in corruption.
He was removed by President Dmitry Medvedev in October, but since then we can only see minimal changes in cleansing.
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena Baturina, who owns a prominent design firm, have consistently denied allegations of corruption for many years, winning several perjury lawsuits for such allegations.
In September, he said on a Russian television station, when asked about proven evidence of corruption: "It's crazy, it's filth, it's crap."
Russians believe with absolute conviction that if their society is corrupt, it will turn out to be a vote.
However, it is unusual to see such details being said in such a way, in an embassy report, and it is also unheard of for diplomats from foreign countries to do so.
"The government of the city of Moscow and its association with the criminal elements have led some to call it 'dysfunctional,' confirming that the government operates more like a kleptocraci than a government," the report says.
"Criminal elements enjoy the so-called 'krysha' (a term from the world of crime and mafia, which literally means 'roof' or protection) provided by the police, the Federal Security Service, the Federal Security Service (FSB), the Ministry of the Interior and the Prosecutor's Office, as well as everywhere in the government bureaucracy of the city of Moscow.
"Analysts have identified a three-stage structure in moscow's criminal world."
"Luzhkov is at the very top."
"The Federal Security Service, the Ministry of the Interior and the militia are in second degree."
"Finally, ordinary criminals and corrupt inspectors are at the lowest level."
"It's an ineffective system in which criminal groups fill in the blanks in some areas because the city doesn't provide some services."
The report says the FSB is taking money from the biggest companies and the police are targeting smaller businesses.
One source said, "Business owners in Moscow realize that it is better to get protection from the FSB or the Ministry of the Interior (rather than from organized criminal groups), since they not only have more weapons, resources and power than criminal groups, but are also protected by law."
"For this reason, protection from criminal gangs is no longer so popular."
The record says that while the withdrawal is complex, the protection itself may already be in trouble; even those who pay can sometimes be arrested.
For those who do not pay fast enough, their business closes under various pretexts.
Medvedev has spoken several times about fighting corruption, but admitted that he has made little progress.
The embassy report speaks of men taking suitcases, presumably packed with cash, into the Kremlin itself.
"Medvedev must rely on bureaucrats to fight corruption," Georgy Satarov, director of the Moscow Research Team Indem, said in a recent interview.
"But it's part of this bureaucracy."
"It is not part of the political class, because there are no more political classes in Russia."
Without politicians, without opposition, without a separation of powers, corruption is inevitable, he said.
Indem estimates that corruption costs Russia more than $300 billion a year nationwide.
The country ranks 154th in a recent survey on global perceptions of corruption by transparency international (countries ranked from least to most corrupt).
The revelation of the US Embassy report, which did not appear in Moscow until late in the evening, certainly did not cause enthusiasm for the Russian government, although only to the extent that Luzhkov can be blamed for Moscow's shortcomings may be an opportunity for the Kremlin to argue for a solution to the problem.
In an interview with CNN's Larry King, Putin said the documents WikiLeaks released may have been forgeries and reacted angrily to claims that American diplomats call him Batman and Medvedeva Robin.
"The truth about the whole thing is that it is about our interaction, which is an important factor in domestic policy in this country," he said.
"But to be honest, we didn't think it would be done with such arrogance, with such pressure, you know, so unethically."
Khmer Reds veterans forced to come to terms with the past
In a dimly lit concrete classroom with soiled and peeled walls, an Anlong Veng High School principal reminded the man who built it, Khmer Rouge leader Ta Mok.
"Everyone here loves Ta Moka."
"He was a good leader and he took care of his people," said Sreng Kor Ma, 42.
Known as the "butcher" for his brutality during the Khmer Rouge rule, the commander remains popular in this remote Khmer Rouge holding in northwestern Cambodia, where he built hospitals, bridges and other infrastructure, and where thousands of former soldiers of the organization still live.
But this year, 12 years after the Khmer Rouge relinquished control, long-standing loyalties are also being hacked in Anlong Veng.
In April, victims at a truth and reconciliation forum were allowed to publicly confront people who were part of the regime.
In June, the government provided textbooks explaining to children for the first time the history of the Khmer Rouge and their former soldiers.
And in July, the UN and the Cambodian Court jointly sentenced a former Khmer Rouge member, the former leader of the notorious tuol sleng violent association, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as the Spirit, to 35 years in prison.
With each such advance, unrest grew among the Khmer Rouge veterans in Anlong Veng, complicating reconciliation efforts and their attempts to re-engage with Cambodian society.
"There is resentment and fear among the former Khmer Rouge, but they are powerless to do anything," said Chhang Youk, head of the Documentation Center of Cambodia, an independent organization that researches the regime.
"For them, life among the Khmer Rouge was wonderful, but the regime became a symbol of evil."
"It divides families."
During the Khmer Rouge rule in Cambodia, from 1975 to 1979, an estimated 1.7 million people were executed or starved to death, from illness or overwork.
When the Vietnamese invaded and overthreached pol pot in 1979, the remnants of the regime and its soldiers fled to Cambodia's border with Thailand.
There they launched an uprising that lasted until the last movement in December 1998.
Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sara directed guerrilla wars from their bases in the mountains and jungles of western Cambodia, while Ta Mok cultivated followers in Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, following a UN-sponsored peace agreement, the country was led to its first democratic elections in 1993. Large groups of Khmer Rouge fighters began to move to a government that culminated in the surrender of Ieng Sara in 1996 and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died of natural causes in 1998, and Ta Mok, who persisted, was captured by government forces in the nearby Dangrek Mountains in 1999.
He died in Phnom Penh Prison in 2006 while a while a while a trial was admed.
Their beneads no longer cared for them, most former Khmer Rouge fighters have fallen into ordinary Cambodian rural life, and many nostalgically recall the movement's time.
Although several elite Khmer Rouge have retained their local government positions in exchange for their weapons, their position remains weak, like unskilled farmers.
"These people have benefited minimally from surrender," said Sok Leang of the Center for Justice and Reconciliation, which runs public forums across Cambodia, including Anlong Veng.
"They are surrounded by the utopian agrarian ideology of the regime."
"They were well-been ord without any idea of making a deal."
Sor Lim, 55, who joined the Khmer Rouge as a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle around Anlong Veng before settling down as a poor farmer in 1998.
"Life under the Khmer Rouge was good," he said.
"That Mok has made a living for everyone."
"But now life is hard, because we have to provide for ourselves."
The ongoing Khmer Rouge trial has also raised concerns.
Early next year, the court will begin investigating Nuon Che, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sara and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Rouge minister.
The court has a mandate to prosecute the leaders and the people responsible for the crimes, but it has not been said whether it will continue in the four cases.
It was little to calm fears in Anlong Veng.
Recent media speculation has focused on Im Chaem, 64, who was regional leader in Banteay Meanchey province during the Khmer Rouge rule in the late 1970s.
In 2007, she told researchers at the Documentation Center in Cambodia that she oversaw the construction of trapeang thma dam, a project that is believed to have killed thousands of forced laborers.
On a recent hot evening, Im Chaem returned from work in the field to her wooden house on a dirt road outside Anlong Veng.
As the sun began to descend and shadows appeared across the parched grass, Im Chaem refused to talk about her past among the Khmer Rouge.
If the court summoned her, she would refuse to go.
"There is peace in Cambodia and it is stable," she said.
"If there are any more prosecutions, there will be war."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who defected from the Khmer Rouge in 1978, has also repeatedly warned that there will be instability if the court seeks more suspects, although experts and historians disagree.
"Cambodia must dig a deep hole and bury the past in it," he said.
But confronting the past is just what Cambodia needs to do to move forward, said Chhang Youk of the documentation center.
"Reconciliation in Khmer conditions means gluing broken pieces together," he said.
"It is our duty to put these broken pieces together so that we can understand each other."
The center published the first government-approved textbook on the Khmer Rouge, 75 pages long and titled "The History of Democratic Cambodia."
It was distributed in Anlong Veng in June as an addendum to the Department of Education's history textbook, which contains less than four pages on the Khmer Rouge.
Like many people in Cambodia, the young people of Anlong Veng knew little detail about the Khmer Rouge, despite the city's connection to the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19, a high school student at Anlong Veng, said the new textbook helps students understand an important part of their history.
But his parents reacted with skepticism when he took home a book to study.
"My family rejects many parts of the textbook and the courts," he said.
"They're suspicious because they're not sure how many people the court will prosecute."
Such resistance makes the reconciliation process more complex and difficult, Sok Leang said.
But public forums, textbooks, and the court are beginning to have an impact, he said.
The Khmer Rouge still have a strong charm here.
Up in the Dangrek Mountains is a weed-covered road with dumped plastic bags that leads to a black soot rectangle covered with a rusty tin roof.
Pol Poto's body was burned on a pile of tires after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, 31, a cell phone saleswoman on the side of the road, said she didn't know much about the man who was cremated at the scene.
"But he has a strong spirit, many local people come here and pray to him," she said.
It was Nuom Sothea's birthday, and she planned to visit Pol Pota's resting place later, where she would bring a bunch of ripe bananas in the hope that it would bring her luck.
Belarus agrees to appear to have its uranium-based stockpile
In a surprise victory in President Obama's campaign to secure nuclear material around the world, the Belarusian government announced Wednesday that it would give up its stockpile of highly enriched uranium, a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The agreement was made public in a joint statement issued after the security summit by Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov.
For years, the US government has tried to persuade Belarus to give up highly enriched uranium, and it seemed that they had hit the stumbling block last spring.
But U.S. officials told The Washington Post that several covert operations have been conducted with Belarus in the past two months to remove 187 pounds of uranium-based weapons from a Belarusian research facility.
This paved the way for Wednesday's deal to remove the rest of the material - around £500, according to the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because it is a sensitive matter.
The agreement proved to be one of the most important outcomes of Obama's 47th National Nuclear Security Summit in April, at which Belarus was eliminated.
And it was probably a good move to secure the former Soviet Republic's invitation to a subsequent summit in 2012.
"I was really fascinated by the fact that they wanted a place at the 2012 Nuclear Security Summit."
"This proves that the process is working," said Ken Luongo, president of the Partnership for Global Security, a pro-nuclear safety group.
Clinton called the agreement a "very important, important step" from Belarus.
Obama promised in Prague in April 2009 to secure all sensitive nuclear materials around the world within four years.
Since then, the U.S. government has helped six countries dispose of all their stockpiles of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will be seventh.
A dozen countries did so under the George W. Bush administration.
At the time of Obama's nuclear security summit, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko announced that his nation would never give up its uranium.
"We have highly enriched uranium - hundreds of kilograms of what is essentially the basis for a weapon and less enriched uranium," Lukashenko said afterwards.
"It's our commodity... We're not going to make dirty bombs, and we're not going to sell them to anyone."
"We only use it for research purposes, that's all."
Belarus, however, joined the United States a few months ago and expressed interest in reaching an agreement.
The first commitment to remove Belarusian uranium in October was particularly complicated because the material was lightly irradiated, officials said.
It was loaded on a special train that traveled more than 1,300 miles to a Russian storage and disposal facility, officials said.
The second operation was closed on Monday and was carried out by air, officials said.
The US government spent $13 million on the program, most of it to deliver less enriched uranium to a Belarusian research institute that is not suitable for the production of nuclear weapons.
"Everything has been coordinated very carefully and managed on a trust basis," leading to an agreement signed by Clinton, said Andrew Bieniawski, an Energy Department official working for Global Threat Reduction.
This year, the James Martin Center for nuclear non-proliferation studies estimated that Belarus has at least 88 pounds of uranium usable for weapons production.
Belarus will, according to the Joint Declaration, seek to eliminate its stockpiles by 2012.
Relations between Belarus and the United States have been strained for years, mainly because of Lukashenko's brutal repression of human rights.
But Wednesday's announcement suggests the possibility of a gradual thaw.
"We welcome progress on these global security issues, the United States and Belarus have recognized that more consistent respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains the basis for improving relations and is necessary for the progress of the country and its people," he said.
The Spanish government didn't make a big deal out of CIA flights.
The Spanish government has not made any head of cia flights transporting imprisoned Taliban and Al-Qaeda members to Guantánamo via Spanish territory, as the United States envoy in Madrid put it in a telegram.
This is what the documents provided by Wikileaks to El País also state that the then First Deputy Prime Minister, María Teresa Fernández de la Vega, requested that the Spanish executive be informed so that "she can show that she has proper oversight of foreign aircraft passing through Spanish airspace."
In June 2006, following a Communication from the Council of Europe in which a dozen states, including Spain, were accused of complicity in human rights violations, a meeting took place between the US Ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega.
The Deputy Prime Minister said the Council of Europe's communication "took zapater's government out of play" and insisted that Spain had nothing to hide on the matter.
De la Vega stressed that Spain has no problem with secret service flights through its territory.
"They simply want to be informed" so that they are not "caught unprepared," Aguirre says in one of the documents.
The then Foreign Minister, Miguel Ángel Moratinos, also suggested to the US ambassador that the Spanish government "wanted to make the matter as low as possible, but by having the matter in the hands of the judges, the cabinet had limited possibilities of influence."
In February 2007, Prosecutor Vicente González told the Embassy that, as far as he was concerned, he had no intention of blocking the judge's initiative to request the declassification of Documents of the National Intelligence Center (CNI) and the Department of Defense regarding CIA flights.
"This information does not contain any incriminating file or sensitive information," the Embassy explained after speaking with the prosecutor.
However, the US expressed concern about "apparent coordination between the Spanish judge and German prosecutors" rather than the declassification of CNI or Ministry of Defence information.
"This coordination between independent experts will complicate our efforts to resolve this case discreetly between governments," Aguirre regrets.
In March 2007, at a luncheon between the US ambassador and Interior Minister Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, he told the ambassador that "although Spanish judges are very jealous of their independence and will do as they see fit," he had already instructed his colleagues to "avoid inflammatory comments with the intention of reducing tensions."
The Ambassador also expresses his concerns about the conduct of the Political Party Partido Popular (PP) on this matter.
"Despite its general pro-American orientation, our experience tells us that the Partido Popular party will not hesitate to take advantage of any suggestion that the Zapatera government tolerated or deliberately ignored U.S. actions that could be interpreted as possible human rights violations, even if these revelations could have negative consequences for the United States government." noting.
Admitted mother-killer complained on the network about maternity "worries"
A young woman was talking about a child when she was already dead, and she had her blog: "Terror after Galicius."
Mónica Juanatey Fernández calls her "Muki" online.
with this nickname, which she had used since she was a year old, she communicated with her cousin and at least one friend; both are from the village of Noia in the La Coruňa area, from which the young woman comes.
The reports are from 2008.
In order to understand them, it is necessary to know the woman's emotional life, which abc newspaper reconstructs with the help of the testimony of her family members.
A 30-year-old woman from Galicia entered into a relationship with industrialist Iván Túnez in 1998.
They dated for a year.
Shortly after they broke up, she found out she was pregnant.
The man wanted to know if the newborn baby was his, but his ex-girlfriend never had DNA tests done.
Before long, she found a new acquaintance.
Her chosen one was Alberto, a young man from the nearby town of Lousame.
Their cohabitation lasted a long time.
Little Caesar lived with them.
When the girl went to the Balearic Islands to look for work, the little one stayed with her partner, who even came to Palma for a week to visit her.
However, the content of her communication shows that the relationship has broken down.
In March 2008, she's alone in Menorca, writing, "Alberto's upset that I left for work."
"When I told him, he thought it was good, but now he realizes he has to be with the baby all day and he can't do what he wants."
Then she talks about the text message she just received: "I want you to come back later this month or give me the address where I'm supposed to send your baby."
He complains, "If he doesn't like me leaving the baby with my mother, I'll marry him when I get back," he says.
in May, he talks about his return to his residence: "I'm going there this week, but I'm only going to stay until the 19th because on the 20th I have to go for work so I don't lose the job".
He explains that if all goes well, he'll take his son with him.
"He'll be with who he's supposed to be with, me, and it's never going to happen again in my life that I leave him with anyone but my mother," a dubious intention given her bad relationships.
there's another post in July.
When he taps this message, it is assumed that the child who arrived on the island on the first day of this month, and was probably murdered on the 10th, is already dead.
"Caesar is satisfied on the one hand, but he is not."
"On the one hand, he's with me, and he kind of likes it here, but on the other hand, he goes to school almost every day.".
He's talking about moving to Majorca.
"He (son) is going to go to summer school there, so I'm going to save a little money on a nanny."
On the 17th, greetings and complaints.
"Big kiss from Caesar, who asks me when you're coming."
"Alberto says he sent you I don't know what videos to email you, look how he likes it, he'll meet me, sex is needed".
On the 30th, another message: "The boy is well, goes to summer school to learn Catalan".
There's also one message about Víctor, the current partner: "He's giving me money."
On the Internet, Mónič's posts are on blogs dedicated to anime and manga.
She even had her own on MySpace, now revised, where she called her "Muki ex-inmate."
"Terror after Galicius (motto) ".
The last man she lived with, the guardian, expresses his remorse and feels guilty.
She doesn't want to believe that everything would happen because she didn't tell him she was a single mother.
Yesterday, Mónica entered the provincial shed in Palma, where she arrived from the Menorca detention center.
The defense attorney, Carlos Maceda, said the defendant did not remember how it all happened and "had no intention of harming the little one in any way."
Before that, however, she admitted drowning Caesar in the bathtub and put his body in the trunk.
Both the defense and the D.A. are asking for a psychiatric evaluation.
The People's Party would win 4 seats in the Chamber of Deputies and the PSC (Socialist Party of Catalonia) would lose 9 seats
with the results of 28 November, the PP could have the lead in the town halls of Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona.
After a significant increase in the votes received and the number of experienced members during the recent autonomous elections, the Catalan PP (People's Party of Catalonia) already has a given idea of general elections, whether or not there is an increase, its prospects are more than positive, since the number of votes in national elections is usually one such as that of the Catalan elections.
in 2008, the Catalan People's Party won 610,473 votes in the general election, compared with only 316,222 in the 2006 autonomous elections.
Last Sunday, the PPC (People's Party of Catalonia) received 384,091 votes.
If this trend of increasing is maintained, supported by the transfer of votes from the PSC and the loyalty of PP voters, the party's analysts calculated that if the general elections were held, the PPC could gain 12 MPs in the Chamber of Deputies compared to the current 8, the CiU (Convergencia i Unió) would also win 4 seats (it now has 10) and the PSC would lose at least 9 seats (now 25).
These calculations would confirm that Catalonia is essential for the PP and PSOE (Spanish Socialist Workers' Party).
According to this analysis of the People's Party, the ERC (Left-Wing Republican Party of Catalonia) would lose one MEMBER - it now has 3 - while the ICV (Green Initiative for Catalonia) would continue to have one mandate or gain another.
However, according to the electoral calendar, the next meeting will take place in May 2011 on the occasion of the municipal elections, where the People's Party could also have a decisive influence on the end of the Socialists' domination in the four main provincial cities, as well as on the changes in the Barcelona Council (Diputación de Barcelona), one of the administrations with the largest budget expected - 661 million euros for 2011.
Both nationalists and People's Party agree on the possibility that the PSC could lose town halls in Barcelona, Tarragon, Lérida and Geron, where the Socialists would not receive a majority, nor could they turn to their traditional allies, the ERC and the ICV.
Given the Republican debacle, it would not be impossible for the party to lose its representation in the Barcelona city council - as it needs to get at least 5% of the vote.
The PP has increased the number of votes received in four capitals and could have decisive influence in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
Nationalists believe they could play a major role in the turnaround in Tarragon, where they ruled alongside the PP party ahead of the current mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros.
in Lérida, the PP received only 500 more votes than the PSC, whose mayor, Angel Ros, has a very good relationship with Mariano Rajoy - they met on several occasions during the last campaign.
The People's Party also gained at other important town halls such as Badalona, Castelldeels and Reus.
currently, the PP has representation in 34 town halls in Catalonia and would like to create candidates in as many municipalities as possible.
Catalan cell gave thousands of passports to Al-Qaeda
In addition to the seven detainees in Barcelona, three more were detained in Thailand
Seven Pakistanis and one Nigerian, who were detained by Agents of the General Information Commissioner in Barcelona, formed a jihadist cell controlled from Thailand, archoting passports for various al-Qaeda groups, including the "Tigers liberated by Tamil Eilam" and "Lashkar-e-Taiba", the latter being the author of the Mumbai bombings in 2008 that killed 106 people.
The Ministry of the Interior attaches great importance to the investigation of this matter, aiming to ensure that al-Qaeda's counterfeiting apparatus is weakened internationally through "Operation Kampai" and thus "limit its operational capabilities."
Investigators estimate that the cell may have sent thousands of passports to Thailand during the two years it was active in Catalonia, where they were then forged and then delivered to groups that make up al-Qaeda's criminal galaxy so that their "fighters" could travel across borders in Europe and other Western countries with impunity.
This broken cell was not the only active one that the jihadist network in Europe had, which is why other European police forces, in addition to Thai services, were involved in these investigations, and it cannot therefore be ruled out that in the coming days there will be no similar interventions in other European countries as the one in Barcelona last Tuesday night.
In connection with this operation (when Pakistani Junaid Humayun was detained, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade) developed another in Thailand, with Pakistanis Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt and Thai Sirikanlaya Kijbumrung captured.
It was these men who ran a cell based in Spain from Bangkok and others in other European countries.
The Catalan network, part of which was liquidated in 2009, mainly stole passports from tourists that met islamist requirements.
This means that the documents had to belong to men aged 25 to 45, had to be valid for several years and were without marked visas.
The investigative documents stress that no facts are yet known linking the detainees from Catalonia to the Mumbai bombing, although the author of the attacks, "Lashkar-e-Taiba", was supposed to be one of the groups that accepted passports stolen in Spain and then falsified in Thailand.
However, it is worth noting that a few days before this assassination, about $1,000 was sent from Catalonia by a transfer agency, which was "deposited" to buy cards for mobile phones, which were later used by members of the "commando" that killed 106 people.
The police have already seized a lot of evidence.
People's Party (PP) demands Mas stop fiscal deal
Alicia Sánchez-Camach, leader of the PPC (People's Party of Catalonia), had the opportunity yesterday to present in person to Arturo Mas the conditions under which she is willing to support his inauguration as President of the Generalitat; these conditions are the same as those proposed during the campaign, and their priority is to revive the economy and renounce risky businesses such as the economic agreement that the nationalist leader wants to propose during his mandate.
The leader of the Catalan People's Party has arrived at a meeting with Artune Mas with the certainty of the 18 seats won in last Sunday's elections, a figure more than satisfactory for gaining popularity, so the CiU candidate needs at least one of the opposition formations to abstain from voting to put him in office.
A possible agreement with the PP depends on future alliances that the nationalists would like to maintain in the Chamber of Deputies when the general elections are held, but so far the talks mas is having with the rest of the political leaders these days are catalan.
As for the PP president, in order to win her support for the inauguration, "she will have to put an end to all sovereign and liberated speeches," as well as an economic agreement - similar to the one in the Basque Country - that the CiU leader even wanted to vote on in a referendum.
Both leaders would like to slim down the oversuggered political apparatus of autonomous administration and reduce inheritance and donation taxes.
Details of the negotiations over Mas's inauguration will be dealt with by PP Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
Mas has already met Joaquin Nadal (PSC), who has promised tough opposition, Joan Herrera (ICV) and will today meet Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Alberto Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
Director of the geriatrics facility assures that the deaths were not due to a 'lack of action'
Olot Center performances don't rule out their caregiver killing more than 11 clients
The management of the La Caritat de Olot (Gerona) geriatric centre gave a press conference yesterday to explain the damage caused to the institution by the criminal behaviour of Joan Villa Dilma, a carer who - while employed here - killed at least 11 senior citizens in his care.
Joan Sala, the director of this nursing home, arrived accompanied by the facility's lawyer, attorney Joan Canada, and announced that "the wishes of La Caritat's home would be to be able to press charges against the culprit" responsible for the killing, but "the legality and responsibility obsess over to leave this process to the appropriate authorities."
In addition to the reputational damage that this institution may suffer because it did not detect the criminal activities of the caregiver in a timely manner, the demands for material compensation already calculated by the lawyers of the bereaved families pose a major threat to la Caritat's home.
Joan Vila Dilmé admitted that his first crime took place back in August 2009 and that he has not stopped killing since
The judge ordered the exhumation of eight bodies of the elderly home's clients, suspecting that in many cases no doctor had examined the deceased personally, but that - due to the age and poor health of the patients - everything was done over the phone.
Yesterday, La Caritat, through its director, resolutely rejected this extreme, stressing that 'the lack of action could in no way have been the cause of what happened'.
La Caritat's lawyer added that "there is no indication in the case that any third party has committed any misconduct other than the accused."
The man now nicknamed "Angel of Death" admitted 11 killings yesterday, specifying that he committed the first crime on August 29, 2009, and killed a second old woman a month and a half later.
in this case, caused death by administering too high a dose of insulin, as opposed to the first time he used a mixture of soothing pills.
Director La Caritat said it was complicated to control staff access to medication.
Insulin and a cocktail of sedatives were probably six out of nine of the nine drugs this caregiver used to kill patients in their efforts to relieve their suffering.
However, only the analyses now taking place in the laboratory should show whether Vila is lying and was actually looking for a less cruel death for his first victims or, on the contrary, killed them by administering lye, as he has already admitted in the case of the three women killed between 12 and 17 October.
in La Caritat, they do not believe the medical claims, nor do they rule out that the number of people killed may be higher than the number to which he confessed, and justify his conduct in the various versions brought by Vila to the court, knowing that he must change his act when it became clear that he had killed eight people.
That is why they say they want to be available to the judiciary so that the full scope of the matter is illuminated.
The European Central Bank is threatening
Investors reacted sharply yesterday to yesterday's threat from European Central Bank President Trichet, who warned that "markets should not underestimate our ability to respond."
Marginal differentials closed strongly, and European bank stocks fell more than 5%.
However, we should also not underestimate the European Central Bank's ability to erm - the euro has just risen above critical value.
What happened yesterday is typical of an out-of-the-market market, which, although declining, is recovering - but thanks to short and very speculative positions.
It's going to take an investor some time to lose their fears.
A month ago, the European Central Bank quoted us to take back the liquidity rate today, and tomorrow it will have to appeal for the fourth time in two years.
The Bundesbank demanded an end to the plan to buy back the national debt for the ineffectiveness and elimination of all exceptional liquidity rates within the deadline, leaving unrestricted access for only one week.
After the Irish crisis, we expect them to forecast liquidity rates "at least until March" and to keep the three-month unlimited access auction until the end of this trimester to guarantee liquidity until at least June.
We also hope that they will continue their bond-buying programme and even announce its intensification.
If they do not live up to the expectations created, they will re-create the reaction of the markets of yesterday, and if they continue blindly to withdraw the liquidity rate, God be with us!
It was the same at the may congress, where they claimed they had not even considered buying bonds, and markets collapsed - tomorrow history could repeat itself.
The European Central Bank must be credible and persistent.
in May, the armor fist announced it on Monday, and on Wednesday it said it had already bought many, triggering another market crash.
Yesterday's one-year bill auction in Portugal was very poor.
El Tesoro spent only 500 million with 5.28%, compared with 750 million with 4.81% of the previous auction.
Thus, rates in Portugal fell 30 points, reflecting the change in market sentiment that followed Trichet's words.
figures have been published in Ireland representing losses for Allied and the Bank of Ireland.
The estimated amounts are roughly 10,000 million on short-term securities and another potential 15,000, with a chance to become private equity by February or nationalized.
Although Ireland has no credibility after it failed to detect the problem through stress tests in July, the amounts are acceptable under the AA and will help reduce uncertainty.
However, next Tuesday the government will need to get the approval of the new budget through parliament and still does not have enough support, so uncertainty continues to reign in Ireland.
Angela Merkel has softened the tone of her speech to ease the tensions in her face for the next EU leaders' meeting on 14 December, at which a political compromise is needed to show that we are a union and we are all in the same boat.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner, while others would prefer Beethoven's Ode to Joy.
In Spain, the Prime Minister had the opportunity yesterday to present a plan of action to be approved at the Council of Ministers on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in autonomous regions and financial institutions, deficit reduction, liberalisation, privatisation, measures to revive employment - in investors' ears it sounds like Vivaldi's Four Seasons.
The double effect of Trichet and Zapatero explains why the Spanish stock exchange rose by 4.5%, twice as much as other European exchanges.
Unlike february, the reaction of the government and the Spanish National Bank was swift and convincing - we are probably benefiting from the surprise effect.
Today we have a key three-year bond auction, which will benefit from the Trichet effect, which we hope will result in a great demand for it, which will help dispel doubts about our refinancing capacity.
Asking for a rescue plan would be self-sacrifice for Spain.
They would give us cash that we don't need - there are 40,000 million in cash available in El Tesoro, three times more than in March - then high rates and market access would close our sine die.
However, cesar's wife's strategy must continue to be used - "not only to be that, but also to appear to be."
We're going to make it.
Eulen Group President Attacks Vega Sicilia Meeting Requested by His Children
The storm in open conflict in the Álvarez family, the owners of Eulen and El Enebro, is not fading.
David Álvarez, the group's founder, will challenge, after he considered it "completely meaningless," El Enebro's legal action scheduled for 16th this month and the requested five of its seven descendants, at which they should try to force their majority and seize Bodegas Vega Sicilia's procuration with the help of the administration.
David Álvarez and his sons Jesús David and María José are finaling a legal group for a new chapter in their dispute over control of part of the company.
The founder of the largest corporate services holding company seems unwilling to ease his dispute over membership of El Enebro's governing bodies.
five of its seven descendants, who were appointed leaders during the shareholders' meeting on 18 January this year and whose objection is entered in the Commercial Register, were deposed from its administration committee.
El Enebro's court hearing scheduled for the 16th of this month, convened by a Clerk of the Commercial Court Number 2 in Madrid, restored the thunder in the womb of the Álvarez family.
Appealing to a judge is the only legal remedy that guarantees the convening of a commission until the dispute is resolved.
David Álvarez sees the latest move by Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marty and Elvira Álvarez Mezquiriz as " a desperate means of his five children serving through judicial guile and clear legal fraud to strengthen and improve the January 18 negotiations, which were completely invalid."
This argument will serve as a basis for justifying the legal challenge to this conduct as 'completely meaningless'.
The protagonists themselves, who are discreetly silent, have already tried without success to have the court convene a hearing in June.
in El Enebro, a group that owns, among other activities, Bodegas Vega Sicilia, seven descendants of David Álvarez control 100% of the capital.
However, according to family protocols, the founder of the group demands the right of use for 51% of the capital.
This matter is a key issue that will have to be decided by the judge at the trial of the issue of judicial challenge to the hearing. A date for this trial has not yet been set.
Red Bull triumphs in Formula One with a secret weapon from Siemens
The software proposes real-time improvements in vehicles.
Ever since Red Bull invaded the Formula One series in 2004, its history in this extraordinary world of speed has been characterized by surprise and success.
At first, no one took too seriously the possibilities of this new arrival team, and despite the upward trend of recent times, everyone was betting on Fernando Alonso's Ferrari triumph.
Without wanting to diminish the driving skills of the champion, German Sebastian Vettel, or the renault engine capabilities that power his car, a legend was born in the Formula One world - the "secret weapon" that multinational Siemens put in Red Bull's hands to make it a winning team.
In fact, it is a powerful marching simulation software that the German company launched in 2007 for purposes very far removed from automotive sport.
The so-called PLM, this powerful software device, was used to design assembly lines in production plants around the world, in power plants and for high-precision devices.
Its aim is to faithfully reproduce the product or simulate the process before it is actually created, thus avoiding unnecessary mistakes and expenses.
PLM has facilitated the development of the Canon camera, Sukhoi aircraft or Nissan's most famous commercial vehicles.
Siegfried Russwurm, head of Siemens' industrial division, explains that the use of this software device has enabled the Red Bull team to make modifications and improvements "in a matter of hours, in near real time" that are otherwise detected during races and trials.
Russwurm says that in 1992, the stables employed an average of 10 technicians who were able to make a maximum of three or four improvements in one period.
Red Bull now has 180 young, highly qualified professionals equipped with powerful information technology who analyze and design every type of modification of racing vehicles.
The Siemens manager explained that plm software is able to analyze and improve all elements of Red Bull racing vehicles, with the exception of the engine for which Renault is fully responsible.
Materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety features are modified.
Changes can be translated from virtual reality to reality in less than 24 hours thanks to advanced production systems using lasers and high-tech autoclave.
The only limit to this technical convenience is the $40 million amount representing the maximum any Formula One team can make for each period to improve their competitiveness.
Red Bull has set up a high-tech plant about 30 miles from London to design and manufacture its racing cars.
These are two buildings that are restricted to visitors - especially journalists.
Everything that happens here is considered a "great secret".
The list of participants in this project includes 580 people, including two pilots - champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
Red Bull's hero in Formula One is undoubtedly fresh champion Sebastian Vettel.
Behind the immeasurable technological means that the energy drink brand has put into its participation in racing circuits, however, are other protagonists whose help is invaluable, yet no one knows them.
Steve Nevey, head of manufacturing technology, says that five years ago, it could be said that advances in vehicle research and development contributed 50% to victory, and the rest was due to riders.
at present, this ratio has changed, and technology is worth 85% success, while pilots contribute 15%.
Nevey acknowledges that Vettel or Webber will never be replaced by computer technology, as they are "unpredictable gladiators."
HP will set up 20 of its own stores in two years in partnership with local distributors
Hewlett-Packard (HP) in partnership with its business partner Pont Reyes inaugurated its first exclusive store in Barcelona yesterday.
The venture will be the first of a network of 20 80 to 100 sq m stores that the multinational plans to open in Spain in the next two years.
These stores will also be located in 16 existing department stores such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
Helena Herrerová, vice president of HP Spain, cited as an example a newly rebuilt store in Barcelona's Gran Vía, owned by Pont Reyes, with which HP has been cooperating for 30 years.
The North American company has prepared a plan to establish 200 points of sale in Europe by 2013, which includes 20 Spanish stores.
The first stores opened last week in Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia), so the store in Barcelona is the third.
Herrer would not reveal where other stores would be opened, but admitted that Madrid could be one of the following places.
Herrer, who also runs HP's personnel systems, assured that the business opening philosophy would always be the same - using local distributors with experience and knowledge of the sector.
Here, the North American company advises on an exclusive design of store equipment (with products that can be interactively tested) that will be identical in Europe.
In addition, HP is also engaged in providing staff for trades.
Helena Herrerová denied that it was franchising and stressed that the exclusive network of stores aims to 'improve customer service, SMEs' services in purchasing, servicing, after-sales service and even packaging'.
The barcelona business is part of a world-class pilot pioneering programme aimed at addressing any problems with computer equipment under the system.
The online service is connected to a technical centre based in Maastricht (Netherlands).
"That way, we can solve problems in 10 minutes that may otherwise take up to two days."
"This system is designed specifically for small and medium-sized enterprises and ordinary customers, given that large companies already have a technical assistance contract service", helena Herrerová stressed yesterday.
Sabadell bets on 'stealing' a million clients from its competitors in three years
More optimistic than other bosses, Banco Sabadell's delegated board member, Jaime Guardiola, believes 2011 will be a challenging year for the bank, but rejects a new liquidity crisis and predicts an end to the passive war.
Nevertheless, it envisages a reduction in interest rates, which they will try to compensate by reducing bank fees and credit prices.
Sabadell expects to acquire a million private clients within three years.
Sabadell found a way to take advantage of the next three years and survive in difficult economic conditions.
The Bank will launch a new strategic plan in 2011, valid for three years.
The aim, in addition to surviving without the need to turn to public assistance in the FROB, is to gain market share by attracting a million new private clients - or 700,000, respectively, if those who eventually leave the bank are deducted - because until now, the Institute has pampered small and medium-sized entrepreneurs and large enterprises rather than small clients.
This year, the bank has already acquired 250,000 private clients and 50,000 businesses.
Its market share is 3.5% for private clients, compared to more than 10% for corporate customers.
Another of the basic ideas of the 2011-2013 plan is a commitment to productivity, or sobriety, in order to reduce the costs that the bank will show when it presents the results for the period.
At this time, not many banking institutions dare to set targets and make them public, as the financial crisis has changed all plans for world banking.
Sabadell will close its Optima program this year, set four years ago, although it was originally for three years, but the market situation required expansion for a further period.
Clients who leave savings banks will be their main target group.
At a meeting organized by the APIE, Guardiola insisted that 2011 would be "difficult and very important."
Indeed, he believes that the journey out of the crisis in Spain "will be lengthy."
Moreover, in two or three years it will be "very difficult to create employment," which is fundamental to the survival of the banking sector, he added.
And while he believes that passive warfare - which reduces margins - is receding, the cost of the risk margins that banks and savings banks pay for their issuances to obtain liquidity is already shifting to credit prices, thereby offsetting margin reductions.
"The topic of liquidity and financing is structural and will be a pressure factor on loans".
"We haven't closed the faucet yet, but the differentials are very high," Guardiola acknowledged.
Banesto has already issued orders to its network on Thursday to reduce long-term loans and raise differential prices - see CincoDías from November 22-27.
He also acknowledged that the tendency in banking "now is to reduce commissions", but there is a "competitive framework".
Sabadell's strategic plan is based on organic growth, but as usual, the group does not rule out corporate operations.
Not in vain, he assures that in Spain "larger sizes will be required."
"There will be no stone left on the stone next year," he assured.
It confirms that capital needs are "greatly reduced" and does not rule out a Spanish institution entering the red.
And it points out that the FROB can substitute fundraising in the market before a new capital measure.
After assurances that Sabadell can survive a temporary market shutdown, what some bankers predict is a new liquidity crisis remains a serious problem.
It notes that it is not possible to issue, but unlike what was in June, short-term financing can be obtained through repo rates, which alleviates the crisis.
CECA rules out another wave of savings banks mergers
Yesterday, the CECA's director general denied that there should be another wave of savings bank mergers, and again insisted on the speed at which the sector is being reorganised.
When the process of pooling Spanish savings banks started, there were several institutions that assured that they would not participate in this first phase and wait for the second round.
However, José Antonio Olavarrieta, director general of the Spanish Savings Bank Confederation (CECA), ruled out yesterday that a new wave of these operations should emerge.
"I believe that most mergers have already been carried out, the incorpomination of Cajasol into the Banca Cívica Group cannot be considered as a second round, what is happening is conventions".
"Most of it is completely implemented; it is possible that instead of 17 institutes we will go to 13 or 14, but all the major processes are already complete and under the protection of the Spanish National Bank, which cooperated very well on this matter," the director noted.
In statements at the ADEA meeting (Association of Aragon Executives and Executives - NB) Olavarrieta recounted that the concentration process is taking place "at the highest possible speed and we must be very satisfied, as it shows in the instalments that appeared in the business plans with the Spanish National Bank at one time, not now," he stressed.
"Moving from 45 savings banks with an average asset volume of 28,000 million to 17 with 75,500 million is a process that has no history of comparison, reducing the number of institutions by 62% to make them larger and thus in line with the Basel Treaty," he underlined.
Olavarrieta acknowledged that "there are a number of not very happy opinions about the slowness of the process" that show a "lack of seriousness and understanding" because "what the Bank of Spain is doing is reminding us that we have to be on deadline before the end of the year."
CECA Director-General José Antonio Olavarrieta yesterday assured that Spain has the strictest financial system in all of Europe and "probably" the world, and attributed a "lack of knowledge" to those who dispute it.
The director noted that in the current favourable economic situation, "we can be calm" about financial institutions and savings banks, as well as a system that has mastered a "very important" concentration process and that continues at "the highest possible speed."
He also recalled that Spanish banking came out very well from the stress tests carried out by the European Central Bank in July.
Zapatero and red German line
Berlin opted to maintain the euro, but set the conditions for the whole Union.
Tensions in the markets provoked a double government response.
On the one hand, José Luis Zapatero proposed new adaptation measures, edging taxes for small and medium-sized enterprises, through the regulation of private intermediary agencies or the abolition of 426 euros for the unemployed without benefits, to the privatisation of 49% of AENA (Spanish airports and air traffic control), the airport administrator Barajas and El Prat and 30% of the state lottery.
Vice-President Elena Salgado, with the support of former Prime Minister Felipe González, on the other hand, joined the criticisms of Chancellor Angela Merkel over her responsibility for starting the current crisis.
How to interpret these emotiones?
Let it be said in advance that Merkel's position is not a mistake in her communication policy.
On the contrary, it is another point in the complex process of redefining the euro.
And here, Germany has a radically new vision of what its future should be, which alludes to the idea of adhering to old traditions that a large part of the other members adhere to.
In the face of European resistance, there is speculation in Germany about three possible ways out of the crisis.
The first is a strong eurozone, which would include Germany, but also Austria and the Netherlands, for example, while southern countries would leave the currency zone.
The second is a return to marce - although it may now seem like sci-fi, this version has broad public support, close to 50% of the population.
The third option, according to The German proposals, is to recast the euro with greater macroeconomic supervision, budgetary rigour, fines for guilty states, possible deferrals of payments for some of them, and an extension of the possible costs of regulation to the private sector.
The German position is clear and has been defined for some time, so there is now no room for dials.
First, when both the International Monetary Fund and the European Commission insuce deficits in 2009, the German government pulled constitutional reform out of its sleeve to prevent them from 2016.
This was the first sign of a contradiction between what Germany considered correct (plans for fiscal austerity and stability of public finances) and what its European partners, including France, practiced.
The second was shown by this Central European country, as Merkel painfully dragged out decisions on greece's bailout.
It was already the subject of fierce criticism, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and public opinion, which was also published, were strongly opposed to Greece's bailout.
Finally, in the last days of October, Merkel has reappeared with a clear position, calling for the Reform of European Union Conventions to allow the rescue of a Member State, while at the same time allowing private creditors to bear part of the costs.
This position was interpreted as anti-European, as it accelerated the Irish crisis and everything else.
However, its proposal, albeit in a somewhat softened form, has been approved, and in the coming months we should monitor the Union's reform process, which should allow for these measures from 2013 on.
Germany has set a red line that it does not intend to cross.
And it tells us all that, although measures need to be taken now, with which they seem to disagree too much, from this date the old functioning of the euro will be over.
2013 will represent the birth of a new currency zone, in which rule-breaking states will be severely sanctioned and forced to announce deferrals, and the private sector will also have to bear some of the costs.
Germany is suggesting to us that we must take a strict path of growth with an increase in savings and investment rates, moderate consumption, improved productivity and competitiveness, and capital buffers.
They simply do not tolerate another debt-based and building-based option, with huge balance of payments gaps such as those that prevailed during Spain's boom years.
The offer is clear.
And we'd be wrong not to understand.
This is not just about restoring the public deficit to 3% in 2013.
What they want us to do is much harder.
And worst of all, under these conditions, we could be wrong ourselves.
I hope that these current turbulences will be replaced by greater calm.
And that we will take advantage of the opportunity they give us until spring 2013.
Prime Minister Zapatero seems to have understood this, too, and his double statement (reforms promised after last Saturday's meeting with big business and yesterday's announcement of new measures) gives the sense that, despite the criticisms of Merkel, the way has opened up for the idea that things need to be put right.
But the red line that Germany has set out is there, and it does not seem to want to move it.
And leaving a eurozone full of not-so-serious countries cannot be ruled out of the possibilities to consider.
Well, Germany will always be able to tell us that it has warned us.
Sport and circumvention of the rules
The tricks that Alonso and Ramos pulled off against Ajax show wit, not intent to escape punishment.
The allegedly concussed suspensions of two Real Madrid players (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) in the Champions League match against Ajax on 23 November have caused a sea of ink to be written about whether or not this is unsportsmanlike conduct and whether or not UEFA should punish both footballers.
As is known, a few minutes before the end of the match (which their team clearly won), the named players deliberately wasted time one by one when a foul was about to be played to provoke the referee, who showed them a second yellow card.
In this way, both players will meet the prescribed penalty in the next match against Auxerre - with Real Madrid ending up in the lead in their group - and will be able, deprived of their cards, to proceed to the next stage.
In the end, the UEFA Disciplinary Board gave coach Jose Mourinho a two-match suspension and the guilty players were fined.
Provoking a yellow card under similar conditions is not a new practice, but is more or less common in football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the eth of football, rules that are unwritten but watched.
Part of the discussion in this case arose from the fact that it involved a Real Madrid team (which prides itself on generosity and honour in its anthem, and which has already fined its players for similar acts), and, it seems, also thanks to the dramatisation led by Mourinho, who thus adds another episode to his long history as a comedian and provocateur.
in any event, the debate revolves around whether this type of conduct, which is not expressly prohibited by the rules, is contrary to the principles of sport, that is, whether these acts circumvent the law; these are indeed actions respecting sporting rules, the meaning of which, of course, seems to be trying to circumvent.
It is solved what type of damage such actions cause to the sporting spirit.
One of the elements of sportsmanship is the physical integrity of opponents, which in these cases was not violated, so there was no violent play.
Another of these elements that characterizes a clean game is to avoid players having an advantage over the opponent's team due to their offense - which has not happened here either.
So the paradox of the Real Madrid players' action is that there was no what we normally characterise as a ruse or circumvention of the law, there was no covert violation of the rules in order to avoid a penalty, but this behaviour should have been as noticeable as possible in order to receive the penalty.
They waited and were happy to receive the punishment.
Another question, however, is what advantage the culprits will have from their intentional infraction.
It must be stated here that the opponent is not in a disadvantaged position and that there will be no benefit in the current match, since the obvious consequence is that the team itself will have fewer players.
And even that is not a useful strategy for the next match, as the club will not be able to count on these players.
The advantage obviously is that players will start the next stage of the Champions League without cards that could jeopardise their participation in the next match.
However, it is an advantage from a long-term perspective and with a certain degree of uncertainty, i.e. at first glance the team can be eliminated, and in addition, by doing so, players will receive a penalty, and they will go to the second round of cards, in which one card less than in the first round is enough to exclude them.
So as the rounds go on, it will not be entirely clear whether this is an advantage.
In short, these negotiations do not go against the sporting spirit, which includes making strategic decisions that will allow maximum benefit within the rules.
in the case we are dealing with here, the players were not aimed at avoiding the award of a penalty (which would be a clear case of circumvention of the rules), but rather chose when to submit to it.
They made a strategic decision without avoiding punishment or running from it.
Although the line between ingenuity and circumvention is not entirely clear, I believe that this case was clearly about ingenuity.
It seems to me that the controversy arises for two reasons: because they were two self-separations, and because of the way in which the transmission of instructions to provoke them from the management took place.
The damage to sports principles by these actions is not as ethical as aesthetic.
Fight bids to host Christmas parties in Barcelona
This year, the calendar dictation concentrates an avalanche of reservations on December 16th and 17th.
There is a growing number of celebrations paid for by the employees themselves, who want to spend between 20 and 30 euros.
Like Turkish honey or lotteries, with the arrival of December, pre-Christmas parties are again coming, which still act as an oxygen bomb for restaurants and leisure facilities in Barcelona, but thanks to the crisis they have resulted in a struggle to win clients by lowering prices: almost everyone wants to spend 20 to 30 euros on food, agrees the entrepreneurs and associations from this sector.
To complete the complicating of numbers, the calendar concentrated this year (when Christmas Eve fell on Friday) applications for a week from December 13, creating an avalanche of reservations for peak days (16th and 17th), while there was hardly any traffic in the previous week.
As has been the case since 2008, when the lean years began, there are many companies that have cancelled collective parties for budgetary reasons.
In order not to abandon traditions, many employees pay for parties out of their own pocket.
Regardless of the situation, many demand prices at the limit of bearability, says gaieta Farras, president of the Gremi de Restauració de Barcelona restaurant association.
At the moment, the representative of the patronage of the restaurant establishments does not dare to predict what the celebrations will be like this month.
"People will think twice before making a reservation."
"They want to go out, but they're cautious when it comes to pricing," he adds.
Shops will go well for those "who offer quality and good service at a reasonable price," he says, recalling that the crisis has made customers tend to go down a notch and most customers now want to spend around 25 euros.
A survey of different facilities shows that the biggest onslaught of booking requests is on the evening of December 17.
Soteras Group reports a real boom in bookings for this Friday, with the most requests being for spending up to 30 euros, adjusted by menus that total prices range from 25 to 30 euros.
in another major company, Andilana, with 16 facilities in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), the peculiarity of this year's calendar has brought more early bookings since the beginning of November.
"We have done both the possible and the impossible to maintain last year's prices, and our menus, from which everyone should choose, range from 19.95 to 30 euros," they state.
The AN Group, which includes El Mussol, Attic, QuQu and has a total of 23 businesses, remains optimistic after seeing a rise in profits since the second half of the year and having a fairly solid outlook for Christmas sales.
The company's sources stress that December 18 will also be a busy day as pre-Christmas celebrations between friends will take place.
they added a Christmas menu to their six group menus, with a budget of 30 euros or more, as they experienced a tendency for guests to spend 10% more in exchange for other items such as cava (Spanish sparkling wine - nb.
They also noted that companies are already appearing to invite their employees again, and the size of the groups seems to be slightly larger.
Enric Goma, vice president of Fecasarm (which includes institutions such as the Barcelona Bar, Restaurant and Leisure Association), believes he is beginning to see the end of the tunnel and says the number of bookings has "recovered", even though clients are "bargaining to the maximum."
This impression did not subside even during the Christmas celebrations, no matter who pays, he points out.
Pakistan's Nuclear Program Spawns Great Unrest in the US
Islamabad produces nuclear weapons "at a faster rate than any other country."
Wikileaks documents confirm ties between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The contents of correspondence between the United States Embassy in Pakistan and the U.S. State Department published by Wikileaks confirm the extraordinary unrest that pakistan's nuclear program is arousing in Washington.
In addition to the clarifying and significant details they offer regarding the content of communication and the ideas of representatives of North American diplomacy in Islamabad, these documents reveal that cooperation between the two countries in terms of nuclear safety, rather than increasing, is "in decline," and that this unstable Asian country produces "more nuclear weapons than any other state."
The peculiarity of Pakistan's nuclear program - that its weapons are not assembled, but stored in parts to make it difficult to destroy them in the event of an attack - is one of washington's main reasons for vigilance.
This is calculated by The Ambassador to Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, in a report before the visit of then-National Security Adviser James Jones: "The proximity of some nuclear facilities to Taliban-controlled territory, the alleged dispersal of nuclear materials, and the vulnerability of the transport of atomic materials."
The increased number of people associated with nuclear arsenals and the missile program is no longer observed only by the US, but also by Russia, as a spreading and present reason to be alert.
"Pakistan had to hire personnel with strict religious beliefs to protect nuclear facilities; given the decline in education and culture levels, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people to work in nuclear or missile programs," said Yuri Korolev, an expert at the Russian Foreign Ministry, in a meeting with his US counterparts.
The biggest novelty of the documentation published by Julian Assange's server is the increasing cooperation between the US and Pakistan on nuclear proliferation and the increased pace of Pakistani production of such weapons.
A dispatch issued by the embassy in May, which classifies communication with Pakistan as "frustrating," states: "Transparency often does not exist; offers of assistance remain unsothed or are rejected'.
in another report, Peter Lavoy, national intelligence officer for South Asia, notes that "despite the economic disaster, Pakistan produces nuclear weapons as quickly as any other state in the world."
Ambassador Petterson also asks Washington to "make it very clear" during a visit by army chief General Ashfaq Kayani that "the Pakistani army must put an end to its silent support for terrorist groups."
The Hunt for the Wikileaks Chief
Obama appoints a high-ranking counterterrorism official to avoid new leaks.
Interpol is issuing a "red alert" to track down and determine where Assange might be.
Everything about Wikileaks and its founder Julian Assange forms a complicated labyrinth where it is hard to be sure of the facts.
Interpol yesterday announced an "extraordinary call", the red notice, to "locate and track the movements" of Assange.
However, this is not a classic detention order.
Besides, this challenge is not new, but it dates back to November 20.
And it has nothing to do with the latest leak of more than a quarter of a million diplomatic documents, but with the allegations of sexual abuse that australians face in Sweden.
In addition, Wikileaks creator Mark Stephens' attorney assures that "the police know where and how to contact Mr. Assange."
It was November 20th when the International Police Force, based in Lyon, France, issued the order at sweden's request, but did not publish it until yesterday, when it received permission from swedish authorities.
Against this situation, Interpol's 188 countries have instructions to identify or locate Assange "with a view to imposing temporary detention on him and issuiting him."
Although Interpol cannot order the detention of a person concerned by the red notice, many Member States, as the organisation explained, consider the so-called red notice to be allowing arrests to be made - this must be ensured by the national police force - especially when states have a bilateral agreement on extradition, as is the case with Sweden and England, where Assange is believed to be.
The move offended Assenge's lawyers, who published a letter yesterday claiming that the 39-year-old Wikileaks founder had shown a willingness to answer questions from the Swedish authorities via videoconference.
They also recall that Assenge requested and subsequently received permission to leave Sweden from the prosecutor of his case, which they compare to the legendary Lavrentiy Pavlovitch Berija, stalin's head of security.
"This is a hunt, not a legal pursuit," the letter states.
While the whole world is looking for him - and from Australia his mother defends his son's innocence - Assange remains in an unfamiliar place, but he is not silent.
on Monday, he gave an interview via Skype from an unknown location to the editor-in-chief of Time magazine - in which he demanded the resignation of Us Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
"If it turns out that she was responsible for ordering U.S. diplomats to conduct espionage at the UNITED Nations in order to violate international conventions that the United States has signed, she should resign," he said.
His view was rejected yesterday by White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs, who called the resignation request "ridiculous and absurd."
"I'm not entirely sure why we should care about the opinion of the individual who runs the website," he told CNN.
Obama himself has commissioned a high-ranking counterterrorism official, Russell Travers, to prevent further document leaks.
President Barack Obama's intention to stop attaching importance to Assange contrasts with the views that conservative politicians and commentators have been proclaiming these days.
Peter King, a member of Congress who will chair the House of Commons National Security Committee from January, asked the State Department to explore the possibility of including Wikileaks as a terrorist organization "so that anyone who contributes or otherwise provides assistance to them can be intervened and prosecuted."
Tom Flanagan, an adviser to Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper, went further, saying that Assange should be "killed," which he subsequently had to call off.
"Obama should put a bounty on him or use an unmanned aircraft or something."
Who didn't apologize was Mike Huckabee, a Baptist priest, former governor of Arkansas and possible presidential candidate.
"Whoever is in government, whoever is responsible for the leak, has committed treason, and any punishment other than execution would be too lenient," he told Fox News.
Puigcercós seeks peace in ERC by 'blinking' at Carod supporters
The Republican leader will allow the party a secret vote to remain.
Huguet proposes a more plural executive and an end to the meeting system.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found a recipe for fighting several internal revolts within the ERC ranks (Left-wing Republican Party of Catalonia), to no ava the point of losing 11 MPs and half the vote.
The party leader is aware that his gesture of resignation seems insufficient to the supporters of former leader Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira, and he also knows that the sector's influence is now as weakened as its leader itself, and that he absolutely cannot be as concerned as he was with other defunct currents.
That is why the leader of the Left will try to win new critics with a wink to help him get into the municipal elections.
First, Puigcercós announced yesterday that more than 200 members of the national committee would be able to secretly vote to remain in office.
Using ballots, not by raising your hand.
If Carod's supporters want to give the President a criminal vote, they will be able to do so without fear of retaliation.
In fact, the boss wants to avoid splits and subjugation.
in several interviews, he claimed that he would not consider himself confirmed with half the votes and one more, but added, without specifying the percentages, that there would also be no good result "after Bulgaria."
Carod's supporters are demanding more from the President than to make his office available - a gesture that has no weight, as Puigcercós controls the largest body at the conventions.
But since they don't have a majority to enforce their resignations, they'll try to remind the executive of the plan from now until May.
As a result, they expect to participate in the drafting of a document on strategic reorientation, which will be put to the national council on 18th day of the month.
They aim to support Puigcercós in exchange for this promise to move Congress as early as the fall of 2011.
The ERC leader said that "multi-proate" was damaging stability, and that his goal was for the organization to be able to wash its dirty laundry behind closed doors once and for all.
in this context, the article that current advisor Josep Huguet signed on his blog seems to be characteristic.
After taking into account Puigcercós' ideologue, this innovation adviser took it as a done deal that the leader would be confirmed "in exchange for several goals."
And he named five of them, two of which stand out.
The first is to "re-incorporate" the executive to represent at least 90% of the members, which also means including new faces who are from a sector favored by Tsarnaev.
The second goal can be big news.
Huguet proposes that the ERC should put an end to the meeting al-Establishment as a mechanism of operation.
And so he is fighting for the reform of the statutes so that congresses can be held through delegates selected by vote.
Ending the model of the meeting system, an exception in spain's system of political parties, is the intended goal of Puigcercós's team, which has fought in this direction at the last two congresses.
However, the convulsive assembly of 2008 decided that the meeting must be assessed at a special congress on the reforms of the statutes.
This matter is still pending, as the situation within the party has discouraged the resolution of this matter.
Now, without the critical sectors lurking, it might be a good time to look again at this matter and try to close it once and for all.
23 murdered in November; 390 for 2010
According to MILENIO, Mexico saw a decrease of 4 cases compared to 2010.
In November, 23 people were killed in Mexico, four fewer than the previous month, as reported by MILENIO.
Among the murders stand out are the cases of three women and the discovery of a pair of separate bodies in the Valley of Mexico.
in the penultimate month of the year, there are a total of 390 killings in Mexico, probably linked to organized crime.
Among the cases stands out is the discovery of a corpse in San Diego de los Padres Cuexcontitlán, in Toluca County.
The victim suffered at least three gunshot wounds, a mercy wound to the head, and her arms and legs were bound with rope.
The next day, a body was found in a suitcase that was stored in the trunk of a vehicle above Mixtecas Street, in the Santa Cruz Acatlán colony, naucalpan county.
Early on the morning of Thursday, November 4, cooperatives discovered a body bearing signs of torture and at least three fatal shots to the chest off the Tenango-Ixtapan de la Sal highway in a stretch of Villa Guerrero district.
Next to the body was a message signed probably by the criminal organization La Familia Michoacana.
A day later, a 50-year-old man was killed by eight shots in Nezahualcóyotl after he left his house to start collecting garbage.
On November 7, two victims, aged 30, were killed by a bullet to the head in the San Pedro Xalaxtoc colony, ecatepec county.
in Chalco, the body of a man shot in the forehead was found on a secluded road in el Naranjo colony, and a shell casing from a .25 caliber weapon was found under the body.
in Ecatepec, human body parts were found in a sewage canal in the Playa Golondrina colony.
Emergency services conducted a thorough search of other parts of it, but did not find them.
Residents of Tepotzottan reported finding a body with their hands tied back and their heads wrapped around the site of Pena Colorado.
The man had a gunshot wound to the back of his head.
in the middle of the month, the murder of two men, who were wrapped in bed linen and left in the luggage compartment of a vehicle in Villas de la Hacienda in the Atizapán de Zaragoza district, was reported to have been killed, with death threats also being found among the victims.
A day later, a cardboard box containing a human head was found in the Valle de los Reyes colony in Los Reyes La Paz district.
in a nearby colony, the rest of the body was found wrapped in a black plastic bag, with a message from El Incorregible.
On the 17th, two dead women were found wrapped in bed linen in the settlement of Zoquiapan in Ixtapaluca County, and the next morning a man was found killed in Huixquilucan wrapped in a yellow-and-blue sheet, which was tentatively identified as Mario Ríos, according to a report the killers left behind.
In Ixtapaluca, a woman with no signs of life was found in the san francisco settlement of Acuautla with two wounds to the back of the head.
Tattoos of the sacred figure santa muerte (literally "Holy Death" - nb. p.s.) as well as necklaces with her likeness were discovered on the skin of the woman.
At the end of the month, the body of a man with at least three gunshot wounds and a message signed by a criminal group was found in a car in the village of Zinacantepec.
Two days later, the bodies of two men with their heads wrapped in tape were found and a report was also found in the village of Puente de Piedra, in Santiago Tepatlaxco.
For the victims, the report was probably written by one of the criminal organizations, which said, "This will happen to those who do not adapt".
in Ecatepec, two bodies were found carrying signs of torture and their limbs bound, inside an abandoned taxi behind the Justice Center in the San Agustín colony.
On the last day of the month, the remains of two men were found in los reyes la paz and nezahualcóyotl counties.
The first was beheaded and found in the Cuchilla Ancón colony, and was wrapped in black plastic bags, bound with tape, with a message left with him; while the other was tortured and found in plastic wrappers in the streets of Colonia Juárez.
Along with him, agents found a note with a message.
China adheres to its goal of reducing greenhouse gases
The country's representative at the COP16 UN Climate Change Conference assured that his country had made extraordinary efforts to reduce its carbon footprint, and said it insisted on its promise to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40% to 45% by 2020.
China will keep its promise to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45% in 2020, said Su Wei, the country's representative at the UN climate change conference.
In his first public appearance at the 16th Conference of the Parties to the UNITED NATIONS Framework Convention on Climate Change, Su Wei assured that his country had made enormous efforts to reduce its carbon footprint and transform its industry.
He said his country has already invested $245 million over the past four years in efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
However, he made it clear that China will not change its objectives and will continue to work on this with the international community.
He reported that China's climate change strategy is divided into the following four items: dialogue, capacity building, institution building, and support for pilot programs.
They have already made progress on all of these points, including last year's passage of a new energy law that includes proposed targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, he explained.
He also stressed that in China, federal authorities worked in coordinated with provincial and local authorities to achieve their goals in terms of energy saving, efficient energy use, and emission reduction.
Furthermore, he said, various multi-year plans are under way or have already been finalised, which are financed by both the GOC and the governments of other states.
For example, he said, it is the Energy Efficient Energy Programme, which has been put in place over the last five years and which has received investment from the UN, government and private initiatives.
There is also a provincial climate change project, a project to replace fluorescent lamps with energy-saving bulbs, and a mitigation and adaptation project, he said.
At the same table, Martin Krol, the country's expert adviser on climate change, assured that China's efforts were greater than widely thought.
For example, he said, greenhouse gas emissions per capita represent 6 tons in China, compared with 100 tons in the United States; China is responsible for 9% of historical emissions.
It has also made unprecedented efforts to use energy - for example, it has increased energy efficiency by 20% over the past five years and expects to make further progress by 2020, he added.
Espin exclusion enaced: César Nava
The national chairman of the PAN (Partido Acción Nacional) party stated that the former chairman of the party is entitled to claim his right with the National Order Commission.
The national chairman of the PAN party, César Nava Vázquez, assured that the expulsion of Manuel Espina Barrientos had been enaced and that the party's former leader was entitled to address the National Order Commission and claim his right.
in an interview taken before the objection was raised by the State Governor Gabin Cué Monteagud, he said that the exclusion of Espin was in any event a decision taken at local level.
"This is an autonomous decision of the Order Commission of Sonora."
"Mr Espino has the right to appeal to the National Council's Order Committee in order to make a decision made by a competent authority," he added.
He went on to explain that now is not the time to think about 2012, and that she has never been at the negotiating table for the alliance's presidential candidacy.
Nava Vázquez expressed his belief that PAN would emerge from the internal elections held the following 4 and 5 December, in which his successor will be elected, strengthened.
"This (alliance in 2012) is a topic that has never been at the negotiating table, at least not yet, it was an intention for local elections that was successful and fulfilled its purpose," he said.
The PAN President said that 71 years of dialogue were behind his party, and therefore "we are not afraid of internal competition, on the contrary, we benefit from it and strengthen us," he added.
He said that the committee could, without a doubt, elect the best chairman or chair that pan deserves for the next three years, so he would pass the baton on to "whom the committee appoints."
"So I am absolutely calm and relaxed, I will proudly give the office of party chairman to any of the five".
He predicted that the upswing the party saw in the last election in July would be reflected in future contests, although "it is not yet time to think about 2012."
"Now it is necessary to accompany The Governor Gabin Cué in this task".
in this context, he stressed that the three governments, rooted in alliances in Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa, would be flag-flag-observed throughout the country, as "many expectations and desires are embedded in them, and I am sure Gabino will live up to those expectations."
When we asked him about president Felipe Calderón's criticisms by the PRI (Partido Revolucionario Institucional, Czech: Revolutionary Institutional Party, nb.)) Because of his speeches during the four years he has governed, César Nava has called on PRI members to think about the six-year terms of former Presidents Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
"If the PRI thinks that the governments of Zedillo and Salinas were better than the rule of Fox and Claderón, then let them start advocating for them to come out of their shells," he said.
He argued that the head of the federal executive has the right to express himself as he did during a speech at the National Auditorium, since there is no gag or censorship in this country.
Obama promotes bill on Twitter to support undocumented students
"If you think passing the Dream Act is the right thing to do, let your senators know and be induceding that they pass it," the US president tweeted on the popular social network.
President Barack Obama today joined a national mobilization in support of the Dream Act, which would legalize students without documents, by posting on his personal Twitter account.
"If you think passing the Dream Act is correct, let your senators know and call for this bill to be passed," Obama tweeted.
His short report highlights an internet link to a more extensive document asking the public to contact senators immediately as a vote on the bill approaches.
"Since the vote is expected to take place soon, now is the time to let your opinion be heard," he points out.
The report was released after 42 Republican senators threatened to block the passage of any bill unless an extension of Bush-era tax cuts and government funding was approved.
Such a block, announced in a letter signed by 42 Republican senators, could affect the vote on the Dream Act and other projects, such as ratifying a new nuclear proliferation treaty with Russia called START.
When asked about republican blocking of the Dream Act and other proposals, a presidential spokesman said he believed that once the fiscal issue was resolved, a calendar could be drawn up for the rest of the projects.
"I believe there's still time..."
"We all agree that we must resolve the tax issue before the end of the year..."
I believe that we can reach an agreement on this at some point and then we will be able to plan the order of other issues," he said.
Senate Democratic Majority Leader Harry Reid announced Tuesday that he would seek a "vote to close the debate" on the Dream Act, so that a bill to legalize undocumented students could be voted on in the Senate from next Thursday, although it is more likely next week.
Senate approval of the Dream Act, or "American Dream" law, would legalize roughly 800,000 young people who entered the United States before the age of 16, have resided in the country for the past five years, and have been admitted to higher education institutions or the military.
But supporters need 60 votes to pass the bill, which is why they need the help of several Republicans, so his supporters' organizations are conducting intense agitation to secure the passage of the bill.
Democrats, whose majority supports the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
However, at least one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, has said he will vote against it, and only one Republican, Richard Lugar of Indiana, has expressed his support for the bill.
That's why dream act supporters need to win over a few Republicans in case other Democrats decide to reject the bill.
Among the Republican senators most likely to negotiate are Maine Senators Olympia Snowe and Susan Colins, as well as outgoing Florida Senator George Lemieux, who filled in for Senator Mel Martínez.
Other Republicans who have supported the Dream Act in the past are Orrin Hatch of Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas, but they have said they will not support it next time.
Another Republican who supported the bill, John Mccain, has yet to comment at this time.
Although the House of Representatives is leaning toward a different version, most analysts say the Dream Act will face the biggest hurdles in the Senate.
with literature they put their finger in the wound ("poner el dedo en la llaga", translated "put your finger in the wound" is similar to the Czech "hit the nail on the head - nb.
The second round of the Pleasure of Language cycle was a promenade where participants put on a literary gala performance
"I understand that with Sex in language, but... Finger in the wound? What is expected of me?", asked the writer Luisa Valenzuel, who was invited to launch the second round of The Pleasure of Language, a cycle that celebrates literature written in the Spanish language, and whose question was used on this occasion as a subtitle (at another fair, they focused on the topic of Sex in language at a round table, she explained).
Finger in the wound "brings us into a tight spot," the Argentine writer said sweetly to an audience composed mostly of young people gathered at the Guadalajara International Book Fair to hear the roundtable debate moderated by Marisol Schultz and with valenzuelle, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Monter and Luis García Montero.
Luisa Valenzuel read the text she had dedicated to Gonzal Celoria, which Schultz then described as a great story, in which Luisa acted in the first person as the protagonist, who, in search of knowledge of what a "wound" is, goes from doctor to doctor, from whom she does not receive answers although traces of the same story do.
She leaves the infectologist convinced: "patience is not my strong suit, maybe it will be my blow".
Finally, after frustration with the traumatologist who took her breath away in the middle of the road, but explained that the wound is not a scientific term, it is the psychoanalyst who reveals the secret: "the wound represents a truly open wound, and the symbolic one is the scar".
The protagonist sighed lightly and concluded that "she had only been able to learn so much about the wound that it was really open and that it did not exist", but she became convinced that the pleasures and pitfalls of language must go hand in hand.
Writer Valenzuel played with both.
Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez also made an adorable story, which he called Praise of Invention, in which the finger in the wound is not named, but at one point appears.
with elements of magical realism, it tells of a famous witch who played clouds, brought back people who had gone far away, or corrected the righteousness lost by a virgin, this narrative, which was then turned to speak America, a great novel in which from the beginning his own chroniclers who told it were not missing, and bernal Díaz del Castillo is quoted here, which criticizes exaggeration in the narrative of conquering captains.
"Cervantes, who invented all of us (writers), was despired by fake testimonies that were presented as real in the stories, but in another way never managed to tell the story of America with such a picturery that lacked even shame".
However, he stressed, "they are fools and liars who have a greater imagination", and it is precisely where reality and lies merge, where it is no longer known which of the story belongs to one group and what belongs to another, that fictional literature reaches its peak.
He calls it a "Cervantes tradition."
"Thanks to his legacy, we have what we have."
Subsequently, Mayra Monterová emphasized and praised the variety of interpretations that the invitation of the International Book Fair with her discussion Finger in the Wound made possible.
The Cuban-Puerto Rican writer pointed her finger at the great blow to the social violence that runs through her country - and is shared by Latin America - and is the result of trade disputes and drug sales.
"I think good literature, good poetry and good songs make a quiet compromise that is obviously not intended," she said after edging that the reality of literature is the communication and dimension of the compromise that is being created between the author and readers - and in their "chemical reaction."
The evening was closed by the Spanish poet Luis García Montero, whose performance also emphasized "this finger in the wound of a writer bound by a writer."
He said that in a world that lives in haste, also in intellectual habits and consciousness control, which is teeming with dogmatism, it is forgotten that "behind every admissive there is a small no, and behind every denial there is also a small yes."
"In order to be masters of our thoughts and reality, we must color: and color means many times putting our finger in the wound and harassing those individuals who are much more comfortable because they think in caricatures, in black and white, in fixed ideas and without coloring, and also harassing the authorities who prefer this black-and-white world," he said, to promote the meaning of writing.
Romano goes for his first title
Rubén Omar Romano has three defeats in the final, he has experienced good and bad during his career, but he has already managed to reach the decisive series on three occasions.
in the santos laguna-monterrey duel in the final, two different styles will also meet, characterized by their techniques, teams that have a noticeable difference in results between them.
Rubén Omar Romano has three defeats in the final, he has experienced good and bad during his career, but he has managed to reach the decisive series on three occasions, but until now he has left with nothing, which is why this chance is extraordinary for him.
The Argentine had to settle for a silver medal, stayed one step behind the winners and played curiously with the same team in the following final.
As a coach, the Santa strategist reached his first final in the Apertura 2002 tournament when he held the reins of morelia, with whom he lost 4-2 against Toluca; then, in clausura 2003, he again advanced to the decisive duel and also lost it with a total score of 3-1, which was against the Rayados team.
Already with Santos Laguna in the Torneo Bicentenario tournament 2010, again against the "Devils" of Toluca, Rubén suffered defeat again, although his team played against the "Sausages" (another nickname of the club Deportivo Toluca - nb) after 210 minutes of play in a 2-2 tie, after a series of penalty shootouts he got a three-on-one advantage and had two opportunities to seal the title, but in the end his three players missed out on 11 steps and the team suffered a turnaround to 4-3.
Rubén has already lost two finals against the "Red Devils" of Toluka and one against Monterrey, his future rival, so he would like to avoid the same fate and get rid of the curse, so he can celebrate the title for the first time, although he says the most important thing for him is the institution.
"I want to come out victorious, I don't want to break the stats, this is for the club, for the passion I am committed to, and of course the title would be for me too, but the first one is the most important," the coach said when asked about the numbers that speak against him in the final.
in his vivid memory he has a previous final, in which, as he confirms, he learned a lot, "we learned the lesson that until the referee whistles the end, we cannot celebrate, we have to be ready for action, as well as the players, because last time with two penalties, we were already ready to run out to celebrate, and I think we have learned our lesson in this, until the game is over, we cannot celebrate".
He is not concerned that this series could be decided in penalty shootouts, he believes to his players: "You never try to make a series of penalty kicks, you try to end up in normal time, but sometimes there is no other option and we need to be prepared for it, we were ready in the last tournament, but unfortunately fate has prepared us for the wrong move, perhaps because of nerves or anxiety , which we felt when the title was in our hands, but we lost it, that left something in us and hopefully this time something like this will not happen".
Romano has a chance in his hands to stop being the other and get a first-time chance at the fame that titles bring.
U.S. changes visa rules
People will have to contact the Visa Applicant Services Centres before being interviewed by the Consular Department; costs will be lower and waiting times will be reduced.
From January 10, 2011, the visa process at the United States Embassy and consulates will change.
with the new procedure, most applicants will have to contact the Centres of Services for Visa Applicants (short for ASC English) before an interview at the Consular Department.
Staff from the ASC will remove the applicant's biometric information and it will be evaluated by the Consular Department before the interview.
The new procedure will have certain advantages, including the following:
The total cost of processing the visa will be lower, there will no longer be a fee for the appointment, the second for processing the application and another for the delivery of the document by the transport service.
The applicant shall pay only one fee covering all three services.
The current fare will remain unchanged: $140 for a tourist visa, $150 for visa cases with an application (including visas for temporary workers), and $390 for a visa for merchants and investors.
People wishing to renew their visa will not have to be interviewed by a consular officer, but will only contact the nearest ASC, where they will present their documents and fingerprint them.
As biometric information will be collected in the ASC, applicants who require a second meeting with an interview at the Consular Department will spend less time here than in the past.
Likewise, those applying for a visa at consulates in Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo will no longer pay an extra service fee of $26.

NASA announces discovery of extraterrestrial life
The U.S. Space Agency has called a press conference tomorrow to present a discovery that could cause a breakthrough in the search for extraterrestrial life.
The United States National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) will announce an astrobiological discovery tomorrow, Thursday, that could confirm the theory of the existence of extraterrestrial life.
The discovery will be presented tomorrow at 1 p.m. by experts in astrobiology, a science that studies the origins, evolution, spread and future of life in space, at a press conference at NASA headquarters in Washington.
When it invited journalists, NASA assured that it would present "a discovery that will cause a breakthrough in the search for extraterrestrial life," prompting speculation from experts from other countries.
The discovery could confirm the theory that there are other creatures besides us, living in inhospitable conditions that were considered unincupiable, and which could present the possibility that they will one day become intelligent creatures, such as humans, if the conditions in which they live improve.
It appears to be a microbe found at the bottom of Lake Mono in Yosemite National Park, California, where it lives in an environment that was considered too poisonous for any form of life because the lake is rich in arsenic.
The creature somehow uses arsenic for its life, and it is this ability that increases the likelihood that similar life could exist on other planets that do not have an atmosphere like earth.'
According to astrobiologists, if these organisms use arsenic in their metabolism, it will be proven that "there is another, second life form, different from the one we know."
The space agency will announce the true reach of the discoveries at a press conference tomorrow.
The conference will be attended by geobiologist Pamela Conrad, who studies the possibility of life on Mars; biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists who examines Titan (Saturn's largest moon) with the perspective that its chemical composition is similar to that on Earth.
PRD, PT, Covergencia and Patrón spawn an opposition "bloc"
Reforms to the Constitutional Law on Congress lead to the advent of "bipartisanship," they claim.
The 60th parliamentary term has not even begun yet, when an opposition bloc was formed in Congress, led by members of the PRD (Partido de la Revolución Democrática, Czech :' Democratic Revolution Party), PT (Partido del Trabajo, English for "Labour Party"), Convergencia (English for "Consensus") and Jesús Manuel Patrón Montalva, who declared himself independent, and the four discussed one thing : the arrival of "bipartisanship" in the Chamber of Deputies.
Before the start of the session at the opening of the 60th parliamentary term, Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez of the Convergencia party, Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza of the PT, Javier Corvera Quevedo of the PRD and Patrón Montalvo "thundered" against the reform of the Constitutional Law by eliminating them.
This reform, they repeated, begins with "bapartism," because now it will be two people from the same number of parties who will control Congress.
These four Members, together with Gloria Margarita Santos Aquilar, coordinator of the PRD party, were the only ones to vote against the Council, led by Salvador López Brito of the PAN (Partido Acción) and Luis Cárdenas Fonsecia as Vice-President.
Corvera Quevedo stated that these reforms institutionally constitute a political marginality at the insuit of the PRI (Partido Revolucionario Institucional) and PAN parties.
He specified that over the next few days they would be talking to representatives of the PAN and PRI parties to modify the scheme on the basis of political will, and if they did not have it, they would again be subjected to the two parties, ending the opposition coalition.
"When the (opposition coalition) came here, I'm looking at it because we're excluded from any decision, they're not even willing to consider the opinion of others".
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez of Convergencia said they were in agreement with PRD, PT and Patrón and would therefore form a plurality group.
It is impossible, he continued, for Congress, after being monopolistic, to now be "duopolite."
The aspiration of law reform is not to have endless bipartisanship in Congress.
The group starts with five legislators, and its members are now in the process of err on the talk with other colleagues to get more votes, as Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez added.
The PT's Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza explained that congress has now become the "prey" of two - alluding to pan and pri parties.
"It used to be controlled by only one party, today it is divided by two."
Patrón Montalvo demanded that the personality of the Member be respected in order to give him a seat at the negotiating table.
"So that the five Members, who are probably already nine, but who are seeing us in five right now, do not stay out of the way because of the arched agreements, each in a different faction, we have united to find a seat at the negotiating table, because the problem is that we are out of line in the reform they have created and agreed to," he said.
Another 200,000 pesos are issued for the "supplier"
The town hall in Mazatlán will pay another check to the discussed owner of the company supplying the electrical material.
Another check for a little more than 200,000 pesos was sent by city hall to Lorena Guadalupe Camacha Palazuelos.
This will result in 1,200,000 pesos paid to the owner of the company supplying the electrical material in the second half of the year.
According to the city hall transparency page, this last cheque number 9258447 was sent on November 16 of this year, was issued for 200,144.56 pesos and its subject matter was "compensation for outstanding payments".
Treasurer Luis Miguel López Moreno noted that the municipality would pay an additional amount to this contractor, which was monitored by the State Inspectorate for sale at high prices.
What hasn't been said is the total amount the town hall still owes her, and how many more checks will be sent to Camach Palazuelos.
"Nothing has been purchased now, it is only paying what we owe it, as well as other suppliers," he said in an interview.
The last cheques "reappeared" in the last quarter of the year: 24 September, two on 15 October, 19 October, 29 October and this last on 16 November.
Although the businesswoman has not yet been published in the Government Letter, as stated by law in the case of companies examined by the High State Review Office in order to prevent their services from being used by other administrations, the Treasurer assured that she had not re-used the services of the town hall supplier.
in the past, after July 25, Noroeste published a review of the cheques made by city hall to its suppliers, revealing that between March 2008 and July 9, 2010, during Mayor Jorge Abel López Sánchez's three-year term, the city of Camacha Paid Palazuelos more than 10 million pesos through 42 checks.
It also carried out transactions with Jumapam, where it collected cheques for more than 3 million pesos.
Tourist sites in dire need of maintenance
Tourist managers complain about the accident of a foreign tourist due to the poor condition of the Sánchez Taboada show in Mazatlán.
After a foreign tourist fell into a depression at the Sánchez Taboada show, mazatlán's tourism sector is asking authorities to pay attention to areas and places that are in poor condition, so as not to show the port in a good light.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, president of the Zona Dorada Region Traders Association, recalled that they have repeatedly asked to heed the impression of destination, and the bad things that tourists find here, in order to be replaced by new activities or routes.
He said the poor condition of streets and sidewalks is affecting tourists walking around and seeing the mess, which adversely affects nearby businesses.
"Politicians don't know what it's like to close a business for a day, and they have no idea of the sales that are leaking, otherwise they wouldn't have dealt with these issues for so long without proper planning".
Hotelier José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said the tourist's fall was caused by a lack of preventive measures and maintenance by city hall.
"City Hall will have to take responsibility and prevent something like this from happening again, it will have to do preventive maintenance, not just fix existing defects," he said.
We would like to enjoy a clean city, because not only because we are a tourist area, maintenance should be done, because even as residents we deserve a clean residence, the town hall should change its strategy of maintaining the city".
There are other places that look neglected and pathetic, he noted, such as the Mazatelin Emblem and El Venadito (monument, statue of a deer).
"Nowadays, in order for tourists to come, it is not only about promotion that it is necessary to offer a good product, that is, a city full of cleanliness of its beaches and streets, where constant maintenance of tourist attractions is carried out," he said.
"There was no attention to it, and these facts highlight something that is well known to everyone, maintenance is lacking.
He talked about a number of places to be put in order in cooperation with city hall, said the priority must be to keep the city clean and orderly to make it attractive as it has tourist potential.
Raúl Llera Martínez, a sub-secretive of the Tourist Graduation, said that rescuing tourist sites in Mazatlán is urgent as they are not used properly and do not make a good impression.
Fortunately, Mazatlán offers many historical and cultural goals and spaces, but this will need to be put in order to make these places more attractive first and to put them on the list that we have to promote this destination".
IP asks Congress for results
Eduardo Gaveos, president of the CCE, would like MPs to take great responsibility by setting an example in seeking a better Sinaloa, in the various challenges facing the state.
A parliamentary term of dignified work and no agreements between the parties and the State Executive demands the business sector in Mazatlán, as Sinaloa is convulsed and facing major problems.
Since yesterday, the 60th parliamentary term has been launched, consisting of seven political forces, 19 PRI members, 13 from the PAN, three from the Partido Nueva Alianza party, two from the PRD, one from the PT, one from the Convergencia party and the last from the PVEM party, which includes a total of 40 national representatives.
The list of expectations from new members of Congress is that they can implement decent leadership, with commitments to society and various areas that require responsible legislative work, and that the same partisan and paternalist patróns will not be repeated.
Eduardo Gaveos Zamora, chairman of the Coordinating Business Council (CCE), suggested that the recently elected 40 members of Congress take great responsibility and set an example on the road to a better Sinaloa in the various challenges they face.
"We expect members to actually exercise their right, without agreements between the parties, because they usually take measures to advance their own interests and become carnival parades of rulers and leaders of parliamentary factions".
That is why he spoke of the need to reaffirm the commitment to establish the necessary bridges to move the ruling government forward in order.
"We want them to do a dignified job and, above all, be committed to society and sectors, because it was the people of Sinaloa who gave them confidence in their vote in the last elections".
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, president of the Tres Islas Hotel Association, said that one of the biggest challenges for the 40 national representatives would be to muster up all the forces in order to achieve the country's economic growth, because the current economic situation is very complex.
The most important thing is that they encourage economic growth, to create incentives for investment and infrastructure, which will support the creation of jobs in some way".
As for tourism, he demanded that the new legislators give him more weight within the state budget and support the Ministry of Tourism.
"I have learned that it is the ministry with the second lowest budget, which is disproportionate given that this is an important economic activity, bringing in foreign prices and investments that, moreover, are directly in competition with agriculture".
In addition to isting funds for start-up tourism projects, Congress should help provide the state with certainty and help with the alcohol law, which has failed to resolve in previous parliamentary terms.
Looking for the Three Kings
Dolls, cars and bicycles are on the Coronado Valenzuel family's wish list along with other toys.
It will be difficult for their parents to live up to their expectations on the upcoming Three Kings Holiday, as their household consists of exactly 12 people and one ram.
But Adelaida, Isabel, Jesús, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaías, José Juan and Miguel do not lose hope that Kaspar, Melichar and Baltazar will give them the toys and clothes they so desire.
The family lives in a modest dwelling in colonia Salvador Allende in poor conditions, as the father does not have a permanent job.
"Sometimes it's hard because my husband's unlucky, but we sell tangerines and potatoes... In the afternoon, I go out with "plebeians" on the street to sell on the street," said Cayetana Valenzuel Andrade, the children's mother.
Four-year-old Adelaide wants a doll or bike, while her three-year-old sister Isabel would like a Barbie doll.
As for 10-year-old José Alfredo, he'd wanted a "monster" car for some time, and for his eight-month-old brother Jesús, Cayetana would like a one-year-old outfit.
"He told me (José Alfredo) 'I wish I had this monster car', but I said 'we're going to see my son' because it was very expensive," Cayetana recalls with sadness.
Clothes and shoes would be ideal for older children who were at school.
María Guadalupe, who is 11 years old, is a size 12, 10-year-old Isaías is a size 10, while eight-year-old Miguel wears a size 8.
14-year-old Jose Juan is missing sneakers, so he could really use a five-and-a-half or six pair.
To help fulfill the dreams of the Coronado Valenzuel family, you can participate in the "Three Kings Are Wanted" campaign and bring a gift or money in cash at noroeste's reception.
14 alleged drug traffickers arrested
Dozens of inspections were carried out in Estria on Wednesday as part of the liquidation of a network for the production and sale of Indian cannabis.
Fourteen people have been arrested and face various charges.
Searches were carried out in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, mostly in drug-making locations.
"Approximately 750 flowerbeds of Indian cannabis, four kilograms of hashish, money and equipment used for production have been seized," said Louis-Philippe Ruel, a spokesman for the Quebec Police.
In total, 11 men and three women were arrested, both alleged bosses of the network, two men from Sherbrooke.
The arrested persons had to appear at sherbrooke's palace of justice following their arrest.
They could face charges of producing Indian cannabis, possession with the aim of trafficking it, conspiracy and theft, among others.
These searches took place following a long-running investigation that lasted almost a year.
"It was information that we received from the public that allowed us to make these arrests," Mr Ruel said.
About 70 officers from the Regional Investigation Unit of the State Police of Quebec, the Sherbrooke State Police and the Sherbrooke Memphrémagog Police Administration participated in this police operation.
Illegal migration will be able to continue without problems.
A conservative bill that the government says should regulate the problem of ships loaded with illegal immigrants will clearly be defeated , while all three opposition parties said on Wednesday that they could not support it.
"I rely heavily on the Charter."
"I'm standing upright on the side of the party that built granite under your feet," liberal leader Michael Ignatieff said, surrounded by MPs after a week-long session of the weekly du caucus.
Liberals insist that the bill, as proposed, would allow the withering of up to a year any person coming from a ship identified as carrying illegal immigrants would violate Canada's Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
The head of the Quebec Bloc, Gilles Duceppe, also said he could not support the bill because it was headed for the wrong goal.
"We are against it and all opposition parties seem to be against it, so we will see what the government does," Mr Duceppe said.
The NPD's critic on immigration, Olivia Chow, has rejected critics who want her party not to be strong enough when it comes to illegal immigrants.
"The Neo-Democrats agree to take action against illegal immigrant smugglers, and that is what we consider to be the main part of another bill, the C-35," Ms. Chow said.
"We do not support the Conservatives' bill because it blames refugees and puts children in prison for at least a year," Ms Chow explained.
Immigration Minister Jason Kenney blamed opposition parties.
"Canadians are collectively educated by MPs that they do not tolerate this kind of illegal migration, these criminal operations that target Canada and treat it like some kind of sycophant."
They expect Canada to take consistent action, Secretary Kenney said.
The government has not called a vote of confidence in its bill, which could lead the country to vote to reject it.
Meanwhile, a Conservative told QMI that the government would demand that any MP who opposes answer for their position in front of their constituents.
New unity does not mean unanimity
Despite the announcement of the possible creation of a permanent unit to combat corruption and co-operation, many observers continue to call for the creation of a public commission of inquiry into the issue.
The Secretary of Public Safety, Robert Dutil, is working to ensure that the idea does not fall into oblivion: Quebec intends to consult with the New York Department of Investigation as early as January next year.
The metropolis has had a permanent anti-corruption unit since 1870.
That's why Tuesday's announcement surprised many of us.
It should be noted that at the meeting of the Permanent Council for Police Services in Quebec on 29 October last year, this measure was not discussed, even though Robert Dutil himself was present.
More than that, there was no need for public safety critic PQ Stéphane Bergeron to rate the announcement as a "rabbit pulled out of a hat" and an "amateur solution botched on his bike."
Minister Dutil himself has responded to those who fear that political power has too much influence on the possible future of unity.
"He'll settle for confirmation: you'll see the result when we announce it."
"We are aware of this problem."
For csq president Réjean Parent, nothing can replace setting up witness interviews at a public hearing.
"Moreover, Mr. Charest is certifying that he does not want to create this commission of inquiry, and people think, like you and I, that he is hiding something," he explains.
"The only way to achieve the creation of a commission of inquiry is the resignation of Jean Charest," explains Yves Boisvert, professor of ethics and political science at the Institute for the Education of Senior Civil Servants.
In order to break this impasse, he proposed that Quebec grant special authorization to the inspector general to investigate co-ins and corruption.
"We must be able to extend the mandate of the Inspector General," he said.
It also considered that Quebec could give the inspector the same powers as the commissioner, who is allowed to force people to testify.
The creation of a permanent working group is not the only proposal in the Charest government's files.
Quebec would also after Ottawa to change the Penal Code to better tailor it to this type of crime.
This requirement would be based on the Commissioner for Operation Marteau (Hammer), who informed Justice Minister Jean-Marc Fournier that the case law on this type of investigation was not explicit.
Federal Minister for Public Security, Vic Toews, has confirmed that his colleague in the judiciary, Rob Nicholson, is currently looking into some of the amendments linked to this dossier.
In Operation Spring 2001, which affected groups of bikers, although the Criminal Code has not yet been amended, 131 people were arrested.
Ottawa subsequently had changes made to the Gangster Act.
Rivers under close supervision.
Several watercourses have come under heavy control due to heavy rainfall that has fallen since Tuesday in several regions of the province.
There was a landslide in Shawinigan, Mauritius, on Wednesday afternoon.
Two houses were evacuated as a precaution.
In the evening, another landslide occurred in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, Lanaudière.
The road's bent.
From Tuesday to Wednesday evening, several regions were hit by heavy rainfall, i.e. between 40 and 70 millimetres of rain.
Between 20 and 40 more millimetres were not expected from today until Thursday evening, by region.
Stretches to the north of the river and in the Outaouais Valley were hit the hardest.
A total of up to 100 millimeters could fall there.
If we add up these precipitation with the melting of snow accumulated in some sectors, we may be worried about flooding in some watercourses.
The Quebec Ambulance Service issued a flood warning for the Ouareau and Achigan rivers in Lanaudière on Wednesday evening.
Rivers in the north, in Saint-Jérôme, in the Laurentides forest, and in Chêne, lotbinière, have become the subject of flood alert and 24/7 control.
In the de Lanaudière area, heavy rainfall caused the distribution of some lakes, in Sainte-Julienne, sainte-marcelline-de-Kildare, as well as rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, a makeshift bridge was torn down as a result of heavy rains.
Two residences had to be evacuated as a precaution.
In Outaouais, the spill of some lakes from the shores caused some roads to be closed, especially in Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
Emergency services are on standby to monitor the situation in the area, said Annik Bouchard, a security consultant.
Quebec's Flood Prediction Center issued a severe flood warning for several rivers on Wednesday, not least Maskinongé, Assomption, Ouareau, Achigan, Batiscan and Loup.
Dupont partially blaming
Quebec radio host Stéphane Dupont suffered a partial setback before Canada's Radio and Television Standards Board (RRTV) over controversial statements about social assistance and Haitians and, as well as crude language during broadcasting.
The Radio and Television Council consider that Mr Dupont and his group from CHOI 98,1 FM had the right to express their views, but some statements contained 'inaccurate information on social assistance and inappropriate negative descriptions of Haitians of crude language that does not correspond to broadcasts broadcast during the day'.
The Council also concluded that the discussions on suicide, including the broadcast of the names of the two people who took their own lives, did not violate the broadcasting rules.
The Broadcasting Council received several complaints concerning comments made during the broadcast, broadcast between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was made following a complaint by the Joint Front of Quebec Social Support Recipients.
The group complained that the amounts shown on the broadcast were inaccurate.
Moderators must provide reliable information, not deceptive information.
As for suicide, moderator Stéphane Dupont thought suicide was a gesture of desperation.
The majority of the Members of the Commission concluded that the report transmitted was such that suicide cannot be understood as a solution to the problems of everyday life.
"The majority of the Commission considers that the disputed episodes of "Dupont's Noon News" have encountered a delicate subject in an impartial and appropriate manner."
No complaints were made against him.
The latest controversy concerned statements following the earthquake in Haiti.
So Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort became involved in a media firefight that elicited many reactions.
The CHOI moderator said he didn't send any donations to help Haitians because we can't know for sure that the needy will actually get the money.
The Commission considers that these comments were not unjustified, but that their cumulative effect creates an unduly negative picture of Haitians.
"I've already amolined my three-day postponement of that thing."
"My file has been intact for one and a half years," the moderator said.
In all decisions, the Commission refuses to use coarse language on the air.
In any case, CHOI-FM radio broadcasts cooperated 'beyond their responsibilities'.
For a station which will, inter alia, have to notify these decisions once during the main broadcast within a period of three days, the consequences are minimal.
King du kung fuvà of Montreal.
Montreal resident, originally from Algiers, Nacereddine Zemmal, has an extremely strange run-in.
The athlete, who excels in "full contact" (kung fu), kickboxing and Thai boxing, enters the tatami and rings of the world in search of new challenges.
"I started martial arts like kung fu and kickboxing 12 years ago, in Algeria," said Zemmal, who has lived in the capital since 2008 to study with professionals."
"In my case, I look for matches a bit everywhere, because for those who don't like the game on the ground that appears in combat sports, competitions in North America are rare."
Recently, this man, who works as a security guard and as a helper for UPS, has just delivered bad news to his rivals by winning two gold medals at the World Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA), from October 23-30, in Edimburg, Scotland.
"I won the full contact kickboxing and Thai boxing categories," he said.
"I'm currently preparing for china for the San Shou World Cup."
"They were invited by opponents who finished in the top four at the last World Cup in each category."
"I won bronze in Toronto in 2009."
"I finished eighth in Vietnam in 2005."
"In 2007 in China, I finished fifth in the tournament, while in Toronto in 2009 I finished third , he added."
"Interestingly, I've made some progress in every competition."
"At this rate, I'll be the first this year or next year!"
"san shou" or "sanda" is a discipline originating in China, where punches and feet, as well as throwing on the ground, are allowed.
Matches are traditionally played on the platform and more rarely in the ring.
The most famous boxer, born of this form of combat, is an American of Vietnamese origin, Cung Le, well known in the martial arts world.
While Nacer Zemmal is only supposed to keep one result in his career, he will boldly confirm his participation in the "King of Sanda" superturnate, the Super Bowl in kung fu.
"This competition is the highest and most prestigious in China," explains the nice guy."
"It's kind of the equivalent of Stade Lumpinee (the biggest stadium in Thailand)."
"It was a great experience."
Zemmal won his first fight, in the semi-finals of his category (80 kg), before suffering a loss in the final.
"The one who beat me was a real pro, he analyzed."
"There are four competitors in the category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg et 90 kg)."
"The winners of the semi-finals will compete in the final of their category."
"Then the winners of each category will compete so that a single champion, the king of kung fu, can be crowned."
450 million contracted without tenders
Hydro-Quebec has agreed by mutual agreement to $450 million in contracts with engineering firms for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydroelectric project.
At the heart of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts is a consortium formed from BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor,which won the most important contract, a contract to manage the entire project for a total of $295 million without a tender.
In 2004, this consortium, on behalf of Énergie Gérance, was authorised, in parallel with hydro-québec's selection, to entrust its responsibility to the private sector for the management of this important hydroelectric project worth $5 billion.
At the beginning of 2005, the consortium "Énergie gérance" won a lucrative contract without any tender announcement.
For the Quebec side, the complaint against the consortium of companies raises a serious ethical issue that risks eliminating competition and triggering price increases.
"It's a new way to realize coding and eliminate competition."
"This means that people who no longer make side deals secretly now do them openly," PQ MP Sylvain Simard said at a press conference yesterday.
A little earlier in the morning, Mr Simard asked this question to the National Assembly, because he says he bears the heavy hand how the public interest can be sold in this way.
In the afternoon, The Minister for Natural Resources, Nathalie Normandeau, objected, vigorously denying that the contract was co-signed.
"I have my own way," she thundered, claiming that PQ was "dishonest" and "lacked accuracy."
She said that "that would be the least of it" that PQ would apologize.
The recipe for forming a consortium is a common practice worldwide.
This is usually a time-limited alliance that allows two or more businesses to group their expertise together in order to respond to a call for tenders for a complex project.
The Eastmain project is very complex in terms of the extensiveness of the works.
Construction is already underway and must be laid out by 2012.
However, the contract was awarded without competition being able to act; It was business.
It must also be acknowledged that the form of consortia is no longer an exception in Quebec, even for relatively simple projects.
As Le Devoir revealed last week, the formula of consortia in engineering consultancy is under investigation by the government.
If we move quickly through the quebec companies' business register, it will allow us to discover more than 200 consortia, some of which appear to have been created permanently.
This is how Dessau works in partnership with most of its main competitors; let's name CIMA+, Geniusvar, SNC-Lavalin and Roche and Tecsult.
Each combination, and there are dozens of them, leads to the same legal entity, and that is Dessau.
As regards the Énergie gérance consortium, Minister Normandeau underlined in particular the fact that 'la Baie James is characterised by a particular labour dynamics and that Hydro-Québec has been responding to it since the 1970s'.
Eastmain's chief patron, Réal Laporte, of baie james energy company (SEBJ), gave an explanation that will force us to wrinkle our foreheads at the fact that the project management contract was concluded by mutual agreement.
"If you're going to a contest and if there are few bidders, your bid prices may be higher."
"You have two choices: that you pick up the people who are in the contract as contestants, and that you say, "Let's make a deal that's satisfactory and at a good price."
"But the main idea is that it's not the price that's important, it's the competence of the people," Mr. Laporte said.
This contract awarded to the Énergie gérance consortium is part of a long list of contracts worth more than $50,000 received by the Quebec Party.
Contracts were concluded with Hydro-Québec or SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
After the verification, Le Devoir counted 109 engineering consultancy contracts concluded between 2002 and March 2010 with companies or their branches, in particular laboratories carrying out soil sample analyses.
SNC-Lavalin has won 22 contracts, of which Geniusvar has won 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10 without having a stake in Énergie Gérance.
All contracts have been concluded.
Together, they total $449,783,344, including a contract with Énergie Gérance for $295,131,564.
Sylvain Simard suggested that the four firms that are part of the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) are "very good acquaintances of the Quebec Liberal Party."
Minister Normandeau leaked a report that PQ was also linked to the firms that "finance" it, before specifying that it was more about its executives.
Barometer of responsible consumption - "green" label does not inspire confidence
More green, but openly skeptical.
The Quebec consumer has very little confidence in sustainable development actors, but also in "impartial" brands and environmental certifications, to follow the choice of products accordingly.
Worst of all, even as we bathe in a media universe that urges us to consume more socially responsible consumption, this media universe laments the lack of credible information, the non-compliance with obligations that it evenqualifies as a brake on its commitment, says Baromètre of Responsible Consumption, the first article of which was published yesterday.
Although consumption of so-called socially responsible products increased in 2010, quebecers who try to sell them still don't trust them very much
In fact, two-thirds of us say they don't believe in companies' environmental promises, simply because the company's green advertising finds a measuring tool developed by the University of Sherbrooke's Responsible Consumption Observatory.
Another finding: half of consumers doubt the credibility of official certificates attributed to so-called fair products, but also the credibility of products and brands that are referred to as environmentally responsible, Barometre says.
In the same way, the debate of politicians on this subject is accepted as serious by only 14.6% of the quebec population.
However, information on responsible consumption seems to be paramount to stimulating this side of consumption, which is currently being revived by almost a third of Quebec consumers.
Indeed, the vacuum and dubious nature of the information would alleviate the enthusiasm of 46% of consumers.
This is the second brake identified by Baromètre, after the higher price of these products.
After all, a third of Quebecers are distrustful of the product data or "green" services we are looking for to let them pass through our hands.
On the other hand, in 2010, almost half of consumers were willing to change their habits and, in particular, change the brand of one or more products, thereby responding to their beliefs.
A full 61% of them preferred to shop with merchants in their neighborhood and preferred to buy food grown in their region, Baromètre says.
More "green" and responsible - the responsible consumption index reached 64 out of a maximum of 100 for this year - , Homo consumus Of Quebec likes to present itself as the king of recycling, which strives for the least environmental impact by taking care of animal protection.
But their social and environmental conscience apparently remained outside their car, Baromètre says: in 2010, barely 28% of Quebecers said they used public transportation or that they recommended using the car to drive at least two people, in the interest of conservation.
Walking and bike were also supported by 39.1% of participants in this large-scale behavioral survey who used this cliché.
State loan to buy eXcentris cinema complex
The Government of Quebec, which we have asked for financial participation in the purchase of the eXcentris cinema complex by Angus et le Parallèle, agrees to participate, but only up to the amount of the loan.
The development company "Angus et le Parallèle", which sought a $7 million donation from the Minister of Culture to buy the cinema complex on Saint-Laurent Boulevard and which proved its mission as a lover of film art, did not get what it demanded.
The government accepts that it will be included in the documentation, but on its own terms.
Rather than the expected donation, the Government of Quebec is proposing a loan, the amount of which would be lower, some of which were initial expectations that could lay the foundation for a viable solution on favourable terms and with resources coming from the State.
The first action plan and the demand for 12.8 million were already rejected by Quebec last spring, but applications have already been revised to reduce.
The proposal and plan of action was sent to Minister St-Pierre by the President of the Society for the Development of Entrepreneurship in Culture (SODEC), François Macerola, who manages the eXcentris cinema project.
The final message was sent 10 days ago.
But the government's counter-proposed came to SODEC on Tuesday.
Le Parallèle et Angus has until 31 December to respond.
However, it seems that the hypothesis of a gift from the state must indeed be rejected.
Recall that the Association of Cinema Owners and Cinema Centres in Quebec opposed a direct state investment to support the purchase of eXcentris, in the view that the Minister of Culture should not finance a real estate project if he did not do so for other cinemas.
But several participants in the debate, on the other hand, called for substantial economic support.
Daniel Langlois, the owner, got film art into his cinemas within a decade after he financed the construction of the complex himself, which may have been the reason for the change by the state's finance board.
The lack of halls for independent films is garish in Montreal, and eXcentris has been able to gain a permanent clientele.
Angus et le Parallèle, with Christian Yaccarini at its head, is running a campaign to free up funds to the private sector, believing it will raise $700,000 to push through the acquisition.
Since spring 2009, only one of the three film companies, Le Parallèle, has continued to distribute films for eXcentris.
The aim of future acquirers is to reopen all three halls on 27 February next year and to screen Xavier Beauvois's most beautiful film Men and Gods.
But Christian Yaccarini didn't mention Le Devoir, so he ignores himself, so he and his group think about the reduction proposals that are being made to him.
The curtain raised on Canada as a whole...
New diplomatic American sources familiar with wikileaks reveal what the United States sees as a complex of Canadian inferiority toward Americans, but they also reveal their sense of superiority toward Canada.
American diplomats, therefore, are surprised that every Canadian voter cares about Canadian-American relations when they vote, and believes that President Obama's visit helped the conservative government adopt its budget in 2009!
Four new reports, which included the U.S. Embassy in Ottawa and Washington, aired yesterday, also provide sensitive details to get "under each other's skin."
The Communication dated 22 September 2008, i.e. in the middle of an election campaign, details at what point the United States is not part of the bets discussed by political leaders.
Much to the surprise of the U.S. Ambassador to Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr Wilkins provides several explanations for this situation.
"Canada's inferiority complex, almost entased, may make political leaders subject to talking about internal bets instead of realizing that this election also applies to the United States (as in the 1988 free trade campaign) ", he writes.
"So the United States," he concluded, "is the proverbial elephant in this election: ubiquitous, but potentially too threatening to talk about."
The ambassador understands this "deafening quiet" all the less because the two countries maintain intense political and economic relations.
"It stands to reason that the ability of a candidate, a party, or even better a party leader to manage these important relationships should be a key factor that voters have in mind when they go to the polls."
Another expression of this sense of importance can be read in a message sent on 22 January 2009 by Terry Breese, chargé d'affaires in Ottawa à Ottawa, preparing President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
"Your trip will help ensure the government's confidence in the early February confidence vote on the federal budget, which Canada publicly admits its first deficit in more than a decade, because of a $30 billion to $40 billion recovery plan," Mr Breese writes.
There is no mention of the government having to adjourn the pre-Christmas session of parliament in order not to be defeated by the coalition, and that opposition parties are conditioning their survival on the quality of the proposed recovery plan.
Another january 2008 report, signed by Ambassador Wilkins, draws Washington's attention to the increasingly negative image that drama series aired on CBC cast on the United States.
The ambassador is concerned about the broadcast of Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which not very subtle references to Maher Arar, "No-Fly-List" or kidnappings for violent interrogations at the CIA can be observed.
Another report reports that in their first bilateral meeting, Hillary Clinton asked her French partner Bernard Kouchner if Europe was ready to accept some Guantánamo prisoners.
Mr Kouchner replied yes, but on a case-by-case basis.
At the end of the meeting, it says, "he handed over some paper regarding Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian descent, to the Secretary of State."
"The Secretary has accepted that she will review the file."
Let us finally note that the people affected by WikiLeaks are sweating.
Tom Flanagan, a former adviser close to Stephen Harper, said on CBC news that the person responsible for this massive leak should be "destroyed."
Word got out, and Mike Huckabee heard about it in the United States.
World Plan for Lighting Restoration
In Cancún yesterday, the UN proposed a plan to restore home lighting, shop lighting and industrial space in 100 countries in order to achieve a reduction in the greenhouse effect (GES), which corresponds to almost one third of the additional restrictions to be achieved to stabilize the planet's climate from now until 2020.
This ambitious plan is at the stage of major concrete projects that the UN wants to promote in Cancún to compensate for the absence of difficult-to-implement reduction commitments on the part of industrialised countries.
According to the plan presented yesterday, if we replace the hot bulbs, which still monopolise 50 to 70% of the market, with fluocompact bulbs or, better yet, bulbs with electroluminescent diodes (DEL or "LEDs" in English), a substantial amount of the 1.8 billion tonnes (Gt) GES emissions generated on the planet due to lighting would be reduced.
Lighting is responsible for 8% of the world's emissions.
It's the equivalent of 70% of the emissions from a car park on the planet.
In Copenhagen last year, large countries with a significant share of emissions, such as the United States, China, Europe, and others, including Canada, participated in voluntary reduction plans that should allow global GES emissions to fall from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
But it will be necessary to deduct 5 Gt from this balance to stabilize climate warming to 2 degrees Celsius by 2020 in order to rule out that it will not get out of control.
In hot bulbs, 95% of energy is dissipated in the form of heat, and the rest, i.e. 5%, is a product of light.
With fluocompact bulbs, energy consumption is reduced by 75% and with new del bulbs, we will reduce this consumption twice more.
Fluocompact bulbs last on average from 6000 to 10,000 hours.
The new DEL bulbs, such as those launched this week by Philips - the company reportedly participated in a UN study - have an estimated lifespan of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than a hot bulb, giving us an idea of a possible savings plan to be applied in 100 countries.
All these new bulbs can also work with reostats and emit less heat.
And they don't contain any mercury.
Several experts have expressed reservations about fluocompact bulbs because they contain mercury and need to be sorted as hazardous waste, which is still not possible in developing countries unless producers set up collection points.
However, as the report states, the main source of mercury emissions on the planet is not a fluocompact bulb, but rather thermal coal-fired power plants that emit much of the mercury needed to generate electricity wasted in hot bulbs.
In the United States alone, these headquarters put 25,000 tons of mercury into circulation annually.
The report also details the profits that any country would make from this international programme.
Indonesia, for example, would save $1 billion a year on electricity purchases and eight million tons of CO2, the equivalent of 3.5 thermal power plants that would cost $2.5 billion to build.
Côte d'Ivoire is eagerly awaiting the results of the election results.
The UN Secretary-General, Ban Ki-moon, has requested the immediate publication of the results of the presidential elections in Côte d'Ivoire after the deadlines have expired.
"The Secretary-General stresses the need for an independent electoral commission to complete its work and report preliminary results without delay," the UN President's spokesman stressed.
"It asks all parties in Côte d'Ivoire and the institutions to prove their sense of responsibility and refrain from any initiative until provisional results are announced."
Despite pressure from some foreign governments, the electoral commission let the deadline - Midnight Wednesday - slip away without publication of the results, three days after Sunday's scuffles.
About 40 minutes before the deadline, the president of CEI confirmed on television that the commission was "continuing to work" to announce the results.
On Wednesday, calls for CEI to finally announce the name of the winner of the second round, between the outgoing Laurent Gbagbo and opposition member Alassan Ouattara, multiplied around the world.
But the Gbagbo camp relies on annulment by the Constitutional Council for "fraudulent" voting in the north, which has been administered by former New Army (FN) insurgents since a failed coup in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, director of the presidential election campaign in Côte d'Ivoire, confirmed that voter intimidation maneuvers practiced by the FN (New Army) in the north of the country had deterd Côte d'Ivoire's supporters from voting.
The elections could be annuled if the Constitutional Council took into into into law the complaints made by Gbagbo.
But opponents of President Gbagbo believe that the country's supreme court is not neutral because it is run by Paul Yao N'Dré, a very close political ally of President Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a northerner who denounces any association with former insurgents, condemned the delay in announcing the results as "unacceptable" and asked Gbagbo to respect them but not go so far as to call for victory.
His allies confirm that Gbagbo is blocking the publication of the results because he knows he has suffered a loss, and that it would be illegal to file a complaint with the Constitutional Council after preventing the electoral commission from broadcasting the results.
The second round of the presidential election, held on Sunday, was seen as the coronation of the process of reunification and reconciliation of a country that has been divided in two for years.
The United Nations warned Côte d'Ivoire's political faction on Wednesday that it could be responsible for any violence.
Laurent Gbagbo finished in the first round, on October 31, as the winner with 38% of the vote compared to 32% for Alassan Ouattara, who won the public support of former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round).
The unemployment rate remains stable in France in the third quarter.
According to the International Labour Office (BIT), france's unemployment rate remained stable at 9.3% in metropolitan France (9.7% including overseas areas), according to provisional seasonally adjusted (CVS) data released by INSEE on Thursday.
The number of unemployed has stabilised at 2.631 million in the metropolis.
Second-quarter data were confirmed at 9.3% of the active population in the metropolis and 9.7% including overseas areas.
In one year, the unemployment rate increases by 0.1 points.
More broadly, 3.4 million people in metropolitan France do not work in the third quarter, but would like to work, whether or not they are available in two weeks to work, and whether or not they are looking for work.
The situation of current young people in the labour market has escalated further with a new increase in the unemployment rate reaching 24.2% in metropolitan France (+ 0.9 points in three months, +0.5 points per year) and 25% including overseas areas.
In the third quarter, 637,000 young people aged 15 to 24 were out of work, according to the International Labour Office.
As for the elderly, they recorded a slight increase in unemployment in metropolitan France to 6.4% in metropolitan France (+0.2 points in three months, the same as in a year), i.e. 482,000 people over the age of 50 and 6.6% including overseas areas.
Only the population aged 25-49 has benefited from the stability of unemployment at 8.3% in metropolitan France (-0.1 points in three months, +0.1 points in one year) and 8.8% across France.
Insee no longer publishes the monthly unemployment rate since 2006, following a controversy over its calculation method.
Eurostat, on the other hand, the Statistical Agency of the European Union, continues to produce monthly statistics and on Tuesday announced a rate of 9.8% for France (including the DOM) in October, after being 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini is charged and remanded in custody
Alexandre Guérini, 53, one of the bosses of waste treatment companies and brother of the PS Bouches-du-Rhône Board of Directors, was charged and imprisoned in luynes prison, near Aix-en-Provence, as part of a public procurement investigation allegedly obtained.
Alexandre Guérini has been charged with misusing company property, misusing public funds and public property, concealment, providing bribes, accepting bribes to influence the office and possession of ammunition, his lawyer says.
"Alexandre Guérini is combative and insists that he and the judge explain all the questions this one intends to ask him, not some delusion."
"It is easy to pursue him for many reprehensible reasons, but it is another thing to prove them," his lawyer, Florence Rault, told AFP before questioning her client.
Mr Guérini said through his lawyers that he had sent a short message to the judge before his hearing to explain everything.
One of his loved ones, Philippe Rapezzi, was also charged and imprisoned on Wednesday night.
According to his attorney, Lucien Simon, his client never did anything but ensure the functioning of the landfills he was supposed to manage.
He never knew about any of this when it comes to awarding contracts or the destination of funds associated with their operation, Mr Simon said.
On this matter, Daniel Pinna, the former director general of services of the Aubagne conurbation, was indicted on Wednesday for misappropriation of public funds and conspiracy, and left at large, under judicial supervision, the protagonists of the matter.
"My client was able to explain all the facts that were reprim him."
"The investigating judge will take this into account and leave him at large," said his lawyer, Mr. Yann Arnoux.
Four other people were charged and released on the night of Tuesday to Wednesday, with two of them under judicial supervision, said Assistant U.S. Attorney Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, Deputy Director-General of Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM), is being prosecuted for accepting bribes to influence the office and for passive corruption".
Two officials from the Aubagne conurbation, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringuier, are charged, one for "theft and misuse of company property", the other for "conspiracy to misuse public funds".
Finally, Alexandra Guérini's business associate, Jeannie Peretti, was charged with "concealing the misuse of company property."
Among those confronted with Mr Guérini is Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, who was recently charged in a parallel case of fraudulent public procurement involving Corsica.
Investigators suspect his companies helped 100 people 100 years old.
The investigation is being conducted as part of several open judicial investigations against X in April 2009 following the receipt of anonymous letters relating to alleged fraud in the award of public contracts, in particular in the matter of waste.
From a source close to the investigation, the investigation focuses mainly on the conditions of allocation and operation of the landfill in La Ciotat, which collects rubbish from Aubagne, as well as from some cities from the city community of Marseille (MPM).
Clotilde Reiss case: Elysée Palace exaggerated Syria mediation
Over the course of more than 10 months, from July 2009 to May 2010, the pment of Klotilda Reiss, a young researcher arrested in Iran for "espionage," united views in France, put diplomacy on combat alert, and emphasized relations between Paris and Tehran.
All this closely monitored by diplomats from the United States.
American documents obtained through WikiLeaks and consulted with Le Monde reveal some of the downsides of this crisis.
They describe how the Elysée Palace explained its strategy to the Americans, going so far as to give them advice on how to handle such hostage cases in Iran (a small group of hikers).
They show how French leaders tried to convince Washington that the release of a young French woman was not compensation against the release of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian imprisoned in France and wanted by the US justice system for subterduing material trafficking in favor of Iran's nuclear program.
Finally, they are subjecting the french Presidency to the sharp light of the way in which the French Presidency tried to manipulate the media to accredit the idea that the Syrian President, Bachar Al-Assad, played a central role in the liberation of Klotilda Reiss.
In fact, he didn't do anything about it.
A diplomatic telegram written in Paris on 12 August 2009 reads: 'Iran:French comments on how to deal with hostages'.
The Elysée Palace's strategic affairs adviser, François Richier, accompanied by the Quai d'Orsay director for North Africa and the Middle East, Patrice Paoli, speaks with the head of US diplomacy, Allegrone.
They explain the French method to him.
They recommend that Americans do just as much to bring back their own nationals detained in Iran by force.
"Make noise," they say, "constantly vigorously pronounce" the words "fundamental rights of man", "innocence", "immediate deliverance" in the media.
The Iranian regime, sensitive to its image, must be brought into trouble.
"Do it the more they ask you to stop."
Because there have been attempts to negotiate through discrete channels, "silence will not solve anything," the Iranians are "masters of evasive maneuvers."
Mr Richier recalls that arresting foreigners is "Iran's family tactic: taking hostages for the purposes of "political blackmail."
It announces that the liberation of Klotilda Reiss (which will take place on 16 August, the day the French Embassy gives her refuge) "will require payment of a large sum of money to the Iranians" (bail of €230,000).
And he announces that the Elysée Palace is anticipating hostage cases, a phenomenon that "will only be heeded."
The Iranians "could arrest another roughly 1,800 French people living in Iran in the future," he says.
August 28, 2009.
Klotilda Reiss left prison 12 days ago, but she remains blocked in Iran.
Information is spreading: Iranian Majid Kakavand, who the United States claims was expelled for illegally trafficking in iranian-sensitive electronic material, is released in Paris at the judge's decision.
The U.S. Embassy, like many observers, is asking about this disturbing consensus.
For Washington, which is pursuing illegal Iranian networks to obtain material intended for its nuclear program, majid Khakavand's expansion is bad news.
France has agreed to haggly?
The liberation of an Iranian woman for the liberation of a young French woman?
In another interview with Kathleen Allegrone, September 4, François Richier assures that this is not the case.
The Elysée Palace, he says, was not only "taken aback by this judge's decision", but was looking for a way to oppose it.
"There have been talks between the presidential office and the Minister of Justice" (at the time, Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French government cannot change the court's decision," he notes.
Mr Richier also wants to demonstrate that Majid Kakavand is under "limited" scrutiny from the French intelligence service.
An adviser to the Elysée Palace dials a phone number, hangs up the phone, and then informs an American diplomat that the Iranian is currently in the Paris buildings managed by the Iranian embassy."
At the time of Klotilda Reiss's imprisonment in Iran, the Elysée Palace is making efforts, negotiating, through communiqués and organized "leaks" to the media, to convince that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad is playing an "important" and "influential" role as a "mediator."
Americans observe this activity not without irony, noting that manipulation bears fruit, since several articles in the press reflect the French official version.
Telegram of 25 August 2009 evokes a media "blem" of French officials'.
What is the base of such a measure of "gratitude", expressed towards Mr Assad, asks the Embassy in Paris.
"Despite their eulising statements, French officials privately acknowledge that they have only a vague idea of what the Syrians have actually done".
The document then examines the reasons that forced the Elysée Palace to pay in this fiction.
Intensive communication "is aimed at validating President Sarkozy's policy of opening up to Syria," he analyzes.
The policy implemented in 2008 "has been observed by many critical voices in France and abroad and marked as premature and uneaffed."
By "exaggerating Syria's role," Paris is trying to "demonstrate syria, what praise it can earn by playing a constructive role in the region."
The aim is also to "sming the grain of discord between Syria and Iran."
The U.S. Embassy knows this from a very good source.
On August 11, François Richier confided in him, "of course we don't know if the Syrians did anything, whatever it is."
"But we still thanked them."
"This should at least create confusion and confusion among iranians."
Klotilda Reiss returns to France on May 16, 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy receives it at the Elysée Palace.
In a communiqué, he thanked the presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for their "active role in favor of the liberation of our compatriot."
End of online games after midnight for young Koreans
South Korea's government will adopt a law called "Peciválsky", which will prohibit adolescents from playing online games after midnight by blocking access to them, government officials said.
The bill will be submitted to Parliament in December to ask online games companies to block access to the games after midnight for people under the age of 16, officials from the Ministry of Culture and the Ministry of Family Affairs said.
"Many children play these games all night and then have learning difficulties at school and are unable to lead a normal life during the day."
"We believe that this law is necessary to ensure their health and their right to sleep," Jo Rin, a senior official in the ministry in charge of the bill, told AFP.
Online games will now be available from 6 a.m.
Companies will have one year to prepare for the application of the law, he said.
The government also expects to ask companies to limit the daily time they have access to these games for young people whose parents so request, the official added.
It will also make available to people who so request free programmes to limit time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the countries most "affected", and the daily press regularly brings various facts associated with intensive internet use.
The country is also the undisputed champion of world competitions in online games.
In November, South Korea won four gold medals at the World Cyber Games in the face of 58 other nations.
2018-2022 World Cup: Fifa establishes host countries.
Full of unrest over suspected corruption, Fifa's executive committee on Thursday established the host countries of the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, a selection supremely politically motivated, where the struggle for influence and lobbying risks overcoming technical criteria.
The matter is certain, the 2018 Fifa Royal Competition will be held in Europe , the traditional bastion of this discipline (4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, The Netherlands-Belgium).
The 2022 Championships will be much more exotic, with the International Federation hoping to conquer new territories (Qatar, Australia) after its premiere on the African continent in 2010, or to continue to set out in the United States or the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities to attend the delegations (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, Prince of Qatar, leading government officials of Belgium and the Netherlands, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) gives you the opportunity to create an idea of the scale of economic and political betting around the world.
Behind-the-scenes negotiations run the risk of lasting until the last minute.
For the rest, it is difficult to establish a hierarchy by candidate.
According to fifa's evaluation report, the English, Spanish-Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) documentation contain the best arguments, as well as the documentation of their competitors.
But these reasons will not carry much weight for the 22 members of the executive committee at the hour of the vote.
The Sunday Times at the start of the revelations, leading to the suspension of two CE members of the European Commission for corruption (Reynald Temarii et Amos Adamu), may have destroyed the chances of their country, the cradle of football, which has only hosted the World Cup once, in a year.
The BBC crowned it on Monday when it aired a documentary that "pinned" three influential CE (European Commission?) members Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
How to make Fifa unhappy and put English leaders in trouble with David Cameron in the first place.
The Prime Minister hopes to repeat the move made by his predecessor in office, Tony Blair, who won the 2005 Olympics for London.
Will this intense activity be enough to give England a new shine to its name at CE (European Commission?)?
Nothing is less certain, because the Spain-Portugal pair are missing the trumps of already prepared stadiums, its good-naturedness (the 1982 World Cup in Spain, the 1992 Olympic Games in Barcelona, euro-2004 in Portugal) and their football culture.
But the bleak economic and financial prospects of both countries could give these ambitions a cold shower.
Any retaliation against the English and doubts about the payment eligibility of Spain and Portugal only increase the position of Russia, which was an outsider despite gaps in its documentation (stadiums, hotels, transport).
But Prime Minister Vladimir Poutin decided not to relocate to Zurich and publicly declared "unfair competition in the run-up to the vote," in verbal innuendo barely twisted on the English press's accusations against CE (European Commission) members.
"We're going to throw mud at them, we're going to try to compromise them," Mr. Poutin said.
For 2022, the United States, with its considerable experience in 1994, seems to be the logical favorite.
The highest performance of the economy in the world, the headquarters of Fifa's main sponsors, seems to have a big lead over Japan and South Korea, which, separately, have produced a beautiful project.
But these candidacies seem premature for the two countries, which together passed the "test" in 2002.
Another threat: awarding the 2026 World Cup to China, which fifa is hotly desired, has invalidated Asia's chances for 2022.
With Qatar pulling a big ace out of its sleeve in the form of futuristic stadiums, and Australia, Fifa would continue its expansion into new landscapes, but the two countries pose more risks than certainty.
Australia, like Japan and Korea, could pay for the flimsy TV fees (due to the time shift) paid by European countries, forming the driving force for Fifa.
Second mandate: obvious (certainty)
De Gaulle was really hesitant.
Mitterrand gave the appearance that he was hesiate.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing et Jacques Chirac did not hesitate in the slightest.
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less than they do.
The mandate of the Elysée Palace calls someone else.
The current head of state will therefore be a candidate in 2012.
But the obvious is not in good agreement with the share of the secrecy associated with the presidency.
So it is necessary to act as if doubts persist.
In one sense and the other.
In 2006, without wanting to believe it, Jacques Chirac's friends made demands that a third mandate not be excluded.
On November 15, Nicolas Sarkozy assured with a serious expression that "a decision will be made sometime in the autumn of 2011."
As he reminds UMP members of parliament at the Elysée Palace on Wednesday night, the prospect of "two mandates" has swished a little feverish state.
Was it an official announcement of his candidacy?
He wasn't far from it.
The President merely recalled that the 2008 amendment to the Constitution limited the number of five-year terms to two.
It was just a statement on his part, not an announcement.
This is not the first time he has recalled the presidential election in a humorous tone at such meetings.
"Worst-case scenario, or at best, you still have seven and a half years with me," he said in July 2009.
Rebellion in May 2010: "Don't think I'm not considering the next stage."
His statements the day before yesterday will not make him a candidate more than the previous day; they won't make him a candidate or less.
If they make comments, it's because of a double truth.
Speeding up the path to the PS candidacy, on the one hand.
But it is not the entrance to the Ségolène Royal's platform that is pushing Nicolas Sarkozy to convict.
This is because his candidacy in 2012 is evident that many in the PS want an early rather than intended arrangement in the battle lineups.
Bad poll on the other hand.
First, right-wing voters would prefer François Fillon's candidacy to Nicolas Sarkozy's (46% vs. 44%, according to BVA-L'Express).
"We have a candidate and we are not discussing the matter with the UMP ," the people closest to the Prime Minister responded immediately and cautiously.
"If he believes in a possible defeat, he will not run," says Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"He'll still believe he can win," says Alain Juppé, serenely clear.
Euro: Central European Bank forced to continue its purchases of state titles.
The last meeting of the Governing Council central in 2010 was supposed to be an opportunity to clarify the conditions for a way out of the crisis or, at least, an announcement to halt a large number of unusual monetary policy operations, which must be completed by the end of this year.
The sovereign European debt crisis obliges the Securities Institute to be so categorical under the threat of a deterioration in europe's already tense securities markets.
In that case, the political price would be all the higher.
Yesterday, at a press conference, French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde paid tribute to the active role played by the Central European Bank in resolving the crisis in European states' claims.
She would not say whether she thought the bank could have done more, for example by increasing their sovereign bond purchase program.
"I reserve my consideration for my European partners (...) ".
The night before, in Brussels, when questioned by the European Parliament's Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee, the President of the Central European Bank, Jean-Claude Trichet, did not appear to be more edicing about his intentions, and was content to say that the programme for purchasing state titles on the secondary market was "continuing" and that "we will see what we decide" during this Thursday's meeting.
One certainty: The Central Bank of Europe will keep its basic fixed interest rate at 1%, its lowest level since May 2009.
In fact, the Central Bank's purchases of bonds from the Treasury doubled in the last week to almost €1.35 billion.
And thanks to the immisinformation of market conciliators, she made new purchases of Irish and Portuguese bonds yesterday.
Overall, eurosystem central banks have purchased €67 billion since May 2010.
There are no doubts among the marketers about the continuation of purchases (see page 29).
Even economists do not expect any significant change in course.
If lending operations for more than three months have already disappeared from the Central European Bank's arsenal, the latter bank shall enter into unlimited liquidity provision under generous conditions and for a period of between one week and three months.
Economists now expect this mechanism to be extended by several months.
"I can't imagine her changing her program in a significant way."
"If not, it would risk creating short-term new tensions," says Michael Schubert, an economist at Commerzbank.
"The progressive starting point announced during the first quarter of 2011 seems more likely," predicts Norbert Bräms, an economist at Sal.
Oppenheim.
Norbert Bräms adds that "the European Central Bank would have to maintain the volume of purchases of its bonds in order to revive the weak market" to plan its interventions in the public debt market.
In view of the exposure of European banks to sovereign debt markets in the euro area, it has no choice but to maintain its presence on the market.
"It needs to make up for the lack of investors in the market at all costs and act in such a way as to prevent the flare-up of paid performance by states that are among the most fragile," a major bond manager testified yesterday.
Because if interest rates take off, they will worry all the more about reducing their debt rather than stabilizing it.
It is saving the euro at this price.
In Italy, Berlusconi's government hunches its back
After a worrying start to the week for Italy, the situation eased a bit, yesterday with a 10-year return on bond interest.
Return to temporary peace.
At the end of a meeting with the Minister for Economic Economics, the presidents of the regions said that they had heard Giulio Tremonti qualify the situation as "inssolvent" and that he expected an "unpredictable" weekend, which he then commented on.
In any case, on Tuesday, the deviation from long German interest rates reached a record of 210 basis points, and the price of bankruptcy insurance contracts (CDS) soared to 263 points, causing some excitement in Rome.
In the Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi noted that in Spain the deviation with German interest was higher than 400 basis points.
But his right-hand man, Gianni Letta, said he was "too busy" with the "turbulent development of the markets" and a possible contagion originating in Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the third economy of the eurozone, is not like Greece or Ireland."
"The bad news is, it's like Portugal," explains Irwin Stelzer, an economist at the Hudson Institute.
Clearly and unencrypted, its problem is the lack of growth and lackluster fiscal input, which goes hand in hand and puts the state at risk of not being able to cover its funding needs.
Brussels' latest forecasts were a cold shower for the government.
Italian growth is now expected to be 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012... while the budget available to the Senate for its analysis is at 1.3% and 2%.
Under these conditions, the European Commission calculates, the public finance deficit will still be 4.3% of gross domestic product next year (against 3.9% projected by the government) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
Hence the rumour of a new sum of additions to the draft state budget, which could be introduced after the holidays, of €7 billion.
"If necessary, strict new measures will have to be taken," says the Commissioner for Economic Affairs, Olli Rehn.
For now, Italy accepts the support of international institutions.
"The cornerstones of its economy are fine and its calculations are correct, we have been repeating this for a long time," assures Arrigo Sadun, an Italian member of the International Monetary Fund's Board of Directors under pressure from Italy on the International Monetary Fund.
"There is no immediate problem, either short-term or long-term, because despite its significant debt (119.2% of gross domestic product in 2011, NDLR), the stabilisation efforts required in Italy are smaller than the efforts required of other countries," notes Pier Carlo Padoan, chief economist at OCDE.
The question of political instability remains.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion of censure in the Chamber of Deputies, and subsequently the elections, which are scheduled for the end of March, could begin to be organised.
This would start a period of little suitable for taking a decision in a case of serious crisis.
Europeans are thinking about strengthening anti-crisis mechanisms.
Christine Lagarde reiterated this yesterday at a press conference in Paris: "I think the Europeans demonstrated it throughout the day and night on Sunday, they are obviously very committed, committed to defending their currency and their currency zone."
Although everything is relative, yesterday's recorded expansion in interest on European government bonds brought water to the mill for governments and the Central Bank of Europe.
But we can't talk about the beginning of normalization yet.
Standard & Poor's said it could downgrade Portugal's debt record, the target most targeted by various speculations.
"Because in May there is a real lack of transparency and obvious policy, mainly based on banking systems," says economists Exane BNP Paribas.
All the more so because "political time runs slower than market time."
Aware of this broken context and the dangers it hides, European countries are intensifying discussions aimed at strengthening existing crisis mechanisms.
Informal consultations between finance ministers, most affected by the problem, and, more broadly, with their G20 counterparts, are going very well.
This is in view of the eurogroup (Eurogroupe) and Ecofin meetings from the beginning of next week.
The Central European Bank meeting is held today.
The fate of unconventional measures to support euro area countries with a focus on markets is on the agenda (see above).
As for the European Fund for Finance (FESF), its executive director, Klaus Regling, began a tour of Asia in Singapore on Tuesday to inform Far Eastern investors of the development of the crisis in Europe.
If the aim of this trip is not to increase funds, it certainly paves the way for this to be achieved.
The first issue of FESF securities is expected next month.
Yesterday, a US official told Reuters that the United States would support a possible increase in mobilized funds through additional direct involvement in the FMI.
The countries at first and foremost, Portugal and Spain, are preparing to adopt structural reforms, in particular as regards the organisation of the labour market.
Reforms that join strict measures with rapid effect.
Lisbon and Madrid were a different route from greece and Ireland.
Both countries want to avoid asking for international aid at all costs before applying their own budgetary correctives and deciding on the structural reforms necessary to regain lasting confidence.
Finally, equity participants in European funds are talking about options available to accelerate the process of normalizing sovereign bond markets.
On his trip to Paris on November 24, Axel Weber came up with the idea that the €750 billion mobilised by Europe and the International Monetary Fund would not be enough, the Union would not hesitate to touch the stockpile of securities again.
Economists at Barclays Capital, the actor in the very first plan to trade european sovereign claims, believe that an addition of about €100 billion would be enough, "rather" in the form of direct provision of financial liquidity.
There is a means: it is the European Financial Stability Mechanism, subsidised to date by EUR 60 billion.
A Council that has every chance of being tested in European capitals.
Especially when market conditions were deteriorating.
Snow and ice: 24 counties have orange alert.
Snow rations are still causing traffic problems, especially on second-class roads in Brittany, and there is a risk that they will disrupt some economic activities.
Twenty-four counties are now on orange alert because of the risk of snow and ice.
L'Eure, l'Eure-et-Loir, les Deux-Sèvres a la Vienne, joined the 20 counties that already have an orange alert, 18 as of Wednesday afternoon and two, la Dordogne and la Gironde, later at night.
According to Météo France, heavy snowfall is causing problems in the north of La Gironde and les Charentes and it is snowing lightly on the Ile-de-France.
Snow cover from 2 to 5 cm, in places from 7 to 10 cm, is expected in the affected districts and cover from 1 to 3 cm, in places up to 5 in the Paris region.
The districts of Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, du Poitou and the counties of Basse-Normandy, Ile-de-France and Limousin are affected.
The snowstorms are large enough to cause traffic difficulties and disrupt some economic activity, Météo France predicts.
On the Côtes d'Armor coast, some counties have banned heavy goods transit - trucks over 7.5 tons with the Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac routes.
Road traffic on second-class roads in Brittany is very difficult, according to police, and police recommend driving out with their vehicle only when it is really necessary and some trucks have been cancelled for the day.
In Picardy, school services were banned for Thursday.
No specific measures to restrict freight traffic are foreseeable on Wednesday evening.
The district office "urges all car drivers to exercise extreme caution on the roads and to adapt the ride to the nature of the road."
The Directorate-General for Civil Aviation (DGAC) asked airlines to cancel 25% of their flights at Paris Roissy Airport and 10% to The Eagles on Thursday due to expected snowfall.
DGAC recommends that passengers using air transport services contact their company.
Gatwick Airports in south London and Edinburgh Airport in Scotland are closed in the UK until Thursday morning.
Metro Grand Paris: first financial proposals
Billions have been raining since the debate on the modernisation of transport at Ile-de-France is underway.
At least during the discussion.
In particular, we recall the 23 billion for the Grand Paris metro to be built by Société du Grand Paris.
In order for this construction to be launched, the State announced a grant of EUR 4 billion.
In theory, this is an amount which will then allow SGP to use part of its dual funding for contracts.
Today we are finally getting to the First Amendment.
The 2010 Finance Rectification Act, which is being examined by the Finance Committee of the National Assembly this morning, contains mechanisms set up to secure these funds.
There are two: the creation of a special equipment tax and an increase in the office tax on Ile-de-France.
The first, read in the text of the bill, Article 15, is 'in favour of the Public Société du Grand Paris'.
It is quantified: 'The income from this interest is EUR 117 million per year'.
The second is the re-enactment of the office rate, which already exists 'in order to modernise it, to increase the revenue generated from it and to affect société du Grand Paris'.
How much would that make?
mirage.
This is not quantified in the text.
We're a long way from 4 billion.
"It is specified that these fiscal resources are attached to the EUR 4 billion of capital injections that will be mobilised by the State and invested in Société du Grand Paris according to the project", we can read in the explanation of the reasons.
At SGP, this system does not seem shocking.
"From the moment we generated revenue (both taxes, ndlr), we can cover studies for three years and then rake in $4 billion, it explains."
"It will be budgeted and used as needed".
SGP is not supposed to add $4 billion until 2013 for the 2014 budget.
This mechanism, in which the $4 billion promised belongs to still absent subscribers, risks provoking a rather busy parliamentary debate.
The first public session will be on 7 December.
Vestily hackers and induceding spies
The WikiLeaks case has two meanings.
On the one hand, an apparent scandal is revealed, a scandal that seems to be a scandal only in the face of the hypocrisy that governs relations between states, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it speaks of profound changes at international level, and foresches a future dominated by regression.
But let's proceed one step at a time.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is confirmation of the fact that every document compiled by the Secret Service (any nation) consists entirely of press cuts.
The "extraordinary revelation" by Americans about Berlusconi's sex life is an anaesthetist that everyone has been able to read in any newspaper for months (all but these two Berlusconi own), and the infamously cartoonish profile of Qaddafi has long been a sketch theme for cabaret artists.
The rule that classified documents can only consist of reports already known is fundamental in the dynamics of the secret services, and not just in this century.
When you go to a bookstore dedicated to esoteric literature, you will see that each work repeats (about Graal, the mystery of Rennes-le-Château, the Templars or the Masons) exactly what has already been written in previous works.
Not only because the author of the occult texts does not like to search for new information (he does not even know where to look for reports of non-existent ones), but because those who are engaged in the occult believe only what they already know and what confirms what they have learned before.
That's Dan Brown's success mechanism.
The same goes for classified documents.
An informant is a lazy, lazy (or limited spirit) intelligence chief (and if he isn't, he could be, as I know, an editor at Libération), who only considers true what he admits.
The high-level information about Berlusconi that the U.S. Embassy sent to the state department was the same one newsweek published the week before.
So why has there been so much fuss about the revelations about these documents?
On the one hand, they say what every cultured person already knows, namely that embassies, at least since the end of World War II and since heads of state can make phone calls or fly out on a plane for a joint dinner, have lost their diplomatic function and, with the exception of a few small exercises in representation, have transformed into spy centers.
Any viewer watching films about the investigation knows very well that it is only out of proportion that it seems to be ignored.
However, the fact that this is repeated publicly defames the duty of hypocrisy and casts a bad light on American diplomacy.
Second, the idea that any hacker can obtain the most highly classified information of the most powerful country in the world represents a severe blow, not a significant one, to the prestige of this state department.
The scandal affects both the victims and his "executors."
But let's move from here to the deep truth about what happened.
Once upon a time, in the days of Orwell, all power could be taken, like some Big Brother who controlled every move of his people.
Orvell's prophecy has been proven since the ability to control every move by phone, every transaction made, the hotel visited, the highway used, and so on, made the citizen a complete victim of the wreath of power.
But when we demonstrate how it works now that even "tombs" with the most secret information of the powerful cannot withstand the intervention of some hacker, the control message ceases to be one-way and becomes a circular.
Power is controlled by every citizen, but every citizen, or at least a hacker - elected as a citizen's vet - can know all the secrets of power.
How can power be maintained that no longer has the ability to keep its own secrets?
It is true that Georg Simmel has already said that the true secret is a unattended secret (and a no-space secret can ever be revealed); it is also true that all the information about the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is indeed a mysterious, unattended secret, because it is pulled out of public life; but to reveal, as WikiLeaks did, that Hillary Clinton's secrets were unmissable secrets is to take away all his power.
WikiLeaks made no mistake with Sarkozy or Merkel, but did something big for Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this blow to the power so significant?
It is clear that in the future states will not be able to send sensitive information online - this would be equal to publishing it on a poster posted on a street corner.
But it is also quite clear that with current technologies, it is useless to hope that it is possible to keep secret phone messages.
There is nothing easier than to find out if and when the head of state traveled by plane and contacted one of her colleagues.
How will private and sensitive messages be kept secret in the future ?
I know that for now my prognosis belongs to science fiction and is therefore fantastic, but I have to imagine government officials discreetly completing formalities along uncontrollable routes and carrying only those messages that they know by heart or rather hide precious information in the heel of a shoe.
The information will be preserved in unique copies in key drawers: all in all, the attempted spying in the Watergate affair was less successful than WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that technology is now moving sideways forward, that is, backwards.
One century after the wireless telegraph revolutionized communications, the Internet rehabilitated a wire-based (telephone) telegraph.
Videotapes (analog) allowed cinema lovers to capture the film step by step, move it forward and back and reveal all the secrets of assembly, while now CDs (digital) allow only to jump on chapters, that is, by macro proportions.
We can get from Rome to Milan via high-speed train in three hours, while we need three and a half hours to travel by plane and transport that includes.
It is therefore not unsuchede that politics and communication techniques will return to horse-drawn carriages.
Last remark.
At other times, the press tried to understand what had been plotted in secret at the embassy.
Now it's embassies asking for confidential information from the press.
Climate: how France hacked its funding promises
A year after the Copenhagen Agreement, it is time to test the promises made by developed countries to keep their promises of fast-start or early start financing.
And the great French hacks have been exposed
In the Copenhagen Agreement, developed countries committed to providing $30 billion in 2010-2012.
The European Union promised €7.2 billion over three years and France €1.26 billion (that is, €420 million a year).
At the launch of COP16, the EU pulled out a big ace to convince its partners of the reality of its fast start funding commitment: a report specifying its Member States' action, a press conference, a grand side event, the distribution of brochures...
A transparent operation invaluable and valued for its true value: developed countries and civil society would like all developed countries and civil society to do them equally and with the same degree of precision.
The EU announces that it released €2.2 billion in 2010, putting it on track to keep its promise of €7.2 billion in 2012.
But if we focus on the detail, we'll find that things are much more complicated.
Under the Copenhagen Agreement, these funds are 'new and additional' to ensure that the increased burden is implemented without prejudice to public development aid.
Unfortunately, there is no consensus on what "new and additional" means.
While the European Commission has proposed harmonisation, some Member States, including France, have blocked the process.
Today, everyone chooses the reference that suits them best.
For example, the European Commission considered 2009 to be a reference: international funding has been preserved, and it is adding 150 million for three years of fast-start financing.
Other countries have chosen similar references with annual payment dates or with public aid for development.
France, on the other hand, considered that the financing of 'all new projects' in 2010 was 'new and additional'.
In other words, there is no reference to previous period expenditure or to the global level of Public Aid for the Development of d'Aide publique au développement.
In particular, france's total aid intensity vis-à-vis developing countries may remain unchanged (or even decrease), it is to honour its commitment to finance "new and additional "...
Another decisive element is the distribution of gifts and loans.
There is no rule yet and everyone chooses their own method of calculation.
Some, such as The New York Times, have been in the market for a new France, they are considering that 1€ borrowed equals 1€ donated.
Clearly, this is hardly demonstrable: the effort is not comparable.
If the use of loans can be documented for certain investments that are profitable (often projects related to emission reductions, consisting in more efficient technologies), it is foolish to present the one euro we receive as the equivalent of one euro that we give... , we should not see it as the price of a loan to a creditor country (i.e. the equivalent of an interest rate).
But France can only give such a justification: it "admopocalyphates" its €420 million commitment, of which it makes a 91.5% loan (€389.8 million) and 8.5% of donations (€36.1 million) - see the EU document to verify for yourself.
It is the only Country of the Union that uses a loan on such a scale.
Germany claimed 46% from here, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia (among others) are keeping their commitments with 100% donations.
In other words, when the vast majority of the European Union gives €1 to back up its promise, France gives only 10 centimes and considers this effort comparable.
Beautiful juggler's piece!
To sum up, in its fast-start financing, France operates with double swindling: on the one hand, the development of the stock over time and, on the other hand, the real financial burden.
Although it spends only €36.1 million, it can convince that it issuing €420 million "new and additional" in connection with its promises.
The manipulation of the Finance Minister (because it seems that although it is Bercy who made such decisions) could have a double negative impact, at the same time within the EU (why would Member States continue to donate when all they have to do is lend?) and in negotiations, because developing countries are not entirely naïve...
The early funding chapter is a small question, relatively short-term, in relation to a series of climate discussions.
But it could be an extra grain of sand in a huge machine like the UNFCCC.
Let's hope that's not our case.
Whatever this is, it is essential to draw lessons from this first year of early funding.
First, France should announce a change in its way of keeping accounts for 2011 and 2012, in a spirit of respect for its commitments and decency and fairness towards other countries of the European Union.
But above all, France should avoid discussing long-term financing deposits (another crucial chapter currently under discussion): we will not escape the question of "additionality" or how loans are accounted for.
France should change its position in order to become as progressive with these deposits as it is with others.
So everyone is putting hope in the new Environment Minister, Mrs Kosciusko-Morizet, who will arrive in Cancun next week.
The surprise announcement of France's fast start and its vision of "additionality" and the use of loans could trigger an increase in the level of international confidence necessary to move forward with the discussions.
An alarm about pesticides that children will inger.
A 10-year-old child will one day ingo 81 different chemicals, according to a study published this Wednesday, from the Future Generations Association (ex- Movement for Rights and Preservation of Future Generations).
The association, which points out that its results "do not have significant statistical value due to the low number of samples analysed, but are characteristic of the issues being processed", bought between July and September foods commonly consumed in four meals and one light meal as a light snack per child of about 10 years in supermarkets in L'Oise and Paris.
These typical foods, including official recommendations - five pieces of fresh fruit and vegetables, three dairy products and 1.5 liters of water per day - as well as confectionery, were analyzed by research laboratories for chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The balance of the plate is overwhelming: 81 chemicals, 42 of which are carcinogenic, possible or probable, and five substances are clear carcinogenic substances, as well as 37 substances that could act as disruptive to internal excretion glands (PE), according to studies by several institutions, such as the International Cancer Research Center.
"While in almost all cases the legal limits for each chemical adopted individually are not exceeded, our research shows that the reality of consumer exposure to contaminants, possibly carcinogenic, and/or PE is striking," the association states.
For breakfast, butter and tea with milk contain about ten résids themselves with possible carcinogenic effects and three proven as certain carcinogens, as is the case with about twenty residues that could disrupt the hormonal system.
The apple, imported from Brazil, cited by the study as a small snack, contains traces of six chemicals, including a banned fungicid agent in France.
The same applies to green beans from Kenya included in lunch, where studies have found traces of strong insecticides banned in the EU.
In addition, minced steak, canned tuna and even a pack and chewing gum were sleek with pesticides and other chemicals.
In tap water, analyses revealed the presence of nitrates and chloroform.
The steak from the salmon for dinner was the "richest" with 34 chemical residues discovered, and even the analysis of the plastic plate used to heat the food in the microwave did not avoid analysis.
The final risk to consumers of this "cocktail of contaminants" is likely to be underestimated," the study shows.
The Environmental Europe-Greens Association (EE-LV) proposed to set up a moratorium on pesticide use "in the face of an emergency" to halt the "rise in civilization diseases."
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Agency (EFSA) examined the presence of residues of 365 different pesticides identified in fruit and vegetables consumed in Europe, including 76 in cereals.
