Unusually open and unique image of Karel Gott in olga špátová's feature-length documentary film
This unique film by Olga Špátová will premiere in Czech cinemas in the spring of next year.
"In mid-September last year, Ivanka and Karel Gott called me and asked me if I would make a documentary about his life with Karl again after ten years. I didn't hesitate for a minute! Filming with a man who has lasted more than half a century in the foreman of Czech culture thanks to his exceptional singing talent, artistic humility and immeasurable diligence was and is a great honor for me. I accepted the call to make a feature-length documentary film about Karel Gott, who brings joy to three generations of listeners with his art," says director Olga Špátová.
The first day of filming was already held on October 22 last year thanks to a quick agreement and agreement, and the last footage with Karel Gott was shot a few days ago. The goal was and is absolutely clear - to capture karel gott authentically as a phenomenal singer who gives away to his supporters, as a painter, but at the same time a loving husband and father of his children. A man who for sixty years has been giving joy to several generations not only in our country, but also in Europe, and in fact all over the world. A man who has written himself into the hearts and souls of his listeners by simply being.
The film is not supposed to be a show of the undeniable glory of Karel Gott and his achievements. "Therefore, it is not even possible to compare my previous film The Gott Phenomenon with this one. Everyone's different. At least by filming them at another stage in Karel Gott's life, and this will be very reflected in his personal, almost intimate confession, which he gave us and which confirmed to us all what legend we have the opportunity to work with and spend time with, which is truly indescribable," adds Olga Špátová.
The filmmakers captured Karel Gott during his performances, during meetings with his fans in the Czech Republic and hamburg, but especially in his home environment, whether in Prague, at a cottage in Czech Switzerland, in the country where he spent his childhood, and in other places that played an important role in his life. Thanks to the sincere openness of Karel Gott, the film will be completely authentic and unique.
"Olga has a great gift for filming with her narrow team in such a way that we often get carried away with the spontaneous atmosphere and naturally let her into our privacy, thanks to which I talked about topics quite intimate. She and her husband, cameraman Jan Malíř, actually became part of our family. We originally wanted to present the film in 2019, when I celebrated my life anniversary. But since my family and I had a beautiful summer, I wanted us to film as long as possible. Well, since there were a lot of me everywhere in 2019, my wish was that it be released in theaters next spring. This documentary is a thank you to my supporters and to all those who supported and accompanied me in my profession," says Karel Gott himself.
Insects are up to 60 times less than they were 40 years ago
No other animal class is more represented in nature than insects. Beetles, butterflies and other species make up more than half of life on Earth. But there are growing reports that the insect kingdom is shrinking radically. Another scientific study on the subject was published just this week, and the situation is even more serious than mankind has ever realized.
The study is based on field research in puerto rico's tropical forest, in which American scientists copied a similar survey from 1976. As they write at the beginning of the report, insects are now "ten to sixty times less" in the forest. This is a decline in the entire population, not the number of species, and the research concerned not only insects, but all arthropods. Due to the extinction of insects, the population of another fauna, which is dependent on insects such as birds, frogs or lizards, is also thinning.
The authors of the research put their conclusions directly related to climate change. According to them, the average air temperature in the forest has risen by two degrees Celsius in the last 30 years, and warming has become the driving force behind the collapse of the food chain. According to the author's team, the study shows that the impact of climate change on tropical ecosystems may be much greater than previously thought.
The report was published Monday in the Washington Post, which headlines the new findings as hyperalarmating. "This is one of the most disturbing articles I have ever read," entomologist David Wagner of the University of Connecticut told the paper, citing him as an independent expert.
Insect extinction also applies to Europe. "In our country, the decline is also orderly," says Lukáš Čížek from the Entomological Institute of the Academy of Sciences. According to him, however, in addition to climate change, it is necessary to take into account the changes of the landscape, which play a major role in Europe. "In our country, it just runs for a significantly longer time than in Puerto Rico," adds Čížek, explaining why scientists could measure such a rapid decline in the forest compared to the 1970s.
Czechs in Europe by Ondřej Houska: Should Czechoslovakia have rejected the Munich Agreement in 1938 and gone to war with Germany? Three TIMES NO
An undated picture shows Adolf Hitler visiting the Czechoslovak border fortifications. The task of the forts was never to stop the German army, but to slow its advance before the Allies became involved.
If, almost exactly 81 years ago, Czechoslovakia rejected the Munich Agreement and subsequently faced a German attack, what would have excluded the most Czechoslovak soldiers from the fight? German tanks, air force, or artillery? It might not have been either of these weapons, even though the Germans had an overwhelming advantage over the Czechoslovaks. The Czechoslovak army would probably suffer the greatest losses – due to blisters.
Police union president Stepanek resigns, wants to live as a free man
Milan Štěpánek, president of the Independent Police Union, has decided to resign. It was stated on Friday by Czech Radio - Radiožurnál. Štěpánek has led the union since 2005. He'll be president of the union for two more months. He will remain with the police even after leaving the head of the union.
"I can confirm that this week I handed over my written resignation to the Bureau, after which I will continue to perform my duties to the fullest for two months," Stepanek told Radiožurnál. "I've decided to be a free man who doesn't want to be chained to a union forever. And who wants to live a quieter life," he said, given the reasons for leaving.
The independent trade union of the Police of the Czech Republic brings together members and employees of the security forces or employees of the Ministry of the Interior. Among other things, the union participated in police protests against budget cuts or petitions for better conditions for the security forces. In 2011, for example, he got into a dispute with the then Minister of the Interior Radek John and organized a petition for his resignation. The leadership of the ruling coalition later agreed on John's departure.
Museum in Semily returns to the Velvet Revolution with an exhibition
Imitation of a normalization room with a TV, which runs footage of a brutal police raid against students on November 17, 1989 in Prague. This is also at the museum's new exhibition in Semily, which focuses on the Velvet Revolution. "The basis is to present what happened in Semily after the events on Národní street," said the curator of the exhibition Tomáš Chvátal.
"I would say that the atmosphere was basically the same everywhere, with the first demonstration in Semily on November 22nd, and then every day more people were gradually packed up," he said. Among the most active were initially a group of local dissidents around Miroslav Matěcha, who was the only one from the city and the immediate vicinity to sign Charter 77, and the Grandfathers, who spread the petition Several Sentences. According to Chvátal, the Civic Forum was created quite quickly. "One specific thing is that there was a very strong group of local doctors in the Civic Forum," the curator said.
About 50 photographs should draw visitors into the events in the city, taken 30 years ago by Karel Bárta. A video of the general strike on November 27, 1989, filmed by František Tomíček, which will be looped throughout the exhibition, has also been preserved. Ivan Hlas also spoke and sang at the demonstration. The Semilský archive also lent a number of preserved banners for the exhibition. "It said: Let's not get drunk with a roll, From the trough to the trough, We don't want violence," said Chvátal. Some of the changes in the city were very rapid at that time, for example, back in December, people in the all-Semil vote decided that the square would be Riegrovo and abolished the previous name Gottwaldovo.
The exhibition also captures events before the events of November. "In the first part, we introduce to witnesses and students what was before such a late normalization. I think we managed to collect unique documents from Semil, whether they are banners with various communist passwords or a bronze plaque from the then museum of the workers' movement," said Chvátal. One room is just supposed to give a sense of what it might have looked like in the living room of an ordinary household.
The last part of the exhibition focuses on what happened after the Velvet Revolution. It is focused on the first free elections. "We've painted election posters in one room. Those who have experienced it will remember the posters with us to Europe or there Václav Klaus is still under the heading of OF with the beautiful motto Everyone for his village," added the curator.
Let the fans be positive, Hašek wishes. Sparta awaits a hit in Pilsen
"We will play to the limit, we will do everything in our power to succeed. To manage the match both in the game and in the results," spartan Martin Hašek promised in an interview with club television.
In the week, the cup duel in Jihlava (2:1) decided by a goal. Sparta advanced to the next round, which was her duty. She's relieved, but she's still struggling in the arc.
Although the season is slowly spilling over into the second period, football Sparta is still looking for the face that coach Václav Jílek spoke about at the beginning of his engagement.
"But it is still Sparta, which has very good players. We have a difficult match ahead of us," warns Pilsen's Roman Procházka.
The last time the Spartans arrived in Štruncovy sady, in mid-May it was an unequivocal affair in the superstructure. The guests left after a thoughtless performance with a 0-4 thrashing, the largest in the history of the independent Czech league.
Whereas before the match the difference between the clubs was eight points in the table, Sparta are now nine points behind after 10 games of the new season. He's having one of the worst start to the season ever.
"It is not an easy situation for us or for fans who would like to see their beloved club completely different from what it is at the moment," hašek feels. "But we'd like them to continue to support us, stay positive and stand behind us."
Sparta do not know if they will be able to use Tetteh, who received a two-match suspension in Pilsen but appealed against him on Friday.
Costa, Dočkal, Drchal, Shot, Pulkrab, Zahustel, Krejci and Kadlec remain on numerous sick days, who is the only one of the cadre to remember the last Spartan victory in Pilsen in 2011.
The home side, who have won their last five matches, including Wednesday's cup in Hlučín, should only be without midfielder Čermák. And as captain, they should be led into the match by defender Jakub Brabec, a Spartan ediche.

"Horrifying study result." Islam does not belong to the West, the vast majority of Austrians think
1,200 respondents were interviewed, the survey shows considerable distrust of Islam in Austrian society.
Nearly 60 percent of Austria's population fears that some Muslims are terrorists, and 48 percent would demand a ban on the construction of mosques. For greater monitoring of the centers of Islam, 80 percent of respondents are.
Most Austrians also want Muslims to be restricted in their religious practices, claiming that the presence of Muslims sometimes makes them feel like foreigners in their own country.
"The outcome of the study is frightening," says study author Wolfgang Aschauer, adding: "Such a tendency towards ethnocentrism could eventually lead to the adoption of discriminatory attitudes. There is a danger that religious freedoms, which are attributed to Muslims, will narrow."
For believers, the critical attitude is less pronounced. Aschauer argues that in Austria it is not a conflict between religions, but between cultures. Dialogue and education could help dull polarization, according to the sociologist.
According to the study, the most hostile attitudes towards Muslims are held by voters of the extreme right, people without a university degree, or seniors over the age of 75. Green voters, people under the age of 30, and college students are the most favorable.
According to estimates by the Austrian Interior Ministry, austria, which has a population of about 8.7 million, has about 700,000 Muslims. The vast majority have Turkish roots. There are more than 400 Muslim prayer rooms and mosques in the country, and Islam has been officially recognized as a religion since 1912.
Thomas Cook: Czechs kicked out of hotel in Majorca. Guarantees weren't enough
The group's Austrian, German and Polish divisions also filed for insolvency in the week. The future of the Czech branch is currently under discussion and should be decided by the end of September.
According to jan Papež, Vice-President of the Association of Travel Agencies of the Czech Republic, there are three options for possible solutions in play - liquidation will be announced, or the company will be sold, or a team from the Czech branch will set up a new travel agency. "Which one it will be, but it cannot be predicted, will depend on the German owner," he told ČTK today.
In addition to two prematurely terminated tours, the CK also deals with cases where clients have had to pay for their stay out of their own right, although the company tries to provide hoteliers with guarantees. CK promised to pay its clients, according to the Pope, the company has sufficient security to do so.
Problems in hotels arose mainly in Majorca, where the company also asked the Czech consulate for help. In this context, the Pope described to ČTK one of the cases in which the hotel there threw out all the tourist offices. "The hotelier could not determine who belongs to German and who belongs to Czech society. Therefore, he threw everyone out of the hotel even though the domestic Neckermann provided guarantees," he said. According to Šrámek, the situation was finally resolved.
Last year, the Czech branch of the bankrupt British group Thomas Cook increased its sales to CZK 995 million, up almost 21 percent year-on-year, according to the company's annual report. It covers the financial year from October 2017 to the end of September 2018. On the contrary, the company's net profit decreased by about seven million crowns to CZK 15.3 million. In previous years, however, the company was left with an unpaid loss of almost CZK 103 million. The branch includes two basic divisions - in addition to CK Neckermann, it is also the Global Travel Lufthansa City Center.
Trump considers canceling U.S. chinese stock registration
US President Donald Trump's administration is considering revoking chinese firms' permits to trade on stock markets in the United States. An informed source told Reuters today. Such a move would be a radical escalation of trade tensions between the US and China. Shares of the companies concerned on the New York Stock Exchange immediately headed down after the report, taking the entire market with them.
The stock withdrawal would be part of a broader effort to curb U.S. investment in China, the source added. This confirmed a Bloomberg report that had sent shock shocks through financial markets shortly before. Shares of Chinese firms Alibaba Group Holding, JD.com, Pinduoduo, Baidu, Vipshop Holdings, Baozun and IQIYI lost between two and four percent.
According to government data from February, 156 Chinese companies are trading on the US Nasdaq and NYSE exchanges. They also include at least 11 state-owned enterprises.
Bloomberg pointed out that an exact mechanism had not yet been developed to ensure that Chinese firms' shares were withdrawn from US exchanges. A possible plan would have to be approved by Trump, who has given the green light to negotiations on the matter.
China and the US have been at war with each other for more than a year, imposing tariffs on each other. The dispute between the two countries has negative effects on the world economy and raises fears of a global economy recession. Washington is using tariffs to force Beijing to change trade practices and reduce China's trade surplus with the US.
According to CNBC, trade negotiations between the US and China are expected to resume on October 10. His goal is to end the trade war.
Police charge CzechTourism manager Aleš Pangráce over promotion contracts
The police have charged aleš Pangráce, the former manager of the state agency CzechTourism, with publicity contracts. The pangrác confirmed to SeznamNews that he took over the charges this week. Czech Television (ČT) reported last year that police officers were looking into contracts worth CZK 38 million in the case. Some of the money was going back to Pangrác, according to police, the server reports. In the case, criminologists were also interested in the Minister for Regional Development Klara Dostálová (for YES), to which CzechTourism belongs. The investigation into the case continues, according to the server.
Detectives from the National Centre against Organised Crime secured evidence in the case in the second half of last November. For example, they were at the headquarters of the Ministry of Regional Development, at the seat of CzechTourism, at the autodrome in Most or at the Sport Invest agency. The service computer was also taken from the Minister's apartment. The court order for a search warrant for Dostálová, which was previously quoted by ČT, stated that the Minister decided in 2016, when she was deputy, on the expenses of CzechTourism for the benefit of selected persons mediated and outside the standard official procedure. Dostálová stated at the time that she felt absolutely innocent, she did not have any erdocument, she can document everything and fully cooperates with the police.
According to the agency, it was an individual misconduct. The media had previously reported that he was the former director of the Regional Partnership Department in CzechTourism, Aleš Pangráce, who was removed due to the results of the audit. As a result, CzechTourism concluded 48 problematic contracts.
"Yes, I've been charged. But that's all I want to say," Pangrác told The News.
Vandal vandal damaged the cemetery in Dobruška
According to a notice received by the police, the vandalism on the scattering meadow inside the Dobruš cemetery was to take place between 13 and 17:00 on Wednesday.
"The material damage was estimated at CZK 60,000. Officers are asking any witnesses to the incident to report their findings in person on the service or by phone on the toll-free line 158," police spokeswoman Lucie Konečná said.

Hundreds of enslaved children freed from religious school in Nigeria
According to the BBC, there were nearly 500 men and boys there, Reuters reported, citing the police commissioner, that there were more than 300 children from the age of five. Some were chained together, others were chained to iron circles in the wall.
Kaduna Police Chief Ali Janga told the BBC that the raid on the school was carried out on the basis of a denunciation. He called the school a house of horrors. Starving people there were held by violence, tortured and sexually abused. They couldn't leave, there was razor wire above the fences. He says it's a slavery case.
Several people were detained in the raid, according to police spokesman Jakubu Sabo.
The children told police that they were taken to school by their parents or relatives, saying it was a religious school. "We have identified two children who are from Burkina Faso, but most were brought here by parents from nigerian states in the north," spokesman Sabo said of the victims' identities. Nigerian states in the north of the country are predominantly Muslim.
The school of imam Ahmad bin Hanbal impersonated a religious school focused on studying the Koran.
The liberations were taken to the stadium, where they are given help and food. Some have already met relatives.
A French chef is emeruing Michelin for removing a star. I suffer from depression, he says
Renowned French chef Marc Veyrat lost his third Michelin star in January this year, a year after winning it. He intends to sue the publisher of the red guide to get the exact reasons for the demotion. Veyrat also doubts the competences of Michelin inspectors, who he says mistook saffron for cheddar cheese. The first trial is scheduled to take place in November.
The chef of the famous La Maison de Bois restaurant in the Alpine region of Upper Savoy lost one of three Michelin stars in January this year. The publisher of the prestigious Le Guide Michelin will be tried because, in his opinion, the commissioners' conclusion was not properly justified. In addition, the removal of the asterisk occurred without any notice. "I've been depressed for six months. How dare you mess with the health of chefs?" said Veyrat to the commissioners.
Michelin reportedly gave the chef only vague reasons, such as that the chef put cheddar in the souffle, which the inspection did not like. "I put saffron in it, and the gentlemen thought it was cheddar because it was yellow. From the beginning, I have worked lovingly with Savoy ingredients," veyrat objected to the decision. He is convinced of the strong incompetence of michelin commissioners: "You are fraudsters who only cause controversy for commercial reasons." An indignant Veyrat doesn't understand "how could they afford to say we put cheddar in our souffle." "They insulted our region, my employees were crazy about it. We have eggs from our hens, milk from our own cows, gardeners collect fresh herbs every morning," he said.
A distinctive chef, always wearing a black hat and dark glasses, is opposed to a new generation of Michelin commissioners, and therefore calls for his restaurant to be removed from the red guide. However, the publisher refuses. "If the business remains open and our inspectors select it again, we will continue to recommend it," says Gwendal Poullennec, Michelin's international director.
According to Michelin, the chef's lawsuit shows that he has no meaningful charges yet, and the lawyer is yet to help formulate it. "We regret that Mr. Veyrat communicates with us rudely. But we will examine his comments carefully," he said.
In addition to La Maison de Bois, Marc Veyart owns two other three-star restaurants.
Technically perfect confusion with a weak scenario. Gemini with Will Smith didn't offend the critics
The dystopian sci-fi spectacle Gemini Man boasts an interesting prememinate - Will Smith will face off in the film with his younger version. But critics say the story is the weakest part of the film. The film will be released in Czech cinemas on 10 October.
Henry Brogan (Will Smith) is the industry leader. It kills efficiently and without unnecessary questions. But one day, he decides to hang up his career. Of course, his employers don't like that, who send another killer after Henry. The catch is that henry himself is the killer, or rather his younger clone made from DNA. Can one determined man win a fight over himself? Literally this time.
Three-time Oscar winner Ang Lee was supposed to be a guarantee of quality. It may be his first science fiction, but he has a wealth of experience with dramatic action films, as he demonstrated in the aforementioned Tiger and Dragon or the western Ride with the Devil. Six screenwriters collaborated on the script. The most famous is certainly David Benioff, one of the creators of the great Game of Thrones. But according to initial feedback, even all this wasn't enough for a good movie.
"Even though Ang Lee is trying to do great things in technical filmmaking, the film itself doesn't have the character to highlight it," says Screen Daily's Fionnuala Hannigan.
"This disappointing film is less than the sum of all the talents involved. Only the technological magic of filmmakers holds together the weak script and plot," said Stephen Dalton of The Hollywood Reporter.
"Gemini is a case in which a huge amount of work has resulted in an incredibly unimited action film," says Variety reviewer Peter Deburge.
"A confused product come up with a bizarre idea," Ella Kemp of IndieWire summarized in her review.
"It's hard to care that one man is the double of another when neither behaves like a human being," wrote Nicholas Barber of The Wrap.
Overview of bank accounts for children on the Czech market
Children's bank accounts are provided free of charge. However, the offer needs to be considered as some other account services are already charged. "The motivation of banks to offer accounts for children whose basic management is free of charge is straightforward. Financial houses expect to get their forgiven fees refunded one day. With a small migration of Czechs between banks, they are probably not wrong," says Kristýna Kuncová from dTest.
"Small bills," she says, do almost everything adult accounts can do. The child gets their own credit card, can enter payments, track account movements, somewhere has their own electronic banking. Banks set up an account, but it is up to parents to teach their children how to use it and also to control their payment.
"Relatively flexibly, a parent can set weekly or monthly limits, turn individual services on and off, and so on. Above all, however, it can monitor what is happening on the account, whether by looking over the Internet or by sms. Beware, these may no longer be free," kuncová adds, adding: "If a parent is considering an account for their child, they should consider their abilities and possibilities."
Strict but fair, we enjoy the clock! This is how benešov gymnasists see their favorite writer's teacher
Humanism should be present in every good book, believes Pavel Hoza. The high school teacher of Czech and history is also a poet, novelist and excite of literary life in a small town.
Bohuslav Reynek comes to mind over Pavel Hoza's lyrics. His poetry, his paintings. Bare trees, whitish country houses, trembling grass, shepherds, sheep and goats, old roads and people who have been after them for centuries. Grieving, swearing, blessing. This contemporary student of Reynk teaches Czech, literature and history at the grammar school in Benešov, runs the equivalent of the Prague Viola in the Café for a word and organizes the Benešov Literary Festival every year.
Wife swap: Ondra's parents were cruelly abused! He ended up in an institution.
It was nerve-racking. The allegedly troubled son Ondřej (9) was severely punished by his father at any moment. "He came home from school and lied with the snack. Lukas looked at me and said he would kneel as punishment," Lucie described in The Exchange. Dad Lukáš made little Ondra kneel in the corner for several hours! Besides, he said off camera, he had to suffer like this on a wooden foot massage mat! "Andrew came to me after filming and said - aunt, I'm making these messes and notes just so I'm not here because I want to go to an institution," Lucie described the moment when she fully understood what was going on behind the studio door. And the boy's wish finally came true...
His condition was so serious that after filming he was taken from his family and placed for a month in the Centre for Educational Care in České Budějovice. He returned briefly to his father and surrogate mother Aneta (28), but then went to a diagnostic institute for troubled children. "When I got home, Aneta immediately posted me on facebook, we texted for a while. What she cared most was whether we got the money. I hardly ever responded to that. But then she texted me that the little one was in an institution, that they gave it back to them, now he's in a diagnostics room. They are both out of work," says mother Lucie from Pilsen.
Lightning, of course, addressed the other side, but he received only a vague answer. "I'm not in the mood, I'm sick, call me later," Aneta said, hanging up the phone.
Sparta doesn't want to lose Tetteh in Pilsen. She appealed against the two-match penalty.
Football Sparta appealed against a two-match penalty for striker Benjamin Tetteh, who was suspended by the disciplinary committee for sunday's derby with Slavia (0-3).
The Flight Club announced this on its Twitter account and is now awaiting the verdict of the appeals board.
Tetteh has already served half of his sentence in Wednesday's home cup match in Jihlava. Sparta are now looking to allow the 22-year-old Ghanaian striker to start in Sunday's round 11 first-round match in Pilsen.
The situation of last October could be repeated. At that time, Olomouc appealed against the penalty for Šimon Falta, who on Thursday received a one-match suspension from the disciplinary committee for his suspension against Liberec.
The appeals board did not have time to hear the case, so the sentence was postponed and Falta could start on Saturday, paradoxically against Sparta.
The commission finally confirmed the one-match penalty for the Olomouc midfielder the following week and Falta missed the following duel with Zlín.
Tetteh's disciplinary team stopped the action for a foul on slavish david hovorka, for which he received a straight red card from referee Miroslav Zelinka in the 82nd minute.
The alleged spitting of a Ghanaian player on the captain of his opponent Tomas Souček has not been proven.
The Germans elected Keller to head the football association
Fritz Keller, the current head of bundesliga Freiburg, is expected to become the new chairman of the German Football Association. The 62-year-old winemaker, gastronom and hotelier was elected unanimously for three years, and did not have a running mate.
Keller replaced Reinhard Grindel, who resigned in April over an unalnowable income affair. His other predecessors, Theo Zwanziger and Wolfgang Niersbach, will go on trial again for possible bribery in the 2006 World Cup.
Keller said one of the main goals would be to restore trust to the union and pull it out of the crisis. "It's not going to be a One Man Show, a lot of people are going to be held accountable. The union is better than its reputation," said Keller, who presented all his tasks under the motto: Together we can do it.
After being elected to head the union, Keller left his post in Freiburg.
There was a fire in the underground of the ČSA mine in Karviná, no one was injured
There was a fire in the underground of the ČSA Mine in Karviná this morning. The cause of the fire is not yet known. However, no one was injured, Ivo Čelechovský, a spokesman for the mining company, told ČTK.
The fire broke out at 04:25 at a depth of about 1200 meters. "None of the employees were hurt, no one was hurt. Paramedics immediately intervened on the spot and immediately extinguished the fire and carried out a field search. The site was immediately closed and made inaccessible," the spokesman said. The exact cause of the fire will now be determined by a special committee.
In the former Ostrava-Karviná area, coal is mined only in the Karvina part, in the mines ČSA, Lazy, Darkov, ČSM-Sever and ČSM-South. Mining is expected to end at The Lazy Mine this year, with other mines also awaiting a gradual downturn. The mining company OKD is the only producer of hard coal in the Czech Republic, its production last year was 4.62 million tons. There are 9,000 people working in the mines.
Berlin responds to public pressure and tackles the housing crisis. Buys 6,000 apartments from a private company
Berlin will buy 6,000 former social housing from private Luxembourg firm ADO Properties SA for €920 million ($23.8 billion) sold by the city 15 years ago. This responds to public pressure to rebel against skyrocketing rent prices. According to Berlin Senator Katrin Lompscher of the Left Party (Die Linke), this is the largest such buyout in the history of the German capital. The opposition criticizes the move.
"The intention is to maintain stable rents in Berlin and give tenants certainty," Berlin Mayor Michael Müller (SPD) said in a statement. "At the same time, we will continue to build new apartments and legally treat the rent freeze," he added. Gewobag, a municipal company, will take over thousands of apartments located in spandau and reinickendorf in the western part of the city this December.
According to Jefferies analyst Thomas Rothäusler, the city bought too expensively. Rothäusler told Bloomberg that he estimated that the housing unit overpaid about 10 percent above its book value.
According to germany's opposition Party, the Liberals (FDP), the Berlin authorities are contributing to real estate speculation. The FDP tweeted on Friday. The Alternative for Germany (AfD) protest party called the move a "waste of money."
As early as mid-July, Gewobag had acquired 670 apartments on Berlin's Karl-Marx-Allee street, der Spiegel reported on its website. The prize was not disclosed by the council at the time. The dispute over apartments on the former exhibition avenue from the time of the GDR was accompanied by protests and filled the front pages of the German press. It became a symbol of the pious situation of tenants in large German cities, the paper wrote.
The German capital used to be famous for its low living costs and low rents. In recent years, however, it has become more attractive. Rent prices have doubled in the past decade, according to AFP, and some residents find it difficult to find affordable housing.
Nokia is suing the Brno company over the name Lokia. People will not get us right, moravians believe
Nokia objected to Lokia's application to the Industrial Property Office. However, according to the CCV, submasing products is unlikely.
The Brno-based company developing CCV software is facing legal action from Finnish telecommunications equipment manufacturer Nokia. The Finns do not like the fact that the brno warehouse management company's program is called Lokia WMS, E15 newspaper reported. Nokia therefore objected to lokia's application to the Industrial Property Office. The CCV resents that subdiching is unlikely.
Marketing Director Petr Ondrášek said that two dozen customers have been using the program since last September.
"Nokia enjoys recognition and trust all over the world. When someone tries to register a stamp that we believe may lead to a change or weakening of our brand, we take steps to protect our valuable asset," said Nokia spokesman Mark Durrant.
Brno developers claim that they did not think about the brand famous in the past by mobile phones when creating the warehouse program. The designation Lokia according to CCV is based on the Latin name for one type of dragonfly, the rapid movement of which is to be an analogy to the movement of warehouse workers around the warehouse.
"On the Czech market, the possibility of submissiveness is unlikely. We sell modern cloud software, through which companies equip their warehouse operations, and we are not really aiming for the field of mobile phone production. And we don't want to be compared to a brand that may be running out of train in its field," CCV manager Tomáš Kormaňák told E15.
CCV applied for brand protection in August before the programme was launched by the Industrial Property Office. "It requested protection for products and services belonging to Classes 9, 35 and 42, as the software belongs to Class 9, the related business management services in the warehouse belong to Class 35 and the development of computer software belongs to Class 42 according to the international classification," said Ondrášek.
Nokia's objection is based on the fact that nokia's earlier trade mark is valid in all classes of goods and services and thus covers the widest possible range of goods and services and therefore, of course, also overlaps in classes 9, 35 and 42. 'CCV does not challenge the claim of the objector as regards conformity with those classes of goods and services. In reality, however, these are completely different brands aimed at other target groups," said Ondrášek.
According to E15, a brand dispute can take months and can complicate the company's business.
Sydney to London in four hours? In 2030, reality may be possible
Sabre combines a classic aircraft engine with a rocket engine. It's designed to power the plane at twice the speed of the Concordes. "Once the Sabre engine is operational, it could allow us to reach Australia in about four hours," Turnock said. And, for example, the distance between London and New York could travel in one hour.
The Independent notes that so-called hypersonic flights, in which sound speeds are five times higher, are complicated due to engine overheating. However, Sabre (Synergetic Air Breathing Rocket Engine) should deal with this problem by using super cold helium to prevent temperatures from rising.
"The most important thing about Sabre is that it's a hybrid rocket engine and an aircraft engine that's powered by a stream of exhaust fumes generated from the air," says Shaun Driscoll of Reaction Engines. "Missiles haven't been that big in the last 70 years, while aircraft ones have. So when you combine the engines, you can have a very light and efficient propulsion system and basically create a space plane," he added.
The engine is currently being tested, with test flights expected to begin around the middle of next year. Commercial flights around 2030.
Kovosvit sells an office building and other halls. Expects worse times
Due to the restructuring, Kovosvit ended last year with a consolidated loss of CZK 100 million, consolidated turnover was CZK 1.3 billion. Last year's main problems include Chef's lack of staff and shifts in subcontractors. This year, demand for machine tools has fallen by 10 to 20 percent year-on-year. "This is related to the expected decrease in turnover by the order of ten percent," said the CEO. In 2017, Kovosvit had sales of CZK 1.3 billion and profit after tax of CZK 40.1 million. The loss for 2016 was 719 million.
Kovosvit now offers for sale several properties, halls and land that it either does not use or only minimally. This also applies to the administrative building, where it uses two of the five floors, and not quite yet. "Part of the long-term restructuring plan is to slim down Kovosvit, make its operations more efficient. The sale of assets is not part of any current solution, whether it is cash flow, for example, but part of a long-term plan where we want to devote all resources to investment development," said the CEO.
About half of Kovosvit's production is exported. Its standard markets are the EU and Russia, and last year, to a lesser extent, Asia. This year, Chef ranks among the most interesting In India, where Kovosvit won a contract for machines allowing five-person machining worth 100 million crowns. This year, the company also exported two five-person machines for CZK 30 million to China. "There is another order in the same volume that we would like to fulfill by the end of the year," cook said. In the Russian market and elsewhere, Kovosvit faces restrictions due to sanctions.
Last year, the company sold two five-person machining centers to France, a company that subcontracted airbus. This May, she delivered another machine, one more should be delivered at the end of the year or early 2020.
The main company investment this year was the switch of heating from steam to hot water for CZK 20 million. Kovosvit employs 500 people, the average working wage is CZK 28,500. The company is looking for casting grinders for foundry, machine tools, lathes and electricians.
The company has been owned since September 2016 by industrialist and armsmaker Jaroslav Strnad. The company has a tradition in the production of machine tools. It was founded in 1939 by Tomáš Baťa. The company had up to 3,000 employees at the time.
Milan Jakubů: The funeral was stolen by the army for itself! Says Andor Shondor
There is still confusion surrounding the funeral of Brigadier General Milan Jakubů. Media speculated this week that the military had planned a final farewell to the Deputy Director of Military Intelligence, despite the wishes of the family, as bombastic as the soldiers could. There were also inconsistencies regarding the date of the funeral. Ministry of Defence spokesman Jan Pejšek denied this.
"It's nonsense! We have been in contact with the family from the beginning, the friday date of the funeral is arranged from the beginning, no one has changed it. Just like military honors apply. We will just deal with possible media participation with regard to the family," Pejšek told The Flash on Wednesday. The funeral will eventually take place on Friday and will not miss all military honors, including the overflight of fighter jets.
But there is still a tense atmosphere around the last farewell to the popular general. The funeral ceremony will not be attended by people who have worked with the general in the past!
These include, for example, the former head of military intelligence, Andor Šándor (62), who met Milan Jakubů 17 years ago. Shondor remembers his former colleague as a hardworking, intelligent and "good man."
Moreover, in recent years, he has met regularly at the anniversary celebrations of the founding of military intelligence. That is why he would like to say goodbye to Milan Jakubů. "Personally, I would go to milan jakubů's funeral," Šándor told The Flash. But he can't.
"I know of other people in the organization who would like to go, but are unlucky because the potentates usurp the funeral for themselves. I don't think it's right to privatize a funeral like this," said the security expert. Nor does he play the supposedly considered closing of the ceremony to the public due to the secrecy of the military's top officials.
"The leadership of the army is not classified, and the leaders of military intelligence do not, because they need to be promoted at Prague Castle, we see them there. If the media's information is true and the family has indeed been left behind by the military, it is, of course, a family matter. Personally, I would never allow the army to oversted the family and its wishes," Shandor concluded.
Milan Jakubů died in a car accident near Spindleruv Mlyn on Saturday. Milan's Rapide head-on collision with a Ford Mustang was allegedly caused by sports car driver Vojtěch Ch. (31).
The amateur racer on the turn was supposed to drive into oncoming traffic, Milan Jakubů apparently had no chance to prevent the collision. His wife (47) suffered serious injuries in the accident and may suffer the consequences for the rest of her life. Police questioned the culprit of the accident on Thursday.
Commentary by Jan Šindelář: Manage railways as a company
Heavenly election, while apparently not entirely smooth, is the culmination of a sad story about the state's inability to give the railways a clear direction. The board has been incomplete for over a year, and even after Wednesday night, that doesn't change because one of the members resigned. The provisional takes place.
The selection procedure itself was a farce from the outset, if only because the requirements for candidates, especially in the field of practice, were significantly reduced. Compared to last year's selection, the requirements for the size of the company in which the candidate was supposed to operate in the past have diminished. First, the members of the selection committee and then the supervisory board played only the role of pimprlat.
Nebeský presented perhaps the weakest professional cv of the five finalists, yet without practice from a large company he smeared experienced guys from the management of logistics giants and transport companies. It was the participation of interesting managers from the private sector that was probably the brightest aspect (and the best hope) of the whole process. Nowadays, those concerned know that they have played only the role of epic backdrops in a political game.
Maybe Heavenly surprises, shows great talent, and eventually turns out to be the greatest runway boss of all time. But, at least in the beginning, it will be accompanied by the aftertaste of a political newsstand. Czech Railways does not expect an easy period, they have to cope with competition in the liberalisation of the market and with a shortage of employees in operation. There are no drivers, shifters and mechanics. What are the motivations for further work and respect for management when the state behaves like an elephant in porcelain in the top management?
The second important group is creditors. How they play at the head of the runways will be seen next spring when the runways defend their ratings. What is certain is that creditors perceive instability. Sadly, someone else goes to Moody's to defend the rating every year for Czech Railways. The agency has not escaped frequent changes in railway management and political influence on the company, criticizing them already this summer.
The ANO movement, among other things, has a motto that the state must be run as a company. For starters, it would be enough for one large state-owned company to run as a company and not as a state. Czech Railways is still one of the largest companies in the country and it would be good if the best were to run them. They applied, but the state despised them. It can certainly be argued that the position at the head of the railways has always been a political issue. But then we can forgive the antics of the tender.
The couple wrapped the dog in tape and drowned in the river, the bag was found by children
The case took place at the end of July in the village around Wallachia Hat. A 27-year-old woman brought home a donated dog one to two years old, whom she wanted to take care of. But her partner of ten years did not like the fact that she was a, so he decided to get rid of her.
"He wrapped the animal in duct tape and rope and greatly eliminated his vocal expression. He put the dog in a jute bag, which he tied. Then they took the animal together to the river, where they threw it in a bag. The dog was demonstrably alive when the dog was thrown into the water," said Zlín police spokeswoman Monika Kozumplíková.
The next day, children playing by the river found a jute bag on the bank. When they opened it, they discovered the body of a dead dog inside. So they called out to a woman who was passing by and ran away. The woman reported the incident to the police emergency hotline on 158.
"Thanks to the knowledge of the inhabitants of the town, the police have discovered who is probably the perpetrator of this incredible act. And they were right. Both the man and the woman confessed to the crime and described how the incident took place," a police spokeswoman added.
An expert opinion in the field of veterinary medicine confirmed that the dog died in a clearly agonizing manner as a result of suffocation, when before death the animal suffered in a matter of minutes.
"The actions of the perpetrators undoubtedly point to a clear intention to dispose of the animal in this reprehensible manner at all costs, even if they could have donated or sold the dog. The Commissioner of the Criminal Police of Zlín accused the couple of committing the crime of animal cruelty committed in complicity. Both of the unpunished could spend up to three years behind bars if convicted," Kozumplíková noted.
Thank you for dancing! Singer Leonard Cohen's latest album will be released posthumously
Thanks for the Dance will include unrealed material and various musical collaborations put together by the singer's son. The album will be released on November 22.
In October 2016, the album You Want it Darker was released, on which Cohen collaborated with his son Adam. He asked him to help him finish the songs. In an intimate recording, Cohen symbolically copes with impending death. He died a month after the album was released at the age of 82.
Seven months later, Adam Cohen began working on the materials he had left behind from his father. He invited a number of musicians to collaborate - Damien Rice, Bryce Dessner, Javier Mas and singer Beck at random.
"When we invented music for my father's words, we used his own distinctive musical techniques. So he's still with us," Adam Cohen said of the album. "What amazes me most about him is the reaction of those who have heard it before. One by one, they say Leonard is still alive," he added.
The first swallow of the album is the short song The Goal. "I'm almost alive, I'm almost home," Cohen sings in his signature honeyed voice. He sang about death, he knew he wouldn't live to see the release of the new material. He admitted it in an interview with The New Yorker a month before he died. "I'm ready to die. I hope it's not too unpleasant," he said.
In September 2018, Adam Cohen published a collection of his father's poetry called The Flame. It will be published in Czech under the title Plamen on 31 December by Argo publishing house.
The first Miss Christ finally went into herself: She lost a few pounds and immediately looked through
Ivana Christová (49) had her first modern miss from 1989 with overweight problems for many years, causing her not only physical problems, but especially psychological ones. She suffered because she had changed a lot since the days of Miss Czechoslovakia. But now it looks like she took the reprimands to heart and went into battle with the excess weight. Even if it's a long shot.
She used to be a first-class beauty who conquered Paris. But it has been 30 years since then, and Ivana Christová can only remember the beauty contest. Not just for fame, but for how skinny she was.
Over time, she decided not to comply with strict modeling rules, which ordered her to be as slimmed down as possible and often not to eat. She decided to stop listening and started indulged in what she wanted.
But she went from hunger strikes to overeating, which was immediately a sign of her figure. She tried to disguise the extra pounds with various loose-fitting clothes, which added to the size of the plump shapes.
Now it looks like Ivana really went for it. Visibly losing weight, she began to dress tastefully and appropriately for her fuller figure.
Everyone present was surprised at the launch of miloš Zapletal's book (75) that she had seen through again and already has the features of a pretty brunette who in 1989 entered history not only as the first winner of Miss after the revolution, but also by the controversy her victory caused.
Christová will always be the first beauty winner, but also the very first one, which the spectators at the Palace of Culture and Sport in Ostrava whistled at as a sense of deprivation when she put on the crown.
"A parody of justice." Scientist warned of pollution cancer, sits in Turkish prison
Sik, along with other scientists, participated in a study commissioned by the Turkish Ministry of Health between 2011 and 2015. It concluded that pollution of water, soil and food in some industrial areas in the west of the country was linked to an increased incidence of cancer among locals.
Scientists mentioned in particular the Dilovasi industrial zone, which lies about 80 kilometers from Istanbul, and where a number of chemical and metallurgical plants are located. According to them, people living in its vicinity suffer from cancer far more often than the international average.
Erdogan retaliates for coup, international criticism despite
It seemed to Sik that the government, despite the clear conclusions of the study, was not taking any action on the matter. He wrote several articles about the research in the opposition daily Cumhuriyet. Authorities subsequently began prosecuting him for leaking classified information.
"The study clearly showed the extent to which water sources were contaminated with toxic substances," Sik told reporters after the verdict. "The court's decision shows that the results of studies directly related to public health may be withholded. This is unacceptable," the scientist added.
"Instead of pursuing alarm-sounding people through the courts, the Turkish authorities should investigate this important public health problem," said Andrew Gardner of the Turkish branch of AI.
Environmental and human rights organisations have long accused the Turkish Government of not enforce environmental regulations despite the rapid development of industry in certain regions.
After the thwarted coup of 2016, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's regime launched a massive wave of arrests. Nearly 80,000 people are now behind bars, including a number of cumhuriyet employees. The authorities have also placed 150,000 civil servants and members of the armed forces on full duty or completely laid off.
The opposition and human rights organizations accuse the government of using the coup attempt to persecute its opponents. But the authorities argue that these are measures necessary to ensure national security.
The fastest man on the planet missed the tests. I'm not taking anything, he's defending himself
The traditionally high-profile race for the fastest man on the planet will be a hunt for defending silver medal defenceman Christian Coleman at the World Championships. The 23-year-old American is the world leader in 9.81 seconds and has lost only once this year. However, his start at the peak of the season was in jeopardy due to a case of missed doping tests.
The US Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) closed his case in early September without pressing charges for formal reasons. Coleman did not pass three doping tests last year and this year, but not within 12 months. His first wrongdoing was dated 1 April 2018, the start of the second quarter, but he did not miss the test until June 6. And since the third omission occurred on April 29, 2019, Coleman did not commit three misdemptions in the form of three failed inspections in 12 months.
Coleman argued that he had merely forgotten to update the app's whereabouts data. "I don't do drugs or take anything legal. Many athletes take legal creatine or protein powder or various other supplements for faster regeneration. And I don't take anything, I work hard and that's what it's all about," he said before the start of world championships.
He suffered his only defeat in six starts in the 100 this year at the Diamond League in Shanghai, where he was surpassed by compatriot Noah Lyles by just six thousandths of a second. He took advantage of Coleman's absence to triumph in the Diamond League finals, but he will only run the 200 at the World Championships.
On paper, the second fastest racer with a performance of 9.86 is 22-year-old Nigerian Divine Oduduru, who has only done well in American university competitions so far.
Justin Gatlin, a 37-year-old American who shot a time of 9.87 at Stanford in June, will defend his title. He ran the last 100 in Zagreb in just 10.29 because he slightly injured his posterior thigh muscle.
South African Akani Simbine, three-time Rio Olympic medalist Andre de Grasse and European champion Zharnel Hughes are also among the favourites. The fastest Jamaican with a time of 9.96 is 2011 world champion Yohan Blake.
The men's 100 will start on Friday with a prelimin and a run. The semifinals and finals are on Saturday. The medals will be won at 21:15 CEST (21:15 CEST).
Plane crash near Žinkov in Pilsen: Two people did not survive the accident
Two people, a man (†63) and a woman (†38) were on the plane. "The plane requested permission to land at Chaloupky airport near Klatovy at 9:30 p.m.," police spokeswoman Dana Ladman said. This was also the last record, at which time it was supposed to be located near Vojovice near Zinkov according to gps coordinates.
But it never reached Klatovy Airport again. The search immediately began for the missing aircraft, which sent out a distress signal. "In addition to the police helicopter, a military helicopter was involved," police spokeswoman Martina Korandová said. But the search operation didn't have a happy ending.
In the forest near Petrovice near Mečín, which is about six kilometers from where the plane was last reported, the wreckage of the helicopter crew was noticed before 9 a.m. "We found a plane and two bodies with no signs of life," Korandova said.
The crashed machine remained partially wedged in the branches of the trees, pieces also fell on the ground in the vicinity. "We will investigate the cause of the accident in cooperation with expert experts and staff of the Institute for Expert Investigation of Causes of Air Accidents," Korandová added.
Civilization in lent time
I recently remembered a beautiful "catchphrase" from one of šimek's great short stories with Grossmann, which takes place partly in the cemetery, which reads as follows: "I warned her that she cries well, but on someone else's grave!" It occurred to me that many of the world's politicians engaged in the senseless fight against climate change are now behaving very similarly.
They act as if humans rule planet Earth. In fact, we're just a speck on its surface, which she can blow out like a fierce gust of wind, like a candlelight. Perhaps few of them look at the famous British and American science documents on the destructive abilities of our blue ball. After all, it would be enough for one of the larger active volcanoes to get properly, and our advanced civilization would be reprim hurtling.
And that will happen in the near future is highly likely. Many large volcanoes, in the opinion of leading volcanologists, have "loaded and armed" (for example, Katla in Iceland).
In a way, it would be ideal if the eruption, if it had to happen one day, happened as soon as possible. Even before trillions of dollars are wasted on measures aimed at reducing carbon dioxide production, because any properly angry volcano, along with dust and toxic volcanic gases, can release at least 100 times more into the air than was spared at the expense of europe's people.
So it makes no sense to forcibly reduce CO2 production. In addition, it has been scientifically proven that with its significantly higher proportion in the air, plants form more biological matter and are also more drought-resistant. For mankind, possible warming is considerably more favorable than, for example, the rapid return of the Ice Age.
Given the still insufficiently explored impact of solar cycles on the Earth's climate, we must come to only one reasonable conclusion: Let us try hard to keep the Earth as clean as possible, and try to adapt to other changes with which we cannot compete with force at the lowest possible cost!
Repair of the Krkonoše Museum will be a year late
The Krkonoše National Park Administration (KRNAP) postponed the deadline for submitting bids by three weeks to the second tender for the repair of the Krkonoše Museum in Vrchlabi. The original opening date for the envelopes was 20 September, said National Park Spokesman Radek Drahný. The reason for the postponement of the deadline for submitting tenders is to reduce the budget from CZK 110 million to CZK 83 million.
"We are currently working with prices that are on the market. There has been a change in the budget, it is the price we expect to be offered. If someone makes an offer that is acceptable, the work will begin as soon as possible," said Drahný.
Compared to the original plans, the start of the repair of the museum is about a year late. KRNAP wanted to have a selected contractor for the construction part by the end of last year and start construction work this spring. According to the management of the National Park Service, European subsidies of CZK 123 million for the project are not at risk.
Krnap's administration is unable to select a construction company to repair the museum. The second competition was held this summer, because in the previous tender all the offers of companies significantly exceeded the then estimated price of 65 million. The offers exceeded CZK 100 million.
The museum, which is housed in a former Augustinian monastery and belongs to the KRNAP Administration, has been closed since autumn 2017. The selected company should provide the construction part of the project. The total cost, including the construction of a new exposition, is estimated at CZK 210 million. The KRNAP visitor centre should be established in the now evacuated building by the end of 2021 after the transformation of the expositions.
The renovated museum with a new interactive exhibition, which should be a story of nature and people settled in the mountains and build on the successful stone and life exhibition, should serve as a representative entrance gate of the Giant Mountains for visitors. The visitor centre should provide information about the past and present of the Giant Mountains in the most understandable way possible and motivate people to explore the mountains and protect them. It should also take on the role of a traditional museum. The centre will also offer opportunities for concerts, festivals, theatre performances or open-air lectures. The plans include the construction of a new entrance to the building, the creation of a research room or a café.
Toyota still believes in hydrogen, preparing second generation Mirai
The Toyota Mirai was never supposed to be a concept. Toyota was so serious about it that even though there was virtually no hydrogen pumping infrastructure in the world, it still put it on the menu. Not to the standard, the customer really had to go after this car in a targeted way, but no one else offered such a variant at the time.
Toyota chief Takeshi Uchiyamada confirmed at an international hydrogen conference that a new generation will arrive next year. Toyota still believes that these cars have a future and will be priced out of hybrids within 10 years. Of course, this is linked to the development of pumping networks. But the future is as much about hydrogen as it is about electricity.
The conference often used the word hydrogen with the needs of environmentally friendly operation, not passenger cars, but on the contrary large tractors, boats, trains, etc. Just the means of transport they need to overcome on a single long-distance refueling. Pure battery versions cannot offer this. Toyota could thus find new outlets thanks to its great experience and long development.
It remains to be remembered that, like Toyota, hyundai, which now offers the Nexo hydrogen crossover, believes in hydrogen drive.
Strawberry, plum and invisible. Choose the right shade of lipstick: There's not just one red
When choosing a red lipstick, you should first determine whether you are warm or cold type. Try a simple test - look at the veins on the wrist. If they are blue, you are a cold type, if green, then you belong to the types warm. When choosing a new red lipstick, put it in the first place on the order based on the undertone. Next, take into out the texture.
If you are one of the women with cold undertones, then lipsticks in purple, plum, cherry or mauve color are suitable for you.
If you fall into the category of warm skin undertones, choose such lipsticks as well. You can tell by the fact that they gravitate towards orange, coral, gold or brown reflections.
You may find that some veins look green and others blue. In that case, congratulate yourself - you don't have to look at the undertone and you can only focus on your color preferences.
Purposeful slander? Ústí Zoo is looking for a new veterinarian, no one is interested
Most recently, at the end of this month. The city management attributes this to the rumors that surred around the former director of the zoo and at the same time the veterinarian Václav Poživil for purposefully killing exotic animals that he cared for. For example, the female rhinoCeros Zamba, the elephant Kalu or the orangutan Douche.
The city council has therefore announced a new contract. "For veterinary care for the zoo with an estimated value of CZK 3.5 million excluding VAT and for the city's Centre for Animals in Need with an estimated performance value of CZK 2.8 million excluding VAT," said Romana Macová, a city spokeswoman.
Deputy Mayor Věra Nechybová (UFO) explained that this is the third time the city has announced a competition for veterinary services. "Dr. Nourished had to explain the unfounded suspicions. I consider it an outrageous dehonest of such a high-quality expert," she said.
Experts specialized in exotic animals, according to her, are very few. "It's certainly not pleasant. Meanwhile, the zoo provides veterinary care in the form of orders," she said. Orders and contracts cost the same money. "However, the garden must comply with the Public Procurement Act in order to finance it," explained Nikola Roštejnská, a zoo spokeswoman.
Václav Poživil himself is one of the recognized experts. For example, he participated in a unique operation in which jane the oyster cheetah became the first cheetah in the world to be given a total endo-prosthesis. He served as director of the zoo from 2009 to 2012. He made no comment on the anonymous rumors against himself. Yesterday, he didn't receive phone calls or respond to text messages.
As far as the zoo contract is concerned, some zookeepers think that there is not necessarily a lack of awareness of it in the zero interest in it. For example, the Ústí veterinarian Jiří Král has not heard of her. "This is the first I've heard it from you. No one's ever heard from us. I think that kind of thing will spread quickly," he added.
Line D will be supervised by a new metro architect, bringing experience from the London Underground
The Prague Transport Company has chosen an architect to oversee the design of the metropolitan metro. From October, Anna Švarc will become her primary task, her primary task will be the appearance of the new line D, but she will also be in charge of the existing stations. According to her, the metro cannot be seen only as a transport structure, subway travel should also bring an aesthetic experience.
The Czech architect, who participated in the reconstruction of three London Underground stations, for example, won a tender published by the Prague Transport Company (DPP).
In addition, 14 other applicants participated in the tender. "The selection procedure included a cover letter and a CV. Apparently, my previous practice from London, where I created a kind of aesthetic manual for the local metro in a team of three people," says the new metro architect. According to her, her practice from the Institute of Planning and Development of The Capital City of Prague.m could also decide.
He doesn't just see metro as a traffic jam. Stations should also have aesthetic value.
"I have ideas about how the subway will change, how the space will improve. However, I will not know how this will realistically take place until the following weeks, when the transport company introduces me to their ideas," says Švarc.
"This is not a series of dogmas, but rather recommendations aimed primarily at maintaining the context of all stations in case they are reconstructed," says the design manual.
Whether a similar instrument is also a way to improve public space in the Prague metro is a question. The Prague Metro is specific. "Whether the manual is ideal or whether it can be covered by a personality, I really do not know yet," švarc concludes.
Former French President Chirac will be buried on Monday, with a public memorial on Sunday
The funeral of former French President Jacques Chirac, who died on Thursday at the age of 86, will take place on Monday evening at The Montparnasse Cemetery in Paris. French media report, citing Chirac's family. The ceremony will be private.

Meanwhile, there are further reactions from the world and france to the deaths of the former Mayor of Paris and president from 1995 to 2007, whom Prime Minister Édouard Philippe now described as "French in the truest sense of the word."
Chirac was remembered, for example, by the Japanese, because the politician was known for his love of their country and sumo sport. The news of the former French president's death made headlines in all Japanese newspapers, including sports newspapers, the French press notes.
The Tribal Art Museum on Paris's Quai Branly Avenue, founded by Chirac, will not charge admission fees for 10 days in honor of the former head of state.
Pumpkin World Opening Delayed Pumpkin Ripening
Nová Ves u Leština (Havlíčkobrodsko) - The pumpkin world opened today for more than a month in Nové Ves near Leština in Havlíčkobrodsk. Decorations made up of thousands of freshly harvested pumpkins dominate the garden of the mighty orange pyramids. The autumn event, which is becoming a tradition, starts a week later this year, as the pumpkins on the surrounding seven hectares of fields of the Pipka family have matured longer. There are still a lot of them in the field, Jaroslava Pipková told ČTK today.
The Pips grow many kinds of pumpkins, but for the last two years they haven't had the weather. This year's harvest was delayed and some species did not come out. "We have enough orange pumpkins for Halloween as usual, but some species for fine-hearted people have failed," Pipkova said. Nevertheless, the farm can choose from several types, from the aforementioned large pumpkins suitable for carving and chipping decorations through hokaido pumpkins or elongated "spaghetti" to ornamental pumpkins of various colors and shapes.
Growing pumpkins is laborious. Farmers manually dig up plants and harvest their fruits, cutting off the stem of pumpkin with scissors. Pipka's pumpkin world has been open regularly since 2010, and last year's editions attracted thousands of people. Pumpkin decorations are complemented by straw attractions or log mazes. Visitors will also see animals kept on the farm. It will be open daily until 3 November.
Details of the event can be found on the farm's website, where growers also offer some recipes for pumpkin dishes, including pumpkin muffins and juice. Other options for modifying pumpkins in the kitchen are told by visitors themselves. "A lot of cookbooks have tried their recipes, and we get inspired," Pipkova said. She pointed out that some pumpkin housekeepers also pickle like cucumbers.
The ministry plans a flat-rate meal voucher from 2021. Nothing changes in tax
The Ministry of Labour and Labour is preparing an amendment to the Income Taxes Act, according to which the employee would receive money for meals directly. According to the Ministry of Health, a quarter of employees, i.e. about a million people who do not yet receive meal vouchers, will also be emant to support meals.
However, according to david Rýce, president of the Association of Voucher System Operators, many small companies that do not have a canteen or meal vouchers provide their employees with meals, for example by importing food or by agreement with restaurants.
"The essence of the plan is that we do not change anything about the tax advantage. It will no longer pay for health and social insurance," Schiller said Friday. It added that the threshold for the maximum employer contribution applicable as a tax credit would also be maintained.
The Income Tax Act allows companies to pay a maximum of 55 percent of the price of a meal voucher. The remaining part is paid to the employee, in some cases it is also paid by the employer, but without a tax credit. The best value of the meal voucher for employees and employers this year is CZK 123.
Prindiš, Prskavec and Fišerová safely advanced to the semi-finals of the World Championships
Kayakers Vít Prindiš and Jiří Prskavec and canoeist Tereza Fišerová safely advanced to the semi-finals of the World Water Slalom Championships in Seu d'Urgell. Prindiš was fourth in Friday's qualifier, Sparkler fifth and Fišerová eighth. Three other Czech representatives will be seeking a semi-final start in Spain in the afternoon qualifying run.
Vavřinec Hradilek, who received a 50-second penalty for improperly passing the goal at the beginning of the ride, failed from a strong representative group of kayakers. On the contrary, Prindiš and Prskavc can rest and concentrate on Sunday's semi-finals.
"I set a goal of driving it first into my 30s, which I did. Not that I didn't care how I turned out, because sunday starts very early in the morning, so I was hoping to be a little higher to have a better starting position," said Prindiš, praising the well-being in Seu. "Before the patrol race, I felt the worst I've felt in the 14 days we've been here. But then it was good in the race and better today. It's beautiful the whole time, nice races, the spectators came, so fine," he said with a laugh.
Even Sparkler was satisfied. "In qualifying, you don't want to make unnecessary mistakes. I didn't really like it in the first goal. Then I drove the middle well, no problem, and I knew I had a drive, so there was a second mistake when I wanted to go straight down and I turned the erka. Overall, I can't be dissatisfied. The form is, we'll see how it goes," said this year's overall World Cup winner.
Both representatives praised the fact that they would not start until the end of the semi-final block on Sunday. 'I'm not an early bird, it's cold in the morning, and when you're here at eight, you want a jacket and a sweatshirt,' said Prindiš. "Overall, it takes an hour and a half to make the semifinals, which is a pretty good difference in terms of sleep," Said Sparkler.
Of the three Czech singkanoisteks, only Fišerová succeeded, Eva Říhová finished two places behind the 20th place, Kateřina Havlíčková was 35. "I went down the top as I imagined, in the middle passage I felt like I was not up to the time and I was not going as planned, but I managed to get into the comfortable track that I wanted to go. I made two nudges, and I'm right behind the winner with a clean time. I have a good starting position for the semi-finals," fišerová said.
Coal will give way to gas and the core. Renewables won't cover increased demand, says ExxonMobil's European boss
Renewables will not be enough for the Czech Republic to meet future energy demand. Due to the unsuitable climate, wind and solar power plants need to be supplemented with other alternatives, such as those using natural gas.
Philippe Ducom, president of the European branch of ExxonMobil, one of the world's largest oil miners, said in an interview with HN. At the same time, it mentions that large repositories in which unused energy from days when the sun and wind are enough could be stored for later are still too expensive.
Ducom visited the ExxonMobil center in Prague, where 1,200 people work and whose task is to support the company's business activities and provide logistics and other services needed for the company's operation.
Declaration of the end of the right in the Chamber or What "right-wing" coalition of ODS, TOP 09, STAN and KDU?
There have been reports in the media and comments recently of the upcoming coalition of these parties. Many applaud that the "right" is finally getting together, but I am asking why these parties still identify as right-wing.
Not to be out of the new Trikolora movement, the Czech Chamber of Deputies no longer has a real right-wing party. And it doesn't matter how the subjects label themselves or what designations are parroted by the mainstream media. The ODS is hardly centrist in its average of the party's top politicians, the TOP 09 is clearly a party of the city's pseudo-liberal left (which is ashamed of its leftistness and thus hypocritically describes itself as conservative or even right-wing). STAN is a party that, by its conception, ideology and voter targeting, is essentially merged with top 09 (the reason for its existence is simply not clear to me). And the KDU has long labeled itself centrist - but their political compass is far more to the left than they say.
Do you feel like I took everyone out of the same water clean? No, I am based on the real political actions of these parties. If I consider myself to be a classically liberal right-wing voter, the highest value for me is individual freedom, the free market and minimal state interference in the lives of individuals and the economy. How do these parties meet this general premise of right-wingness? How many laws that cut people's freedoms with the salami method, tax-raising, confirming new regulations and increasing surveillance, increasing ties to the socialist EU or promoting environmental and gender insanity, have they supported in recent years? A lot, a lot. Not their own stickers, but actions identify them. These parties, despite all sorts of declarations or partial concessions, want to strengthen the role of the state in our lives. And that has nothing to do with right-wingness.
I would not be surprised at the coalition cooperation of TOP 09, STAN and KDU, they simply belong together on the political map, and apart from christian or, on the contrary, homosexual and gender aspects, I do not see a clear difference for voters in terms of the influence of the state on their lives. However, the ODS has long portrayed itself as the "only right-wing" and, by linking it to the three entities, is already openly revealing its true political classification.
By the way, when I briefly mentioned the stickers. Have you noticed how often all these parties quite consistently and cheaply refer to critics of conducting and socialism coming from the European Union as pro-Russian agents? Can't they or just don't want to understand that there are many people who don't like Eurosocialism and growing non-freedom as strongly as the authoritarian regime in Russia? Do they not hide their utter incompetence of argument and gratuitous or blind adoration of euro-EU conditions?
In short, it is possible that in the Czech Republic, a policy other than centrist politics no longer has a chance of greater success. Maybe that's the kind of connection voters really want. Perhaps they want left-center politics under the cloak of the "right", because they are ashamed (or unable to identify) their political beliefs. I don't know. I'm definitely not one of those voters.
Unsolved death of a little girl (†8) in Příbram region: The culprit does not expect punishment
Unexplained cases are called "monuments" in criminal slang. But they are also under investigation if new information emerges years later. Especially when it comes to the death of a child. Criminologist Jiří Markovič was able to investigate the murder of two girls in Prague's Prokop Valley in 1980, which was 12 years old. That's going to be hard, very hard. It would take a start to find the file, it may no longer exist, to talk to those who investigated it. There is always hope, but it would be really hard," says Markovich.
Under the previous regime, the public was not very informed about violent crimes, but according to Markovič, this certainly does not mean that they are investigated laxly. "It's always been up to specific people," says the criminologist. The problem may be that materials from the 1950s can be destroyed, although unfinished cases should not be shredded.
Lucie Bílá's father wasn't a fan of her at all. You're not going to believe what she was supposed to do for a living!
Who does not know that the national treasure Lucie Bílá (53) is the original profession of seamstress and her real name Hana Zaňáková probably does not live in the Czech Republic. But the singer herself has now revealed that she almost worked in a glassworks!
Lucie Bílá knew from a relatively early age that she wanted to be a singer. Her love of singing was born when, as a little girl, she performed in a cultural house in her native Otvovice, where the foam still lives.
"And I remember exactly where my mother was sitting. That's when the singer was born in me," she admitted to Impuls radio.
But her father was a little worried about his daughter's future, recommending that she take the path of a craft that has a golden bottom.
"Dad always said, 'Craft girl, craft. Walk your feet on the ground!' He even talked me into going to the local glassworks. The glassworks isn't working anymore, I kind of do. I am a well-taught seamstress and at home I make various rosaries and pendants out of beads, which I then auction off and buy wheelchairs with money," she added with a laugh.
The launch of the new toll is not at risk, kremlík reports. But there is a change of operator in play
On Friday, the Ministry of Transport started preparations for a new tender for the operation of the new toll system. It is a back-up plan that the State would use if the current toll contract were finally cancelled. In addition, the state is preparing another provisional solution in case the tender is not completed in time. This was stated on Facebook by Transport Minister Vladimír Kremlík (for YES).
On Thursday, the Office for the Protection of Competition (ÚOHS) banned the performance of the toll contract between the State and the CzechToll/SkyToll consortium, with a one-year postponement. The Ministry will appeal.
"The launch of the new toll collection system is not at risk. Starting today, we are starting the preparation of a new transparent procurement procedure, which will include the services of the operation of the new toll system, which is now being completed by the CzechToll and SkyToll consortiums," said the Minister.
The state would thus be looking for the operator of the currently upcoming toll, which will be launched from This December. It would therefore not be a competition for a completely new toll system, as was the case with the last tender, nor would it be a use of the old system now operated by Kapsch.
According to Kremlík, however, the Ministry is also preparing for the fact that it would not be able to prepare the new tender in time. "Based on my experience with the toll tender process to date, I am deeply convinced that the IOC is wrong and that it is not objectively possible to prepare and implement such a complex tender procedure within the specified period of 12 months and to hand over the operation of the toll system to the new operator," he said.
In addition to the new tender procedure, the resort will also prepare a provisional solution that would solve toll collection for a transitional period until the state found a full-fledged form of solution.
Thus, the State is unlikely to take advantage of the offer made to it in recent days by the current toll administrator Kapsch. The Austrian company offered to operate the existing system to the State in case the toll contract was cancelled.
At the same time, the Kremlin reiterated its believe that a backup plan would not be needed. The Ministry will therefore appeal against the antitrust authority's decision.
On Thursday, the Office issued a decision prohibiting the performance of the toll contract. However, the ban will not take effect until a year after the authority's decision is final. This is not final and may be appealed to the President of the Office. The Ministry and CzechToll are therefore continuing to prepare a new toll, which should be launched in December.
Last year's tender for the new toll system and its operator was won by the CzechToll/SkyToll consortium. It succeeded in the toll tender with an offer of CZK 10.75 billion for ten years of operation. The current operator Kapsch protested against the tender and the validity of the toll contract, which failed in the competition with an offer of more than CZK 13 billion.
I still see myself as a boy who's just looking around, says Jan Cina
"It was a big school for everyone who worked on it. I fell in love with afro dancing there. The way I have something Romany in me from my father, I am completely enchanted," said Jan Cina, who considers himself mainly a musical actor.
He has much more fresh memories than the first step for his role as a painter in the new film National Avenue. Cina revealed that director Štěpán Altrichter must have attracted him a lot. "The work was difficult, but the result is worth it. The film was made a year ago. Hard and honest, but fun at the same time. It was filmed on National Avenue, where I drove as a non-steer. A lot was also filmed in the South Town in Prague," he said about the Czech-German co-production film.
Although he is nominated for the Thalia Award for his role in The Little Prince, he does not consider it the pinnacle of his career. "That's not how I feel. I still see myself as a boy who's just looking around. But the nomination is very pleasant and surprising. I can see the peak far ahead of me," he said, not even thinking about the thank-you speech in the event of victory. "Not really, but as a kid, when I was listening to talk shows on the radio, I always imagined talking to people."
Jan Cina has been living with his colleague Petr Vančura for thirteen years. What's his recipe for a happy relationship? "To like each other and to see the problems as a challenge and a good thing to solve," he said, reminiscing about the Czech Lions awards when his friend fell on the stairs.
"Yes, it really did happen. He had new slippery shoes, and the red carpet was slippery, too. So it wasn't long before he was on the ground. He was able to make it a priority. He had a workshop on vančur's stairs, where he taught how to safely fall down the stairs at VIP events."
Děčín Zoo rejoices in a small macaque
"Our group currently has seven members. Its youngest member came into the world on August 17, was born by the female Buffy and is her fifth cub, the father is the male Hitam. In the first days after giving birth, the female carried the cub firmly to her body, and for a long time she did not want to show the world whether she had given birth to a male or a female. At about three weeks of age, however, the cub began to postpone it for a short time, and the zookeepers have known for a few days that it is a male," said alena Houšková, a zoo spokeswoman, noting that the Děčín zoo has successfully breeded 12 cubs of this species.
Macaque cresteds are the so-called endemics of the island of Sulawesi, that is, they do not live elsewhere in the world in the wild. A typical feature is black fur and a ching on the head, according to which they have a name. Macaque cresteds live in rainforests, especially at lower altitudes.
Like most primates, they feed on plant and animal food. The diet is very strongly dominated by the fruits of forest trees, which complement the flowers and leaves. It addresses the need for protein by eating small arthropods, larvae and, to a lesser extent, bird eggs and chicks.
"Aside from the natural enemies of pythons, everything else has been written down by man. Locals hunt macaques as a favorite prey with tasty meat and for fur. Burning and felling the rainforest is also fatal for these animals," the spokeswoman added.
Germany reports the first case of West Nile fever infection from a mosquito on its territory. It has to do with climate change
In addition to West Nile fever, mosquitoes can also transmit malaria, for example.
Germany on Friday reported the first case of a man contracting West Nile fever in German territory after being biting an infected mosquito. This was reported by DPA. Until now, all the sick have contracted the virus while traveling or contacting sick animals. According to experts, the break-even case of infection is related to climate change.
The Robert Koch Institute said a 70-year-old man from Saxony contracted the virus. The disease was severe and he was treated in a hospital in Leipzig for inflammation of the brain. He's healthy now.
West Nile fever virus was first detected in 1937 in Uganda. In the meantime, it spread to large parts of Africa, Asia, and Europe, and to the United States in the 1990s. Its carriers are mainly birds, as well as mosquitoes, which become infected with their infected blood.
Managers of state-owned companies are to now go through the selection procedure. The law will be circumvented, says opposition
"This is a typical bill that is unnecessary," said Zbyněk Stanjura, chairman of the ODS parliamentary group.
After several unsuccessful attempts, the Chamber of Deputies approved changes to prevent opaque division of functions - critics talk about newsagents - in state-owned companies in the future. Candidates should now go through a selection procedure at the ministry and will also be assessed by the government's committee on personnel nominations.
However, this is a compromise solution that the ODS, for example, does not like, because it will supposedly allow ministers to make excuses that selection committees are to be responsible for any poor selection of state managers. Moreover, the opinion of that committee will not be binding on the Minister. The novelty has yet to be approved by the Senate and signed by President Miloš Zeman.
Přerov: Driver crashed near kokory village: Died wedged in his Fabio
The tragic traffic accident occurred on Friday on a flat stretch between Přerov and the village of Kokory. The 28-year-old fabie driver couldn't make the trimmings and drove off the road. The car flipped onto the roof and he was wedged under it. He didn't survive the injuries.
"According to the initial information found at the scene, a passenger car travelling in the direction of Kokory went off the road, where it overturned on the roof and the driver remained wedged under the vehicle," Přerov police spokeswoman Miluše Zajícová told novinky.cz.
And where are the audience? Doha can't be London
At the same time, however, it is a step backwards, as athletics voluntarily and knowingly renounced the thrilling atmosphere that reigned at the sold-out London 2017 stadium and last year's European Championships in Berlin.
Giant banners on the walls of doha skyscrapers invite you to "the biggest sporting event of 2019". However, concerns about how dignified its backdrop will be are growing.
"Tickets for the destination are sold out for all evenings," the organizers say.
But that's too little.
The upper gallery of the Khalifa Stadium with a total capacity of 40,000 spectators is already covered with brightly colored tarpaulins, which also display the flags of the 209 participating countries. Athletics in Qatar has gone to a territory where it has no roots despite the diamond league's annual meeting.
No wonder, then, that last week only 50,000 tickets were sold for 10 days of the Championships, although their price started at 60 Qatari rials, or less than 400 crowns.
The organizers have now set a goal of filling at least half of the exposed parts of the grandstands. That is why, according to sources in the British newspaper Giuardian, they are reportedly (although the organisers themselves deny this) handing out free tickets to migrants who work here as workers, as well as to children. Which Sebastian Coe, head of the IAAF Athletics Association, can also comment positively: "This is how we can inspire future generations."
Wealthy Qatar has won world championships in handball and cycling in the past, with football coming up in 2022 after athletics. The oil superpower's financial offers will always be lucrative for wealthy sports federations. That is the reality of today's sports world.
But even if we accept it and forget the absence of fans in the stadium, we will not be able to resist a purely sporting sigh that the experiment with the first outdoor World Athletics Championships in the Arabian Peninsula should have been better timed by IAAF leaders - and for another year. The extremely late deadline, enforced by the climate, disrupts the whole pattern of the season in the pre-Olympic year and thus the preparation for the key Olympic season, which would normally start for athletes as early as October.
Perhaps Qatar will make up for this with technological innovations, with which it promises ultra-modern and attractive championships. That it's 37 degrees right now? Already the stadium area is artificially air-conditioned to twenty-four. And the advanced cameras, built right in the blocks, are designed to give tv viewers a detailed look at what happens in athletes in the hundredths of a second before and just after the starter's shot.
Sparta is really busy this year, admits Hradec Bek Nedomlel
In his case, the increased motivation is more than understandable. Hradec Hockey defender Richard Nedomlel will play in Friday's game against the club where he recently played. However, the former Spartan is convinced that his teammates will be in a similar position, even though they never wore the Prague club jersey.
"Everyone wants to come out against Sparta," says Hradec Bek before the 5th extra-league match.
Hradec Králové will try to stretch its winning streak, which at the moment consists of three three-point wins in a row. After Kladno, Pilsen came on Sunday the most celebrated fans, Mountfield went to neighboring Pardubice for it.
"But we can't watch the games that were. We need to focus on the matches that await us now and play in them the same way, if not better," says the Hradec defender.
The Hradec Králové team should not even look back on last year's record with Sparta. They lost three of their four matches, taking points only once after winning in Prague after extra time. In addition, Sparta's management brought in some significant reinforcements in the summer and expects the team to return to the top.
"Sparta have always had quality players, but what are we going to talk about this year is really charged," admits Nedomlel before the first game of the week.
And the other one? Also a nice shift, waiting for Mountfield on Sunday afternoon in Trinec.
Bloomberg: Venezuela has bitcoin hidden and doesn't know what to do with them
Venezuela's central bank is conducting internal tests to see if it can hold cryptocurrencies. This is in response to an instruction from the state-owned Petróleos de Venezuela (PDVSA), which seeks to send bitcoins and ethers to the central bank and then to pay the oil firm's suppliers with cryptocurrencies. Employees are also studying the proposal that the central bank could count cryptocurrencies in foreign exchange reserves, which are now close to their 30-year low, Bloomberg reported, citing four sources.
The sanctions imposed by the United States against President Nicolás Maduro's authoritarian regime have largely cut Venezuela off from the global financial system. This has exacerbated the country's economic crisis. At the same time, the current crisis is one of the most serious in the world, forcing officials to use a mixture of different ways of moving money. While Maduro's efforts to launch the world's first state-owned cryptocurrency have failed, continued efforts to use digital currencies show how desperately the government is trying to find ways to circumvent restrictions.
Neither the Central Bank of Venezuela nor PDVSA responded to a request for comment.
It is not clear how PDVSA came to own Bitcoin and ethers, nor how much value it owns these currencies. The company is having trouble obtaining payments from customers through conventional channels because large banks are unwilling to do business with entities subject to sanctions. Last month, the company received most of the $700 million ($16.6 billion) payment in Chinese yuan because the parties were unable to find financial institutions to allow the transaction.
PDVSA may not want to sell cryptocurrencies on the open market, as this would require it to register on the stock exchange and submit to due diligence. Instead, it wants the cryptocurrency to be used by the central bank and paid with it to entities to whom PDVSA owes. Oil firm officials believe that the central bank is less exposed to any obstacles that might arise when paying with cryptocurrencies.
Bitcoin and ethers use a decentralized internet ledger known as blockchain to verify and record transactions. In some cases, relatively anonymous transfers are allowed without the need for an intermediary. Few banks engage in digital currencies because of money laundering problems and client information related to them and complicating compliance.
Cryptocurrencies are returning to prom this year after the 2018 debacle, anticipation of their greater acceptance by institutions and Facebook's plan to come up with its own cryptocurrency. They still remain unstable. Bitcoin has fallen nearly 20 percent in the last four days, but has made a profit of about 130 percent since the beginning of the year.
Neckermann cancels all flights, it affects 500 Czech clients
Neckermann cancels flights in connection with the insolvency of Britain's Thomas Cook and his German daughter.
"The Czech company Thomas Cook, s.r.o., acting under the trade name Neckermann Travel Agency, did not file an insolvency petition," Šrámek said in a press release.
"However, CK Neckermann is obliged to continue to cancel the planned departures of its clients," he added, adding that this currently applies to all departures from 26 September to 6 October.
According to Šrámek, the cancellation of flights will affect about 500 clients. According to him, 800 Of Neckermann's clients who are currently abroad "will be taken care of and their safe return to the Czech Republic by their planned flight will be ensured".
The travel agency admitted that some clients had been asked to pay for their stay. "In this case, clients must immediately contact the SOS line of CK Neckermann," Šrámek added.
Thomas Cook's collapse occurred on Monday. In August this year, the travel agency struck a deal to inject £900 million into the firm.
She was to receive half of the sum from the Chinese company Fosun Tourism. On this basis, it was to become the majority owner. The other half was to be provided by bondholders and creditor banks. However, on 20 September, it was claimed that creditors had asked the travel agency to obtain a £200 million reserve, otherwise the deal would fall. On Monday, the company announced that it had gone bankrupt.
Someone killed a non-conflicting homeless woman under the bridge. Police are looking for witnesses
According to the Prague police, the murder took place sometime in the evening to the night from Tuesday to Wednesday. It is at this time that the police call for possible testimony relates.
"One of the drivers who was passing on the bridge connecting Libeň and Žižkov or along Pod Krejcárkem street could have filmed the killer on the dash cam, for example. Maybe some witness could just see him and describe him. In short, we will welcome any testimony on this case and accept it on line 158," said Jan Daněk, spokesman for the regional police directorate.
According to spokesman Danek, the murdered homeless woman was non-conflicting, did not drink alcohol and did not seek the company of other people. The woman lived at the scene. "Most often she was around Krejcárek, Palmovka and Holešovice, when she was carrying large blue shopping bags," Danak added a description of the victim, which could also help potential witnesses.
Slovaks succeed, only pay a fine for racist insults
The Slovak Football Association succeeded in appealing against the closure of the stadium for fan racism. The national team was originally supposed to play a European Championship qualifier against Wales without spectators, instead the union will now only pay a fine of €15,000 (about 387,000 crowns).
The UEFA Disciplinary Committee punished Slovakia and Hungary for the behaviour of fans in the recent qualifying match in Budapest, which was won 2–1 by the visiting team of Czech coach Pavel Hapal. It closed the stadium for one match and fined Slovakia €20,000 and Hungary €67,000.
Slovaks were fined only €15,000 for offensive political shouting after the appeal. The next match of the national team in the European Championship qualifier against Wales on 10 October in Trnava will thus be made available to fans.
Basketball players did not reach the medal from the Under-17 World Championships, finishing fourth
The Third World 17 was won by the Americans, who defeated Spain 77-75 in the final despite 40 points from Spaniard Angela Salvadores.
"We really wanted to win and not be potato, but maybe we wanted it too much. We got off to a good start, but we couldn't hold it because they overcam us under the basket," regretted captain Karolína Malečková. "But playing in front of such an audience was an incredible experience," she praised fans in Klatovy and Pilsen.
The Czechs started very well, taking an 8-0 lead thanks to two 3s and dominating the field throughout the first quarter. At that point, it seemed that they would resurret their opponents' 85-88 group defeat after overtime. But the referees whistled 15 fouls at half-time and helped Hungary get back into the game with a 12-2 lead.
"I'm convinced it was enough to score two or three more baskets, run away to 20 points, and we wouldn't let it go. But instead, our mistakes came. I'm not interested in referees, I'm interested in what we did wrong, and there were mistakes that helped the opponent catch on," coach Richard Fousek said.
"It wasn't the first time we'd had a lapses in concentration. But the girls are warriors, they didn't release anything and fought to the end. But the opponent was of high quality," he added.
The Czechs kept Petra Holešínská in the game mainly with accurate shooting from a distance and pivot Tereza Šípová. However, the best Czech scorer had a problem with fouls and was absent from the field for much of the third quarter. The Hungarians took advantage and gained a slight lead, which they held, even though the Czechs fought until the last seconds.
"The first five games were very difficult for us, we turned the matches in a tight rotation and it cost us a lot of effort. Even against Spain, you could see that the girls were tired and there was no place to take them. Because of our physicality, we weren't consistent on defense. We didn't play a fast counterattack, we missed the rebound. And Hungarians are of such high quality that if you don't put everything together, it's hard to win," fousek added.
He believes his ward has a promising future ahead of her. "In two years, the girls have been able to win the Youth Olympics, be second in the European Championships of 16-year-olds, and now they are fourth in the world. By our standards, it is a quality team with good character and needs to continue to work with it and develop talent. Now it's up to the federation to assign them a coach in the higher categories," Fousek added.
The end of political newsstands? According to critics, the new law won't help anyway!
But, according to some opposition MPs, the law is more likely to make ministers get rid of their election responsibilities while still choosing their candidates.
Greater transparency in tenders for positions in state-owned companies - this is one of the objectives of the Nomination Act. 119 Members voted in favour. The law passed, for example, thanks to the votes of YES, ksčm, social democrats and even Pirates.
Candidates for state-owned firms will have to go through a selection process before a government committee. For example, it was the Pirates who sought to make the recommendation binding on the Minister. That didn't work out in the end.
The Civic Democrats and the SPD are worried that the nomination law will be passed by ministers. "Now the minister will be able to hide behind some decision of the commission and will therefore not have a clear transparent responsibility," says SPD Chairman Tomio Okamura. Martin Kupka, vice-chairman of the ODS, speaks similarly.
A government committee should reject candidates who do not meet the conditions altogether. These will include criminal integrity, debt-free, a minimum age of 25, and expertise should be the main selection criterion.
The bill will still have to pass the Senate, and then the president will get it for signature.
Tough competition for Skoda Kamiq. Kia XCeed bets on rich equipment, at what cost?
The Kia XCeed is a relatively difficult model to classify. It is clearly a compact SUV, but it does not offer all-wheel drive. This item leaves this item to the larger Sportage sibling, which is such a direct answer to cars such as the Škoda Karoq, Opel Grandland X or Volkswagen Tiguan. In comparison, the XCeed also bets on more dynamic body shapes, which, by sloping the back, can remotely remind the world of the SUV-coupe, popular in this part of the market especially among premium brands Audi, BMW or Mercedes-Benz.
On the other hand, XCeed can't be classified just alongside plastered versions of classic compacts, such as the Ford Focus Active. Compared to him, koreans have made a much larger number of changes to the bodywork, so if you don't want to, Ceed may not even see the news in the shapes.
Unlike the compact Ceed hatchback or station wagon, the XCeed also offers only supercharged engines, so don't expect a basic atmospheric 1400. XCeed starts with a supercharged litre and also offers a supercharged 150 kW 160 kW version reserved for siblings of the GT version. Don't expect a sporting level here. Turbodiesely 1.6 CRDi is only offered in mild-hybrid versions, that is, the combustion engine is assisted by an electrical system that helps with reducing consumption and emissions. From 100 kW it is also possible to pay extra for a seven-speed dual-coupled automatic in addition to the manual.
Soon, the offer will be grow with a plug-in hybrid, a variant that travels about six tens of kilometers on electricity only. Batteries can then be charged even from a normal socket.
Simona Krainová: Fuck the Age! Then she kissed Lucia White!
The day before the launch of fuck the age calendar, Simona Krainová posted her last photos of herself completely naked! "I was a little worried that people would judge me for taking pictures naked at my age. I'm a pretty shy person. But so far, I've only had positive reactions. I wanted to show women that when they want to, you can have a solid figure at 46. Of course, there's hard work and resentation behind it, but there's no other way."
"Lukáš Dvořák and I took about three thousand photos, selected about a hundred and there are twelve on the calendar, so the rest is still waiting for their moment. It's definitely not the last time I'm naked," the model, who also came up with a very revealing baptism, told The Flash.
She was wearing an elongated Bernhardt jacket and shorts underneath, but they weren't visible, so it looked like she'd forgotten her bottom. Her daily running has strengthened her legs, so she can afford similar models.
Simone was so happy with her success that she kissed everyone she met at the christening. Husband, friends, even Lucia White's desk.
The auto-lady brought the voice of the digital soul
Everything you know about obesity is wrong, proclaims the headline of a long text written for the Huffington Post by Michael Hobbes and photographed by Finlay Mackay. The provocative explanation then states that for decades the medical community ignored the facts about obesity and waged a ruthless (and also unnecessary) war against overweight people that not only affected public opinion, but also destroyed many lives. But now is the time for a new paradigm.
What Hobbes puts into practice right from the start is the fact that there is often a very long and tedious journey from knowledge and knowledge of facts to putting into practice. It mentions the case of scurduettes, when some captains were already handing out lemons, limes and oranges to their men in the seventeenth century, in the belief that this would prevent illness. However, the British Navy withdrew from the practice due to fears of increased costs. The clear effect of fruit in the prevention and treatment of the disease was then demonstrated in the mid-18th century, but it took another fifty years for the Navy to take this into account. Seatbelts existed long before the invention of the car, but they did not become mandatory until the 1960s, as well as the first confirmed asbestos-related deaths date back to 1906, yet its first ban came in 1973.
"Every public health discovery - no matter how significant it was - has always had to compete with traditions, prejudices, and financial incentives within the society into which it was to be implemented," Hobbes writes. In American society, nearly 80 percent of the adult population and about one-third of children now meet the definition of overweight or obesity. More Americans now live with obesity than with breast cancer, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and HIV combined.
Obesity is seen as a supremely personal failure of an individual who is said to burden health care and reduce GDP. The fear of fat is so great in the population that Americans now spend more money on diets than they spend on computer games and movies. But the truth is, diets don't work. As early as 1959, research showed that 95 to 98% of attempts to lose weight end in failure, and two-thirds of people on a diet subsequently gain more weight than they have lost.
Armed with hobbes statistics, he goes on to describe the lifestyle and traumas of overweight people. Personal encounters systemic, for example, at faculties when teaching future doctors, he devotes only 19 hours of his entire studies to the issue of nutrition. Which, at a time when the 60 calories americans are receiving comes from ultra-processed food - that is, over-processed food.
How obesity is stigmatized is illustrated by reports from surgeries, where overweight people typically experience shorter check-ups, doctors treat them with less empathy and consider them more problematic patients.
But being overweight is far from just an American problem, as Hobbes writes, since 1980, obesity rates in 73 countries around the world have doubled and increased in 113. And in that time, no country has managed to reduce and stop this increase. Absolutely none.
Brno Grand Prix? Tickets are at risk of price increases
The most expensive item is the list fee each year before the Grand Prix. This year it was about one hundred and fifteen million crowns. "The mass of people who come to Brno at the Grand Prix will spend money on accommodation, food or entertainment there, which should more or less balance the costs associated with organizing the event, including the list fee," said economist Petr Pelc.
According to him, the importance of the race is also in attracting tourists to the city. "Brno does not have so many world tourist attractions. The Grand Prix attracts visitors from abroad. It is as important for Brno as, for example, turan airport or exhibition grounds. And these are projects that are supported with public money," the economist added.
Brno Grand Prix
- costs for the past five years: CZK 686 million
- profits from the previous five years: CZK 682 million
- problem: lack of money to organise, increasing list fee for dorna promoter
- possible solutions: more money from the state, use of advertising space, increase in ticket prices
- state of affairs: negotiations on a new contract for the organisation of races for the next five years
According to the director of the Institute of Public Administration Filip Hrůza, the organizers must now evaluate whether the race is advantageous for Brno. "The Grand Prix sucks money out of public budgets for other matters. But to some extent, it is a political issue, not an economic one," he thinks.
In the future, the cost of a motoring event may be even higher. In the game, the option of increasing the list fee is almost double.
"The situation is not closed, we must try to negotiate the best possible terms with Dorna. It also depends on the extent to which the state is ready to contribute to the organization of the race. If the worst-case scenarios come true, I fear that it is not realistic for the city and the region to pay the amount," admitted Brno Mayor Markéta Vaňková.
As the Daily Equality reported, representatives of the South Moravian Region and Brno are also discussing the possibility of using advertising due to difficulties in raising money for the Grand Prix. "Dorna's condition is that advertising must be placed in places that are not occupied by cameras. The choice of companies is also limited, because if Dorna has a general sponsor, then the second sponsor cannot be a company from the same area," explained Vaňková.
In the coming years, organizers can also get more money from tickets. "We have to sit down and say what the costs are going to be. And we have to adapt the revaluation of tickets to this," said Brno opposition representative for ano movement and former mayor Petr Vokřál.
D5 accident: Motorway closed by truck collision
The event was reported around 08:00 on the 22nd kilometer in the direction of Prague. "The highway is closed, at least for freight traffic. Cars can go through a gas station," police spokeswoman Michaela Richter said this morning. Traffic was restored around 2:30 p.m. According to Richter, the preliminary damage is at least two million crowns, the cause of the accident is being investigated by the police.
Petr Svoboda, a spokesman for the Central Bohemian Fire Brigade, said that one truck was transporting passenger cars and the other was carrying plastic granulate. "Due to the large impact, the vehicles being transported were shifted, which firefighters first had to secure against possible falls," he added.
One of the cars had a damaged fuel tank, from which about 200 liters of diesel leaked. Another 200 liters were drained by firefighters. Workers of the Environment Department of beroun town hall were called to the accident due to a fuel leak. The rescue of crashed vehicles and the clearing of the highway were provided by a private company, which also extracted contaminated soil.
Failed qualification. Czech athletes are not doing well in Doha yet
The World Championships in Doha began with qualification failures for Czech athletics. Diana Mezuliáková fell in the 800 meters heats and the qualifiers did not pass the pole romana maláčová or hammersmith Kateřina Šafránková, who defended the eighth place, which surprised her in London two years ago.
The hurdler Vít Müller will also run on Friday and Marcela Joglová will run the night marathon race.
Saffron threw her third attempt at 65.46 meters and fell almost six meters behind her maximum this year, which she would have to improve to advance. Maláčová jumped 435 cm, 450 cm was already beyond her strength. To participate in the finals, the limit of 460 cm had to be overcome.
Mezuliáníková, who reached the championship at the last minute thanks to an invitation from the IAAF International Federation, finished in fourth place in the penultimate sixth place, and even a time of 2:03.48 minutes was not enough for her to advance to the semifinals. She was one and a half seconds behind her peak this year. "It was pretty quick on me, unfortunately I was fighting my opponent on the corner, which kind of took my strength off. I felt like I still had the strength, but that's where it slowed me down. I almost stopped and had to run again, so this was a little uncomfortable. I can't be completely satisfied," said the Czech representative.
She was happy to beat at least one opponent at the finish line. "She really wasn't well, so every defeated opponent was good. But I think it was for the fifth place. Unfortunately," she added. Winnie Nanyond of Uganda was the fastest half-back in 2:00.36.
Doha lacks the best 800-year-old Caster Semenya from South Africa, who has too high testosterone levels in her body, but, like some other runners, refuses the treatment that IAAF rules have been ordering since this year.
In the 100 meters, American Christian Coleman confirmed the role of number one favorite, with a time of 9.98 seconds. His compatriot Justin Gatlin, who is seeking the title at the age of 37, also advanced to the semifinals. Nigerian Divine Oduduru, who is 9.86 second in this year's charts, was not expected to start and was expected to face Coleman, who has a 9.81 this season.
Juan Miguel Echevarría, a Cuban who made his first jump to 840 cm, showed great form in the long-distance qualifier. No athlete has jumped that far in world championships in the last 20 years.
French Oscar nominee Wretches launches Be2Can show
The Golden Bear and both winners of this year's Berlinale Acting Awards, the Cannes Directing and Jury Award and much more will present the 6th annual festival film from Berlin, Venice and Cannes. This year, the Be2Can festival will also bring a selection of the most remarkable and insundious, presented by the competitions of the three most important European film festivals.
The opening film of this year's show will be the French drama Misérables, for which the film's creator Ladj Ly won the Jury Prize at this year's Cannes Film Festival. The film is a French Oscar nominee. The preview of the film in Prague will be personally performed by representatives of the two main roles of the police officers of the criminal unit, actors Alexis Manenti and Djibril Zonga. Alexis Manenti is also the co-writer of the film's screenplay.
This year, Be2Can will take place in Prague's Lucerna and Edison Filmhub cinemas, as well as in Brno (Art Cinema), Ostrava (Minikino) and Zlín (Golden Apple Cinema) from 2 to 8 October.
Director Ladj Ly's directorial feature debut was released and acclaimed at a number of other world festivals after his success at Cannes. Durban won the Best Picture and Best Screenplay Award at the IFF, was also presented at the Zurich, Shanghai, Munich, Melbourne, Sarajevo IFF and will soon be presented in San Sebastian.
As part of the festival, however, viewers can also look forward to the films Synonyms, Young Ahmed, System Intruder, Goodbye, My Son, Sorry, We couldn't reach you, The Anthology of the Ghost Town and the film At the Golden Glove. But they can also look forward to other fresh news from this year's Venice, which will head to the Czech distribution: the sci-fi Ad Astra, joker, the Czech triumph of Painted Bird.
Which cities disappear under the sea?
A vote by canada's upper house of parliament confirmed a well-known rumor for days: Canada is revoking honorary citizenship from former Nobel Peace Prize-winning legend Do Aung San Suu Kyi. The current leader of Myanmar (Burma), who spent years under house arrest for trying to bring freedom to her country, has lost her honorary degree for her part in the genocide against the minority Rohingya nation.
The decision to take Suu Kyi's honorary citizenship was approved by the lower legislature a week ago, and senators have now unanimously supported it. "This is the right message for her, for Myanmar and for the world," said independent Senator Ratna Omidvar, commenting on the decision of her colleagues. "We must make it clear that genocide accomplices here in Canada are not welcome - all the more so as honest citizens."
The canadian parliament's verdict does not technically change anything for Suu Kyi, it is just an honorary degree, but on a symbolic level, it is a strong message for her. The silence of a longtime human rights activist on atrocities committed by myanmar's majority-Buddhist army for months on the Rohingya Muslim minority is intolerable.
The fact that there is an officially organised genocide in Myanmar and that Suu Kyi - the de facto prime minister of the country's government - has completely failed in her duty to protect her citizens was recently brought about by a UN report. Specifically, it mentions the names of several army commanders who, according to the investigation team, should stand trial for crimes against humanity committed in actions that - as the report says - "shock both the terribleness of their actions and the vast scale." According to the UN, Suu Kyi and her led administration were complicity mainly by covering up the soldiers' actions and letting out a fog of lies around them - for example, that it was a "counterterrorism operation."
After Suu Kyi was removed, five personalities remain on Canada's list of honorary citizens: Swedish diplomat Raoul Wallenberg, Nelson Mandela, Tändzin Gjamccho, 14th Dalai Lama, Karim Aga Khan IV, 49th Imam of Shi'ite Muslims and Malala Yusufzai.
The development around the former icon of the struggle for freedom and democracy was reflected in the Canadian Museum of Human Rights, where Suu Kyi's profile added information about atrocities against the Rohingya and the parliamentary decision to take her title of honorary citizen. "We have also muted the illumination of her photo on a tableau depicting the time-out of the fight for human rights, and we are thinking of replacing her face with a portrait of a rohingya minority member," Canadian media quoted museum spokesman Rorie McLeod as saying.
The only thing that will remain so in the current upheavals of Suu Kyi - at least for now - is the Nobel Peace Prize, awarded to her at the suggestion of Václav Havel in 1991 for his huge contribution to the fight for democracy. "While Ms. Suu Kyi's current actions are regrettable, her award will not be annulled," Lars Heikensten, head of the Nobel Foundation, told CBS Canada.
Microplastics have reached human intestines, a study has confirmed for the first time
Scientists have been confirmed for several years. A team led by University of Vienna professor Philippe Schwabl has published a study that for the first time demonstrates the presence of microplastics in human stools. Although the study is small, with eight participants from Europe, Japan and Russia - however, small particles of plastic measuring between 50 and 500 micrometers were found in the samples of all the people under study. None of the eight subjects were vegetarians, six of whom avoided sea fish, all drinking water from plastic bottles and food packed in plastic.
And it would actually be a bit of a miracle if nothing was found. We already know that microplastics - which are produced either directly, for example for the needs of the cosmetics industry, or are formed by the breakdown of larger pieces - are present in marine animals, insects, tap water and lemonades; everywhere on the planet. Their entry into the digestive tract of a person has therefore only been officially confirmed. About 20 microplastic particles accounted for about 10 grams of stool, and scientists estimate that more than half of the world's population will have them in them.
Of course, lay and scientific awareness knows that this is not good. However, humanity still does not know how bad it is - and what effect microplastics have on "host" organisms. Small particles can reach the bloodstream or lymphatic system and end up in the liver, for example. "It's the first study of its kind and confirmed what we've been thinking for a long time. Now that we have the first evidence of microplastics in the human body, we need to continue to investigate what exactly this means for human health," says Schwabl.
So far, it is known that microplastics in the intestines can negatively affect the immune responses of the digestive system, the thus facilitating the absorption of poisonous chemicals and other pathogens into the body. And so far, there is no known solution other than to limit the use of plastics, especially polypropylene. But this will be difficult - the first task facing governments and authorities will at least be to stop its steep rise. As for plastic bottles, experts estimate that in three years, humanity will consume a fifth more of them than they do today. The current pace is a riveting million bottles bought per minute. Every year, roughly eight million tons of plastic end up in the seas and oceans. Waste threatens marine ecosystems and infests marine animal digestive systems.
Some states have already taken restrictions and other measures, kenya, for example - under the threat of draconian punishments - has banned plastic bags. The European Commission is considering small bans (well-known straws), with the domestic Ministry of the Environment heading in the same direction. But critics say that while such measures are nice, they are completely inadequate.
Harry in Princess Diana's footsteps (†36)! Where's Meghan?
Diana was special in that she could grab people's hearts. In January 1997, she caused an uproar when she visited Africa, and especially the minefield. The images of him wearing a protective suit and shield on his face have become iconic. And even then, no one could have known that a few months later the princess of human hearts would ex out for the last time in a tragic car accident in Paris.
Now her younger son Harry has also scored points, going to the same place as her after 22 years. He went to a mine removal post in Diric, Angola, and also put on a special protective suit, looking very thoughtful. Surely he couldn't help remembering his beloved mother, whom he lost when he was just 13 years old.
Harry gave a speech on the spot praising the efforts of the Halo Trust, which is working to defuse minefields and other explosives in war-war countries. "Minefields are the unharmed wounds of war. By cleaning them up, we can help the community find peace, with which opportunities come," he said, also appealing to the conservation and conservation of wildlife and the local river as a source of water. After this visit, the Duke of Sussex moved to Huamba to rename the local orthopedic centre after his famous mother, Princess Diana.
He didn't forget to mention it on his official Instagram account: "The Duke is honoured to visit a place and community that was so important to his mother, to get to know their tireless mission and to speak to all those she (Diana) felt they needed most to be heard, even though the problem wasn't exactly popular worldwide," the Sussex Royal's Instagram post read.
But royal fans may be sorry that he didn't take his wife Meghan (38) and their son Archie (4 months) on such a quest to remember Diana. They've both had a separate program with Harry since Wednesday, presuming apparently to protect them. After all, taking a little baby to a minefield doesn't sound very safe, and Harry doesn't want to put his beloved family in jeopardy at any cost.
Only child. We don't have a reproduction, but we don't have to scare
Some words have ominous connotations, even if they only communicate the state of affairs. They include the word "only child." It refers to a child growing up without siblings, but it doesn't sound neutral. "You know, an only child," they say, without much to add. Interestingly, this trait has long been carried by the "only child", back in the days when terms such as demographic crisis were not widely used.
Today, even people outside the scientific community know that a fertility rate of 2.1 children per woman is required to ensure simple reproduction of the population. It is also widely known that no state in Europe today achieves this value. France or Sweden are close to it at most, but european states do not have a simple measure of population reproduction. (Within the West, only Israel stands out, with a total fertility rate of 3.1 children per woman.) It's a situation made for alarmism. Therefore, it is no wonder that the Minister of Labour and Social Affairs Maláčová is also failing him: "There are almost as many only children as two children's families," she said in an interview with LN. But she neglected the devil hidden in detail.
Yes, it is good to draw attention to the problem, instead of downplaying or ideologizing. Like in Germany, where a multi-child campaign easily gets the label of fascism (in the style of "that's how Hitler supported it"). It's a good thing to be reminded that many couples plan only their only children directly. It is good that politicians show a willingness to remove the obstacles that lead to such decisions (for example, a weak expansion of work from home discourages women from further pregnancies). But through it all, let's point out one thing.
If Minister Maláčová says that "there are almost as many onlys", there is a shh of demagoguery. That statement was appropriate 20 years ago. Let us remember that fertility in the Czech Republic last ensured simple reproduction in 1980 ("Husák's children"). Then it fell to a frightening 1.14 in 2000. But since then, it has risen by almost fifty percent, to the current 1.70 children per woman, which is Europe's above average. This is not enough for simple reproduction, so the activity of politicians is appropriate. Only with the alarmism can they take it down a notch.
Costa Rica is a champion in the fight against climate change
Costa Rica received the title for several reasons. For starters, the plan to be carbon neutral by 2050 - but many countries have committed to this under the Paris Agreement. A Central American state with a population of about five million produces only 0.4 percent of the world's emissions. Costa Rica has also pledged to fully switch to renewable energy by 2030, with 70 percent of buses or taxis running on electricity.
The official tourism organization says that about 95 percent of energy already comes from renewable sources - in 2017, Costa Rica operated on them for a total of 300 days.
Costa Rica boasts nearly 30 national parks.
Afforestation density also contributes to reducing emissions. Rainforests with diverse fauna and flora, covering more than half of the country's territory, are also one of the main tourist draws. "Costa Rica is a pioneer in the field of nature conservation and gives an example to other countries in the region, but also around the world. Climate change requires urgent action from all of us," the UN said in a statement.
Costa Rica boasts nearly 30 national parks, which is a lot, given the country's small area (51,100 square kilometers). Rain or mist forests, coral reefs or mangrove swamps are home to five percent of the world's biodiversity. The country also has volcanoes, picturesque waterfalls, and there are also several lifelines for sloths.
Gentle on the planet. The Night of Scientists begins in Prague
"In Prague, I would definitely visit CTU and look at the model of what smart cities will look like. At Charles University, I would visit the Institute of Anatomy at the Faculty of Medicine, to which there is no public access at other times," advises Jitřenka Navrátilová, National Coordinator of the Night of Scientists.
The Department of Anatomy offers a tour of the autopsy room and the opportunity to try working with surgical instruments.
"Then I would go to ČZU and watch the film Green Desert," adds Navrátilová. Nine laboratories will also offer guided tours. The motto of this year's Night of Scientists is "planet-friendly."
Attorney General reinstates prosecution of mother who manipulated daughter against father
Attorney General Pavel Zeman disagrees with the acquittal of a mother who manipulated her daughter for a long time and disrupted her relationship with her father. She faced charges of abuse and endangering her upbringing. The regional court acquitted her, Zeman disagrees. A similar act can be seen as a criminal offence, according to his appeal to the Supreme Court.
The Supreme Court's decision could have a broader impact on other cases. "A more specific definition of such a specific form of abuse can also be considered necessary in terms of directing further application practice," zeman's appeal reads.
Last year, the District Court in Svitavy first found the woman guilty of abusing the entrusted person and endangering the upbringing of a child. She formed a strong, even symbiotic bond with her daughter, even in a situation where she was to be entrusted to her father.
The result was a pathological fixation on the mother and a markedly negative relationship with the father. The situation marked the emotional development of the daughter, who was even hospitalized. She threatened to self-harm if she was taken into her father's care.
The Svitava court sentenced the mother to two years in prison with a two-year suspended sentence. However, the Pardubice branch of the regional court acquitted the woman on appeal, saying it was not a crime. The same verdict was repeated by the regional court after the Supreme Court had already ordered it to decide again.
The Regional Court found that situations where one parent manipulates a child against another are not exceptional. It is dealt with in the care proceedings, possibly with the help of psychologists or youth social protection bodies. Rarely is criminal law the solution.
According to the Attorney General, however, the woman committed both abuse and threats to her upbringing. "The accused acted entirely in a targeted way, arousing negative feelings towards her father in her daughter, and purposefully affirming these negative emotions. By doing so, she not only pursued an illegal intention to restrict or exclude the father's contact with a minor, but she had to be aware that this would cause negative consequences in the psychosocial sphere of the minor," the appeal states.
Zeman asked the Supreme Court to take the case back to the regional court one more time. The appeal implies that the child is now in the care of the father.
Step back, he called on Schiller for words about the opposition scum of Czernin
"I find it completely unacceptable that a member of the Czech Government anywhere, much less in parliament, should use such totalitarian expressions," Czernin wrote in an open letter to Schiller.
Her words caused a stir when she discussed the draft constitutional action against President Miloš Zeman. The opposition did not get enough votes, and the draft constitutional action brought by the Senate was thrown off the table by MPs.
"I get dozens of messages from people I don't know. There's not a single vote in support of this lawsuit. There are messages in support of the president and messages like taxpayers' money being spent here, empty straw being beaten around. And I even dare not use harsh language, quote one of them: It's oppositional and senatorial scum," the Finance Minister said.
"With these terms, the Nazis often used to use jewish citizens and communists used to use their political opponents. It is totalitarian rhetoric, with no respect for man and opinion," wrote Top 09 Vice-President Czernin, who will compete for the post of party chairman with the current first vice-president, Markéta Pekarová Adamová, in the autumn.
"I quoted one of the many reports that I received during the House of Commons negotiations. Their common denominator was disgust at the constant personal dehonest that we see on a daily basis in domestic politics, which was also the main motive for Thursday's Chamber of Deputies meeting. I am surprised that someone refers to themselves," Schiller told ČTK.
Destroyed shops, street fires, memorial procession accompanied by riots
Five years ago, 43 students at Ayotzinapa College disappeared, but despite extensive investigations, the case has not yet been cleared. The students were reportedly to have been detained by police in the Mexican state of Guerrero. It is unclear exactly what happened next, but according to the investigation, the students apparently ended up in the hands of a local syndicate and were subsequently killed and burned, APTN reports.
A memorial service was held in mexico's capital on Thursday, with families expressing frustration that they still have no answers and explaining their children's disappearance.
But the largely peaceful march was disrupted by smaller groups of vandals destroying everything in their path. Vandals destroyed shops and hotels, did not slithing or destroying monuments, set fires around the city and drained windows.
Even before the march, President Andres Manuel López Obrador said he would do everything he could to catch him and asked the public for any information that would lead to clarification of the case.
More than 142 people were detained as part of the investigation, but none of them were convicted. Many had to be released because their human rights were violated, investigators allegedly should have to torture the suspects, APTN adds.
Mahulena Bočanová has interrupted a year's detox and is sining again!
More than a year ago, Mahulena Bočanová confided in Lightning that she had given up alcohol. "During the holidays, I thought I'd give my old, run-down 50-year-old body a breath. I've given my deadline forever. I feel so rested, I have a lot of energy and most importantly my psyche has improved. I haven't been well mentally lately. I get up better, I don't have a headache, I have more energy, more money."
A year's abstinence was enough, and the actress found her way back to alcohol. "Sometimes I have bubbles or quality wine, but I don't drink what I used to. I'm going to have one drink and have fun till morning. I've had a bottle of wine in the fridge for a week. I also enjoyed non-alcoholic beer, which I can drink at any time," boasted Mahulena, who still forms a couple with Brno businessman Petr.
Bočanová also returned to the theatre season after the holidays and will now join the series The Office in the Rose Garden. "I'm ashamed of the first two performances, I was really bad, I said it. But it's getting better," smiles the actress critically.
Jaromír Soukup spoke about Gott: He wishes him peace
Moderator and entrepreneur Jaromír Soukup (50) will not be afraid of any questions. On his show Call and Write to the Boss, he speaks publicly on various topics. And he's no stranger to tabloid causes, which he draws in a sparkly and witty way. Although this time he wasn't laughing.
Jaromír Soukup commented on the sad news, which is a very serious illness of Karel Gott. He promised the singer one very considerate thing for himself.
"You know, Karel got sick and said it fairly without tabloid journalists poking around. I don't want to comment on it, it's a serious illness, we all have great respect for Karel Gott. And I would like him, of course, successful treatment and, above all, peace of mind! The peace he needs now," said barrandov, the tv owner.
"I wish the media would leave him alone. And she's been waiting for the news that the Master himself decides to give to the media. I don't like the different expressions his old friends and celebrities think about his health. And on the part of our media, I can say that we will only deal with his illness and his person if he shows himself an interest. I think other media should consider a similar approach."
Young Czechs think they can do it with money. The survey didn't confirm it.
"It turns out, therefore, that young Czechs have somewhat more confidence in their knowledge of finances than reality. In this case, women and respondents without a high school diploma had a significantly higher proportion of bad answers," said Jaroslava Palendalová, Director of kruk.
Men and young high school students or undergraduate students are more likely to believe in their knowledge of financial products.
Young Czechs learn the most about the functioning of financial affairs from their parents (37 percent), self-study on the Internet (23 percent) and only in the third row from teaching at school (21 percent).
Women, in particular, consult parents about finances, while men are more likely to seek information online. Obtaining information about finances from parents prevails in all age categories of young people, regardless of their educational attainment or personal income. Prospectuses of financial institutions, professional journals and publications have virtually minimal influence.
"Once again, it shows the importance of raising children by their parents, who represent authority in all the main areas of life. Therefore, the level of financial literacy of parents who transfer their knowledge and experience to their offspring is crucial," palendal said.
Savings and investments are preferred by 94 percent of young people.
Clearly, young people are concerned about whether it is better to save and buy, for example, their own house or apartment, or to enjoy and spend money rather, without savings and their own housing.
94 percent of those surveyed have a strategy of saving and investing in tangible fixed assets. This applies across all age categories of young people, regardless of educational attainment, social status or current personal income.
The survey strategy is 100% held by people married with two or more children and public sector employees. On the contrary, people living alone and with an income of more than CZK 30,000 per month want to enjoy themselves.
Hunter injured in fall from his seat, carried to ambulance for three hours
The unfortunate accident occurred before 8:30 p.m. in the top parts of Čertova mlýn.
"It was a very difficult and inaccessible terrain, so we went to the injured man with five of our rescuers with the proper technique. At the same time, we requested cooperation from the Moravian-Silesian Region Health Rescue Service. The paramedics then dispatched an ambulance to the accident," libor Kluz, dispatcher of the Beskydy Mountain Service, described the circumstances of the intervention.
Rescuers found the hunters in a designated location with multiple injuries. They treated him immediately and then transported him gently but with difficulty on the so-called Austrian cart through imm edible terrain.
"Transport on a route of about one and a half kilometers was slow and difficult. The injured nimrod was therefore handed over to the ambulance crew after approximately three hours," added Libor Kluz.
Fortunately, according to Radan Yaškovsky, the authorized chief of the Beskydy Mountain Service and also an intervening rescuer, a fellow hunter was able to describe in detail where the injured man was.
"We found it relatively quickly. However, if he had the Ambulance app on his phone, our rescuers would have been with him sooner and at the same time the dispatcher of line 155 would have known about the accident and its situation immediately," commented Radan Yaškovský.
He added that a charged mobile phone with the Ambulance app activated should be a matter of course in the mountains today.
Zeman the ConservationIst - The Man Straining the Constitution Calls for Law Enforcement
Those who move in a divided society in the camp and do not want to go completely crazy will welcome situations when they do not have to root only for their own. When he can give pluses to someone he's criticizing otherwise. If only to make him feel that he was oriented only by pre-allocated stickers. Such situations include a list of severely damaged monuments that President Zeman fencing on his favorite trips to the regions.
Everybody knows what's going on. And those who occasionally wander through the Czech Republic see many of these devastated monuments - from the centers of historic cities to individual castles, monasteries, old houses, churches or farms - with their own eyes. Everyone knows that even here can come to the word demagoguery. That if we're criticizing city hall for monuments or some horror in the zoning plan, it could be the work of former administrations. Or an object privatized, the owner of which is not traceable. The head of state of local politics calls for: "The section of the Heritage Act allows you to fine owners of buildings who do not care about their property." But even if the owner is unassumable, it must be acknowledged that the president is calling for law enforcement. Which even critics of his bending of the Constitution should recognize as a plus.
Of course, Miloš Zeman would not be Miloš Zeman if he considered all the details and formalities of a complex problem. But he stands up for a good cause, like squatters he doesn't recognize. Two years ago, we wrote, "Despite all the swearing, squatters draw attention to a problem outside the current interest. For the fact that one or another building is in a state of disrepair." And let's face it, the president is doing the de facto same thing.
When you arrive at the historic center of Jáchymov, you will be a marvel at how devastated it is - including houses with Renaissance cores. At a time when Jáchymov is celebrating 500 years of silver mining and tolar stamping (for Americans dollars). why? They say it's because of the high-speed sale of houses in the 1990s, officials there say. But why is it that the island seven kilometers away, the seat of the Shoals who made the Jáchymov tolars, has the historical core nicely repaired? It is good if the President draws attention to these matters.
Babiš called for security cooperation at the memorial to the victims of terror
Prime Minister Andrej Babiš and his wife Monica visit ground zero on September 27, 2019 in New York City.
Terrorism is the main enemy that all the countries of the world should fight together. Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babiš made the statement today at the conclusion of a five-day visit to the United States at the New York Memorial to the Terrorist Attacks of September 11, 2001. On this occasion, the Prime Minister paid tribute to the two victims of Czech origin.
"It's a very moving place," said the Prime Minister, accompanied by his wife Monica, placing a white rose with the names of Lukáš Rambousek and Czechoslovak emigrant Alena Sešínová. Both were among the more than 2,750 killed when hijacked planes attacked a former pair of World Trade Center (World Trade Center) skyscrapers. The World TradeS towers collapsed after the crash, and there's now a memorial in their place with a name list of the victims.
"It is necessary to remember what happened here, the horror," Babiš said. The 9/11 attack on the US was cited by the Prime Minister as the reason why the UN should cooperate in a united campaign against international terrorism. In addition to destroying the World Trade Center skyscrapers, the terrorists crashed a hijacked plane into the Defense Department building in Washington, D.C., and planned another strike on a target in Washington, presumed the White House or Congress. But the plane crashed when the passengers confronted the hijackers.
"This is our main enemy, where all the countries of the world should unite and fight international terrorism in a coordinated way," the Czech Prime Minister added.
Slovenians beat Polish world champions to reach ME finals
Slovenian volleyball players will sensationally play for the first title of European champions. With the support of nearly 12,000 roaring fans in Ljubljana, the reigning two-time world champions beat the Poles 3-1 and are the first finalists.
Who they challenge in Sunday's climax in Paris will be decided on Friday between France and Serbia.
The Slovenian team looked much more compact in the semi-finals than the Polish world champions. They only owned the beginning of the opening set and with luck the end of the second set, but the home volleyball players outdushed each other in defence, and of the players in the red-and-white jersey, only the Cuban-born León scored.
However, both Čebulj and Urnaut, as well as the second all-rounder Štern, who soon replaced the lacklustre Gasparini, were introduced in the home line-up. The Poles paid the price for winning all their previous matches at this Euro, while the Slovenians gained confidence after heavy playoff battles with both Bulgarians and Russians.
The Slovenians lost 1–3 to the Poles in the Olympic qualifier in Gdañsko in August this year, but they repaid the defeat at home. But now he will leave the sold-out Ljubljana Arena Stožica. After today, however, they have a certain second medal in history, in Paris they can improve on the unexpected silver from me four years ago.
At the previous European Championships, the Slovenians finished eighth, behind the Czech national team.
Technology companies want to rule our cities
Francis Fukuyama's history has been somewhat scathing. In 1992, at the height of the wave of liberalism that followed the end of the Cold War and the fall of the Iron Curtain, this political scientist wrote in his most famous book, The End of History and The Last Man: "What we may be witnessing... is the final point of humanity's ideological development and universal acceptance of Western liberal democracy as the ultimate form of governance."
Twenty-six years later, we are rather seeing models of the iliberal and thriving in various forms of nationalism and radicalism winning from the US to Russia, from Turkey to Poland, and from Hungary to Italy. Fukuyama's current ninth book, Identity: The Demand for Dignity and the Politics of Resentment, attempts to balance the playing field. As his interview with George Eaton for the New Statesman shows, many of his former positions are being rethisued: he argues that ideas of socialism should be returned to public space, and Marx was right in many ways. At the same time, he insists that his intellectual development is still in line with the position of the 1990s, and critics say they have misunderstood the End of History and the Last Man.
"What I said at the time was that one of the problems of modern democracy is that it provides peace and prosperity, but people want more than that... Liberal democracies don't even try to define what a good life is. It leaves it up to individuals who feel alienated, do not see the point, and therefore group together according to identity, which give them a sense of belonging."
In its time, the book The End of History and the Last Man was written as a strong argument against Marxists who perceived communism as the final stage of history. When asked how he now sees the rise of socialists in Britain and the US, Fukuyama replies: "It all depends on what you mean by socialism. If we are talking about owning means of production, then, with the exception of the need for clear services to the public, I do not think this will work. But if you are referring to redistribution programmes that are trying to address the huge income and wealth imbalances that we are seeing, yes. I think not only could he come back, he should come back. The long period started by President Reagan and Prime Minister Thatcher, in which certain types of ideas about the benefits of an unregulated market came to the fore, had a disastrous effect in many ways."
In the end, Fukuyama is trying to calm the current situation, warning all liberals that even the emergence of new, not entirely democratic regimes will not mean the end of history.
Soldiers rehearsing, pull down the curtains. China prepares celebrations at the site of the massacre
The army has been rehearsing the show over the last weekend. Shops in central Beijing had to close, and residents near the square were ordered to close their curtains. Military vehicles rolled down the empty streets to the square, and fighter jets circled in the sky.
Several Chinese told Reuters they were proud that their countries would show off their military power. But one woman said it was hard to deny that the celebrations would upset other states.
She was probably referring to Taiwan, which China claims and where the elections are coming up. But they may also be worried in hong kong's semi-autonomous city, where thousands of people have repeatedly demonstrated against China's elected administrator.
Celebrations are also being prepared outside Beijing. The southern Chinese port of Siamen put on a special light show on Thursday night. Siamen is opposite island Taiwan and is one of China's top ten most innovative cities.
Before the anniversary, the list of forbidden things is growing. It already has drones, balloons, dragons, alcohol, radios and radiowaves, The Guardian reported. He added that China's popular social network Weibo is deleting "harmful political information."
"This is another milestone, another opportunity to show that the Chinese Communist Party remains (with the hanger) despite all the predictions," said historian Maura Cunningham, who deals with China. "This is a moment when the party can demonstrate order, control and power," she added.
The People's Republic of China was founded in 1949 when communists led by Mao Tingong won the battle against The Chinese Nationalists, who retreated to Taiwan.
In the second half of the 1960s, China underwent a disastrous communist experiment in the form of the so-called Cultural Revolution. In June 1989, the regime massacred thousands of pro-democratic protesters from students and workers in Tiananm Square with tanks.
Since the late 1970's, China has increasingly taken over elements of the capitalist economy. According to critics, it is now a mixture of communism (a monopoly of one party and persecution of the opposition) and (Dickensian) capitalism (exploitation of workers).
Czechs or children are not allowed. CAI reveals discrimination in restaurants
These included, for example, misinformation on prices and non-compliance with the principles of fairness of sales.
In one case of discrimination, restaurants in Prague refuse to let smaller children into the establishment. According to the CIC on its website, it says that the device is not suitable for children under the age of eight. "When asked electronically by the consumer if it is possible to order a table for four adults and one child aged four in the restaurant, the restaurant employee electronically replied that they do not accept the presence of children under eight years of age in the restaurant," Fröhlich added.
In the latter case, another Prague company did not want to let Czech-speaking people to the table, while allowing English speakers to do so. "Czech-speaking inspectors, in the position of a consumer, were not allowed to sit at a table in the restaurant and place an order. English-speaking consumers were allowed to do so," a CAI spokesman described the situation.
Both cases are now dealt with in administrative proceedings. As they are not yet finalized, a spokesman for the inspection could not provide further information on the restaurants in question.
However, discrimination occurred only in a very small part of the restaurants controlled in the second quarter. In total, the CAI carried out 139 inspections. In addition to the two cases of discrimination, it revealed other misconduct in 64 cases. Most of these were shortcomings in respect of the principles of fairness of sales and not informing the consumer about the prices of products and services in accordance with regulations.
Already on Wednesday, the inspection reported cases of discrimination against foreigners in two Prague restaurants, Clock Caffé and Café Restaurant. In both establishments, foreigners were charged amounts higher than Czech-speaking clients. In these cases, final fines of CZK 60,000 have already been imposed.
On vacation with just a credit card? NEO account offers FREE ATM withdrawals around the world!
According to surveys, roughly half of all Czechs who go abroad have already used to pay directly by card. The main reasons include, in particular, comfort, security, but also the possibility to use travel insurance, which is often associated with a credit card.
Travelers in almost every corner of the world can enjoy the convenience of paying by card. This is especially true in popular tourist destinations, but today credit cards are accepted almost everywhere. "People who travel more often, for example for work, do not have time to go to exchange offices repeatedly to exchange cash. And even "vacationers" don't want to rely on cash to make do. Moreover, czech banks or exchange offices do not even have some foreign currency exchanges. With neo account, we have solved this so that its users can withdraw cash free of charge from all ATMs, wherever they are," says Kateřina Petko, Director of Marketing and Communication and Spokesperson for Expobank CZ.
Moreover, a credit card is a much more reliable way than cash not to lose your money. When losing a full wallet, its owner no longer has to wait for the money he carried in it. However, if he loses only his credit card, he can easily block it immediately over the phone or via internet banking. Thus, they do not have to suffer any financial loss at all in a quick negotiation. "In addition to protecting money in a bank account, it has other advantages in addition to its reliable protection. For neo account, for example, it is interest of 1.6% per year, which is among the highest among current and savings accounts. Its establishment and administration takes place completely online without the need to visit a branch. In addition, the money in the bank account is insured up to 100 thousand euros and the account management is completely free of charge," adds Kateřina Petko.
For anyone going abroad, travel insurance should be a matter of course. Thanks to the possibility to arrange it and pay by card online, it can be done even at the last minute. However, owning a credit card alone often means insurance protection when traveling. "For example, for embossed MasterCard Gold and MasterCard Business cards, travel insurance is an integral part of foreign trips to all countries of the world. Holders of these cards can also insure their family with whom they travel. They often do not miss any other arrangements," adds Kateřina Petko from Expobank CZ. However, it is always advisable to check the scope of the insurance, i.e. whether it applies to all activities that travellers plan to undertake.
We're looking for motivated immigrants. The head of the children's clinic is building an international team of doctors, we bring their stories
Albanian Ledjona Toni studied medicine in Czech and today few people know she is a foreigner.
Hundreds of medics from abroad are studying in the Czech Republic who could stay and work here. The pediatric clinic in Motol, Prague, tried to obtain some of them.
Tara Hussein Tayeb had to get up a lot to arrive at motol hospital in Prague around 5 p.m. A Kurdish woman with short-haired hair flew to the Czech Republic from Suleimania, a town in northeastern Iraq where she works as a pediatrician in a hospital and in the afternoon still treats small patients as part of a private practice. In addition, he teaches at the university.
Spilková in steam. Indianapolis is on the verge of advancing after the first round.
Golfer Klára Spilková is on the verge of reaching the final rounds after the first round of the Tech Championship in Indianapolis. On Thursday, she played two birdies, two bogeys and finished the opening day in par. With a result of 72, he is 69th in the division, which is the expected cut.
The 24-year-old Spilková returned to the circuit a month ago after a two-month medical break and failed to make it to the second half of the tournament in Portland. She was rested due to fatigue and exhaustion after a disease.
The first Czech winner of a professional tournament at the European LET series is a member of the LPGA Tour for the first year and has not been doing very well so far. She has been cut three times out of 12 tournaments, the best being 32nd in Hawaii. He's fighting to keep his card for next season.
The tournament in Indianapolis was best played by Korean Hor Michong. After the first round, he has a score of -9 and a two-shot lead over a trio of opponents.
Prague Stock Exchange rose slightly, Czech banks, O2 or Avast prospered
The Prague Stock Exchange closed the trading week with moderate growth. The PX index rose 0.13 percent to 1,038.45 points. It was drawn up by Czech banks, telecommunications company O2 or technology company Avast. On the contrary, Austrian titles and the media company CME did not fare well. This results from the results of trading on the stock exchange website.
For most of Friday's session, the Prague Stock Exchange traded in slightly positive territory and ended with a small profit. "However, it lost slightly over 1 percent over the whole week (the PX index)," said Josef Dudek of Fio banka.
Domestic banks have partially corrected the declines in recent days. Komerční banka improved by 0.82 percent to CZK 803 and Moneta Money Bank by 0.41 percent to CZK 72.80. Avast shares gained 0.89 percent to 113 crowns and operator O2 gained 0.46 percent to $216.50.
Kofola's shares rose the most, by 1.38 percent to CZK 294. Philip Morris, a tobacco company whose shares rose to CZK 13,640, gained less than a percent.
CEZ's energy company's securities stagnated at CZK 520 on Thursday.
Three titles were loss-making - Erste Bank wrote off 0.87 percent to CZK 779.20, CME 0.73 percent to CZK 109 and insurance company VIG 0.40 percent to CZK 618.
The crown weakened slightly against both major world currencies. It lost four cents on the euro to CZK 25.85/EUR, to the dollar three cents to CZK 23.62/USD. This results from data on Patria Online.
My heart is like a bell and the lungs of a non-smoker. I'm just going to have a few infusions,' Zeman joked.
The head of state underwent a several-hour medical examination at the Central Military Hospital (ÚVN) on Tuesday. According to the director of the hospital Miroslav Zavoral, doctors did not find any "compulsive conditions" in the president. The president will celebrate his 75th birthday on Saturday.
The president's doctors showed slight signs of dehydration during the checkup. His low-pressure problems were caused by a lack of water. "To fix the dehydration, I'm going to have a few infusions that will get minerals into my body," Zeman said.
Otherwise, however, according to him, the director of the Institute stated that "the Czech state has a healthy president". The president mentioned that Zavoral had received several hate messages for a medical examination.
According to the president, the doctors examined him thoroughly and did not miss a single spot on the body. "So a brief recap: the heart beats like a bell, the lungs are clean, as if it wasn't a smoker, the liver works like I'm teetotal, the kidneys are fine too, and I can go on and on," Zeman said.
The iDNES.cz contacted the military hospital to comment on Zeman's statement on his health.
The issue of Zeman's health became a topic especially during last year's presidential election or in some public appearances in which Zeman has obvious walking problems. According to Prague Castle, the President walks badly due to diabetic polyfunctional neuropathy. He also has problems with low blood pressure and is harder to hear. Because of his health, he cut back on smoking.
For their study, scientists are looking for toddlers with a congenital defect called ankle valgosity
Valgozita (ankle oats) is a congenital defect that affects five to ten percent of children. By default, it is treated with intensive exercise. Scientists are trying to help these children even more, so they have developed special shoes that should significantly speed up the treatment.
"We have two prototype shoes that will be worn by healthy children and children diagnosed to map the effect in both groups. Participation in the research will have no risks for children and the measurement will be completely painless," explains Marta Gimunová, Head of Research at the Faculty of Sports Studies at MU.
Parents of both groups of children can apply for the study via the website, where a registration form and all information are available.
Scientists are looking for fifty children with a diagnosis and fifty children healthy. Of each group, half will always wear health shoes and half will not.
"The moment when parents should register their child is when they embark on the first separate steps, typically letting go of furniture, for example, which they cling to when trying to walk. Participation in the research involves three measurements within seven months of the child's first steps, each lasting about 20 minutes, and for half of the participants it also includes wearing the tested shoes," gimunová points out.
Pike in a pond or a relatively affluent open-air museum?
Babiš chose statistics such as good security (the Czech Republic is seventh in the world), low unemployment rate, low national debt for his optimistic view. Or the figure that our country is 24th in quality of life out of the 140 countries evaluated, according to one recent study.
However, developer Dušan Kunovský and architect Josef Pleskot presented other, not so "pink" data in a television interview on the occasion of the Architecture and Development Summit. For example, the Czech Republic is 154th in the world in the speed of construction procedures. It may be that the current economic "boom" will not leave behind any significant building heritage as it has in the past.
The biggest obstacle is not only the current legislation, but also slow, non-powerful bureaucracy. This is also documented by comparative studies in which the Czech Republic lags significantly behind the overall quality and performance of public administrations behind developed countries.
Our country has simply not yet been able to make good use of the potential of the good economic situation of recent years to invest in the future. While it is nice that salaries and pensions are rising, people with better living standards will also want to have a place to live, travel modernly and quickly, have quality cultural stalls, live without an unbearable environmental burden.
But in the capital City of Prague, for example, it has been possible for years to complete the inner and outer ring road or to build a high-speed train or metro to the airport. And Prague does not even have a modern, architecturally courageous national library, concert hall or national gallery. The reason for this is not only absurd wraths over architectural competitions, zoning plans and building permits, but also a kind of specifically Czech conservatism, which sticks to the motto "any bolder change is for the worse".
And just when it seems that something bolder could be done, it will almost certainly be thwarted by conservationists or other rather ammo-smoochy societies or politicians. In the absurd drama surrounding Jan Kaplický's "blob" designed for the new National Library building, President Václav Klaus even wanted to tie himself to excavators.
However, the list does not end in Prague. The Czech Republic is not able to build its backbone motorway network or start building train speedways, so Germany eventually decided to run its railways for superfast trains from Berlin to Vienna by "detour" through Bavaria. Moreover, repairs to existing infrastructure are often drowning in schlorianism. Getting from Prague to Brno quickly is now a puzzle.
Babiš came into politics promising to "make things happen." But not much has happened yet when it comes to meaningful investment and accelerating cumbersome bureaucratic procedures. Although an amendment to the Act on speeding up the construction of transport infrastructure has been in place since 2018, we will have to wait for more extensive positive effects, for example, on easier land expropriation. And a new building law, passed by the government, which it says should reduce the current average length of construction proceedings from 5.4 years to one year, will take effect from 2021 if we are lucky. But I don't think many people would bet on it.
Disheaged wants $45 million from the state
According to the office spokesman Vladimír Řepka, the Ministry of Justice has received six applications in this regard so far and is now analysing them. The young man was jailed for two years for assaulting the woman, but was eventually acquitted by the judiciary.
Both The Attorney General Pavel Zeman and The Minister of Justice Marie Benešová did not file an appeal in the case.
The attempted murder of a hairdresser in Hořice took place in February 2013. The Hradec Public Prosecutor's Office indicted a 20-year-old student of the Grammar School Of The Unchased. The prosecution claimed that he hit the woman several times in the head with a log and then took over 10,000 crowns from her. The seriously injured woman was found by her son, her life was saved by doctors of the Hradec Králové hospital.
Disheaged from the outset, he denied any guilt. "I'm innocent, and I swear to it. I am sincerely sorry for what happened to the victim, but I am not the perpetrator," the young man, who did not deny that he was in the hairdresser's on the fateful day, said earlier in court. He said he wanted a haircut. But he left after his wife told him he was closing. He then turned himself in to the police as a witness.
The hairdresser did not recognize him as an aggressor during questioning, but later identified The Disheaged as the assailant. According to forensic experts, she suffered from memory loss after the attack.
The Hradec Regional Court gradually handed down five judgments in the case. He first found The Disheath guilty twice and sentenced him to 16 years in prison, while the High Court of Appeal reduced his sentence to 13 years. The dishealysed man gradually went to prison twice, but each time he was released after the Supreme Court intervened. After an ordered replacement of the court chamber, the acquittals were finally handed down repeatedly, the last of which was upheld by the High Court in March this year.
At the same time, the President of the Board of Appeal, Jiří Lněnička, stated in the reasoning of his conclusions that this decision was wrong, but that he did not have a better option, given the procedural situation. He said he dismissed the prosecutor's appeal against the acquittal, even though her appeals were justified.
"The problem with this is not that there is a lack of evidence, but that there is an assessment of it. We believe that sufficient evidence has been collected in the pre-trial proceedings that would be sufficient in another criminal case to acknowledge guilt," said Lněnička.
But both the Hradec Králové court and the Supreme Court viewed the case differently, and their opinion would probably not be changed by the further annulment of the acquittal.
Epilepsy has complicated his love of sports, thanks to surgery he has a new hope
For the first time, Honziek's parents noticed that something was wrong with him, in a year and a half. He always stared into space for a few minutes, immobilized, and did not respond to anyone. The pediatrician therefore sent him to a pediatric neurological clinic, where after a series of examinations, doctors diagnosed him with epilepsy and immediately gave him medication, which did not work immediately.
It took almost a year for doctors to find the ideal combination of drugs, thanks to which he completely stopped having seizures. At the age of five, doctors dropped his medication, and because the seizures did not return, his parents thought Honza was healthy and began to lead him more to sports. He rode his bike, skied, played tennis and floorball, spent his free time playing games with his sister and friends. But at the age of 11, he had another seizure, and it all started all over again.
The doctors tried different combinations of drugs again, but this time nothing worked, seizures in the form of absences were constantly repeated. Since Honza always lost sight of the seizure, his parents were terrified that he would get it while playing sports and get hurt. Gradually, Honza stopped cycling and swapped downhill skis for cross-country skis and snowboards. Although the sport gave him a seizure from time to time, he never gave it up completely. He even fulfilled his dream and finished the Spartan Race, but together with a friend who kept an eye on him to help in an emergency.
When Honza was 15 years old, his parents decided to try to change doctors and turned to specialists at motol university hospital. After a series of examinations, the doctors there decided that Honza was a candidate for surgery to remove the foci from his brain - the source of epileptic seizures. "I had to have two surgeries in a row, first the doctors injected probes into my brain to scan its activity, then they could remove my bearing. It's been a hell of a week for me. All I had to do was lie there and barely move, there were wires sticking out of my head that were connected to the computer," Honza recalls.
The operation was successful and doctors removed the relatively large deposit. "The first days after the operation it was very mentally demanding, Honza was apathetic, confused, sad and almost did not speak. As opposed to how normally he is alive and communicative, this was a frightening change, but luckily after a few days everything returned to normal," says his mother, adding: "A month and a half after the operation, he had 1 seizure, but according to doctors, this happens. He's been seizure-free for three months since then."
This school year, Honza will graduate, in addition to sports, he enjoys languages and has started working with Company E, with which he travels around schools for epilepsy talk. Honza is not yet fully engaged in sports activities, he is starting to return to sports gradually. "I'm learning how to play sports properly, how to breathe well, so I don't put my body under sudden stress, which is a challenge with my competitive nature," honza explains.
This year, therefore, he will not actively participate in the traditional EPPI water triathlon, where patients with epilepsy and healthy athletes meet, which takes place already this weekend, September 28, 2019 at the Veselská sandpit. But maybe next year, yes.
XXX Lutz can buy competitor Kik, the bureau has authorized. But there's a catch.
"The Office for the Protection of Competition, on the one hand, has authorised the merger of competitors XLCEE-Holding GmbH, on the one hand, and Kika Nábytek and Lambda Properties Czechia, on the other, subject to compliance with the structural obligations laid down in favour of maintaining effective competition," said Martin Švanda, spokesman for the Office for the Protection of Competition.
XLCEE- Holding owns Möbelix stores in addition to xxx lutz. If it were to absorb the Kika chain, it would take up too much of the Czech furniture and accessories market. Therefore, part of the purchased company must be sold off.
XLCEE-Holding also buys Kika branches in other countries where the chain operates, i.e. Hungary, Slovakia and Romania. Even there, the transaction must be em authored by antitrust authorities. Xxx Lutz announced the purchase of 22 foreign branches of the Kika chain from Signa in May. Signa took over the bankrupt Kiku last year at a symbolic price.
The Kika chain entered the Czech market in 2005 and is the number two after the Swedish company IKEA. Before it was taken over by the Austrian company Signa, it belonged to the South African company Steinhoff International Holdings from 2013. She faced problems when she discovered inconsistencies in her accounting. Kika has nine stores in the Czech Republic.
XXX Lutz has been operating in the Czech Republic since 2010. In addition to IKEA, Sconto, Jysk or Assko-Furniture and Kika, it is one of the largest furniture retailers on the domestic market. The same owner is the Möbelix brand. Xxx Lutz will operate over 300 department stores in 12 countries after taking over the foreign branches of Kika. According to the company's website, its annual turnover is €4.4 billion (about CZK 114 billion).
The library commemorates the anniversary of the death of Wenceslas IV with an exhibition of manuscripts
Six rare historical manuscripts from the turn of the 14th and 15th centuries , i.e. from the time of Roman and Czech King Wenceslas IV, can be viewed today and Saturday by people in Prague's Clementinum. The National Library released them from its vaults to commemorate this year's 600th anniversary of Wenceslas' death. This morning, librarians and restorers placed rare originals in display cases in the Mirror Chapel. Admission to the exhibition is free of charge, open for both days from 10:00 to 18:00.
An exhibition of documents entitled Ad mandatum domini Regis: From the royal office and library of Wenceslas IV, the library together with the National Archives. The Written Heritage from the time of The Reign of Wenceslas IV is viewed by the National Archives from the point of view of official documents and the National Library from the point of view of literary works, its author Jan Vojtíšek stated about the exhibition.
"Visitors can look forward, for example, to a work on agriculture by Peter de Crescentiis, which is basically an encyclopedia of agriculture, or to a breviary, i.e. a prayer book of one of the Benedictine monasteries of St. Jiří at Prague Castle, from the beginning of the 15th century," he listed the reasons why people should look at the exhibition.
The Epistles of Peter of Blois, where the opening miniature H (enrico) depicts the semi-post office of King Henry II of England, will also be exhibited. The author of the decoration is most likely the Master of Samson's History, who, in addition to two volumes of the Bible of Wenceslas IV, also participated in the decoration of a number of other manuscripts. Visitors will also see john wycliff's Latin collection of tracts from about 1411 to 1414.
Not a single book has been published from the Václav IV Library in the Czech Republic. According to experts, this library was one of the largest and most beautiful book collections in Central Europe at that time, because the young king longed to build a representative library to match the book collections of his French relatives. However, the library disappeared soon after Wenceslas' death. Apparently, it was stolen or destroyed during the conquest of the Hussite castle. But several codes were saved. Most of them are now owned by the Austrian National Library.
"We have a number of treasures in our collections and I am glad that they are in a state that allows them to be exhibited and made available to the public live and not only in the form of the Manuscriptorium digital library," said Martin Kocanda, Director of the National Library.
On the day of the Saturday public holiday, an exhibition entitled What Lies Under the Floor, which presents local archaeological discoveries, will also be open free of charge in Klementinum.
Kristýna Plíšková did not make it to the finals, she is missing her second title

Petra Černocká changed her image and did the right thing! Resued in light hair
Film Saxana Petra Černocká (69) looks absolutely fantastic for her age. Even though she's celebrating her jubilee in November, she never looked like a pensioner. And now she's helped. She changed her image until her colleagues didn't recognize her.
Actress Petra Černocká never looked like a typical grandmother, who had hair interwoven with gray color, wore settled things and went into society sporadically. She's always taken care of herself, and the older she gets, the more she can untie herself in the way she looks at her image.
Fortunately, she did not succumb to the trend of plastic surgery and takes care of her skin with the help of a good old-fashioned indulon. And her anti-wrinkle recipe pays off. But now she's changed her hair color and she's completely out of her mind.
When it came to a social event where celebrities said goodbye to summer, no one could recognize Petra. Not only did her hair get lighter and shorter, but she was also dressed in a yellow coat that made her shine even brighter.
Ladies should learn from Saxana how not to underestimate that even on the threshold of 70, they can take risks with appearances. And Petra's worth it, she looks like 50 at the most.

Former presidents of the upper chamber Libuše Benešová and Milan Štěch also received medals.

Fištejn was a commentator and director of radio broadcasting of Radio Free Europe, now he cooperates with public media.

The medal was awarded in advance to the astronomer and head emerile of the United Nations Office for Space Affairs, Luboš Perek, in July on the occasion of his 100th birthday. By the end of the year, the same award is to be given to Czech native and first secretary of state of the USA Madeleine Albright and British philosopher and political scientist Roger Scruton, who, among other things, participated in the activities of the so-called underground university during the communist regime in former Czechoslovakia.
