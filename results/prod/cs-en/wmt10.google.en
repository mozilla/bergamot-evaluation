As the fourth US president, Barack Obama will receive the Nobel Peace Prize
US President Barack Obama will arrive in Oslo, Norway, for 26 hours to receive the Nobel Peace Prize as the fourth US president in history.
He will receive a diploma, a medal and a check for $ 1.4 million for, among other things, an exceptional effort to strengthen world diplomacy and cooperation between nations.
The head of the White House will arrive in the Norwegian capital in the morning with his wife Michelle and will be busy.
He will first visit the Nobel Institute, where he will meet for the first time with five members of a committee selected in October from 172 people and 33 organizations.
The presidential couple then has a meeting with King Harald V of Norway and Queen Sonja.
In the afternoon, the visit will culminate in a ceremony at which Obama will receive the prestigious award.
He will receive it as the fourth American president, but only the third, who will receive the award directly in office.
The White House has already announced that Obama will talk about the Afghan war at the award ceremony.
The president does not want to avoid this topic, because he realizes that he is accepting the award as the president who is currently at war in two countries.
He stepped up his war effort a few days ago by sending more troops to Afghanistan, which will not forget to emphasize any of his critics.
During the ceremony, Obama will also receive a gold medal, a diploma and a check for ten million Swedish crowns (about 24 million Czech crowns).
He intends to give them to charity, but he has not yet decided on a specific charity.
The busy program will then take the president and his wife to a banquet, where, in addition to the Norwegian king and queen, there will also be a prime minister and another 250 invited guests.
From the beginning, Obama was more reticent about the price.
He said, for example, that he felt he did not fully deserve it.
He also repeated several times that it was not just a price for him, but for all those who strive for the same values as him.
He said immediately after the announcement that it was a &quot;call to action&quot; for him.
Conservationist accused of blackmail
The Litoměřice police accused the chairman of the Litoměřice Society for Nature Conservation of the civic association of extortion.
In several cases in the past year, he appealed to some construction proceedings, for withdrawing the appeal he demanded money from investors for his benefit, said Litoměřice police spokeswoman Alena Romová.
The chairman of the Litoměřice Society for Nature Conservation is Lubomír Studnička.
He is now in custody and faces up to three years in prison.
Brno sorting containers do not smell much
In Prague, ordinary people can sort their packaging from drinks, in South Moravian villages you will find sorting containers at every step.
And in Brno?
There to set aside a few minutes before you find suitable bins.
I do not want to claim that waste is not sorted at all in Brno.
But it occurs to me that councilors are not sufficiently interested in this problem because we are the second largest city in the republic.
Brno is in the forest league sorting waste not only because, as citizens, we can still throw only paper, glass and plastics into sorting containers, but above all the number of bins for such waste.
For example, have you ever tried to throw a PET bottle in the collection bin at the center?
It&#39;s a complete gem, it mainly takes time and strong nerves.
The only place I&#39;ve come across so far is on Moravské náměstí opposite Potrefená Husa.
Don&#39;t let Mr. Onderka and his colleagues get mad at me, but it will hurt me a little.
Not to mention that there is no honey sorting in other parts.
Many of my friends prefer not to sort waste.
Out of laziness.
They are far from garbage cans.
I&#39;m not surprised.
After the celebration, I offered to throw away a few glass and plastic bottles.
But I did not see any colored garbage cans in Kounicova Street in sight.
Fortunately, I came across the right place on the way to the dirt.
However, garbage overflowed from it.
After all, it is still the center of Brno, which perhaps represents the city the most, isn&#39;t it ?!
But the ecology and some aesthetics of the Brno socialists are probably not very interesting.
They would rather buy a hockey extra league for the city, which will embarrass us all over the country, than buy a few extra containers and offer sorting of other raw materials for cleaner Brno.
I am glad that I was able to confirm my assumption with official statistics after a while browsing the Internet.
According to the data of the company EKO-KOM, Brno is really the worst in the whole South Moravian Region.
&quot;Paroubek&#39;s&quot; budget took money for pensions and sickness benefits
After the left has added to farmers or officials, despite the government&#39;s opinion, there may not be money in the budget for pensions, sickness benefits or building savings.
But also on interest on government debt or international litigation.
It will cause problems for those who will rule in the second half of next year, says Finance Minister Eduard Janota.
When the Social Democrats and Communists pushed for an increase for some groups, they relied on the government to borrow additional spending, pensions or sick pay. &quot;It&#39;s just postponing problems to the future, laying mines,&quot; says Janota.
The borrowed money is paid higher and higher interest rates and must sometimes be repaid.
The state does not have the power to choose where to take it.
If they do not reduce social benefits or the cost of running the state, they must raise taxes.
To all to whom the left has now added: firefighters, teachers, farmers.
And later to their children.
People don&#39;t have to worry about pensions or sickness benefits, from whose account 1.8 billion has disappeared, they will get them.
However, at the cost of becoming more indebted to the state - next year not only 163 billion will be missing from the coffers, but more.
Despite Minister Janota&#39;s efforts, the debt will grow faster and faster, along with interest costs.
The state will need money to pay for it, and it will no longer be enough to slightly increase VAT or reduce maternity pay, as the government has done in its anti-deficit package.
Due to money transfers to several groups of voters, five billion will also be missing next year for the completion of motorways and railways.
These are mainly sections that have already been competed for and under construction, which cannot be redesigned and possibly not cheaper.
Preserve at most, which is also not free.
This means delaying or stopping thirty large buildings, and the drawing of European money is also endangered, warns Ministry of Transport spokesman Karel Hanzelka.
The CSSD has proposed that it solve the loss of money in Solomon&#39;s way - it will reach into ČEZ&#39;s dividends, which the state owns for the most part, and from which it will add to the transport fund.
The problem is that the amount of the dividend is never certain, and it is no longer a bottomless resource.
Last year, 18 billion came from CEZ to the budget.
Every year, dividends pay for the liquidation of environmental damages, supplement the pension account or serve as a reserve for the planned pension reform.
In addition, this trick increases the real budget deficit to 5.7 percent of GDP under EU rules.
However, this does not end the carnival of relocations.
Almost three billion have been budgeted for various compensation for victims of communism and crime or for litigation, even building savings.
It is not certain whether the state can do without this money.
It&#39;s a lottery.
If we lose an international dispute, we will have to pay anyway, Janota says.
The minister will then have to save money within the ministry or, in the worst case, reach for the government budget reserve.
One hundred million is also missing from the already launched two-billion State Treasury project, which is intended to enable online monitoring of what the individual authorities are spending.
The first stage will start in January.
If the finance minister did not find the money elsewhere, the project would have to stop, sanctions would come, Janota warns.
Your next smartphone will handle two operating systems
In the future, Americans are counting on a mobile phone on which the user will be able to switch between different operating systems at the touch of a button.
The revealed plans sound promising.
Just press one key and you will be transferred to Android from Windows Mobile in a few seconds.
This is precisely the goal of the American company VMware, which focuses mainly on the development of virtualization software for computers.
We will allow you to manage two user profiles on your mobile at the same time.
You can switch between them, you can divide them into home and work.
Both will work at the same time, Srinivas Krishnamurti of VMware said in an interview with Computerworld magazine.
It was presented in November last year and was shown for the first time a few days ago.
It will be on the market in 2012.
Smartphone virtualization is no fiction.
VMware has already successfully demonstrated to journalists a test sample of a smartphone with two operating systems.
It was a modified Nokia N800 with 128 MB of RAM, on which the mentioned Windows Mobile and Android systems also ran side by side.
The development of new technology for mobile phones is in full swing.
VMware is now working with European and US operators to test smartphone virtualization, and devices are expected to reach customers during 2012.
Lack of snow in the mountains bothers hoteliers
The bare slopes are not only of concern to the Krkonoše ski lifts.
The lack of snow discourages people from ordering ski stays in hotels and guesthouses.
That is why in the Giant Mountains you can still find free rooms for all winter dates, including Christmas and New Year&#39;s Eve.
We have a lot of traffic on our website.
People go through offers, find out prices, but so far they are afraid to order.
And if they call us, they immediately ask if we think this Christmas will be in the snow or in the mud, &quot;said the operator of the information portal Spindl.Info Martin Jandura.
If you want a New Year&#39;s Eve stay in Špindlerův Mlýn exactly according to your ideas, you should not hesitate to order.
If you prefer to save money and the quality of accommodation is in second place, you can still try to wait a few days.
So far, Špindlerův Mlýn hoteliers mostly offer only weekly stays on New Year&#39;s Eve.
I think they will try to give them away for a while, but then they will let go and go for a shorter time.
And then the vacancies will shrink quickly, &quot;Jandura estimated.
Free beds in all winter terms are still offered by the Vrchlabí travel agency Ingtours.
Now we are most interested in the Christmas week, which is not sold out yet.
Even half of the seats in our offer remain vacant.
That is why we have already prepared some cheaper Christmas stays at the last minute, &quot;said Petr Schiefert, director of Ingtours.
New Year&#39;s Eve in the Giant Mountains can also be offered by the Vrchlabí travel agency, but there are fewer vacancies.
The first fortnight in February is also selling well, the remaining winter terms are sold on average.
This year, the interest in winter stays is negatively affected by the fact that there is still no snow in the Giant Mountains.
People are waiting to see if it attacks.
No one wants to spend the end of the year in the mountains without snow.
If the slopes are snowy during the week, Christmas will also sell out, &quot;says Schiefert.
On the contrary, the rooms of the Horizont hotel in Pec pod Sněžkou are slightly better than last year.
We&#39;re about five percent better.
We have the last few places for New Year&#39;s Eve and Christmas.
There is great interest in the Polish holidays in January and it is also selling well in February, &quot;said Karel Rada, the director of the best hotel in Peck.
Eighty percent of the New Year&#39;s Eve stays are occupied by the Omnia Hotel near the central parking lot in Janské Lázně.
On the contrary, at Christmas half of the beds left in the newest hotel in Jansk.
This year, we were pleasantly surprised by January, which is already occupied by about sixty percent.
February is a bit weaker so far, but as soon as it snows, interest in staying in the Giant Mountains will certainly increase, said Erik Sporysch, director of the Omnia Hotel.
For the time being, hoteliers from the Krkonoše Mountains have to let go of their taste for a larger portion of snow.
It should be cool on Thursday, if there is any precipitation, there should be snow in the mountains.
But then warming is coming again, Jiří Jakubský informed from the Hradec Králové workplace of the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute.
USA: Repetition is the mother of wisdom
It is comical with what schooling effort Barack Obama, a president with a reputation for being the smartest, repeats the strategy of his predecessor, whom he considered the stupidest, on the Afghan question.
When he finally sweated his long-awaited Afghan doctrine, he turned out to have copied it through a copier from Bush&#39;s Iraq script three years ago.
Not only does he use the phrase &quot;as in Iraq&quot; several times in the text itself, but he did not even hesitate to use the title of the Bush Declaration of January 2007 as the title of his own declaration: &quot;A New Way Forward.&quot;
At the same time, three years ago, he himself criticized Bush&#39;s idea of sending fresh military reinforcements to a war-torn Iraq as an &quot;irresponsible and, as a result, catastrophic decision.&quot;
Subsequent months, however, have shown that Bush&#39;s strategy based on field commanders&#39; recommendations was the only one possible and very successful, so much so that there is no talk of Iraq at all today.
It did not improve Bush&#39;s reputation, but he objectively left his successor a much more grateful starting point than might be expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama hopes the miracle will happen again.
He was again asked to increase the military contingent by field commanders, especially the commander-in-chief of the Afghan operation, General Stanley McCristal, who, despite his subordinating habits, harshly criticized the hesitant White House gunners.
He asked 40,000 men to break the situation for the better.
The president hesitated for three months, but came up with nothing better, so at least he cheated the general by 10,000 soldiers.
He was able to squeeze the promise of another 5,000 from Europe, even though he himself originally counted on at least 10.
The most problematic of Obama&#39;s entire strategy seems to be his intention to begin withdrawing troops from Afghanistan in 18 months and to complete the process within three years. The whole Obama doctrine raises more questions than it answers.
Many doubt that the half-increase will bear the same fruit as the move in Iraq.
Despite the fratricidal wars of recent years, Iraqi society is relatively well-organized, with leaders honoring the deal.
The Afghan situation is characterized by the opposite symptom - no one can be relied on and no agreements are being honored.
Under these conditions, the Afghan security forces are accustomed to changing their lord every day according to their needs.
Political institutions, even if they are formally established, will remain a small village, beyond which patriarchal tribal relations will continue to flourish.
Balancing the interests of different ethnic groups is extremely difficult due to the lack of clarity, which further complicates Pakistani and Iranian influences.
Even the building of an &quot;actionable state&quot;, which is the minimalist goal of the whole operation, does not seem very realistic.
The time horizon of Obama&#39;s strategy strikes with his voluntarism.
The situation in Afghanistan has only worsened over the last eight years and is now on the verge of an explosion.
Only a truly romantic soul, untouched by reality, can believe that soldiers sent into the turmoil of war for the purpose of &quot;returning home early&quot; will cause a miracle to be done here.
From a political point of view, setting a date for the withdrawal of troops is pure irresponsibility, as the Taliban will see this as an indirect acknowledgment of the American defeat.
The latest NATO summit showed that the willingness of Europeans to take part in combat operations in Afghanistan is coming to a loss.
European politicians cannot and do not want to explain to their constituents how the security of Germany or Italy is related to the war in the foothills of the Hindu Kush.
Another factor capable of radically intervening in the situation is the development of events around Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and the intensified sanctions do not affect Iranians, the United States will have the difficult question of not trying to solve the problem by military force.
It will have to be answered at a time when, according to Obama, America is embarking on a victorious withdrawal from Afghanistan.
However, any such solution will also mean a dramatic turnaround in the Afghan situation.
The only patch for Barack Obama is the fact that there are three years left in the presidential election, and therefore there is still time left to come up with another strategy if it proves to be a total failure.
Goldman Sachs executives will no longer receive cash rewards
Senior executives of the US bank Goldman Sachs will not receive cash rewards this year.
This was announced by the company, which thus responds to sharp criticism of its wage practices.
Instead of money, a group of 30 leading managers will receive shares that can be sold in five years at the earliest.
In addition, shares may be taken away from managers if they take excessive risks.
According to Reuters, Goldman Sachs is at the forefront of efforts to combine Wall Street rewards with long-term performance.
I think Wall Street is well aware of the broader direction it needs to take, said Douglas Elliott, a former JPMorgan investment banker.
The problem is in the details, he added.
Goldman Sachs has been criticized for setting aside nearly $ 17 billion (almost CZK 300 billion) in bonuses in the first three quarters of this year.
According to Reuters, the total remuneration in the company for this year is likely to exceed $ 20 billion, despite the measure announced today.
With the advent of the financial crisis, high rewards in the banking sector have become a hot political issue in many countries.
Britain announced on Wednesday that it intends to charge bankers bonuses in excess of £ 25,000 (approximately CZK 712,000) with a one-off 50 percent tax.
France is preparing similar steps.
This year, women won the Nobel Prize in all fields except physics
A record five women today in Stockholm received this year&#39;s Nobel Prize in professional categories and for literature from the hands of King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden.
In addition to the four scientists, Herta Müller, a German writer of Romanian origin, was one of them.
Two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, and their compatriot Jack Szostak received the Nobel Prize in Medicine for their research on chromosomes.
The Israeli Ada Jonath won the chemistry award together with the Americans Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz for elucidating the structure and function of ribosomes.
The last laureate was the Nobel Prize in Economics, which was won by the American Elinor Ostromová and her compatriot Oliver Williamson for analyzes of economic administration.
The only professional category that did without a holder this year was physics.
This award went to scientists Charles Kao for research in the field of optical fibers and George Smith and Willard Boyle for the invention of the CCD chip, which is the basis of all digital cameras, fax machines or astronomical telescopes.
Each winner received a diploma, a Nobel Medal and a certificate of financial reward.
For each category, it reaches ten million Swedish crowns (approximately 25 million CZK).
If there are more honors in each of them, they divide the reward among themselves.
Traditionally, the most anticipated Nobel Peace Prize was received this afternoon in Oslo, Norway, by US President Barack Obama.
In his speech, he acknowledged the controversy of his award, as he is only at the beginning of his career and, moreover, he is at the head of a country that is waging two wars - in Iraq and in Afghanistan.
In defense of his policy, however, he added that wars are in a situation necessary for peace, even if the price is high.
Minister Janota is considering resignation. Klaus invited him to the Castle
On Friday morning, President Václav Klaus will receive Minister of Finance Eduard Janota, who is considering staying in government because he does not agree with the form of the state budget for next year, as approved by the Chamber of Deputies on Wednesday.
It is assumed that the budget and possibly Janot&#39;s stay in the cabinet will be the topics of their Friday meeting.
Klaus also criticizes the budget.
According to him, the deficit is too high, which further deepens the crisis of public finances.
The president&#39;s spokesman Radim Ochvat informed about the meeting.
Janota wants to discuss his continued position with Prime Minister Jan Fischer on Monday.
According to the budget law, which Klaus will now sign, the Czech Republic should run a deficit of 163 billion crowns.
However, on Wednesday, the Chamber of Deputies approved the proposals of the left for money transfers and increased money for salaries of state employees, for the operation of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government criticized the Social Democrats&#39; proposals for secretly increasing the budget deficit.
This caused a sharp domestic political dispute between the left on the one hand and the government, Klaus and the right on the other, which raised the question of the further operation of Fischer&#39;s office, which the ODS, CSSD and Green Party agreed to form in the spring.
Critics argue that the budget, as adopted by the House, is essentially destroying the austerity package that the Fischer&#39;s government pushed through in the fall, which it says should stop the state&#39;s indebtedness.
Klaus, who may or may not sign the state budget law, said at today&#39;s breakfast discussion with businessmen that politicians have long neglected the &quot;serious problem&quot; of the &quot;unsustainable deficit&quot; of public finances.
According to him, today he no longer has a good solution.
Only a strong government could bring improvements, which could also rely on a broader consensus of political parties, says the president.
ODS chairman Mirek Topolánek said the budget was frightening and the government should consider its continued existence.
ODS deputy chairman Petr Nečas told ČTK that the concept of an official cabinet with the support of the CSSD, ODS and the Greens was clearly no longer working.
In response, Prime Minister Fischer called similar words &quot;strong statements.&quot;
The head of the CSSD, Jiří Paroubek, reacted to Topolánek by saying that the budget deficit prepared by the former Topolánek government for this year, which will exceed 200 billion crowns, is frightening.
Already on Wednesday, the CSSD called the approval of the state budget for next year a success.
The People&#39;s Party was also satisfied.
Mandela was played by Morgan Freeman in Clint Eastwood&#39;s novel
South Africans claim that the new Hollywood film Invictus: Undefeated tells the world a lot about the country, its struggle and victories, despite some criticism that the main roles are played by American actors.
The story is about sport, racial conditions and Nelson Mandela.
The tireless fighter against the racist apartheid regime in South Africa and its first black president, Nelson Mandela, is represented in his life story by the Oscar-winning American actor Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said Mandela, 21, asked him if he could portray him in Eastwood&#39;s film.
Another important role in it is played by Matt Damon.
I told him, &#39;If I play you, I will have to have access to you.
The 72-year-old actor, who won an award for his role in Eastwood&#39;s boxing drama Million Dollar Baby, has already portrayed the leader of the slavery movement, who eventually became a slave, a fictional US president and even a god in Divine Evan, but rarely anyone who is still alive and is as important to many people as Mandela.
The former South African statesman has been in prison for 27 years for his active work in ending apartheid in South Africa.
He was released in 1990 and then became president of the country for four years.
In 1993 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
Invictus is the Latin word for undefeated and is the title of a poem by the English author William Ernest Henley published in 1875.
The challenge was to speak like him
The film is a true story of how Nelson Mandela joined forces with South African rugby team captain Francois Pienaar to help unite the country. Newly elected President Mandela knows that his nation remains racially and economically divided after apartheid.
He believes that he can unite his people through sports, so he decides to unite rugby players who are among the outsiders worldwide.
The South African team will eventually advance to the 1995 World Cup.
Freeman worked for several years to get Mandel&#39;s story on the screen.
I had no other goal than to play this role to bring it as close to reality as possible, Freeman said.
The biggest challenge, of course, was for me to speak like him.
The actor said that if he and the world politician were from the same area, he would try to meet Mandela, have dinner with him, be behind the scenes before his speech.
Most importantly, he wanted to shake Mandel&#39;s hand.
I&#39;ve found that when I shake your hand, I take over your energy, it&#39;s transmitted, and I felt like I knew how you felt, he said.
It&#39;s important for me to try to become a different person.
In the film, Matt Damon plays François Pienaar, the captain of the national rugby team, which was dominated by white players.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for a role in the tough world of rugby.
The big surprise for him was finally when he first met Pienaar in his house.
I remember ringing the doorbell, it opened for me, and the first thing I said to François Pienaar in my life was, &#39;I look much bigger in the movie.&#39;
Despite clear differences in the actors&#39; characters compared to their real models, directed by Eastwood, Invictus: Undefeated received positive reviews and there was talk of ambition for the Oscars.
Daily Variety film critic Todd McCarthy summed up his assessment: &quot;It was a very good story, a very well-made film.&quot;
In movie reviews on rottentomatoes.com, Invictus received 76 percent positive reviews.
The secret of the glow over Norway unraveled: the Russians tested the rocket
Above Norway, it was possible to observe a special light effect of unknown origin.
It was only yesterday that the Russian Ministry of Defense admitted that it was testing an intercontinental ballistic missile near the Norwegian border.
However, the start was again unsuccessful and the missile, called the &quot;Bulava&quot; type, which was originally to be the pride of the Russian army, is slowly becoming a black moth for Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
Even his repeated presence during rocket tests did not have a proper effect on the success of test flights.
Bulava usually did not take off at all or was damaged in the air.
In Russian newspapers, &quot;Bulava&quot; is already described as a &quot;rocket that does not fly&quot;.
A rocket that does not fly but lights up
This was the 13th attempt in a normal manner, initially normally.
It was only at the end of the flight that the apparatus was technically damaged again.
Apparently the engine exploded in the third stage of the rocket.
This time &quot;Bulava&quot; took off from the nuclear submarine Dmitry Donsky, which sailed under the surface of the White Sea.
This type of rocket allows you to fire from a vessel that is in motion and submerged at the same time.
Therefore, it is probable that the mysterious light over Norway caused by an unspecified flying object was actually broken by &quot;Bulava&quot;.
After all, the Norwegians had no doubt from the first moment that it was a Russian missile.
This time, the generals are defending themselves, claiming that failure cannot be said unequivocally.
The first two stages of the rocket lasted and the accident affected only the third.
In previous cases, the engines broke down in the first stage.
Although not a single test start took place without any errors, only six out of thirteen consider the leadership of the Ministry of Defense to be unsuccessful.
The almost 50% success rate therefore fills the generals with optimism, and so he still claims that the &quot;Bulava&quot; will one day fly without problems and that it will even carry up to ten hypersonic nuclear blocks with a maximum total weight of 1.15 tons.
The legendary Fetisov signed a one-year contract at CSKA Moscow at the age of 51
Legendary defender Vyacheslav Fetisov will once again present himself in a professional hockey match at the age of 51.
The former world champion, Olympic winner and Stanley Cup holder will help his CSKA Moscow team in distress and will probably start in Friday&#39;s KHL duel against St. Petersburg.
Fetisov, who ended his career at the age of forty in 1998, is currently the president of CSKA.
After Denis Kuljaš was injured, we urgently need another defender.
Fetisov trains regularly and has agreed to help the team.
We just need to resolve some formalities, the AP agency quoted the coach of the Moscow club Sergei Nemchinov as quoting.
It is not yet clear whether the famous hockey player&#39;s comeback will only cover one match.
I think that Fetisov is one of those who can lift the spirit of other players, said Němčinov.
According to the AP, Fetisov will become the oldest Russian professional hockey player if he returns to the ice.
In the NHL, legendary striker Gordie Howe played the entire season for Hartford at the age of 51, scoring 15 goals and 26 assists.
The oldest of the famous five Fetisov, Kasatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov is one of the best and most successful hockey players in history.
In the jersey of the Soviet Union, he won two Olympic gold medals, seven world titles, triumphed at the Canada Cup and the Junior World Championships.
In the second part of his career, he also achieved success in the NHL, where he twice raised the Stanley Cup above his head in a Detroit jersey.
He has been a member of the Hockey Hall of Fame since 2001.
Hyundai complied with the unions. Cancels all overtime
The management of the Hyundai car plant in Nošovice has agreed with the unions to abolish all overtime.
Due to the often ordered overtime, the unions declared a strike alert on Monday.
Hyundai spokesman Petr Vaněk confirmed this.
However, the management wants to agree with the trade unions on another Saturday shift this year.
We cannot resign from our production plan, which is essential, which is why a voluntary overtime was proposed on Saturday, December 19, with the proviso that two shifts would be made, Vaněk said.
The Sedmička.cz server wrote that the company of employees who work Saturday&#39;s shift offered a bonus of CZK 400.
People will get it back even on a working Saturday, November 28.
According to Vaňek, the company decided to change the way employees are motivated for the proposed overtime.
Either they will be reimbursed for overtime pay or they can take compensatory leave on December 28, and thus extend the Christmas holidays by one day, Vaněk said.
In addition, all Saturday shift employees receive paid fares and lunch.
Given that overtime was the most urgent and burning point in terms of comments and complaints from trade unions and protesting employees who stopped production spontaneously last week, the management decided yesterday afternoon to cancel all overtime for December with immediate effect, Vaněk said.
Until last week, the carmaker&#39;s employees were forced to work two hours overtime practically every day after an eight-hour shift.
After signing the agreement, the unions withdraw the betting readiness
The next meeting between the carmaker&#39;s management and the trade unions is to take place on Friday morning.
The head of the unions, Petr Kuchař, said on Wednesday that if they agreed to meet the requirements and sign a joint document, they were ready to cancel the strike standby.
The situation at the carmaker worsened last week on Wednesday, when about 400 employees went on strike spontaneously due to constant overtime.
They also protested against poor pay conditions and alleged bullying.
Management has argued that overtime must be done by employees to meet car delivery requirements.
In their announcement of a strike alert on Monday, trade unionists also demanded that no sanctions be imposed on employees who interrupted production last Wednesday.
In the area of overtime, unions demand that the company reduce overtime work to a minimum.
In addition, they want to pay a reward of 5,000 crowns for it this year.
The Nošovice car manufacturer Hyundai now employs 2,000 people.
The company started mass production last November.
By September of this year, it had produced about 80,000 cars, and its current production capacity is 200,000 cars a year.
Czech discovery: a substance that also targets &#39;hardened&#39; HIV viruses
A team of Czech and German scientists is testing new compounds that can slow down the spread of HIV in the body.
The main advantage of the improved substance is that it also targets viruses that have already acquired immunity to drugs.
In some cases, this fact outweighs the fact that the compound does not act as strongly on a common variant of the virus as some of the drugs already available.
AIDS cannot yet be cured.
However, a mixture of drugs that prevent the spread of HIV in the body can significantly prolong patients&#39; lives.
However, their use is accompanied by a number of side effects.
In addition, incomplete suppression of virus replication results in the development of so-called resistant viruses, against which drugs are no longer effective.
The work of experts from three institutes of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, the Institute of Chemical Technology in Prague and the University of Heidelberg opens the way to deal with virus resistance.
They have shown that substances called metallocarboranes act on the protein responsible for the reproduction of the HIV virus.
Metallocarboranes are compounds of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds block the spread of the virus differently than all drugs used today, and therefore can overcome the problem of resistance.
In their work, researchers come up with new &#39;improved&#39; compounds prepared based on knowledge of the molecular mechanism of their binding to the viral protein.
Metallocarboranes have a unique three-dimensional structure: two multi-walled cages made up of boron, hydrogen and carbon atoms are connected by a metal atom, in this case cobalt.
A treacherous and resistant virus
The HIV protease is a protein of the HIV virus that is essential for the life cycle of the virus.
Without HIV protease-induced cleavage of HIV, mature infectious virus particles would not be formed.
When we stop the HIV protease, we also stop the spread of the virus in the patient&#39;s body, the researchers explain in a press release issued by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic.
In a paper published in the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, researchers describe a series of compounds in which two pairs of cages (see table) are connected by a short organic chain, which is further systematically modified.
Slightly weaker, but more reliable
The effect of this series of substances against HIV protease was tested in a test tube and also against its resistant variants obtained from HIV-infected patients.
The effect of metallocarboranes on a common variant of the enzyme is not as strong as that of clinically used drugs, but it does not lose its effect for resistant variants against which the drugs used are often ineffective.
The unique mechanism of action as well as their other properties such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of further chemical modifications make metallocarboranes interesting compounds for further research aimed at designing effective drugs against HIV, says Pavlína Řezáčová, head of the Structural Biology Laboratory of the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry and the Institute of Molecular Genetics of the Academy of Sciences.
Quarrel over budget. The ODS embarked on Fischer, who defends himself
ODS leader Mirek Topolánek called the approved budget for next year &quot;scary&quot; and, according to him, the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should consider further existence.
The Prime Minister described the ODS statement as strong statements.
He is said to be taking the time to analyze.
ODS deputy chairman Petr Nečas said that the concept of an official cabinet with the support of the CSSD, ODS and the Green Party was clearly no longer working.
According to Nečas, the Prime Minister must decide whether he intends to lean on the minority in the Chamber of Deputies, which is to fight the growing deficit, or whether to remain in office with the help of the parliamentary left.
The approach of the ODS and social democracy to the issue of public deficits is diametrically different, Nečas pointed out.
On Wednesday, the Chamber of Deputies adopted the budget for 2010, but with left-wing amendments for more than 12 billion crowns.
The Chamber of Deputies increased money for salaries of state employees, for the operation of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government&#39;s criticism of the Social Democrats&#39; proposals was that they were secretly increasing the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic should run a deficit of 163 billion crowns.
The ODS left the hall before the vote, thus satisfying the government&#39;s wish that even the amended budget is a less bad option than the provisional budget.
Disappointment and vanity
Minister of Finance Eduard Janota spoke of disappointment and a sense of futility, Prime Minister Jan Fischer said that the government would assess the current situation.
Nečas is convinced that if Janota seriously threatened to resign if the amendments were adopted, the situation could look different.
According to Czech Television, Janota ordered the Prime Minister on Monday after the government.
He indicated that he was considering remaining in office.
The reason is his disappointment at the budget negotiations.
According to Nečas, if Fischer is in favor of another fight against the budget deficit, the nominees of the CSSD, which enforced changes in the budget, have nothing to do in the government.
The prime minister should also make it clear that he will resign if the Chamber of Deputies approves other deficit-increasing laws, such as those relating to sickness benefits, pensions, or an amendment to the Civil Service Act.
Topolánek: The ODS-nominated ministers were not at fault
It is a matter for Prime Minister Fischer and the entire government.
The ministers nominated by the ODS did nothing wrong, Topolánek emphasized in a text message from the USA.
He reminded that in several ministries there are people in the deputy positions who apply for TOP 09, who voted against the budget.
Nečas stressed that if Fischer decides to resign himself to the principle of combating the level of the public finance deficit, &quot;it is perfectly logical and correct to rely on the left-wing majority that is currently in the House.&quot;
But then he is said to be unable to count on the support and tolerance of the Civic Democrats.
I did not think about it, and when it becomes relevant, I will deal with it, the Minister of Defense Martin Barták, who was nominated to the government by the Civic Democrats, told reporters in the Chamber of Deputies.
In the afternoon, Prime Minister Fischer flew to Brussels for a European Council meeting.
At the request of the Prime Minister, the ODS withdrew
At the same time, Nečas emphasized that the ODS would probably vote against the amended budget in the Chamber of Deputies on Wednesday if the Prime Minister did not explicitly ask the deputies of the Civic Democrats to allow the adoption of the budget.
We do not feel like orphans, we are not small children, he then reacted to the question of whether the ODS did not burden the absence of the party chairman in the parliament and the Czech Republic during the political negotiations on the budget.
I didn&#39;t notice my voice missing.
Even when I resigned, I knew that in the coming months it would be mainly about the Bolshevism of the Chamber of Deputies and the destruction of everything positive, Topolánek himself reacted.
According to the new ČD rules, fewer trains will run for almost the same fare
From 13 December, Czech Railways will cancel or reduce some less busy expressways and local railways, while strengthening other connections.
The total volume of traffic will be reduced by two percent from today as of the new timetable.
Most tariffs, including basic and customer fares, will not change.
For example, the inhabitants of the Ostrava region will get more connection options to the capital, and the railways will add one pendolino set to this line.
The express train, on the other hand, will stop running to Bratislava.
Fewer express trains will also run on the line Prague - Písek - České Budějovice, direct connections Prague - Letohrad will be substantially reduced.
Of the regions, the railways plan the largest reduction in traffic in the Hradec Králové region, by a total of eight percent, while Prague and its surroundings can look forward to an increase.
Two night trains on the route Prague - Tábor - České Budějovice are also canceled and the operation of several express trains on the route Prague - Písek - České Budějovice is limited to certain days of the week.
One of the biggest changes is the introduction of a new direct line from Milovice to Prague, today the Milovice family has to change in Lysá nad Labem.
This is the fifteenth line of the Esko suburban system, its opening is possible thanks to the completion of the electrification of the line from Lysá nad Labem to Milovice.
Long-distance connections to the capital will end at the destination station Hlavní Hlavní nádraží.
ČD will introduce more SC Pendolino connections between Prague and Ostrava, and trains to Šumperk / Jeseník will run at two-hour intervals.
Passengers will no longer be transported by pendoline to Bratislava from 13 December.
This year&#39;s bill for regional railways: 200 million more
The express trains are ordered and paid for by the Ministry of Transport, which will give the railways a total of four billion crowns next year to cover the so-called provable loss, just like this year. The locals are ordering the regions, they will pay a total of eight billion crowns for them next year, while the state will contribute almost three billion to the regions.
This year, regional trains are 200 million more expensive.
The railways have a newly concluded ten-year contract for local and express trains, so far the contract has always been for one year.
The railways praise the system, which is why they probably did not increase the prices of the vast majority of tickets.
There will be changes only for one-day ČD Net network tickets and cheap eLiška internet tickets.
For passengers without a customer card, the price of ČD Net will increase from 450 crowns to 600 crowns.
The price of the eLiška will be based on the distance traveled, so far it has been uniform for travel between any regional cities and amounted to 160 crowns.
Philippine militants are still holding more than 50 people, and the children have been released
Today, gunmen abducted 75 people in the southern Philippines, including several elementary school students and their teachers.
This was stated by the AFP agency, which originally reported only 65 abductees.
All 17 detained children were released after eight hours, including one teacher.
The abduction took place in the province of Agusan del Sur.
About 19 gunmen are said to be using the hostages as a living shield when fleeing the police.
Local negotiators are now trying to agree to release the remaining hostages.
According to the AFP agency, the militants belong to the New People&#39;s Army (NPA), which is an armed component of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to the AP agency, the police originally persecuted the kidnapper due to the violence that required the settlement of accounts between two local family clans.
In the southern Philippines in the province of Maguindanao, martial law has been declared due to the recent massacre that killed 57 people.
Among the victims of the November 23 massacre in connection with the governor&#39;s elections were 30 journalists.
The governor of the southern Philippine province and his father, Andal Ampatuan, the patriarch of the influential Ampatuan family, were arrested on suspicion of involvement in the massacre.
Muslim separatists are also active on the island of Mindanao.
However, they resumed peace talks with the Philippine government on Tuesday.
The story of South Africa is about everyone, says Morgan Freeman alias Mandela
In the coming days, Clint Eastwood&#39;s new Hollywood film Invictus (Invictus: Undefeated) is coming to American cinemas, which captures part of the life story of former South African President Nelson Mandela.
Morgan Freeman, who is said to have been chosen by Mandela himself years ago, took on the role of a world-famous anti-apartheid fighter.
Matt Damon played the supporting male role of the legendary South African rugby champion Francois Pienaar.
With the release of the film in cinemas, it arises from the responses of critics and the public
Nelson Mandela
Full name Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela was born on July 18, 1918 in Mvez, South Africa.
In 1988 he received the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought and in 1993, together with de Klerk, the Nobel Peace Prize.
He was President of South Africa from 1994-1999.
high expectations as it comes to light at a time when preparations for the World Cup are culminating in South Africa, but at the same time the media is shaken by disturbing reports of growing racial hatred and discrimination by the black majority.
According to the AP news agency, the response to the new film in South Africa has been generally positive so far, despite numerous reservations about the casting of the main roles by &quot;slack&quot; Hollywood stars.
However, according to Morgan Freeman, he is proud of the new film.
I dreamed of that role for many years and prepared well for it.
I have also met Nelson Mandela in person many times to, as they say, recharge his energy, he said in an interview after the film&#39;s premiere in Los Angeles.
I think it&#39;s good if we can recall Mandel&#39;s personality and message with the film.
It&#39;s the story of South Africa, but it affects everyone, he added.
In the jersey of the national rugby team
Based on a book by British writer John Carlin with a loosely translated title In the Role of the Enemy: Nelson Mandela and the Game That gave rise to the nation, the film portrays a South African human rights activist during his first presidential term.
During the film, Morgan Freeman tries to unite two racial and for many years mutually defined groups of the population, and as in 1995 Nelson Mandela, he also plays the role of South African national rugby jersey on the World Cup, which South Africa won at the time.
Fourteen years ago, Mandela received a standing ovation from a predominantly white audience and gained the recognition of the white population for entering the lawn in a jersey, which is perceived almost as sacred in South Africa.
The football championship may be able to reunite people into one nation, said rugby player Chester Williams, who was the only &quot;black&quot; person on the national team in 1995.
Whether the tense situation in South Africa will improve remains to be seen.
However, white South Africans are skeptical, as rugby fan Christopher Dawson, who fled the country to Britain, revealed in a recent interview with LN.
The championship will start on June 11, 2010.
A transformer is burning in the Louny region for tens of millions of crowns
The fire hit the Čeps transformer in the morning in the substation near the village of Výškov in the Louny region.
According to Lukáš Marvan, a spokesman for the regional fire brigade, Lukáš Marvan, six units are involved in the fire.
Originally, firefighters wanted to burn the transformer, but later reconsidered their opinion and extinguished the fire with a mixture of water, foam and special extinguishing agent.
The cause was a technical fault, internal short circuit of the transformer.
No one was injured, according to Pavla Mandátová, a company spokeswoman, the accident does not endanger the safe operation of the transmission system.
The damage is estimated at several tens of millions of crowns, it will be possible to quantify it precisely after the end of the fire.
According to the Mandate, the destroyed transformer will need to be replaced with a new one.
In the ten years of Čeps&#39;s operation, nothing similar has happened, defects of this type are rare, she added.
According to CEZ spokeswoman for Northern Bohemia, Soni Holingerová Hendrychová, the electricity supply was not interrupted, and the operation of households, offices and companies was not affected by the fire at the transformer station.
As Čeps operates in the Czech Republic as the exclusive operator of the transmission system, 400 kV and 220 kV power lines.
It maintains, renews and develops 39 substations with 67 transformers transferring electricity from the transmission to the distribution system and a line route of 4339 kilometers.
Jančura files a criminal complaint for defamation against three governors from the CSSD
The owner of the Student Agency, Radim Jančura, will file a criminal complaint today against defamation against three social democratic governors.
Namely, Michal Hašek from the South Moravian Region, Radko Martínek from the Pardubice Region and the Governor of the Olomouc Region, Martin Tesařík.
Jančura stated this in Twenty Minutes of Radiožurnál.
The lawsuit is related to the company&#39;s efforts to operate regional train transport in some regions.
However, in the end, all regions signed long-term contracts with Czech Railways.
All three governors are attacking us and talking about choosing raisins, while we only offered what they wanted.
He claims that we are more expensive than Czech Railways, which is not true because we know the prices of Czech Railways, which were closed last week.
So all we have to do is defend ourselves.
This is for defaming the Student Agency, he told Radiožurnál Jančura.
He also said that he had evidence from all regions that they had not taken their steps in accordance with European law.
It is therefore preparing an initiative for the European Commission.
Hašek considers the filing of a criminal complaint to be a further continuation of Mr. Jančura&#39;s media show, which serves as an unpaid advertisement for his company and his own person.
I am, of course, ready to defend the good name of myself and my region, and I will challenge other governors to the same.
I assume that even on this occasion it will become clear that it is Mr. Jančura who manipulates the public and uses false and untrue arguments in the matter of regional railway transport, said Hašek.
Jančura announced last week that it is investing several million crowns in advertising, which will draw attention to the unfavorable step of the regions.
He told Radiožurnál that he would interrupt the campaign after Christmas and wanted to continue it after the New Year.
He specified that the campaign would be conducted against corruption as such.
Jančura launched the campaign after the regions agreed to operate regional railway connections with Czech Railways and did not tender for the order of around 150 billion crowns.
According to Jančura, such conduct is illegal and contrary to the opinion of the European Court of Justice.
According to him, a member of the CSSD has already threatened Jančur with criticism of train transport in the regions.
The only threat was that if we didn&#39;t stop, we could lose our bus licenses.
He introduced himself as a member of the CSSD, I know which gentleman it is, I will not say his name, Jančura told Radiožurnál today.
Vaccination against pneumococci will be free and optional
Vaccination against pneumococci from January will break the established habits.
It should be the first for families free of charge and at the same time optional.
But there are already rumors that compulsory vaccination would be more effective.
Preparations for the introduction of free pneumococcal vaccination are in full swing.
The Institute of Medicine is already setting maximum prices for vaccines to be paid by health insurance companies.
Experts are also clear on the vaccination process.
New vaccination
Free vaccines for August children
From January, children born last August 2 and later can be vaccinated against pneumococci free of charge.
The condition is that they have not yet received a single dose of vaccination.
Anyone who started vaccinating last year or earlier must pay for another revaccination.
The first dose of vaccination must be given between 3 and 5 months of age.
Already last year, a quarter of families voluntarily had their children vaccinated against pneumococci.
At the same time, the parents paid 1,600 crowns for one dose or more.
Four doses are needed to vaccinate the youngest children.
Overall, experts estimate that health insurance companies spend 300 to 450 thousand crowns a year on vaccination benefits.
But it will save on the treatment that children would need without vaccinations.
So far, the state has paid about 500,000 a year for all vaccinations of children.
Paid vaccination was introduced by the so-called Janot package.
Pneumococcus causes inflammation of the middle ear, but also serious infections, including meningitis and blood poisoning.
According to a survey in hospitals, up to 28 children under the age of 10 die from pneumococcal infections in our country every year.
In addition to the Czech Republic, they have introduced paid vaccination of children against pneumococci in about 40 countries.
Will vaccination be mandatory?
At the same time, however, there are opinions that this vaccination may be mandatory in the future.
From January, it is to be paid by insurance companies and optional.
Rudolf Kalovský, the head of the Nahlas civic association, suggested, for example, that compulsory vaccination would be better.
His association has long promoted the pneumococcal vaccine.
The experts at the international conference that our association attended were not completely satisfied with the fact that we have voluntary vaccinations.
It&#39;s not perfect.
On the other hand, we are glad that at least this has been achieved.
I think that is the path we must take now, said Kalovský.
However, the Ministry of Health does not want to change the procedure of vaccination against pneumococci.
We are not thinking about it at the moment, said his spokesman Vlastimil Sršeň.
Voluntary vaccination has its drawbacks, doctors say
The chairwoman of the Professional Society of General Practitioners of Pediatricians, Hana Cabrnochová, acknowledges that voluntary vaccination has its disadvantages.
If all children were vaccinated, a reduction in the number of revaccinations could be considered. &quot;In a situation where this vaccine costs such a large amount, we quite understand the political decision that vaccination was started as voluntary,&quot; says Cabrnoch.
Experts expect more than 80 percent of new parents to have their infants vaccinated against pneumococci from next year.
Vaccination against pneumococci is also groundbreaking in that it is paid for by health insurance companies, not the state, as the first comprehensive vaccination of children.
Insurance companies should spend money on prevention, thus saving on further treatment, explains Cabrnoch.
Doctors will have to buy the substances themselves
But there are concerns for GPs about buying vaccines.
According to the original intention, vaccines were to be bought by insurance companies and doctors would receive them in the same way as the state supplies them with substances for other vaccinations.
However, some MEPs feared that insurance companies could &quot;withdraw money from health insurance&quot;.
Doctors will therefore have to buy the substances and wait for the insurance companies to reimburse them.
It is estimated that individual GPs will invest 40,000 a month in vaccines, a significant amount.
It won&#39;t be easy at all, says Cabrnoch.
The son of the American artist &#39;stole in a museum&#39;
The son of renowned American filmmaker Frank Frazetta was accused of attempting to rob $ 20 million (£ 12 million) paintings from his father&#39;s museum.
Pennsylvania police said Alfonso Frank Frazetta was caught loading 90 paintings into his vehicle and trailer.
The named Mr. Frazetta and the other man used an excavator to break into a museum in the Poconco Mountains region.
Mr. Frazetta senior, age 81, became famous for creating the characters Barbara Conan and Tarzan.
At the time of this, the artist was in Florida, according to the Associated Press.
The AP quoted an unnamed police officer as saying that Mr Frazetta Jr. could have been motivated by long-standing family disputes.
In front of the police, Mr Frazetta issued a younger affidavit, aged 52, that he had done so on his father&#39;s instructions, &quot;to get to the museum in any way possible and move the paintings to the malting rooms,&quot; the agency said.
Mr Frazetta Sr. denied granting any such permission, the agency said.
Labor is resisting the planned increase in taxes
Ministers advocated rising taxes and spending cuts announced in the preliminary budget report against criticism from the opposition, businessmen and unions.
According to Alistair Darling, the Tories have &quot;wasted&quot; the opportunity to show that they are serious about postponing the decision to reduce the deficit until after the election.
The chancellor also came under fire due to the disability of low- and middle-income workers.
According to his proposal, this is mainly an increase of 0.5% in social insurance and a 1% adjustment of public payments from 2011.
Annihilation about social insurance
The unions protested that the low-income workers were punished for the recession, which they did not cause, and warned in advance of &quot;problems&quot;.
Social security is on the rise - an increase of around £ 3 trillion a year - which has outraged the business community, who have said it is an employment tax, while focusing on economic recovery.
This increase, limited to this income of more than £ 20,000 a year, will affect around 10 million workers.
KEY POINTS PBR
Social insurance will increase by another 0.5% from April 2011
The economic situation will deteriorate more than expected by 4.75% this year
New taxation of 50% of bankers&#39; bonuses
Increase in 1% corporate tax for depreciation of small companies
Tax reduction for electric cars and wind turbines
Increase in the assessment of pensions by 2.5%
According to government estimates, some revenue of £ 30,000 will be reduced by £ 90 a year and some revenue of £ 40,000 will be reduced by £ 190, while some revenue of £ 10,000 will be increased by £ 110.
Ministers announced that their goal of halving the deficit by 2013 was &quot;difficult decision-making&quot;, but insisted that 60% of special taxes should fall on 5% of the highest-income earners.
Finance Minister Stephen Timms denied that the proposed increase in taxes and spending cuts would be a &quot;drop in the ocean&quot; compared to what would have to be done.
&quot;These are big numbers. They will allow us to halve the deficit, which is an absolutely basic requirement for the next four years,&quot; he told the BBC.
Mr Timms said he believed the economy should grow at the turn of the year.
But making a forecast for future economic growth - which will affect the volume of loans needed and how quickly the deficit will be reduced - must be taken into account after the chancellor was forced to revise earlier amounts.
In his opinion, he said the economic downturn this year was 4.75% - far worse than the 3.5% decline predicted in April - because loans were £ 3 trillion higher than previously estimated.
Missed opportunity &#39;
Conservatives, who launched a new publicity campaign on Thursday to warn of a &quot;debt crisis&quot; for Labor, called the planned £ 789 trillion loan over the next six years unbearable.
Ministers failed to present a credible plan on how this could be paid, they added, &quot;cynically&quot; postponing the decision until after the election - which must take place by June 2010.
&quot;They have not added anything significant that would be feasible,&quot; said shadow finance minister Philip Hammond. &quot;They had a chance to do it, but they wasted it.&quot;
&quot;All important announcements will be made after the election if we win them&quot;
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Labor insists that schools, hospitals and the police be protected from future cuts, unlike the Tory&#39;s proposals, which would like to reduce the deficit faster and on a larger scale.
But the Liberal Democrats argue that the money raised by raising taxes and cutting spending should be used to support spending next year and not to reduce the deficit, arguing that the plans are &quot;built on sand.&quot;
BBC political commentator Nick Robinson said of the timing of the announcement - for example, inflation would rise and the inability to pay benefits next April - could lead to accusations from the chancellor of the election campaign if the money were difficult to recover a year later.
But Labor insists on providing special help if people need it very much and the situation is reviewed in September 2010.
Suspicious budget &#39;
Although ministers did not disclose details of spending after 2011, economists said it was clear that reducing public spending would only be the beginning of medium-term restraints.
The acclaimed Institute of Budget Studies said the chancellor&#39;s figures indicate significant cuts in many areas, potentially in the future including transport, higher education and defense.
&quot;It&#39;s really very painful so far,&quot; said director Robert Chote.
&quot;All the important statements will come after the election, if we win them,&quot; added Roger Bootle, an economic adviser to the Deloitte accounts auditor.
&quot;It was a report on a suspicious preliminary budget. The markets are implementing it.&quot;
FBI conducts investigation in &#39;US prisons in Pakistan&#39;
The FBI is investigating a prison in Pakistan against five Americans suspected of being linked to extremists.
The men were imprisoned for attacking a house in Sargoda in eastern Punjab province, according to the BBC at the US Embassy in Pakistan.
The FBI said it was investigating whether they were the same men who had been declared missing last month in their home state of Virginia.
The US State Department said it was also about obtaining information about these men.
Three of them are said to be from Pakistan, one with Egyptian ancestry and the other from Yemen.
&quot;If they were American citizens, we would be very interested in the conditions under which they were detained and the circumstances in which they stayed there,&quot; said spokesman Ian Kelly.
FBI spokeswoman Katherine Schweit said the agency had been informed of the arrest and was in contact with the families of the missing students.
&quot;We are working with the Pakistani authorities to determine their identity and the nature of their actions here and whether they are really missing students,&quot; she said.
The Pakistani embassy in Washgington said the men had been arrested in a house belonging to one of their uncles.
He said the house had always been the focus of local police and that the arrested men had not yet been charged.
Secretary of State Hillry Clinton declined to comment on the arrest, Reuters reported, but said the United States must &quot;work much more closely with Afghanistan and Pakistan in uncovering the infrastructure of terrorism that continues to recruit and train people.&quot;
The disappearance of these five students from their homes in northern Virginia was announced by their families in late November.
Rejection of amnesty for Iranian abusers.
The human rights situation in Iran is as bad as it has been in the last 20 years, according to a report by Amnesty International.
The report details the &quot;methods of torture&quot; in the regime before and after the disputed presidential elections in June.
One of the men said he was beaten and burned with cigarettes. Another said he was in danger of being raped.
Iran has denied the above criticism of this report on respect for human rights.
Officials described the criticism as politically motivated.
Thousands were imprisoned in Iran and dozens were killed after the controversial election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, leading to the largest street demonstrations since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.
Dozens of them were detained and prosecutors sentenced the last five people to death.
John Leyne, a BBC correspondent in Tehran who is now in London, said that earlier in protests, Supreme Leader Ayyatollah Ali Khomeini had declared certain forms of torture unjustified and banned their use in the Karizak correctional facility.
But since then, almost no criticism of legitimate power has been tolerated, as our correspondent said.
False confession &#39;
Amnesty International quoted a 26-year-old computer student, Ibrahim Methari, as saying he had been accused of &quot;working with Facebook&quot; and protesting the election results.
&quot;I was often beaten in the face,&quot; he said.
&quot;They burned cigarettes under my eyes, on my neck, in my head ... They threatened to execute me and humiliated me.&quot;
After five days, he signed a false confession and was released and left on the street, still bleeding and half unconscious, Amnesty said.
In August, defeated presidential candidate Mehdi Charroubí was detained after protests after the elections and was tortured to death in prison, and others were raped.
Iranian senior government officials have denied allegations of rape, but admitted that torture had taken place.
Amnesty also cited the case of a former prisoner who said he had been held in a container with 75 other people for more than eight weeks in Kahrizak prison.
Amnesty acknowledged that the Iranian parliament and judiciary had set up committees to investigate the government&#39;s post-election riots and reactions, but said the mandate and powers of the authorities were unclear and the findings of the parliamentary committees were published.
The group said at least 90 people had been detained in the last three weeks to prevent further demonstrations.
A ski slope was created in the city park
More than 100 tons of artificial snow were used to turn the Bristol landmark into a race track.
The downhill run for the race in the park attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders to compete for financial prizes.
At the top of the ski slope in Brandon Hill Park was a short ski jump in front of the 100 m long ski slope.
Fourth-year medical student John Hickman said it was a beautiful view from the top of the piste, but that it was really depressing.
It was a beautiful sight of the flashing lights of the city below.
There were some of the best skiers and snowboarders from all over the country - some of them real talents, &quot;he added.
The prizes were awarded for the best pieces - or maneuvers on the piste.
After Thursday night&#39;s race, the snow was left to melt.
Still them and us
Can a Muslim be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in the secular state.
At a time when Swiss voters have called for a ban on the construction of minarets and there are widespread alarming reports about the alleged Islamization of Europe, John Bowen, an American academic, wrote and informed and pondered whether Muslims could integrate - and integrate - into one of the most open secular societies on the continent.
After reading this book, some readers have admired the author&#39;s latest work, &quot;Why the French Don&#39;t Like Headscarves&quot; (2006), this elegant and debated study of controversial issues that have divided and occupied the country for 15 years and whose effects are being felt. still today.
Mr Bowen&#39;s latest book has a broader and much more ambitious scope.
As a good anthropologist, he wants to know not only what politicians and the media have said about Islam in France, but what really happened in the beginning.
He spent months in mosques, schools and institutes, which now care for 5-6 million French Muslims, which Mr Bowen calls &quot;Islamic spaces&quot;.
He is a good listener, reproducing debates between teachers and students on the issues that concern them most.
Should a Muslim marry in a mosque or town hall (or both)?
Should a young Muslim be taught about the development and rights of gays?
can a Muslim woman marry a man who is not a Muslim?
Does a Muslim have the right to use an interest-oriented banking system to obtain a mortgage?
It is these seemingly secular issues that are being discussed that are part of everyday life rather than the political dramas that employ the media.
The author identifies a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, including well-known people, including Tarik Ramadan, an Arab, a Muslim researcher and academic born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open a debate on how to be a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society at the same time.
They have no arguments for all their habits.
Conservatives are skeptical of the true idea of French or European Islam.
The philosophers and activists interviewed by Mr. Bowen are inclined to believe that this is the opposite of Selafi — supporters of the purist Sunni Islam associated in Saudi Arabia — this group is small but influences European Muslims.
Mr Bowen believes that Muslim values and French secularism are compatible.
But adaptation requires compromises on both sides.
He wonders how far French politicians (and the intellectual elite that so stubbornly defends the lay public) are really committed to the idea of pluralism.
He believes that Muslims are likely to have less experience of the faith than Catholics, Protestants and Jews, who have also had to make historical compromises with secular republicanism.
Rather than developing pragmatism, he found &quot;tightening of the screws of values.&quot;
Can a Muslim be French? After reading this book, someone may tend to say &quot;Yes, but not now.&quot;
The most bleak prospects in the world
The Arctic is changing faster more dramatically than the rest of the planet&#39;s environment.
Boundary ice melts at an alarming rate, affecting animals and their survival like nowhere else.
The interests of oil, gas and fishing companies must be focused on new natural water resources, together with diplomats, lawyers and writers when they awaken.
In &quot;On Thin Ice,&quot; Richard Ellis, a writer and illustrator, tells the natural history of the icon of the North, the polar bear.
Well acquainted with the complicated history and practices of whaling, he describes the long tradition of polar explorers who tried to seize the polar bear.
Admiral Nelson&#39;s encounter with a brave fourteen-year-old lifeguard who fought only with a musket is really a myth, but everything else is true.
Young bears swimming behind the bodies of their newly killed mothers were caught and sent to zoos and circuses.
At the beginning of the 20th century, 75 polar bears appeared in one circus tent at the same time.
Even today, zoo enclosures typically have an area a million times smaller than the area available to adults in the wild. The climate is rarely suitable: the resident polar bear in Singapore has turned green from algae growing within the hollow hairs of its coat.

Mr. Ellis draws on the works of other writers and historians and often returns to the threat that hunters threaten the survival of species.
Although hunting is banned in Norway, America and Russia, the killings continue in Greenland and Canada, where they hunt from helicopters and the Indians ski and all are armed with powerful assault rifles to fire their prey.
The irony is that it is taking place in the water north of these two hunting nations and that the ice will eventually be the largest.
In his new book, &quot;On Ice,&quot; Alun Anderson, a former editor of New Scientist, offers a clear and unhappy responsibility for Arctic science and an engaging glimpse at how the future can change it.
Scientists have the answers to everything.
Even meteorologists and oceanographers do not have an adequate response to the speed of change.
That&#39;s for lack of testing.
Fridtjof Nansen&#39;s research in the late 19th and early 20th centuries indicated for the first time how floating ice was moving.
Submarines during the Cold War then mapped the shifting divisions as they subdued them.
Satellite reconnaissance and large fields of probes in floating glaciers are a useful addition, but much still happens thanks to intrepid individuals camping in the winter.
Mr. Anderson looks at the extraordinarily fragile world of the gradient system within the Arctic ice, formed by the flow of salt water that shrinks as it freezes.
But from the above-mentioned bear to the microscopic wonders within, it is all doomed to extinction as soon as the summer ice moves, which happens sometime between 2013 and 2050.
In a few months ... it could be us&#39;
6,000 Marines laid wreaths on graves in Arlington
Petty Officer De&#39;Angello Robinson, 19, traveled by bus for seven hours to lay a simple wreath on a soldier&#39;s grave he had never met.
For him and the other Marines who traveled from Johnson Camp in Jacksonville, North Carolina, to Arlington National Cemetery to decorate their graves, it was a day to pay homage to men and women who once wore the same shoes.
In the few months we board, it could be us, Robinson said of the fallen soldiers.
If that happens to us, I would like someone to do the same for me, to show me the respect I am trying to do.
He was one of more than 6,000 volunteers who gathered that morning to lay wreaths in a veterans&#39; cemetery in several wards during a reverential act in Arlington.
In 1992, Morrill Worcester, owner of Worcester&#39;s funeral home in Harrington, Maine, began the tradition when he and several others decided to decorate several hundred graves at a reverential act in Arlington.
It is now an 18-year-old tradition that Mr. nMorill and his wife Karen take this trip each year and stop in various cities along the way to honor the memory of military personnel and victims of terrorism.
The Worcestesters do not seek profit in this, wreaths across America that they lay in other states.
This year, volunteers laid more than 16,000 wreaths at Arlington Cemetery, the Pentagon, graves at Fayetteville National Cemetery in Arkansas, Battery Park, New York City, and the memorial site of United Airlines Flight 93 in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second year running, the Walmart Foundation is donating more than $ 150,000 to purchase and transport wreaths.
Charleen Hunt, 70, of Westminster, said she traveled to Arlington in honor of her husband, a deceased member of the armed forces.
Because her husband is not buried in Arlington, Mrs. Hunt said it was her way to recover what the victim was doing.
It&#39;s a small way for citizens to support our troops, she said.
It&#39;s like visiting a family grave.
Wrapped in coats of warm cloth, volunteers walked through the cemetery through the surrounding lawns and hills.
Volunteers headed for older graves from the First and Second World Wars and the Vietnam War, as these are not visited as often as newer graves.
The mood was positive as the children played and held hands as they transported the young pine tree to the greyish tombstones.
Each circular wreath was dark green with a small red arch over the top.
There was a real silence nearby in Ward 60, where most of the veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are buried.
Associated service organizations donated 1,000 wreaths to decorate the department, but the gloomy mood of the ongoing wars filled the area.
Some cried sincerely, others prayed, and families and friends kept each other in the cool air.
Some read aloud the names engraved in the stones, while others leaned over to look at the small black-and-white name tags, pushed into the wet mud where the tombstones had not yet been placed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of many mothers wiping tears from their eyes in front of her son&#39;s grave.
She drove eight hours from Zanesfield, Ohio, to visit the last resting place of naval artillery sergeant David Shane Spicer, who fell in combat in July.
No one should ever forget why we are free. . My son paid for it, she said.
&quot;Even though I&#39;ve been gone a long time, I want to be the one to remember him.&quot;
US government contractor imprisoned by Cuban government officials
The Cuban government has arrested a U.S. government contractor who imported cell phones and laptops into the country, State Department officials said on Saturday.
A supplier who has not yet been identified worked for Development Alternatives Inc. based in Bethesda.
The company is working on projects for the US Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
Consular officials, along with the U.S. Interest Section in Havana, sought access to the detainee, who was arrested on December 5.
Certain allegations have not been made public, but under Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or foreigner can be imprisoned for almost anything that is described as &quot;dangerous.&quot;
All so-called counter-revolutionary activities, including mild protests and critical articles, pose a risk of imprisonment.
Anti-government graffiti and speech are considered serious crimes.
There is a young blogging community in Cuba, led by popular commentator Yoani Sánchez, who often writes about how she and her husband are being watched and harassed by government agents.
Mrs Sánchez has repeatedly asked permission to leave the country to accept the prizes, but she has been denied permission.
The detention of the American contractor may be the result of growing tensions between Castro&#39;s communist brother, who rules Cuba, and the Obama administration, which has been seen as a &quot;delaying tactic&quot; in improving relations with the island.
They were the first to report the arrest of the New York Times on Friday night.
The new US policy emphasized that if the Cuban government takes concrete steps, such as the release of political prisoners and creates more room for opposition, the United States will take reciprocal action.
Mobile phones and laptops are allowed in Cuba, although they are new and sought-after commodities in a country where the average salary of a civil servant is $ 15 a month.
The Cuban government granted ordinary citizens the right to buy mobile phones this year; These are mostly used for PRP text messaging because a 15 minute phone call would cost more than one daily wage.
Internet use on the island is extremely limited.
It is available in expensive hotels and for their foreign visitors and at some government connections, such as universities.
Cubans who often want to apply must report their names to the government.
Access to many websites is denied.
American detention in Cuba is a rarity.
Most of the handful of U.S. citizens in Cuba&#39;s prison are behind bars for crimes such as drug smuggling, said Gloria Berben, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Interests Section in Havana.
Mrs Berben said she could not provide more information about the prison.
Imprisonment and detention were clearly amoral.
Such activities, which would be legal in any other open society - let&#39;s say free mobile phones - are a crime in Cuba, said Miguel Vivanco, director of the U.S. Human Rights Group&#39;s program, which recently published an unfavorable report on freedoms in Cuba entitled &quot; New Castro, the same Cuba, &quot;as an allusion to Raul Castro&#39;s installation as the country&#39;s leader and a replacement for Fidel&#39;s ailing older brother.
Vivanco said defendants are often arrested, tried and imprisoned in one day.
He said that any solution would be more political and that the Cuban government often provoked a negative reaction in the United States just as the two countries were moving towards a wider dialogue.
Pakistani civil servants are uncovering a conspiracy to send men to Afghanistan.
Pakistani authorities on Saturday uncovered an alleged leader in a conspiracy to send five men from northern Virginia to Afghanistan to kill U.S. troops, saying they hoped the case could help uncover a vast network of terrorist recruiters scouring the Internet and is looking for radicalized young men.
Investigators said they were looking for a gray rebel figure known as Saifullah, who invited the men to Pakistan after he first discovered them when one of the men posted a comment approving the terrorist attacks on the YouTube video.
Saifillah took command of the men as soon as they arrived in Pakistan, trying to help them reach a remote area of Pakistan in the Indigenous zone of Pakistan, home to al-Qaeda and its terrorist training camps.
But a Pakistani intelligence official who reported the case said on Saturday that Saifullah had failed to convict al-Qaeda commanders and that the men were not part of a CIA attempt to infiltrate a terrorist network.
As a result, they were planted for several days in the eastern quarter of Sarghod, far from the menacing mountains in the northwest, which became a refuge for terrorists.
They were considered a strike force.
Why they were dismissed was said by an official who spoke of maintaining anonymity due to the sensitivity of the case.
The official said the men were not intimidated and were still trying to get permission to gain access to al-Qaeda camps when they were arrested under Pakistani law.
The case of the five - which remained in Pakistan and were questioned by the FBI - highlights the critical role of recruiters in identifying potential terrorists and, perhaps more importantly, determining who is trustworthy.
Since the 9/11 attacks, US intelligence has given top priority to attempts to place human resources in al-Qaeda.
The organization&#39;s recruiters act as guards, disqualifying those who are not serious enough in their commitment to the holy war and those who might be spies.
U.S. bogus recruits have been subjected to special scrutiny by al-Qaeda, analysts said.
But they were also considered extremely interesting in the group because of their potential approach to American goals and their promotional value.
But Evan Kohlmann, a senior analyst at the US-based NEFA, said terrorist groups have also become significantly more cautious in recent years about allowing anyone to join them as US intelligence agencies have acquired experts in their recruitment methods.
If we are trying to penetrate these groups, is there no better way than to follow their recruitment model, which has been followed so much? Mr Kohlmann said.
This model is one that is far more web-based.
Tens of thousands protest in Copenhagen, calling for climate &#39;action&#39;
Tens of thousands of protesters marched through the streets this Saturday, demanding stronger climate action from negotiators at Bella&#39;s convention center.
Protesters reported the number of hundreds of thousands of participants in the event, but police say the number was closer to 25,000.
The event was relatively quiet and a handful of masked activists placed several small charges near a group of government buildings in the city center.
On the day of a small incident in UN-sponsored climate talks, thousands of activists walked through the city carrying banners reading &quot;This is not Planet B&quot; and one in Spanish saying &quot;Earth says&#39; enough.&quot; . &quot;
Several celebrities took part in the protest, including Danish model and photographer Helena Christensen, who said she had traveled to her mother&#39;s birthplace in Peru to provide me with information about the plight of the country, which is still affected by climate change.
That is part of the reason why we have decided to join this great march - to walk the world and appeal to world leaders to come up with a fair, ambitious and binding agreement, she said.
It is not an easy task, but it must be done, it still cannot be avoided.
Police prevented protesters from approaching Bella&#39;s center, saying they had detained 19 people, primarily because they were either wearing masks or carrying pocket knives.
These activities are prohibited under Danish law during demonstrations.
According to one of the non-participating spectators, who does not wish to be identified because he is involved in climate talks, activists disguised as athletes and in black suits have placed several charges near Copenhagen&#39;s main canal, which is located near several ministries.
They agitated at the buildings, he said, launching flares, but then &quot;several major explosions followed.&quot;
Inside the convention center, people gathered around television screens to watch the march during the afternoon.
But the protest probably did not reach the minds of key officials such as Su Weie, China&#39;s chief climate negotiator.
When asked if the demonstration nevertheless had a constructive impact on international negotiations, he replied in English &quot;Actually, that is something that I was not aware of&quot; (it really is something I do not realize).
Then he continued in Chinese and said, &quot;Because the venue is large, I can&#39;t hear what&#39;s going on outside.&quot;
He watched to see if the march was painful or helpful, depending on everyone&#39;s prospects.
The concentration of the general public and various sectors and the subject of climate change can be seen, he said.
In other words: &quot;It can also be said that this is a violation of the actions or freedom of others.
The test data revealed persistent persistent racial differences
Last week&#39;s federal certificate of mathematics was a welcome element of good news about Columbia County&#39;s public education system.
Although the district lags far behind the country&#39;s high-performance systems, the certificate has shown greater progress among fourth and eighth graders in the last two years than in cities including Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what remains hidden behind the latest issues of the National Attestation Center for Progress in Teaching are the persisting differences in knowledge between African Americans and white students, both locally and nationally.
The average score for fourth-grade white Columbia students over the past two years has increased from 267 to 270 points (out of a possible 500), but their African-American peers have increased by only three points, from 209 to 212.
Indeed, the knowledge gap widened between 2007 and 2009 from 53 to 57 points.
Progress in eighth-grade African Americans remains broadly balanced, deviating by a statistically insignificant one point from 245 to 245.
The average result for white pupils was not included in the test results because the sample size was not large enough.
The picture at the horizon of six years is not exactly encouraging.
The difference between white and black fourth graders in 2003, when the first NAEP was conducted in the precinct, was 60 points on the scale (262 to 202).
Although the outcome of children in both groups improved during this period, the difference hardly approached 58.
Some county education advocates said last week that the results celebrated by Secretary Michelle A. Rhee and Mayor Adrian M. Fenty (D) were more stimulated by white students where results were already high.
This would suggest that we have increased the total support of those at the higher end of the scale, which is problematic and worrying, said Jeff Smith, CEO of DC Voice, a non-profit group that advocates for equality in the precinct.
I&#39;m not jumping up and down to scatter two or three points, said DC committee member Kwame R. Brown (D-At Large), who has a daughter in the fourth grade of Eaton Elementary School.
Often criticizing Ms. Rhee&#39;s management style, Ms. Brown said reporting on test results meant high school in the city is in a state of despair and requires attention.
Obviously, you always want to see the pros, and I respect that.
But what is terrifying is that we did not devote almost any time and energy that needed to be devoted to our secondary education.
Ms. Rhee said the district&#39;s goal is to continue looking for better ways to address the needs of low-achieving students.
Thus, for example, some teachers are trained in the use of new reading curricula, Wilson&#39;s reading system, aimed at upper secondary students and high school students who have failed to master the basics of reading earlier in their college careers and lag far behind their peers.
The day-to-day math and sixth-grade math syllabi, highlighting real-life games and experiences that came to the precinct under former Director Clifford Janeyi, can be attributed to NAEP&#39;s progress, which was reported last week.
And I just think we should keep working and make the best possible interventions for those students who stay below class, Mrs Rhee said.
Others said the NAEP results clarified the question of whether Ms. Rhee could continue to improve the overall performance of the system and still provide additional money and resources for low-performing schools, which is needed to reduce the gap.
It&#39;s a certain dilemma of Michell Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, a professor of teaching at the University of California, Berkeley, where he studies test results in urban areas.
The conventional remedy is to focus resources and administrative reforms on schools located in the worst parts of the Columbia district.
Thus, focus can bring political repercussions that go against an important agenda.
But the reproach also belongs to other city directors who are trying to maintain a medium average between white and black.
We need to focus on building a system of large schools.
We need to strengthen the kinship of our schools so that all families, no matter where they live, can be confident that their children will be provided with excellent public education.
Mr Janey, now the principal of schools in Newark, said in an interview this week that a key element in reducing the gap is the extension of the traditional public school year, currently 180 days in the precinct, to make schools eligible.
You have to get up to 200 days to make the changes, said Mr Janey, who signed a 185-day contract with his teachers&#39; association last year for the school year, which he sees as a &quot;sign&quot; for looking for a bigger increase next year.
Make higher education part of a better future
The tour bus drove to Gettysburg College with a loud respite.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12, stepped out and rested for a moment on white columns, brick facades and emerald green lawns.
Graciel&#39;s parents had a hard time graduating from college in El Salvador.
So far, Graciela herself, who was born in Silver Spring and lived in Riverdale, has never entered the dormitory grounds.
Now she and other eighth graders in the group were exploring Gettysburg, where tuition was $ 38,690 a year, their status being enthusiastic rather than frightened visitors to potential students.
Yes! This is it! exclaimed Graciela, who would like to study medicine, when the guide offered them to enter the building of knowledge.
Wow, really? she said thoughtfully as they told them the low ratio of professors to students.
The Pennsylvania dormitory was one of seven they visited on their three-day trip and were now completely fascinated by the future news: The question is not whether you will enter the dormitory.
The question is from where.
However, this is a major problem for the high number of US-born children of Spanish immigrants who are expelled from university or pregnant as minors, but there are hundreds of thousands of those who receive a college education and thus enter the middle class.
In fact, one-fifth of this &quot;rainbow generation&quot; of Spanish college students — remarkable results show that many of their immigrant parents, mostly Mexicans and Central Americans, entered the United States without graduating from college.
Their success story is important, researchers say, because it underscores their way forward for a generation that has played a marginal role in the country&#39;s workforce.
Those who have attained higher education say they had a natural inclination toward school and an innate penchant and desire to succeed.
Many also had parents who set high goals for their children and looked for ways to replace the ignorance of American education.
But school programs also play a special role in helping Graciele and the millions of children who would like to graduate - especially if these efforts persist over time.
Given that the children come from low-income groups whose parents have no experience and skills to help them navigate the system, any simple intervention at every point will not solve it, says Patricia Gándara, a researcher at the University of California, Davis, where she studied students from the Latin American field.
We need to think about providing these children with a pre-school safety net in every way they can get through college.
The federal program that funded Graciela&#39;s dormitory trip is a useful example.
Known as GEAR UP, it provides more than $ 300 million a year for local school systems to run college preparation programs that begin for low-income groups in high schools and continue until those students graduate from college.
Since 1999, the program has served more than 10 million students, of whom more than% have entered college, according to the US Department of Education.
The Iraqi Ministry of the Oil Industry has reached an agreement with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite fears of violence and political instability, the Iraqi government has managed to persuade major oil companies to rebuild their unhealthy infrastructure during two auctions on Saturday.
Ten agreements have been concluded by the Iraqi Ministry of Oil Industry with foreign oil companies, indicating that Chinese, Russian and European oil companies are ready to play a significant role in rebuilding Iraq&#39;s oil industry, paralyzed by decades of war and sanctions.
American companies left with a shareholding in just two of the 10 auctioned fields.
Seven American companies paid to participate in the second auction, which began on Friday.
Only one submitted a lost bid.
Two US companies reached agreement on the field, which was auctioned in June.
The meager participation of US oil giants in the open Iraqi oil industry surprised analysts.
Iraq has finally opened its doors after six years of war, and instead of American companies, Asians and Europeans are in the forefront, Ruba Husari, editor of the Iraq Oil Forum, said online news.
That will be for a long time before anything else is for sale in Iraq.
Security concerns, highlighted by massive coordinated bombings on Tuesday and political instability, as well as the withdrawal of the US military, are likely to discourage US companies from intensifying business in Iraq, which has arguably the third largest raw material reserves, analysts say.
American companies have been at a disadvantage in some cases, especially Chinese and other government-controlled energy companies, which have significantly lower operating costs and are more prone to risk because they are not accountable to shareholders.
Exxon Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only American companies to enter into agreements with the ministry.
Leading US companies, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which have maintained close contacts with the Iraqi Ministry of Petroleum Industry and offered technical assistance in recent years, left empty-handed.
Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the top shareholders in two of the contracts awarded at the end of this week.
State Chinese National Petroleum Corp. participated in bids for more contracts than all other companies and left with large stakes in contracts in two main fields.
We all know that China is striving to become a major economic as well as technological force, said Oil Ministry spokesman Assam Jihad.
We are convinced that the Chinese company will be comparable to the competition and will live up to its obligations to Iraq.
The companies were pre-selected to submit bids, which were then compared by the ministry by barrel price, and the ministry is willing to pay to boost output above current levels in each field.
Al Qaeda&#39;s top planner was apparently killed in Pakistan.
A US missile strike at the Pakistan-Afghanistan border this week apparently killed a top al-Qaeda operations planner, U.S. counterterrorism officials said Friday.
As confirmed, this could be the second deadly attack on one of the top terrorist leaders.
Saleh al-Somali was one of two Arabs killed when several rockets hit their car on Thursday near the city of Miran Shah in North Waziristan, according to US sources and Pakistani officials in the area.
Local authorities reported that the missiles were fired from an unmanned aircraft operated by the CIA in the area of illegal indigenous tribes.
These were brought to a white car heading for the Afghan border when it was hit, an official said, along with a Pakistani civilian intelligence agency, who was calling from Miran Shah.
The official said that local militants had rushed to the point and quickly confiscated what was left of the &quot;totally destroyed bodies&quot;.
Local authorities were unable to verify the identities of the victims, but two U.S. counterterrorism officials quoted an unspecified witness as saying that Somali had been killed.
Somali was cited as a high-ranking al-Qaeda military operations planner who led terrorist group operations outside Afghanistan and Pakistan.
He was involved in conspiracies around the world, said a senior official who did not wish to be named, citing the sensitive nature of US air strikes on Pakistan.
If he held such a central position, he was probably involved in attacks on the United States and Europe.
He received instructions from al-Qaeda&#39;s top leadership and planned possible terrorist attacks.
Another US official said Somali was advancing rapidly in the al-Qaeda hierarchy and was well connected to other extremist groups in the region.
He may not have been a well-known person to some Americans, but he didn&#39;t humble himself in any way to pose in front of us and our allies, another official said.
When his death was confirmed, Somali should be the second high-ranking al-Qaeda or Taliban leader to be killed from September, when Najmudin Jalolov, the leader of a militant faction in the tribal tribe zone, and three other top poperative leaders were killed in a similar attack.
The rate of attacks launched by the CIA using drones has dropped from an average of about six operations a month to two since the summer, according to Long War, a non-profit-based website.
The reduction may be due to improved tactics by terrorist groups, which have taken steps to reduce their vulnerability by also ruthlessly killing people suspected of being informants, the site said.
The United Nations&#39; top delegate in Kabul resigned.
The United Nations&#39; top delegate to Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said on Friday that he would like to resign in March, ending a tumultuous term marred by allegations of widespread corruption in the UN-backed presidential election in Afghanistan.
Eide&#39;s departure is happening because the Obama administration has decided to send another 30,000 US troops to Afghanistan.
The UN delegate said he supported the increase, but expressed concern that the US timetable for the reduction, which begins in 18 months, should be a challenge for other NATO governments to withdraw their forces.
We need to speed up the building of Afghan security forces and send the right signal to Afghans to trust the international community, Eide said in a telephone interview from Kabul.
The commitment made must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also pressured the United States and other military forces to increase the number of international civilian staff assisting in the political transformation of Afghanistan.
The increase on the part of the armed forces must be copied on the side of civilians, he said.
Eide said he was not resigning, but that he was just keeping a promise he made to his family in March 2008 that he would only spend two years in Kabul.
He said he wanted to report to the UN.
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has now said he would need time to find a replacement.
Like I said, it&#39;s high time to look for a successor, Eide said.
When I came here, there was a two-month vacuum between my predecessor&#39;s departure and my arrival.
According to UN officials, Ban has begun looking for a replacement.
Officials said a decision was made between Staffan di Mistura, who was of Swedish-Italian descent and had previously led a UN mission in Baghdad, and Jean-Maria Guéhenn, a Frenchman who had previously led UN peacekeeping operations.
Eide&#39;s position in Afghanistan was tested after his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, who was indicted in September by President Hamid Karzai, who won the country&#39;s presidential election by masking the presence of massive electoral machinations.
Eide denied the allegations, but said allegations that Galgraith - who had been released - &quot;certainly damaged the mission because there was a high degree of skepticism about international intervention&quot; in the election.
Eide said he had proposed a meeting with the top deputy to coordinate relief efforts with US leadership in Afghanistan.
He also urged the UN leadership to allow his successor to hire more staff from the United States and other Western countries to lend them to the Afghan mission, because he said he wanted to boost their confidence that their money was being used properly.
Eide expressed disappointment at the limitation of its efforts in Afghanistan, saying that cumbersome UN recruitment regulations were undermining its ability to use its capabilities.
The UN rules are such that I have had the opportunity to get only one person since May, he said.
This is a disaster and I cannot continue.
Gates: Iran faces further sanctions
Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said on Friday that world powers would soon impose &quot;further significant sanctions&quot; on Iran over a lack of engagement in talks about its nuclear ambitions.
Gates, who spoke to a group of about 300 US troops in northern Iraq during a week-long trip to war-torn areas in Afghanistan and Iraq, downplayed the prospect of armed action against the Islamic Republic.
This is not a good choice for Iran, he said in response to a soldier&#39;s question about likely developments. ¨
One of the things that depends on me is whether I&#39;ve learned anything from Iraq in the last six years, [it] is the inherent unpredictability of war.
The Obama administration is deciding on a package of sanctions that could affect Iran&#39;s military and political elites, but Gates has signaled that some of these sanctions could also affect ordinary Iranians.
He said the &quot;package of incentives and barriers&quot; would require &quot;to make the Iranian government actually feel less secure with nuclear weapons&quot; because &quot;its people will suffer extremely&quot; from sanctions.
According to Friday&#39;s opinion issued by White House spokesman Robert Gibbs, the administration has warned European leaders in warning that Iran will have serious consequences if it does not bring its nuclear program fully into line with the UN Committee on Nuclear Safety and its oversight body, the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Iran insists that it wants to develop its expertise only for peaceful purposes.
During talks in Geneva on October 1, he indicated that he wanted to return to talks to reduce his nuclear program and agreed to provide a substantial portion of his enriched uranium reserves in exchange for urgently needed reactor fuel to conduct medical research.
The administration advocated such an agreement as a way to build trust between the two parties and to gain time for negotiations.
But since then, Iran seems to be withdrawing from the interim agreements - in part because, the expert said, because the Iraqi leadership is divided on whether to engage with the United States.
Frankly, as far as Iran&#39;s stubbornness towards the international community is concerned with some of the proposals he actually agreed to in early October, I think this has brought the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese, together on a path that is not about terminology of additional sanctions against Iranians. said Gates.
President Obama has set a deadline of 31 December for Iran to respond to the proposals before returning to look for other elections, including monitoring, which Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton once called &quot;degrading sanctions.&quot;
In a statement issued in New York, the Iranian mission to the UN on Thursday condemned what it called &quot;unfounded and unfounded allegations&quot; in front of some members of the Security Committee about Iran&#39;s nuclear activities and said it wanted to continue talks with the United States and five other world powers. &quot;in order to reach an appropriate long - term solution.
Gates, who returned to Washington last Friday, met with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki this morning before flying to an oil-rich Kurdistan region to meet with troops in Kirkuk and Kurdish officials in Irbil.
High tensions remain between the Kurds and the Iraqi Arab majority, mainly over borders, property rights and income distribution.
Gtes urged both sides to reduce the potential for conflict in order to avoid delaying US plans to limit the number of US troops from 115,000 to 50,000 by the end of August.
Gates also sought to allay Kurdish concern about the ongoing depression. Gates quoted US officials as saying to Massoud Barzai, president of the Kurdistan Regional Government, &quot;We want to protect your security, prosperity and autonomy in a united Iraq.
We don&#39;t want to leave you. &quot;
In an aging China, the change of course
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters reading that &quot;Mother Earth is too exhausted to support more children&quot; and &quot;One extra child means one extra grave.&quot;
Then they learned the lesson that when official government positions in Shanghai, alarmed by the low birth rate and aging population in their city, suddenly changed course this summer and began encouraging young couples, their response was immediate and determined: Never.
We have always devoted all our time and energy to just one child.
We didn&#39;t leave anything for others, says Wang, 31, a human resources manager with an 8-month-old son.
China&#39;s more than 30-year policy of having only one child was introduced, creating two generations of only notoriously chubby and pampered children, affectionately nicknamed the &quot;little emperors,&quot; threatening the country&#39;s population crisis.
The average birth rate fell to 1.8 children per couple, compared to six, before the policy came into force, according to the United Nations.
The population distribution, where the population aged 60 and over is forecast to grow rapidly from 16.7 percent of the population in 2020 to 31.1 percent in 2050. This is well above the overall average of around 20 percent.
The imbalance is greater in wealthy coastal cities with a university-educated population, such as Shanghai.
Last year, people aged 60 and over made up almost 22 percent of Shanghai&#39;s registered population, while the birth rate was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, director of the Shanghai City Commission on Population and Family Planning, said many couples must have children to &quot;help reduce the proportion of the aging population and reduce the number of workers in the future.&quot;
He says it&#39;s about &quot;being old doesn&#39;t mean being rich - like in developed countries like Japan or Sweden&quot;.
Gradual calming
As inserted into the country&#39;s constitution in 1978, China&#39;s one-child policy is probably still the most controversial mandate established under the Communist Party.
Couples who violated the policy faced enormous fines - up to three times their annual salary in some areas - and discrimination at work.
Chinese officials have pursued policies that have helped the country prevent critical use of natural resources, while human rights defenders have been condemned in enforcing the policy.
In rural areas, some officials forced pregnant women to have abortions with their second child.
In addition, many couples had to undergo sexist selective abortions, leading to an unnaturally high ratio of men to women.
In recent years, population officials have been progressively more lenient in their stance on one-child policy.
In 2004, they generally allowed more exceptions - including urban dwellers, members of national minorities and cases where men and women were single - and in 2007 mitigated the diction of their hard-line slogans.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at Beijing University&#39;s Population Research Institute, said central government officials had previously debated more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children if one of the partners was an only child.
In June, Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage more births.
Almost overnight, posters urging parents to have only one child were replaced by copies of the ordinance detailing how it would be legitimate to have a second child and how to apply for a permit.
The city administration sent family planning officials and volunteers to meet the couples in their homes and put leaflets under the door.
They also promised to provide emotional and financial counseling for those who chose to have more than one child.
The response was cold, family planning officials said.
Grieving response
Although officials in a rural town near Shanghai have seen an increase in interest from couples who would like to have a second child after the campaign, most urban districts have not reported changes.
For example, the Huinan district with a population of 115,000 still registered four to five cases per month.
Disappointed officials in Shanghai said that despite the campaign, the number of births in the city in 2010 is still expected to be only around 165,000 - slightly higher than in 2009 but lower than in 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the family planning committee in Shanghai&#39;s Caolu district, said financial considerations were probably the main reason people didn&#39;t want more children.
They want to give the best to the first child, he said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said she would like to have two children and be legally allowed.
But like many Chinese who have only insufficient health and life insurance provided by the government.
Without an additional safety net, the choice could be irresponsible.
People in the West misjudge the one-child policy as a controversial legal issue, says Yang, a civil engineer whose wife is in the seventh month of pregnancy in a relationship with her first child.
Yes, we were deprived of the chance to have more than one child.
But the problem is not just in politics.
It&#39;s about money.
Other couples give psychological reasons for hesitation.
Wang, the human resources manager, says they only want one child because she was also an only child: &quot;We were the focus of our families and everyone cared for us.
We were not used to provide care and in fact we did not want to take care of others.
Chen Zijian, 42, who owns a translation company, put it much more openly.
For two-career middle-class parents who have reduced birth rates, he said, being successful means being selfish.
Today&#39;s 20- and 30-year-olds see their parents as the first days of China&#39;s experiment with capitalism and do not want this way of living for themselves, he says.
Just one child places enormous demands on parents&#39; time, he says.
The mother must sacrifice at least two years of her social life.
Then there are the controversial issues of the space - &quot;You need to rebuild your apartment&quot; - and the strategy - &quot;You need to have a resume ready when the child is 9 months old for a good preschool education.
Most of his friends want to settle for one child, Che says, but not for two.
We are the first generation with higher living standards, he says.
We do not want to make too many victims.
The UN group outlined a plan to reduce emissions.
The UN-sponsored climate conference - characterized by far-reaching undisciplined attitudes and reciprocity - focused again on Friday on releasing a document proposing ambitious greenhouse gas reductions over the next 40 years with industrialized nations carrying most of the burden in the near future.
The text, which can provide a basis for a final political agreement on greenhouse gas regulation, highlights the remaining obstacles as well as sheds light on the way forward.
But significant progress has been seen in the negotiations, which took place at the wrong time with more than 100 world leaders coming to Copenhagen next week.
Created by the UN ad hoc working group, this text unobtrusively states how much money rich countries should provide to the poor to deal with global warming in the short and long term.
And it provides a range of choices for key issues, including how to develop and manage emerging economies to reduce their carbon output and what the upper limit of global temperature rise that policymakers will still be able to tolerate should be.
This gives the process a great deal of flexibility, says John Coequyt, chief executive of the Sierra Club in Washington.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who drafted the six-page document, summarized 180 pages of text from the meeting to focus on what the top UN climate official, Yvo de Boer, described as a &quot;big picture&quot;.
It outlines an outline for a possible agreement in which industrialized nations could collectively reduce their emissions to 25 to 45 percent by a year compared to 1990 levels, while major developing countries could reduce their emissions to 15 to 30 percent during this period.
Together, the country would reduce emissions by between 50 and 95 percent by 2050.
The European Union hastily negotiated on Friday a pledge to provide $ 3.6 trillion over the next three years to help poorer countries adapt to climate change - from managing floods and droughts to preventing deforestation.
Still, Friday introduced the same kind of verbal fireworks that prevailed in last week&#39;s interviews.
US Special Envoy for Climate Action Todd Stern rejected a speech calling for binding greenhouse gas emission reductions for industrialized countries compared to voluntaryness in major emerging economies if they were not funded by the developed world.
The shift signaled that the Obama administration had established a tougher line with China for Bush administration officials just two years ago.
The United States will not accede to the treaty without the transfer of major developing countries and action, said Stern, who also complained that the text was not enough to secure restrictions and should be scrutinized by external observers.
Stern made the comment an hour after Chinese Deputy Secretary of State He Yafei told the US chief climate negotiator that either a lack of &quot;common sense&quot; or &quot;extraordinary irresponsibility&quot; led earlier in the week to say that the United States would not help China financially to could deal with global warming.
With the future of the economic trajectories of the world&#39;s major powers at stake, scrambles broke out both within the developing world and between the industrialized world and emerging economies.
The current struggle is mostly to preserve individual economies rather than the planet, between China and the United States to meet their respective commitments, while poorer nations point out that the world&#39;s two dozen most influential countries ignore the scientific imperative to take stronger action.
Ricardo Ulate, a Costa Rican delegate, said it was not surprising that major powers were fighting over who should bear the cost of reducing greenhouse gases, while vulnerable countries became much more aggressive in finding a way to prevent large issuers from acting responsibly.
It&#39;s clearly a game that a new economic hegemony is evolving, said Ulate, who also serves as a regional adviser on regional climate change in Mexico and Central America for international nature conservation.
Some of the countries most vulnerable to the effects of climate change have indicated that they would like to continue to push for a legally binding agreement in Copenhagen, but most of the main players said a political agreement would be the best outcome of the talks.
The Alliance of Small Island States, which has 43 members, created a 24-page draft agreement last Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, who led the international climate talks in favor of the European Commission, said the push by small island nations &quot;has caused political pressure on the whole polirt process&quot; partly because they are now united and demanding action from emerging economies such as China and India.
The talks raised new urgency as delegates focused on the fact that they had to resolve most of the remaining contentious issues before the heads of government could reach an agreement.
Senior officials such as India&#39;s Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh and China&#39;s deputy minister got off the planes and walked through the halls of the Bella Center to closed doors of meetings and new conferences so they could set out claims to be assessed next week.
The sheer size of the rally - with 13,000 people moving to and from the convention center every day, guitar activists staged ironic spectacles at night about the countries they thought they sent, and hand-to-hand suggestions were handed over on paper rather than electronically. by mail - controlled by call.
Intensity is only a superstructure: almost all key ministers were present in Copenhagen and previously in the middle of the 60 heads of state.
We have reached high categories, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, said Deputy Minister of Global Policy for International Nature Conservation.
Heavy weights are coming.
Britain&#39;s first train at 140 miles per hour redefined feelings this Monday
at 5:13 on Monday morning, the whistle cut through the darkness to signal the departure of the train, which marked a revolution in traffic in Britain.
The country&#39;s first high-speed passenger train will reach 140 miles per hour and fly from Ashford, Kent to London&#39;s St Pancras, spanning 58 miles in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, the Minister of Transport, then joined Mrs. Kelly Holmes and boarded the first high-speed passenger train outside London.
He hopes that the new service will eventually connect Britain with an international network of fast, reliable trains and connect large agglomerations of Midland, North and Scotland with London.
Neglected stagnant waters should reduce transport times on passenger and commercial journeys, and switching from aircraft and cars to rail could reduce carbon emissions and eliminate road congestion.
Theoretically, the three main political parties have been acquired for this vision.
But the dozens of pounds of pounds needed to build a new national rail network, the inevitable struggle for projects and environmental concerns have now slowed the construction of Britain&#39;s high-speed lines.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company set up in January to provide the government with a feasible study, handed over its report to Lord Adonis on December 30, the Times reported.
She provided him with a detailed route map of the next planned stage of the high-speed network.
A new route to London-West Midland has been proposed within five meters of urban areas and neighborhoods where the impact on the environment could be problematic.
In the open countryside, the final route was planned within 25 m.
HS2 also envisages specifying three options for a large north-speed high-speed network.
Lord Adonis will respond in the spring.
The preferred option is a Y-shaped configuration, where one high-speed line should lead to the West Midland.
The route should be split near Birmingham with one branch running from the Pennines to Manchester and Scotland and the other, leading northeast to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle over Tyne.
One line should lead to Scotland.
&quot;Looks like the most powerful choice has been made,&quot; said the railroad expert.
Once this is done, travel times between London and Edinburgh will be reduced to two hours and 40 minutes.
The first stage, which will not open before 2025, could allow passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes compared to more than one hour in the present.
The proposals should allow trains to run at 2250 miles per hour, making the British network the fastest in Europe.
The initial line is already designed to carry 400 m long trains capable of carrying 1,100 people.
Up to 18 trains could operate every hour on the London - Birmingham line.
This means that the London terminal would be able to handle up to 20,000 passengers per hour if needed.
Due to capital constraints, it is assumed that the existing station would be expanded to accommodate a high-speed network.
Railway industry experts claim that only San Pancras International or Euston offer such potential.
Lord Adonis will announce whether or not he intends to implement this scheme, but extensive public consultation and planning procedures mean that the final decision will not be made before the general election.
Even if it sets the wheels in motion, the net should be built in parts.
Trains should first be put into service not on high-speed lines but on existing lines north of Birmingham and maintain journey times between London and Scotland of more than three hours.
This is seen as a crucial interface for ensuring the transition from aircraft to trains, a landmark for the railway revolution.
Taxpayers paid a £ 75,000 mortgage on the Tory orangery
Alan Duncan, the holder of the Tory front seat in the House of Representatives, was reimbursed by taxpayers for thousands of pounds last year for an orangery he had built in his constituency home.
A prison spokesman for the prison, who was demoted by David Cameron for complaining that MPs were living &quot;on allotment&quot;, increased his mortgage to £ 75,000 to build an oak-paneled extension in his second house in Rutland.
He was allowed to charge a special interest, a total of hundreds of pounds a month, to taxpayers.
The municipal authorities approved the claims in time, so he was not questioned by Sir Thomasen Legg, who inspected membership expenses. Last night, Mr Duncan made his demands &quot;it could have been cleaner or easier.&quot;
Mr Duncan, one of the wealthiest members of parliament, owns two two-story houses in a village in his constituency of Rutland and Melton.
The houses are worth about a million pounds.
The ground floor has a kitchen, living room and dining room, but the tax office has agreed that Mr. Duncan needs more space.
Last year, he added a winter garden to the house, which is planned as an &quot;orangery&quot; in the plans.
Neighbors describe it as a &quot;greenhouse for entertainment and entertainment&quot;.
Mr Duncan was not asked to provide any explanation for the increased loan during the last review by the Municipal Standards and Privileges Committee in the last mortgage settlement.
The committee told him last month that he had broken the rules, after reviewing his spending.
In 2004, Mr Duncan converted the pupil security into a £ 271,406 mortgage from his property in London to a house in his constituency, which he bought in 1991, a year before he became a Member of the House of Commons.
Documents released this week showed that Mr Duncan claimed approximately £ 1,400 a month for a mortgage until March last year.
In April, his demands rose to more than £ 1,800 a month.
The interest in Mr Duncan&#39;s RBS mortgage payments could not change at this time, suggesting that it was all intended to finance a £ 75,000 loan.
The standard variable for RBS mortgage repayments fell in December 2007 from 7.94 percent to 4 percent in March this year, while remaining.
The latest municipal document shows that Mr Duncan continued to claim £ 1,250 a month in May this year.
Mr Duncan left his job as shadow leader of the House in September after a secret correspondent filmed him and said Members must survive &quot;on rations&quot; after the spending scandal.
&quot;Basically it&#39;s nationalized, you have to live on the ration and treat you like ss ** t.&quot;
He said, “I spent money on my garden and entitlement and a small fraction of what was needed.
And I could claim the whole damn share, but I won&#39;t. &quot;
The MP, a millionaire from a former career as an oil trader, was first asked to explain his spending in May, when it turned out that he was claiming thousands of pounds for his garden, before being approved by the tax office, that it &quot;could be considered excessive&quot;.
One of the activists dug a pound-shaped pit in Mr Duncan&#39;s lawn in protest after it was revealed that he had claimed £ 4,000 for three years.
Asked about a mortgage increase last night, Mr. Duncan said, &quot;It was due to a capital increase, which was approved by both the tax office and subsequently Legg.&quot;
He added: &quot;This is not a contentious issue of hiding and zigzagging or breaking the rules or anything else.
It&#39;s an absolutely straight line down, according to the rules, justified and that&#39;s it.
It wouldn&#39;t be possible to be cleaner or easier in many other ways. &quot;
Come and take a close look at the cottage on the Brighton coast with its Advent calendar.
Brighton&#39;s coastal cottages have found a new meaning to life in the winter months as an interactive Advent calendar.
Beyond, an alternative church group that encourages spiritual enjoyment with creativity, invited 24 owners to decorate their cottages for each day in December and to use Christmas cakes as the theme of this decoration.
The event began on December 1, when it allowed visitors to view the last hut from 5.30 pm to 6.30 pm every day, and the bishop&#39;s sandwich and mulled wine provided free of charge.
Selected carols included I Saw Three Ships, O Come, O Come, Emmanuel and The First Noël, where the cottage featured the work of Janetta Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50, a marketing marketing assistant from Hove, is a scholarship-free priest in the Diocese of Chichester and is the leader of Beyond.
He said: &quot;We want to make religion much more important for people in post-Christian society.
&quot;Why, as a church, should we expect people to come to someone else&#39;s old building? I feel that the church should come to people and serve in an awakening way.
&quot;The idea of an Advent calendar in cottages came about as a conversation with some friends over dinner.
Brighton is such a fantastically creative and vibrant place, and we tried to try and present it in a spiritual way. &quot;
Strong mobilization in Copenhagen and in the world against climate change.
Tens of thousands of people took to the streets on Saturday demanding a strong and binding agreement to combat global warming to be adopted at a conference in Copenhagen, demonstrating around the world and in Copenhagen, where police arrested hundreds of people on the occasion.
At least 30,000 people, according to police sources and 100,000, according to organizers, demonstrated in cold weather in the Danish capital on the occasion of the UN climate conference, which aims to adopt an agreement by Friday that could enter into force on 1 January 2013.
Connie Hedegaard, the Danish president of the climate conference, said that the growing global mobilization, as evidenced by current demonstrations, had contributed to making the &quot;political tax&quot; of a possible failure in Copenhagen too high.
According to an AFP journalist, there were incidents in the Danish capital shortly after the parade began, when a group of about 300 protesters, dressed in black, began smashing shop windows with paving stones and hammers.
The riot police immediately intervened strongly.
In total, the police announced the arrest of 600 to 700 people, specifying that they were mainly members of the &quot;Blacks Blocks&quot;, ultra-radical independent groups, which had already manifested themselves in April at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, eastern France.
The Climate Justice Action Coalition (CJA), one of the organizers of the event, condemned the conditions under which hundreds of radicals were arrested &quot;without distinction&quot; and stressed that about a hundred of them were &quot;held in the streets on Saturday night&quot; in handcuffs and sitting. despite the extreme winter.
After leaving Parliament, the procession calmly headed for the Bella Center, where negotiations were taking place.
Protesters stopped about 500 meters from the building without trying to break in.
A podium was set up for the speakers, in front of which a spiritual candlelight meeting took place with the participation of former South African Archbishop of Cape Town Desmond Tutu.
Most of the protesters came by bus and train from major European cities, and in addition to Africans, there were a large number of participants from Asia, including several Chinese and Koreans.
Nearly 3,000 people, mostly dressed in blue cloaks, formed the first rally in Copenhagen in the morning at the call of Friends of the Earth, which wanted to create &quot;blue waves&quot; for a &quot;fair climate&quot;.
Today, we are taking to the streets to demand that the environmental debt be settled in favor of the South, explained Lidy Nacpilová, a Filipino fighter from the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We can no longer say to each other: it&#39;s time for that, said Benin singer Angelique Kidjo.
In Africa, rivers and watercourses are drying up, today we can walk in them, and this has never been possible before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, born in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the movement to fight for another world has moved closer to environmental organizations.
French MEP Jose Bova, one of the figures in the struggle for another world, said he had come to Copenhagen to &quot;link climate and social justice&quot;. &quot;At present, there is no difference between fighting global warming and fighting for another world.&quot;
The first demonstrations began in the Asia-Pacific region, where there are many islands that are particularly sensitive to global warming.
According to the organizers, about 50,000 people took to the streets in Australia.
Several hundred people, mostly students, marched in Manila, wearing red clothes and scarves evoking the importance of solar energy.
In Hong Kong, Jakarta, but also in Canada, several hundred protesters took to the streets demanding strong action against climate change.
In France, hundreds of people took part in protests organized by the &quot;350&quot; movement, mainly in Paris, Marseille (south), Lille (north), Bordeaux (west) and Lyon (east).
Dozens of people gathered in Geneva.
Separatist Abkhazia has elected its president, Georgia denounces it as a &quot;farce&quot;
Abkhazia elected its president on Saturday, about a year after Moscow recognized the pro-Russian separatist territory as independent of Georgia, while Tbilisi declared the move a &quot;farce.&quot;
About 131,000 people were invited to vote in these first elections after the Russian-Georgian war in August 2008 for control of South Ossetia, another former Georgian territory recognized by Russia.
The polling stations closed at 5 pm GMT.
According to officials of the Abkhaz Electoral Commission, attendance a few hours before the polls closed 58%.
The first preliminary results should be announced on the night from Saturday to Sunday.
All five candidates, including incumbent President Sergei Bagapsh, categorically reject the idea of a merger with Georgia, which has condemned the election.
These elections are a farce.
On the other hand, Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili &quot;regrets that Abkhazia has completely fallen into Russian domination,&quot; said its spokesman, Manana Manjgaladze.
Apart from Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela have recognized the independence of the territory, with a population of 216,000, while the rest of the world considers it part of Georgia, which has been illegally occupied by Russian troops.
After secession from Georgia, after the 1992-1993 conflict, which killed several thousand people, Abkhazia is trying to show through elections that it is ready to return to international politics.
This process is one of the stages of our new life, a new era for our independent state, Kvarčija Světlanová, a 54-year-old historian who also admitted that she voted for President Bagapsa, told AFP.
She was one of those who came to vote in the polling station at a school in the capital, Sukhumi, in a beautiful white building with several palm trees at the entrance.
The issue of Russian domination is the main topic of the presidential election in this region on the shores of the Black Sea, which boasts beautiful nature.
Huge billboards with Bagapsh are placed throughout this small country of 216,000, alongside Russian President Dmitry Medvedev and Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
In Gali, in the west of the country, Russian officials who came to oversee the successful election received a warm welcome from district mayor Beslan Arshba.
&quot;We Abkhazians are grateful,&quot; he said during a small ceremony, bearing in mind Moscow&#39;s support and, in particular, its decision to recognize Abkhazia&#39;s independence.
I hope that your country will soon be recognized by the United Nations, said Alexei Ostrovsky, a member of the Russian parliament, who drank a glass of vodka.
The opposition, represented in the election by former vice-president Raul Khadzhimba and two businessmen Zaus Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, has criticized last year&#39;s agreements with Moscow, such as an agreement that allows Russia to control Abkhazia&#39;s rail network for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Bganba, says he supports neither the current government nor the opposition.
An absolute majority of 50% plus one vote is required to win the election.
If none of the candidates achieves this result, the decisive competition must take place within two weeks.
Climate: manifestations in the world, events in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands took to the streets on Saturday calling for a strong and binding agreement to combat global warming to be adopted at a conference in Copenhagen, demonstrating around the world and in Copenhagen, where police arrested about 700 people on the occasion.
At least 30,000 people, according to police sources, and 100,000, according to organizers, demonstrated an afternoon in cold weather in the Danish capital, which will host delegates from 193 countries until December 18, negotiating an agreement that could enter into force on January 1, 2013.
After leaving Parliament, the procession calmly headed for the Bella Center, where negotiations were taking place.
Protesters stopped about 500 meters from the building without trying to break in.
A podium was set up for the speakers, in front of which a spiritual candlelight meeting took place with the participation of former South African Archbishop of Cape Town Desmond Tutu.
According to an AFP journalist, the incidents occurred shortly after the parade left, when a group of several hundred protesters, dressed in black and armed with bricks and hammers, began smashing shop windows.
The riot police immediately surrounded them and intervened without waiting, knocking several demonstrators to the ground.
In total, the police announced the arrest of 600 to 700 people, specifying that they were mainly members of the &quot;Blacks Blocks&quot;, ultra-radical independent groups, which had already manifested themselves in April at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, eastern France.
Late in the afternoon, a police officer in the jaw was injured by a cobblestone and four cars were set on fire near a squat near the incidents, which, according to police sources, resulted in the arrest of about 20 people.
We are focusing on extremist groups, police spokesman Henrik Jakobsen warned as police helicopters flew into the air again.
Most of the protesters who arrived by bus or train from major German cities, London, Amsterdam and Milan, were of European descent.
But there were also a lot of Asians, including a few Chinese and Koreans and / or Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, mostly dressed in blue raincoats, formed the first rally in Copenhagen in the morning at the call of Friends of the Earth, which wanted to create &quot;blue waves&quot; for a &quot;fair climate&quot;.

Geography and history will be strengthened as part of the general grammar school reform, Chatel said.
Minister of Education Luc Chatel said during an interview with JDD magazine on Sunday that the subjects of history and geography will be &quot;strengthened&quot; as part of the reform of general grammar schools, although their teaching will no longer be compulsory in the last year of grammar school with a focus on exact sciences.
Now, all second-year students will have four hours a week, and the same will be the same program in general culture, Chatel confirmed.
According to the minister, &quot;it is necessary to end hypocrisy&quot;, because according to him, specialization S is no longer focused on exact sciences &quot;but&quot; basically the best students are in it &quot;.
The EC and L specializations cannot be a kind of sub-specialization for S, he continues, emphasizing: &quot;I have not heard many historians and intellectuals complain that geography and history are not taught in the last year of vocational grammar schools.&quot;
A Ifop poll published by Humanité on Saturday showed that seven out of ten French people (69%) disagreed with the government&#39;s project to abolish compulsory teaching of history and geography in the GCSE, and many intellectuals and teachers criticized the abolition as left, as well as some members of the right.
The Minister, on the other hand, added that it is &quot;out of the question&quot; to abolish the philosophy in the specialization program S of the graduation year.
At the same time, Luc Chatel defended the reform of teacher education, while 16 organizations (students and unions) called for participation in Tuesday&#39;s mobilization against this project, which they say sacrifices the pedagogical education of future grammar school professors.
As part of Master&#39;s study 2 (M2), they will undergo an entrance examination focused on their field at the beginning of the year and another examination at the end of the year verifying their ability to teach, the minister explained.
They will take part in professional internships during the second year of master&#39;s studies and in the first year they will appear in front of pupils as a professor-intern.
If you add up all the internships that will be offered to you before the admission procedure, you will gain more experience with students, almost 300 hours, he continued.
The minister also announced that he would propose a &quot;personal right to education&quot;, which does not yet exist in national education.
He reaffirmed the project to abolish the school map by 2012.
At the elite École normale supérieure, experts have 15 minutes to convince about the climate.
Fifteen minutes to present the goals of the Copenhagen summit: this is a call announced this morning by Jean Jouzel, Vice-President of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Development (GIEC) at the initiative of the Ecole normale supérieure on Ulm Street.
According to an AFP journalist, Nobel Peace Prize winner Jean Jouzel opened the first of the &quot;Ernest&quot; conferences, a kind of one-day seminar consisting of 15-minute contributions from experts who will be filmed and open to the public.
We wanted to do something that would attract people and give them a greater desire to learn more, explained at the conference 22-year-old Edouard Hannezo, one of the organizers of this seminar, who was named after a fish from a local lake, which the students named .
About twenty contributing experts from individual scientific disciplines were selected and specified that the selection is based on their charisma.
About climate warming &quot;we can talk for hours, but we can also summarize the basic goals in a few minutes,&quot; said Jean Jouzel, AFP, who spoke in front of fifty listeners without pre-prepared notes, using only graphs.
It is part of our scientific work, he stressed, hoping that the audience will recognize that &quot;the Copenhagen conference is based on a very serious scientific foundation.&quot;
The videos shot at these lectures will be posted on the school&#39;s website from 15 December.
The next seminar &quot;Ernest&quot; is scheduled for February and more will follow regularly every two months.
Delays in payments: angry guards in prisons, planned measures
The wardens of prison guards announced a &quot;general mobilization&quot; on Friday, as they demanded that they be paid bonuses and overtime until the Christmas holidays, the payment of which was postponed to January for financial reasons.
Prison FOs (2nd Wards&#39; Unions) have asked staff who will not be on duty to take part in a demonstration on Tuesday morning in front of the prisons and to &quot;block&quot; them and alert them to the &quot;theft of their wages&quot;.
The CGT for Prison Warders (3rd Departments in the Sector) called on them to &quot;convene assemblies in individual prisons and launch a major mobilization&quot;, saying it is &quot;shameful and unacceptable&quot; to &quot;overtime and night work allowances, on Sundays and on holidays &quot;worked in October, were not paid in December.
The first union of guards, the Federal Union of Prison Warders (Ufap / Unsa), &quot;calls for a total mobilization (...) to show dissatisfaction and outrage&quot;.
The Administration Directorate and the Ministry of Justice explain that the number of overtime increased significantly in 2009 and not all of them were included in the financial budget, but they assure that the amounts due will be paid in January.
At the end of the day, the Chancellery said Michèle Alliot-Mario had sent a statement to the ward of prison guards assuring them that the payment would be made next month.
I know about the efforts that prison staff are making to ensure the functioning and modernization of our prison system, the minister writes in her statement.
I have ordered the prison administration to take immediate action so that the situation created by the misjudgment of overtime is never repeated in the future, added Minister Alliot-Mario.
The December salary will therefore be low, with the exception of executives who receive famous bonuses for performing functions and meeting goals, says Ufap / Unsa, and for those &quot;there is always a place in the budget&quot;.
It is simply a scandal, outraged the FO interregional union in Marseille and announced its decision to boycott &quot;all meetings and summons&quot; until further notice.
Workers will not come to work on Sundays or public holidays unless the premiums for these days from October are reimbursed in December, as well as for overtime, there is also a risk of FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne.
At a time when they are giving us more and more work and more tasks without providing us with additional staff, it is sad to allow the lowest-ranking staff to pay for this, says CGT of the prison guards in Bordeaux.
According to unions, the situation is not the same in all regions, some are better off than others.
However, in any case, there is little funding, said Ufap Secretary General Jean-François Forget.
Obama claims to give &quot;better gifts&quot; at Christmas than the ones he receives
US President Barack Obama, who is preparing for his first Christmas with his family at the White House, told the screen &quot;goddess&quot; Oprah Winfrey that when it comes to gifts, he has a simple rule: &quot;I give better gifts than the ones I receive.&quot;
The president and his wife, Michelle, spoke in a special edition of the program, which will be broadcast on ABC on Sunday night, about how they are going to spend the Christmas holidays and the end of the year in their new and prestigious residence.
Even Bo, a small four-legged family companion, gets his share.
Santa Claus also likes Boa, said Michelle Obama, adding that the dog will also &quot;of course&quot; receive a gift, as follows from excerpts from the preliminary broadcast of the show.
And Michelle Obama also objected to her husband&#39;s claim about the quality of the gifts he receives: &quot;Certainly not, I gave you great gifts last year,&quot; she teased the president.
Well, of course, the president was forced to agree, but immediately afterwards he pointed his finger at the first lady&#39;s pearl necklace: &quot;And who gave you this?&quot;
During this one-hour, very relaxed show with the famous presenter, who worked hard to support Barack Obama in his presidential campaign, the Obamas also talked about their most popular gifts they received as children.
Barack Obama introduced a bike with a ten-speed transmission, but also a basketball given to him by his Kenyan father at Christmas, with whom he met only very rarely.
I remember seeing my father come to see us for Christmas and giving me the basketball, the president said.
It wasn&#39;t until long after that that I realized that he had actually given me the ball.
The first lady again remembered the dollhouse.
I had no idea how to organize it all in the house, so I leveled all the furniture along the wall instead of placing it around the fireplace, but I loved the little dollhouse, Michelle Obama recalled.
Johnny Hallyday operated on again, RTL states that he is in artificial sleep
Johnny Hallyday was operated on again in Los Angeles due to &quot;injuries&quot; caused by a major operation he underwent in France, but the situation is &quot;under control&quot; according to his closest, while RTL said the singer was in artificial sleep to avoid pain. and complications.
The 66-year-old rocker was operated on again from Wednesday to Thursday at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles after US doctors found &quot;injuries resulting from surgery&quot; of a herniated disc he underwent in Paris on November 26, his press department told Paris, with the proviso that these lesions required &quot;corrective surgery&quot;.
However, the singer&#39;s press department tried to reassure the public and stated that the situation was &quot;under control&quot; and at the same time announced that a new medical communiqué would be issued within 48 hours at the latest.
According to RTL, which is the main partner of the singer&#39;s last tour, Johnny Hallyday was put into artificial sleep to avoid &quot;pain and complications&quot;.
In 48 hours, when the patient opens his eyes, we will be a little more confident, adds RTL.
The press department, at the request of AFP, did not confirm or comment on this information.
RTL also states that, according to &quot;some sources&quot;, no drain was placed after the first operation in Paris.
Rocker was operated on at the international clinic Parc Monceau due to a protruding disc.
The operation, which had been planned several days in advance, was performed by neurosurgeon Stephan Delajoux, a doctor well known in art circles.
However, the doctor was not available on Thursday to comment on the RTL information.
After the operation, singer Johnny Hallyday was hospitalized at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles on Monday due to an infection that occurred after the operation.
Singer Eddy Mitchell, a close friend of Johnny Hallyday, said on RTL radio on Thursday that his friend was going through a &quot;bad time&quot;, but added that he was not &quot;worried&quot; about the rocker because he was a big &quot;fighter&quot;.
He called me just before he left for Los Angeles, but I told him he was being stupid because spending 12 hours on a plane after such an operation was no fun, Eddy Mitchell said.
On Wednesday evening, the singer&#39;s producer, Jean-Claude Camus, reassured the situation, saying that Johnny Hallyday &quot;responds well to antibiotics&quot; and that the infection was &quot;stopped&quot;.
Mr Camus also said that he had met Laeticia, the singer&#39;s wife, and that he had not noticed any particular concerns.
The singer&#39;s health problems have only multiplied since July, when he was hospitalized for nine days after falling on his yacht.
Two months later, to everyone&#39;s surprise, it was revealed that Johnny Hallyday had been operated on for a &quot;small small bowel tumor&quot; and then for a mild infection.
At the end of September, the singer returned to his long tour &quot;Tower 66&quot;, which is presented as his farewell.
But since then, every one of his health problems has been closely monitored and commented on. Fans and journalists noticed that the singer had difficulty moving on stage.
In mid-November, his team again had to deny the news of a new hospitalization.
Euro-2009 / small pool: the premiere of Bousquet in his favorite discipline
Frenchman Frédérick Bousquet, a three-time medalist at the 2009 World Championships in the big pool, won the title at the 2009 European Championships in the small pool in Istanbul in a discipline he especially likes: 50m freestyle.
On the first day of the championship, on which overalls were last allowed, only three world records were set, although many more were expected.
One of them was overcome by the Hungarian competitor Evelyn Verrasztová in the 200 m medley race and the two remaining men&#39;s relay of Russia in the 4x50 m medley race.
Great grief for Bousquet, who took a liking to the world record in the 50 m freestyle, which he already holds in the big pool (20.94).
In one of the two royal swimming disciplines, 50m freestyle, the 28-year-old Frenchman won with a final time of 20.53 seconds in the final, in which ten swimmers started for the first time instead of the usual eight.
Bousquet defeated Croatian Duje Draganja (20.70) and Russian Sergei Fesikov (20.84), but failed to break the world record (20.30), as he expected.
We can always dream of something better, but I said that if a world record is within my reach, I will try it.
Like Bousquet, almost all swimmers wore overalls made of polyurethane, which will be banned from January 1.
Overalls have helped set 238 world records since February 2008, and their era ends in Istanbul, which was the first to host them in 1999 in the same competition.
The use of overalls this time did not help the German Paul Biedermann, two-time world champion in the large swimming pool in the summer in Rome, who had a world record at his fingertips.
The young swimmer failed to break the record, which holds the 400 meters freestyle (3: 32.77), but still won with the second fastest time of his career (3: 34.55), ahead of Russian rider Nikita Lobintsev (3: 35.75) and Danish Mads Glaesner (3: 36.82)
I didn&#39;t put everything into that race.
I knew I would not break the world record this time, but I managed to defend my title and I fulfilled my task.
Lobintsev will be a serious opponent in the future, Biedermann explained.
USA: A record of a Romanesque sarcophagus belonging to Zola was auctioned for 1.5 million USD
A record of a Romanesque sarcophagus that belonged to none other than the French writer Emil Zol was auctioned for 1.5 million US dollars on Thursday, which is significantly more than estimated, said art dealer Sotheby&#39;s.
The price of this two meter long and 63 cm high faceplate, dating from the third century AD, was estimated at $ 150,000 to $ 250,000.
Marble &quot;representing four Dionysian scenes in elaborate architectural decor, surrounded by satyrs and bakchants is a rare work, there are very few such pieces in the world, perhaps four or five,&quot; Florent Heintz, Vice President of the Auction of Ancient Roman and Egyptian Art at AFP on Tuesday. Sotheby´s.
The work was sold among a hundred others.
The sale is still in progress, but it is probably the most widely used subject, Sotheby&#39;s spokesman Dan Abernethy told AFP.
The fact that Emile Zola bought this marble was discovered a few days ago.
The record was in Rome&#39;s famous collection of the Borg family for almost 300 years and then gradually appeared with French actress Cecile Sorel, who decorated it with a bathtub in her private hotel in Paris and Paul Reynaud, Minister of the Third Republic in France and President of the Council. to the power of Marshal Petain.
It remained shaded there for about fifty years.
Searching the Louvre Museum&#39;s database, Florent Heintz discovered that the plaque was part of the &quot;remains of Emil Zola&quot; opened since 1903, a year after the death of the author &quot;Therese Raquin&quot; and the fresco &quot;Rougon-Macquart&quot;.
Interrupted attempt by President Zelaya to leave Honduras for Mexico.
Mexico ruled on Thursday that the conditions for the transfer of the ousted President of Honduras, Manuel Zelaya, to whom the rebels refused to provide a safe departure, were not met.
After a telephone conversation with President Zelaya that night, all indications so far are that there is no way to carry out this transfer, said Mexican Foreign Minister Patricia Espinosa.
The Mexican government plane, which arrived in El Salvador on Wednesday for President Zelaya and flew back, said a source in the Directorate-General for Migration.
The coup government wanted to force President Zelaya to &quot;resign&quot; and apply for political asylum abroad, only in this way would he be able to leave safely.
But the ousted president rejected these demands because he wanted to go to Mexico as head of exile in exile.
The coup government &quot;experienced another failure when it wanted me to resign (...), they wanted me to resign,&quot; Zelaya told Globo radio on Thursday, often commenting on the political crisis in the Central American country. for five months.
I can stay here for ten years, I have my guitar here, added the ousted president, hidden at the Brazilian embassy in Tegucigalpa for two and a half months and playing a few chords.
The Mexican embassy has asked us to provide a guarantee of safe transportation, but unfortunately we cannot accept this because it does not include an asylum application, the interior minister of the coup government, Oscar Raul Matute, told Honduran radio HRN on Wednesday.
I will not apply for asylum in any country, Manuel Zelaya said in an interview with Caracas-based Telesur.
If I ever leave Honduras, I will leave as president of the Honduran people, he stressed.
Rumors of Zelaya&#39;s departure mobilized supporters of the ousted president on Wednesday, who came to gather around the Brazilian embassy, where the army strengthened protection.
Brazil&#39;s foreign minister, Celso Amorim, has criticized the coup government&#39;s stance.
They thus show their marginal attitude towards international standards, he added.
Zelaya, who became close to Socialist Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, was overthrown on June 28, a day he organized a public consultation in preparation for his re-election against the recommendations of the Supreme Court, the military and Congress.
He returned unexpectedly from exile in Costa Rica on September 21 and took refuge at the Brazilian embassy.
If he came out of there, he would be arrested and held accountable for the crime of &quot;high treason&quot; of which he was accused, according to the coup government.
The coup president Roberto Micheletti managed to hold a presidential election on November 29 to replace President Zelaya.
Porfirio Lobo won the controversial election, recognized by the United States but condemned by Latin American countries such as Venezuela, Argentina and Brazil.
Three days later, Congress voted against President Zelaya&#39;s return to power until the end of his term on January 27.
Wall Street is rising, the US trade balance is encouraging optimism
The New York Stock Exchange rallied on Thursday, and the US trade balance shows a rise in both the United States and its partners: the Dow Jones gained 0.67% and the Nasdaq 0.33%.
According to the final cut-off data, the Dow Jones Industrial Average improved from 68.78 points to 10,405.83 points and the Nasdaq, with technological dominance from 7.13 points to 2,190.06 points.
The Standard &amp; Poor&#39;s 500 Index improved by 0.58% (6.40 points) to 1102.35 points.
We have good news coming from different parts of the economy, commented Lindsey Piegz of FTN Financial.
But we can&#39;t take it too seriously, she added, because the market is focused on &quot;half full glass&quot;.
For Peter Cardillo of Avalon Partners, investors are focusing primarily on US trade balance figures, &quot;which show that activity is improving in the fourth quarter.&quot;
The US trade deficit fell 7.6% in October from $ 32.9 billion in October.
Analysts, on the other hand, expected an increase in the deficit.
There was an increase in both imports and exports.
The big news is the growing volume of trade, especially exports of goods, which is a reflection of the growth of the economies of the main trading partners of the United States, said Christopher Cornell from the research company Economy.com.
However, in the United States, unemployment rose last week against expectations and the number of job seekers reached 474,000.
But over the past four weeks, the average number of new job seekers has dropped &quot;to its lowest this year,&quot; said Scott Marcouiller of Wells Fargo Advisors.
The stock market also declined.
The 10-year treasury yield rose to 3.482% from 3.423% on Tuesday night, and the 30-year yield rose to 4.492% from 4.408% the day before.
Cuba: Hundreds of regime supporters shouted &quot;Ladies in White&quot;
Several hundred supporters of the Cuban regime boasted on Thursday the wives of political prisoners who met in Havana on the occasion of World Human Rights Day and prevented another demonstration at which dozens of dissidents were arrested.
About forty &quot;Ladies in White&quot; wives or close political prisoners were booed right on the street by Raul Castro regime supporters as they marched toward the capital&#39;s center demanding the release of political prisoners, the journalist said.
Away with the Yankees !, &quot;Mercenaries!&quot;, &quot;The streets belong to the revolutionaries!&quot;, &quot;Long live Fidel and Raul!&quot; proponents of the regime chanted dissidents with their fists raised.
The dissidents were eventually escorted by civilian members who came to &quot;ensure safety&quot;.
The day before, there was a similar demonstration in Havana against the &quot;Ladies in White&quot;, but there were no injuries or arrests.
But about 10 dissidents were detained in civilian clothes in Havana&#39;s Vedado district, who were also set to demonstrate on World Human Rights Day on Thursday, an AFP journalist reported.
According to the journalist, the police loaded the dissidents, who were booed by supporters of the government regime, into civilian vehicles using force.
The arrest of dissidents in similar conditions usually takes only a few hours.
The 2005 European Parliament Sakharov Prize winners &quot;Ladies in White&quot; have staged an unauthorized march to &quot;release all, according to dissent, about 200 political prisoners,&quot; said one of their leaders, Laura Pollan, whose husband Héctor Maceda is serving a 20-year prison sentence. .
Mr Maceda is one of a group of 75 Cuban dissidents arrested in March 2003, 53 of whom are still behind bars.
The Cuban authorities consider the opponents to be &quot;mercenaries&quot; or &quot;agents&quot; paid by their archenemy, the United States.
A miracle, Cuban television reported on Thursday a demonstration by government supporters against &quot;opponents of the revolution.&quot;
Cuba, led by the Communist Party and the one-party government policy, is regularly accused by European or American NGOs of disrespecting human rights and freedoms, including freedom of speech.
A madman killed an 80-year-old man with a knife and wounded 5 people in Clichy-la-Garenne.
A madman armed with two knives killed an 80-year-old man and injured five other people in the town of Clichy-la-Garenne (Hauts-de-Seine) during rush hour on Thursday afternoon.
According to preliminary results of the investigation, the attacker at the age of 28 allegedly attacked with two knives and for unknown reasons an eighty-year-old man in or in front of a pharmacy on 85 Boulevard Jean-Jaures, such is the version of the police and witnesses.
A seriously injured old gentleman, born in 1929, died of hospital injuries, according to the Alliance Police Syndicate.
At or before this pharmacy, the attacker then attacked a pregnant woman and her partner.
The husband, around the age of thirty, began to defend himself and was injured.
The first two seriously injured victims were admitted to the same hospital where the 80-year-old died.
The life of the other injured person is in danger, according to police sources, vital authorities were apparently affected.
The pregnant woman is then collapsed and was taken to hospital &quot;in shock,&quot; a police source said.
The armed man, who was apparently under the influence of alcohol or drugs, a police source said, then fled to the street, still on Boulevard Jean Jaurès.
He injured two other people, apparently by accident: a man in his thirties and forties, the other seriously.
How it all happened is not entirely clear, as it all happened in the evening.
He was armed with two butcher knives, which he carried crosswise behind him, said Arnaud Pressé, head of the Alliance syndicate in Hauts-de-Seine.
Several passers-by, including young people, tried to stop and disarm the lunatic, according to testimonies gathered by AFP.
I saw a guy in his thirties in his green jacket.
Three young men tried to catch him.
They did not succeed because he was quite strong, commented Alberto, a waiter from a nearby bar.
A crowd rushed at him, including a city policeman who broke his wrist, he added.
Still on Boulevard Jean-Jaures, at level 61, two city police officers, including their commander, tried to detain the armed man and were injured by fists, a police source said.
The incident took place on one of the main streets in Clichy-la-Garenne, where there are many shops.
Passersby came to tell me that there was an injured person outside.
I went outside and saw a 70-year-old man on the ground, put him in a safe place, and noticed a large wound to his abdomen, Frederic Allione, a 30-year-old pharmacist, told AFP.
Five minutes later, another thirty-year-old arrived who also had stab wounds with a knife.
The man, who did not have identity documents with him, was later arrested by the state police.
The public prosecutor in Nanterre handed the case over to the Hauts-de-Seine Regional Police Investigation Service (SDPJ 92).
The suspected assailant was taken to hospital on Thursday night.
He is in custody and awaiting interrogation.
A police source did not rule out his placement in a psychiatric hospital.
Another police source stated that it took six police officers to manage it at the police station in Clichy, where he was transferred.
He was &quot;completely out of his mind&quot; as &quot;all the lunatics of this type, whose power increases tenfold in action.&quot;
USA: Polansky&#39;s lawyer again calls for an end to the prosecution
Polish-French director Roman Polanski&#39;s lawyer again filed a lawsuit on Thursday in Los Angeles (California, western United States) against his client, who is currently in his Swiss residence because of a moral affair that took place thirty years ago.
Chad Hummel, the lawyer for the director of &quot;Pianist,&quot; has criticized three judges of the Second District Court of Appeal in California for serious mistakes in the 1977 trial.
I demand an end to the prosecution now and now, lawyer Hummel said, adding that from the conduct of the judge who was deciding the case at the time, Laurence Rittenband &quot;had a chill in his back.&quot;
According to him, the judge (who had already died in the meantime) was supposed to negotiate with the public prosecutor before the verdict, who told him that Roman Polanski deserved to go to prison - a serious violation of the rule of law.
Information about this interview appeared in the documentary &quot;Roman Polanski: wanted and desired&quot; (Roman Polanski), from the mouth of the prosecutor himself, David Wells.
But Mr Wells eventually declared in late September that he had &quot;lied&quot; to the author of the document.
In the event that the court refuses to stop the criminal proceedings, Hummel&#39;s lawyer will request a trial in which he will be able to present evidence of his allegations.
The plaintiff reiterated what had already been said in the first state, namely that there would be no serious examination of the request to stop the prosecution until Roman Polanski appeared in court.
The 76-year-old director fled the United States in 1978, before a court ruled on &quot;illegal sexual intercourse&quot; with a 13-year-old minor.
He has never re-entered the United States since.
The deputy prosecutor in Los Angeles, Phyllis Asayama, said Roman Polanski &quot;should be there to attend the trial.&quot;
In this case, do we want to tell not only Roman Polaski, but also other defendants that it is possible to escape? Mrs Asayam asks.
He believes that the director &quot;asks the court for a favor and at the same time despises its authority.&quot;
One in three judges, who now have 90 days to take a decision, also stressed &quot;that there are other alternatives to escape&quot;.
Lawyer Hummel was not alone in calling for an end to Roman Polanski&#39;s prosecution.
The victim&#39;s lawyer, Samantha Geimer, also reiterated her call for an end to the prosecution.
She reminded her client that she could no longer bear the eternal harassment every time Polanski&#39;s case came up, and added: &quot;No one in this room can say that the trial was fair.&quot;
Thirty-two years, that&#39;s enough. &quot;
Roman Polanski was arrested on September 26 in Switzerland by order of the USA
After more than two months behind bars, he was released into house arrest in his cottage in Gstaad, where he is awaiting possible expulsion.
Wall Street ends without direction, hampered by a rising dollar
The New York Stock Exchange closed forward on Friday, the market tossing between better-than-expected indicators and rising dollar prices: the Dow Jones gained + 0.63%, but the Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
According to the final cut-off data, the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced from 65.67 points to 10,471.50 points and the Nasdaq, with technological dominance, left 0.55 points and finished at 2,190.31 points.
The Standard &amp; Poor&#39;s 500 Index rose from 0.37% (4.06 points) to 1,106.41 points.
Frankly, the market is very calm, said Mace Blicksilver of Marblehead Asset Management.
It remains in a narrow range, the volume of trade has decreased greatly and I think it will remain so until the end of the year.
This trend was also confirmed by the publication of better-than-expected economic indicators, which &quot;helped improve market sentiment in terms of the stability of the economic recovery,&quot; summed up analyst Charles Schwab.
In the USA, retail sales increased by 1.3% in November for the second month in a row and much more than expected.
According to a preliminary estimate from the University of Michigan index, US consumer confidence also returned, rising sharply in December to 73.4 from 67.4 in the previous month.
However, the indices were hampered by a new rise in the dollar against the euro, the highest in two months, &quot;pushing down sectors sensitive to the economic situation,&quot; said Owen Fitzpatrick of Deutsche Bank.
Technological stocks are thus losing ground.
The stock market fell.
The yield on state treasures with a 10-year outlook rose to 3.540% from 3.482% on Wednesday night and with a 30-year outlook rose to 4.497% from 4.492% the day before.
Miss World election again in South Africa.
After a month-long journey across South Africa, 112 candidates for the Miss World title on Saturday are about to cross the finish line to achieve their dream: to be elected the most beautiful woman in the world in front of a billion television viewers.
This big celebration of beauty took place in the vicinity of Johannesburg for the second year in a row, and so far five candidates have advanced to the semifinals.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran Acosta from Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo from Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino from Gilbratar and Yanbing Ma from Canada were chosen Miss Sport or Miss Top Model during their stay in Africa.
It was a real whirlwind of events.
It was amazing to visit beautiful cities like Port Elizabeth, Durban or Cape Town.
I&#39;ve seen a lot of things and I have so many experiences !, confided Miss Sierra Leone.
The competition, which is taking place in South Africa for the ninth time, will be broadcast live from Midrand, in the north of Johannesburg, from 5 pm (3 pm World Time).
I could not dream of a more beautiful country in which I put on a crown.
It was a fascinating experience.
I am happy that I was able to experience it twice, confided Miss World Ksenia Sukhin, in the hot southern summer.
For young Russia, her second stay in South Africa was in the spirit of numerous meetings with other candidates and a new discovery of the country and its &quot;breathtaking landscape.&quot;
After a month of performances, rehearsals, press meetings and safaris, Miss now focuses on the competition itself.
Indian Pooja Chopra hopes to follow in the footsteps of Priyanka Chopra, elected in 2000, who is also running in Aishwarya Rai, the 1994 winner who both became Bollywood stars.
Being crowned the most beautiful woman in the world is every woman&#39;s dream, but it&#39;s not just about looks.
We are ambassadors of our countries and I want to return home with a crown, says Miss India with a wide smile.
According to the organizers, the 59th year will be in the spirit of music and dance.
The candidates will present themselves in traditional costumes and, of course, in swimsuits.
The performance will feature Chinese TV presenter Angela Chow, former South African beauty queen Michelle McLean and Miss World Committee chairman Steve Douglas.
South Africa has shown that it can greet the world with a warmth that is difficult to cope with, said Julia Morley, president of the Miss World competition.
As last year, the candidates took part in a safari, visited the famous town of Soweto, this time by bike, and tasted local cuisine.
An extraordinary event was the meeting with South African President Jacob Zuma, who shook their hands.
Unusual for the president, Miss Sierra Leone remarked.
Undoubtedly the most beautiful memory will remain the draw in Cape Town (southwest of the country) for the World Cup, which will take place in June 2010, and which helped the country to support the event a little more.
I could meet people I never dreamed of.
I will definitely return to the 2010 World Cup, says Miss Italy Alice Taticchio with enthusiasm.
According to David&#39;s son, reports of Hallyday&#39;s condition are &quot;very positive.&quot;
News of Johnny Hallyday&#39;s condition is &quot;very positive,&quot; as his son David assured us on his arrival at Los Angeles Airport on Friday, where he arrived to visit his father, who had been hospitalized for several days.
The news is very positive.
It is very strong and everything is going very well, said David Hallyday when he got off the plane, which arrived from Paris shortly after 1 pm local time (9 pm world time)
The singer&#39;s son, who seemed calm, said he would arrive &quot;as soon as possible&quot; at Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles, where Johny Hallyday was admitted on Monday due to a postoperative infection caused by an operation on a protruding intervertebral disc he underwent on November 26 in Paris.
According to a press release, the singer was &quot;put into artificial sleep&quot; in Los Angeles that night for comfort, which is intended to prevent pain and facilitate treatment.
Johnny Hallyday has been put into artificial sleep by doctors at Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles. The hospitalization was due to an infection after surgery for a protruding intervertebral disc performed on November 26 in Paris.
Due to the serious damage caused by this intervention, the singer had to be operated on again from Wednesday to Thursday night.
According to AFP photographer, his wife Laeticia attended a French lyceum school performance in Los Angeles on Friday morning, which is attended by their daughter Jade.
The head of the orthopedic surgery and traumatology department at la Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital, Yves Catoné, announced that he was leaving for the singer in Los Angeles on Monday.
The producer strongly accused Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, a neurosurgeon who operated on the singer on November 26 at the Clinique internationale du parc Monceau in Paris.
They told us it was a massacre.
Los Angeles surgeons said they were outraged, said Camus.
I heard about the possibility of a future lawsuit, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus believes that Johnny Hallyday &quot;went to Los Angeles too quickly with the permission of his Paris surgeon.&quot;
I personally spoke to the doctor by phone and he assured me that this trip is not a problem, which surprised me a lot, because I myself have already suffered from prolapse of the intervertebral disc twice, he added.
A while ago, at the RTL radio station, he stated that the singer apparently left after the Paris operation without a drain, without anything &quot;.
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is very well known in artistic circles.
He operated on actress Maria Trintignant in Vilnius a few days before her death at the clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine, where he worked at the time.
In 2007, he also operated on actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to remove a hematoma caused by a brain hemorrhage.
However, he is also a doctor with a dark reputation, convicted several times in cases of medical malpractice, tax evasion and fraud.
Medical chamber lawyer Olivier Metzner described him as a &quot;unscrupulous man&quot; who is &quot;regularly&quot; summoned before the medical chamber and who cannot be &quot;recommended&quot;.
After several days of silence, Dr Stéphane Delajoux spoke on Friday through his lawyer, David Koubbi.
He announced that the procedure was &quot;absolutely good&quot; and the postoperative examination was &quot;normal&quot;.
The operation was not of a hemorrhagic nature, so the introduction of a drain was not necessary, &quot;he added.
The singer&#39;s health problems have been growing since this summer, and in any case, his next tour seems to be a question mark.
It is clear that the date of resumption of the planned tour on January 8 (In Amiens, ed. Note) seems too close, Camus said.
The UDF raises the tone and calls on the Nouveau Center to stop using their acronym.
The UDF, controlled by MoDemFrançoise Bayrou, responded on Friday to Nouveau Center president Hervé Morino&#39;s attempt to appropriate the acronym for the former Giscard party, saying it could not be used in any media under threat of prosecution.
Hervé Morin publicly announced his intention to appropriate the acronym UDF, saying that François Bayrou did not deserve to bear her legacy after shaking hands with the left.
The Minister of Defense, whose party is a partner of the UMP, planned to confirm this strategy on Saturday before the National Council of the Nouveau Center (NC).
His move was supported by Member of Parliament Hervé de Charetto (formerly U-UMP now NC), who claims ownership of the UDF brand, as he was the first to register it in 2004 with the National Institute of Industrial Property (l&#39;Institut national de la propriété industrielle ).
But on Friday night, a committee of the UDF Association, led by friends of François Bayrou, who do not intend to be expropriated, resigned from his silence and formally requested the minister and deputies to stop using the acronym and return ownership of the trademark, under threat of criminal prosecution.
In recent days, you have raised alarming statements that you will propose to your political movement + take over + the acronym UDF, the association writes in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 committee members, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez by MoDem or Senator Jean Arthuis of the Alliance Centrist.
At the same time, you considered it appropriate to place the name + Nouveau center +, with the slogan + UDF of today +, on your promotional materials and on the welcome website of your movement, the signatories of the letter also state.
As you know, you have no right to use this acronym, explains the UDF committee, which calls on the NC to &quot;immediately remove all mention of the UDF name from all promotional materials, including (its) website.&quot;
At the same time, he asks Hervé de Charette &quot;to transfer ownership of the trademark to legitimate owners&quot;.
If you do not do so, we will turn to the courts to respect the law and the legitimate rights of UDF members, the signatories warn.
In their letter, they state that the UDF &quot;is a full-fledged political movement since 1978&quot; and recall that Mr Morin and his friends &quot;chose to&quot; leave in 2007 &quot;to create a competitive movement, as others did in 2002, to form the UMP.
According to them, the Nouveau center movement therefore has no right to use the abbreviation UDF (Union pour la démocratie française).
At the same time, they recall that the last UDF Congress voted in 2007 to join the MoD for three years and to set up a committee to defend the &quot;moral and material interests&quot; of the association set up by Valéry Giscard d&#39;Estaing.
As for Hervé de Charette, the committee continues, &quot;when he registered the trademark&quot;, he was not &quot;a member of the UDF for three years&quot;, but of the UMP.
He used the acronym&#39;s non-existent registration in a scandalous and fraudulent way to do so on his own account.
This tactlessness begins to turn into a crime, they claim, and then ironically comment on NC&#39;s strategy: &quot;It seems to us that in both politics and everyday life it is more valuable to make a name for yourself than to stand out from anonymity by fraudulent acceptance. names to which we have no right &quot;.
The case of Liliana Bettencourt: François-Marie Banier will be tried for abusing a state of weakness.
A court in Nanterre decided on Friday to judge artist Françoise-Marie Banier and rule on whether he had used the state of weakness of the 80-year-old billionaire to deprive her of part of her fortune, which her daughter Liliane Bettencourt blames.
A photographer (62 years old) known for his photographs of celebrities will be tried on April 15 and 16, 2010 for abuse of a state of weakness, a crime punishable by a maximum of 3 years and a fine of € 375,000.
This decision confirms that the trial will actually take place in a case that can be described as the family saga of one of the richest families in France, in which a mother and daughter attack each other and fight for the management of the cosmetic empire L&#39;Oréal.
However, the 15th Criminal Court also ordered a medical examination of 87-year-old Liliana Bettencourt, which should be performed by a college of three doctors.
L&#39;Oréal&#39;s heiress and major shareholder has always refused to undergo such an examination, certainly not under the conditions offered by the Nanterre Public Prosecutor&#39;s Office during the investigation.
The doctors, who will be elected on Friday, should report by March 10, 2010, at the same time commenting on whether Liliana Bettencourt may have been in a state of weakness and at what time.
I think he will undergo it.
I will talk to her about this, said Georges Kiejman, Bettencourt&#39;s lawyer, after the hearing.
As for François Bettencourt-Meyers&#39; lawyer, Olivier Metzner, he welcomed the court&#39;s decision.
This is great news (...). Expertise shows that he manipulated this old lady who needs protection (M. Banier), he confirmed.
It has been two years since Liliana Bettencourt&#39;s only daughter filed criminal proceedings against François-Marie Banier, a photographer and all-rounder accused of exploiting her mother&#39;s weakness for many years to donate a billion euros in checks, life insurance contracts or master paintings. .
Liliane Bettencourt, on the other hand, has always refused to be manipulated by a photographer whom she considers a longtime friend.
While the court had to assess the legitimacy of the lawsuit filed by Mrs. Bettencourt-Meyers, Friday&#39;s court speech at times turned into a family hour of truth.
Liliana Bettencourt&#39;s lawyer submitted three letters sent by his client (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) to her notary, in which she expressed her distrust of François Bettencourt-Meyers&#39; husband.
In a 2003 letter, Liliane Bettencourt adds, according to the lawyer,: &quot;Could you explain to my daughter that I wrote to Banier once or twice a day for fifteen years.
I have never been able to talk to Françoise since she got married. &quot;
The Nanterre Public Prosecutor&#39;s Office again found that the applicant&#39;s conduct was unjustified, all the more so as the guardian&#39;s judge had recently rejected her request to initiate legal proceedings for her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt &quot;is fully able to participate in court, she is not even under guardianship.
No one else will act on her behalf, &quot;confirmed the prosecutor&#39;s office, Marie-Christine Daubigney.
The court finally ruled that she would rule on Ms Bettencourt-Meyers&#39; legitimacy at the time the trial began.
The managerial revolution or the end of economic intelligence?
If nothing changes in the management of large French companies, our struggle for the development of economic intelligence was useless…
For more than a decade, the behavior of large companies &#39;management towards employees has been reminiscent of companies&#39; approach to consumers before the marketing revolution: it is about co-workers identifying with the &quot;values&quot; set out above, as was the case when consumers had to be forced to develop products. from the ideas of the heads of factory technicians.
By making the customer the center of business, the marketing revolution has leveled the strategy of conquering the market in the right direction ... although authoritarian efforts to impose products other than customer preferences are regularly returning!
Passive attitudes of employees can lead to deadly demoralization.
Suicides at France Telecom, PSA or Renault are just a visible part of a much more widespread general phenomenon, affecting mainly managerial staff.
This demobilization adversely affects the development of all intellectual functions of society, including research and development and, more importantly, economic intelligence.
Indeed, EI &quot;requires from all stakeholders (...) an active approach and the ability to anticipate&quot; and requires from employees commitments that are completely at odds with the income of authoritarian management.
That is why we call for a managerial revolution, which should aim to put employees at the center of the company&#39;s attention as well as the client.
Relative usefulness of internal opinion polls.
Will internal opinion polls - like a questionnaire presented to Orange employees - contribute to a revolution in management practices?
Unfortunately, I&#39;m afraid not.
Mainly because I have already convinced myself that in the face of a new situation, the structure will return to what it has always been doing after various turns!
Furthermore, because authoritarianism, as one of the pathologies of power, increases in proportion to the severity of one&#39;s own failures.
And finally, because most managers have a simplistic view of human behavior.
Because they are graduates of colleges for engineers, they have a mechanical interpretation of psychology.
For the sake of ease of thought, they are adopting an old behavioral theory, currently revived by &quot;neuroscience&quot; from the United States and widely disseminated without much knowledge by scientific institutes and the media.
A recent Ipsos survey on Figaro.fr has shown that it is possible to move the &quot;sic&quot; involvement of managers, which only confirms managers in their position of mechanical steering, unsuitable for today&#39;s world.
Identify and measure mobilization factors.
On the contrary, the managerial revolution necessary for the proper functioning of modern enterprises presupposes the adoption of the ultimate vision of human behavior.
It consists in incorporating a basic observation into all management intentions and practices: Commitments to the company will only be possible for employees if they appear to be a clear means of achieving their dreams, ambitions and projects.
Currently, only studies of Motivational Functional Analysis deal with this concept of employee motivation.
These studies have shown that they evaluate their companies on the basis of a predetermined doxy that allows them, through the image that tells about the company, to evaluate what it offers them to realize their life goals.
By identifying and measuring these mobilization factors, managers can control, anticipate and anticipate their &quot;social performance&quot; and put their human resource management &quot;on track.
This creates a breeding ground for the development of solid and effective economic intelligence.
With a speech from Oslo: &quot;just war&quot;, Obama earned praise from the right.
The American right on Friday welcomed a speech delivered by Barack Obama in Oslo the day before, pleased that the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize winner was defending the concept of a &quot;just war&quot; against US enemies.
Conservatives who initially ridiculed the Obama Award on October 9 applauded the presidential speech, including Sarah Palin, a former candidate for vice president in the 2008 election.
I liked what he said, Palin, the muse of the right-wing Republican wing, told USA Today, adding that she herself had commented on the subject of the &quot;sometimes necessary&quot; war in her forthcoming memoirs.
War is, of course, the last thing Americans want to have at work, but it is necessary.
All terrorists need to be detained there, he believes.
President Obama, who inherited two wars in Afghanistan and Iraq from his predecessor, George W. Bush, justified the deployment of forces in Oslo on Thursday and used a speech to clarify his decision to send another 30,000 troops to Afghanistan nine days earlier.
Another Obama opponent, Newt Gingrich, said the president had done a &quot;very good job&quot; in Oslo.
I think that the speech was really very good, congratulated the former Speaker of the House of Representatives, who especially appreciated the President&#39;s mention of &quot;the existence of evil in the world&quot;.
In a way, I considered the speech to be completely historic, Gingrich said during an interview on &quot;The Takeaway&quot; radio show.
The former MP, considered by some to be a possible Republican candidate in the 2012 presidential election, was thrilled to see the &quot;left-wing president&quot; remind members of the Nobel Prize committee &quot;that they themselves would not be free and could not pass the peace prize if they used force. did not exist &quot;.
According to Michael Gerson, former speech author George W. Bush, now editor of the Washington Post, Obama delivered a &quot;very American speech.&quot;
Not only did he introduce himself as a &quot;world citizen&quot; as always, but he &quot;spoke like an American president&quot; and reminded Europeans &quot;that they live in a safe bubble that they did not create themselves and that they do not do much to preserve it,&quot; Gerson said.
Among the few dissidents on the right are the Bush-era hawk, former UN ambassador to John Bolton, who described the speech as &quot;monotonous, bloated and uninspired,&quot; he said on the National Review Online website.
To the left of the president, for example, Democratic Representative Dennis Kucinich is horrified to see Barack Obama justify the use of force.
&quot;If we wrap the war in justice, we can easily justify the massacre of innocent people,&quot; he warned.
However, the center-left press has praised the president.
Although the Los Angeles Times continues to consider the award of the Obama Peace Prize premature, it has praised his performance as &quot;outperforming,&quot; even for a speaker known for his talent.
The Oslo speech should serve as a guide to international decisions in conflict resolution, in the fight against poverty and oppression, &quot;the California daily said passionately.
Obama &quot;delivered the speech he needed,&quot; the New York Times said, calling the speech &quot;simple and instructive.&quot;
Road hauliers: three marathons to an agreement that will save the supply of supplies for Christmas.
After three negotiating marathons, the road unions and the TLF, the only employers&#39; organization left until the end, reached an agreement on Friday night that ended the call for a strike and the threat that hung over the supply of supplies for Christmas.
Secretary of State for Transport Dominique Bussereau expressed &quot;joy&quot; at the signing of the agreement on Friday, after several negotiations that began on Wednesday morning.
After the second night of discussions, the negotiators broke up early Friday morning in the hope that the text of the agreement would be signed as soon as possible at the end of the morning.
This was despite the fact that three employers&#39; organizations (FNTR, Unostra, OTRE) withdrew from the negotiations.
But it took more than six hours of the meeting, which started at 11 a.m., to get everyone to agree and sign the deal at 6 p.m.
The conflict &quot;would do a great deal of damage to businesses&quot; and &quot;risk ending the holidays at the end of the year,&quot; Bussereau said.
The text includes a 4% wage increase for the lowest wages (for local and regional road transport) and a 2.9% increase for the highest wages (international transport).
The hourly wage at the lowest wages increases from 8.72 euros to 9.06.
It&#39;s not much, but there is a lot of effort behind it, explained Patrice Clos (FO).
Tonight we will order our members to avoid blockades, no supply center blockades.
But there may be a few more opponents who are not satisfied, &quot;he added.
Philippe Grillot, president of the TLF, welcomed the &quot;right deal&quot;, although it was difficult to acknowledge the increase in high salaries due to international competition. &quot;
According to him, there will be an increase of 170 euros per month for the lowest wages and 100 to 120 euros for the highest ones.
It is an agreement of common sense and respect for employees, said CMaxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) welcomed the &quot;historic agreement&quot;.
According to Richard Jaubert (CGT), this is an &quot;acceptable compromise&quot;.
The agreement also envisages a revaluation of travel expenditure of 3% and a report on the state of road transport in the first half of 2010, which will also make it possible to focus on the issue of the 13th salary and modernize the collective agreement.
Bussereau recalled the &quot;reduction of EUR 100 million in corporate payroll taxes&quot; which was the subject of a government amendment to the 2009 budget bill, which was voted on by the National Assembly on Thursday night from Friday to Friday.
The government will ask the Senate for an &quot;identical&quot; vote.
The signature allows this agreement to apply first to companies that are members of this organization, later to the entire industry, in the event of an extension by the Ministry of Labor.
It will take place &quot;as soon as possible,&quot; Bussereau assured.
Only the disapproval of employers&#39; organizations can slow down the whole process.
The FNTR speaks of &quot;bad business&quot; as € 100 million &quot;has already been offered to the sector to offset part of the carbon tax&quot;.
The Secretary of State for Transport forced us to act in an emergency, not as a result of mutual analysis, but in order not to anger turkey eaters during the approaching Christmas holidays, Unostra complained.
For Otre, the agreement threatens to &quot;bury a large number of small and medium-sized enterprises in the industry&quot; in the next 12 months.
RER A suburban trains: interruption of traffic on weekends, unions dissatisfied with the proposals of the RATP transport company.
The disruption of the RER A commuter train, France&#39;s largest public transport line, will continue over the weekend, as Friday&#39;s negotiations between the unions and RATP management on the second day of the strike did not lead to any concrete results on the premium application.
On Saturday and Sunday, the days of an important shopping weekend before Christmas, trains will run only between 10 am and 8 pm, on the main section (between La Défence and Nation) every other train will run, except for this section only one in four trains.
The connection with the SNCF will be interrupted at the Nanterre Préfecture and passengers will be forced to change trains.
Galeries Lafayette department stores, which expect more than 200,000 customers every day, welcomed the fact that &quot;RATP has sought to connect with large department stores.&quot;
The RER A line runs from west to east of the Paris agglomeration.
The section administered by the RATP runs from Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre to Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, one of the two trains was in operation at peak times and virtually no train was running during off-peak hours, as planned.
As on Thursday, the inhabitants of Ile de France arranged differently and there was no confusion on the platforms.
So early in the morning, there were far fewer people than usual at Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) station, partly because of the lack of pupils and students.
Jack Nbakina, an engineer, 29 years old from Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), explained that he got up &quot;an hour and a half earlier to make sure he arrived on time.&quot;
Saint-Lazare station was not overcrowded, the SNCF state railway announced, as a larger number of orderly and law enforcement officers were predicted.
Suburban RER A trains operated by SNCF in the direction from or to Cergy-Le-Haut arrived or departed from Saint-Lazare station with connection to the metro.
Further strike general meetings will be held on Saturday and Sunday to assess the results of Friday afternoon&#39;s meeting with management, which the unions rated as &quot;weak&quot;.
The RER management proposes negotiations on a special protocol for RER A commuter trains in all respects, working time arrangements, career progression, etc.
However, this is not the case for drivers who demand a well-deserved bonus, according to Thierry Garon (OdboryJih).
RATP has even postponed premium proposals for the time being, which has offended the CGT, saying that management was &quot;unable to solve the problem, while for carriers and SNCF it was possible&quot;.
At the new meeting, scheduled for Monday, &quot;the conditions of the profession will be&quot; examined in more detail &quot;, RATP specified the transport companies.
Which was why the unions thought the company was &quot;making fun of weekend travelers.&quot;
In the morning, about 150 drivers filled the works council at its Paris headquarters.
The leadership, which has so far rejected any discussion during the strike, has therefore decided to meet in the interests of &quot;calming down&quot;.
There is a danger that the conflict will spread to the RER B line on Tuesday, after Unsa and Nezávislí announce a strike alert.
The unions are demanding a premium of between € 120 (Unsa) and € 150, of which € 30 are variable (CGT, FO, CFDT, Sud (South), Indépendants (Independent)) and complain about deteriorating working conditions on this line, which daily will carry a million passengers.
RER suburban train drivers earn between € 2,200 and € 2,700 in gross wages and € 600 to € 650 in bonuses for irregular working hours and for work on Sundays and public holidays.
Turkish justice has dissolved the Kurdish party, and the decision has serious consequences.
The Turkish Constitutional Court on Friday ruled to abolish the country&#39;s main pro-Kurdish party. The decision immediately sparked protests and demonstrations in the Kurdish community in the south-east of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision can greatly complicate the task of the government, which is trying to lend a friendly hand to the Kurdish community and try to end 25 years of conflict.
The Democratic Society Party (DTP) was dissolved because it became &quot;a nest of activities that threaten the independence of the state and its indivisible unity,&quot; Supreme Court President Hasim Kilic told reporters after four days of talks.
The decision was taken unanimously by 11 judges, requiring a seven-majority majority to dissolve the party, Kiliç said, adding that 37 party cadres, including its president Ahmet Türk and MP Aysela Tugluk, were banned from participating in political life for five years.
The judge also announced the lifting of the parliamentary immunity enjoyed by Mr Türk and Ms Tugluk and the confiscation of the party&#39;s assets by the Ministry of Finance.
The DTP has 21 seats in Parliament (out of 500).
Even before the verdict, the party leadership pointed out that deputies would rather leave Parliament than act as non-political deputies.
The decision is a follow-up to a 2007 trial by Abdurrahman Yalcinkay, the prosecutor of the Court of Cassation, who accuses the DTP of obeying the &quot;orders&quot; of the Kurdistan Workers&#39; Party (PKK), which Ankara and many countries consider a terrorist organization.
Many observers believe that the DTP is a legal political showcase for the PKK rebels.
The party assures it that it has no &quot;basic connection&quot; with the PKK, but refuses to label it a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate with it.
The court&#39;s verdict comes at a time when the government is giving a friendly hand to the Kurdish community, offering a series of measures to strengthen their rights and trying to reduce Kurdish support for the PKK and end the conflict.
The DTP leadership confirmed that the dissolution of the party could lead to renewed tensions in southeastern Anatolia, where many demonstrations against the conditions under which PKK leader Abdullah Öcalan is being held in clashes with police have collapsed in recent weeks.
Since the announcement of the justice decision, thousands of protesters have gathered in front of the DTP headquarters in Diyarbakir, a large city in the southeast inhabited mainly by Kurds.
Police used tear gas grenades and water cannons, while protesters threw Molotov cocktails or fired slingshot stones.
About a hundred people also demonstrated in Istanbul.
After the verdict, Mr. Türk said that the decision of justice would only &quot;deepen despair&quot;.
Turkey cannot solve this issue by banning the party, the press said.
The government, made up of a party from the Islamist movement, also condemned the decision.
We are fundamentally against party interference.
It doesn&#39;t solve anything, said Energy Minister Taner Yildiz.
This decision is a complete blow to the democratic proposals launched by the government, commented political scientist Ahmet Insel.
Of course, we can expect a response from the PKK, he added.
On Thursday, the PKK claimed responsibility for one of the deadliest attacks in northern Turkey, which killed seven soldiers three days earlier.
Snow can come
Pretty crunchy winter, that&#39;s what Wolfgang Brauburger wants.
Not because he wants to bully citizens, says the head of the winter department of technical services FES.
But so that his employees could try and learn to control all vehicle technology.
According to meteorologists, this could happen for the first time this weekend.
More than 300 employees and 120 vehicles are ready to take care of the snow and ice.
The FES is following a precise plan.
As soon as it snows in Frankfurt and the temperatures drop below zero, they go to 20 so-called sections A of the large spreader, explains Brauburger.
These sections include major and transit routes such as the Neue Weg and Hanauer Landstraße.
But also arrivals for firefighters, suburban public transport lines, pedestrian zones and sections with descents such as Atzelbergstraße.
The FES service starts at three o&#39;clock in the morning.
If necessary, it is necessary to sprinkle with moist salt, which holds better, for a maximum of three hours, something around 1040 kilometers.
That&#39;s why the FES starts at three o&#39;clock at night, &quot;so that the roads are clear when the transport to work starts&quot;.
It is difficult when it starts to snow only at 7.30.
Then we have a problem, says the head of the winter technical services department, &quot;because no one is willing to make the spreaders a place.&quot;
Only when it is not snowing so much, it is the turn of the access and interconnection roads, which also include Rat-Beil-Straße.
Side and side roads have the last priority.
Brauburger knows they will complain there.
At five o&#39;clock in the morning, FES infantry set out on a journey, preferably dangerous places and crossings are cleaned.
FES usually cannot take care of all bike paths.
There is a special service in Frankfurt that monitors bridges from 10 pm to 4.30 am, says Brauburger.
As an iceberg forms quickly on them, the spreaders start moving out as soon as the temperature drops below two degrees.
If necessary, they will also be called by the police.
Cradle of dinosaurs
Tawa hallae looked like many other carnivorous dinosaurs: The animal, two meters long and 1.50 meters high, ran on two strong hind limbs, had an elongated skull with sharp, curved teeth, short forelegs with sickle claws and a long tail.
If this species lived a few million years later, there would be nothing extraordinary.
Sterling Nesbitt of the University of Texas at Austin and colleagues write in Thursday&#39;s issue of the journal Science that Tawa hallae was one of the first dinosaurs to have these physical traits.
The animal lived about 215 million years ago in present-day New Mexico, which was then located in the equatorial arid region of the Pangea supercontinent.
Tawa opens a new window to the earlier evolution of dinosaurs, says Nesbitt.
It shows us a lot about the kinship, distribution and features of early dinosaurs.
In 2006, Nesbitt and other paleontologists began excavations at Ghost Ranch in northern New Mexico.
Sometimes we found a dozen dinosaur bones in one day, unprecedented for Triassic sediments, according to team member Randall Irmis of the Museum of Natural History in Utah.
Some of the bones were quickly identified by scientists as a new species.
During the excavations, they collected the remains of a total of five individuals.
The finding is confirmed by theories about the early history of dinosaurs.
The name &quot;Tawa&quot; comes from the sun god of the Hopi Indians.
This is an unusual finding for Sterling Nesbitt: &quot;Triassic dinosaur fossils are very rare, usually only single fragments can be found.&quot;
Other dinosaur experts do not share this enthusiasm without reservation.
This finding is not particularly sensational, but it confirms some theories about the early history of dinosaurs, says Martin Sander from the University of Bonn.
According to current scientific opinion, dinosaurs first appeared about 230 million years ago.
However, many of the oldest fossils are not complete, so the assignment of pradinosaurs is usually controversial.
Experts discuss, for example, when lizards split into three most important lineages: carnivorous theropods, which later included Tyranosaurus rex, Velociraptor, as well as birds, &quot;long-necked&quot; four-legged sauropods and their relatives, and the herbivores Ornithischia (bird&#39;s-footed gulls), which included for example Triceratops and Stegosaurus species.
Tawa hallae is, after the analysis of Nesbitt and his colleagues, the original therapod.
It has an interesting combination of primitive and advanced qualities, says Nesbitt.
On the skull of Tawa hallae, researchers found, for example, evidence of air sacs that even the descendants of theropods have birds.
Thanks to air bags, the breathing of birds is more efficient than that of mammals.
In Tawa hallae, the bones of the spine were apparently partially filled with air.
Tawa is the oldest and most primitive teropod with air bags, says Randall Irmis.
As a related line of giant sauropods later also had air sacs and light bones, this useful innovation probably already formed a common ancestor between the two groups.
At least three waves of migration to North America
Because the most primitive dinosaurs known to date lived in South America, scientists concluded that lizards first appeared there.
According to this, the three lines of development soon split and spread from South America to all continents, which at the time, as the Pangea supercontinent, formed a uniform land mass.
The fact that the team, together with Tawa hallae, found the remains of two other, not particularly closely related theropods, would also support this.
The three cannot come from one common, immigrant ancestor, scientists argue.
We believe there have been at least three waves of migration to North America, says Alan Turner of the American Museum of Natural History in New York, co-author of the scientific study.
Of course, there are also contradictions.
One even older species, Silesaurus, which belongs to the group of the heaviest dinosaurs, lived in today&#39;s Poland, says Bonn paleontologist Martin Sander.
His assumption could put together a distorted picture, because many primitive dinosaur fossils have been preserved in South America, and are rarely found on other continents.
As dinosaurs have shown that they evolved from a relatively rare lineage of the genus of reptiles to the ruling vertebrates on earth in the Middle Ages remains an enigma.
During the Triassic, dinosaurs shared their habitat with many other reptiles, such as the ancestors of today&#39;s crocodiles and flying lizards and countless other lizards.
Around the end of the Triassic, dinosaurs spread throughout the world and many new species evolved, while relatives became extinct and the Triassic-Jurassic interface.
The success story did not last forever
There are two hypotheses to explain this change, says Martin Sander.
There may have been a mass extinction that the dinosaurs accidentally survived, but the reptiles did not.
Or the dinosaurs adapted better so they could squeeze out the competition.
In any case, the success story did not last forever.
150 million years later, a meteorite impact helped another group of animals, which also evolved into the Triassic and have lived in the shadows ever since: mammals.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and the signatories are international.
The list includes professors of the University of Toronto, the University of Cambridge, the University of Vienna or Berkeley in California.
Associate professors from Naples, Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin and Bremen joined.
The police evacuation of the occupied casino of Frankfurt&#39;s Goethe University has caused a worldwide stir.
278 professors and teachers at Goethe University, as well as universities across Germany, Europe and North and South America, are in solidarity with protesting students on the Westend campus.
In a statement written in German and English, they did not &quot;approve&quot; the police intervention initiated by the Presidium.
Because the walls and works of art were smeared, University President Werner Müller-Estler had the building, which was occupied last week by striking students and lecturers, vacated.
Five students were injured.
The damage to the case, according to the signatories, does not justify &quot;the violent dissolution of self-organized teaching of students and teachers by the police command.&quot;
Evacuation is an &quot;unacceptable interference&quot; with the freedoms of research and science.
The exclusive focus on vandalism serves to &quot;justify and criminalize the protest&quot; and diverts attention from the content.
The Presidium avoided the necessary discussion.
Speakers call for an end to criminal prosecution.
It is alleged that most of the strikers did not support material damage.
Legitimate protest
The youth of the Verdi trade union and the German trade union also show solidarity with the students.
The protest is a legitimate expression of growing concern for one&#39;s own future, says Alexander Klein, the mysterious Earth Youth Verdi.
The Hessian Minister of Science Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU) is currently defending the procedure of the university president and the police.
We are grateful to the university president.
Destruction and occupation are completely unacceptable means, she said on Thursday at the Aktuellen Stunde (Current Hour) in the Wiesbaden Landtag.
We have an understanding for protest, but we have no understanding for vandalism, said Peter Beuth, a member of the CDU Landtag.
The opposition factions of the SPD, the Greens and Linke saw it differently.
The CDU takes the painted walls as an excuse to criminalize the protest, said Janine Wissler (Linke).
Instead of dealing with the arguments and demands of the students, an evacuation took place.
Linke has filed a motion calling on the Minister of the Interior to report on police deployment.
New Silicon-Valley
For many years it was a secret city, inaccessible to visitors from the west.
Zelenograd, one of the ten districts of the capital Moscow, in the Soviet Union, was a strictly guarded site where secret weapons research was conducted.
Today, this district with 216,000 inhabitants, located 37 kilometers from the center of Moscow, is considered the &quot;Russian Silicon Valley&quot;.
Significant micro- and nanoelectronic research and production centers are located here.
Since September 2008, Zelenograd representatives have established contacts with the Riedberg Science Center in Frankfurt - with the university institutions and companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Center (FIZ).
There were several reciprocal visits and on Wednesday Zelenograd and Ridberg signed a &quot;Protocol on Close Cooperation&quot; in Frankfurt.
The Russian delegation was led by Moscow&#39;s Deputy Mayor Yuri Rosljak and the Prefect of Zelenograd, Anatoly Smirnov, and was signed on behalf of Frankfurt by Edwin Schwarz, Chief Planning Officer.
In 2010, representatives of FIZ and small and medium-sized enterprises engaged in scientific research will go to a seminar in Zelenograd.
Scientific exchange
This is an ongoing scientific exchange.
But it is also about economic relations.
FIZ companies will be able to establish themselves in the growing Russian market.
On the contrary, Russian scientific companies want to get contracts in Germany.
Zelenograd is the seat of major Russian research institutes and companies.
These include, for example, the Moscow Institute of Electronic Technology, large Sitronics concerns and Rossiyskaya Electronics.
The district was founded in 1958 as a so-called &quot;socialist planned city&quot; for weapons research.
Zelenograd (literally translated as &quot;Green City&quot;) got its name from the wooded hilly landscape in which the research facilities are set.
Stuttgart brake
The Stuttgart 21 dimension cannot be sufficiently prepared at all.
For fans of the project, this is simply the &quot;new heart of Europe&quot;.
Good. The S21 is more than the launch of a railway station, more than a monstrous building that plunges the capital of Baden-Württemberg into desperate building chaos for a decade.
Stuttgart 21 originated from the spirit of the 1980s.
The head stations with tracks that ended in the city center were then considered to be transport-technical fossils of the 19th century, which act as brakes of modern rail transport, because it took an enormous amount of time to switch locomotives from back to front.
Drive, stop for a moment, move on - that&#39;s how it should work.
And that&#39;s why the main stations are disappearing: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: the transit station, which lies about halfway along the route of the trans-European railway between Paris and Budapest / Bratislava - hence the slogan about the &quot;heart of Europe&quot;.
It really starts with S21, although the visions of the 80&#39;s are no longer compatible with reality.
The very ambitious designers themselves have learned that in the cities of Hesse and Bavaria, the start of construction is almost inefficient.
Since there are modern shuttle trains with motor and control vehicles at both ends, the main stations no longer have problems with entering and exiting.
Still: It starts with Stuttgart 21, including the new ICE line to Ulm.
It was enforced by provincial and municipal politicians.
The railways cooperate, also because the risks of the largest individual infrastructure project in the country are borne by the taxpayer and not by the state concern.
Urbanistically, the project can be excused in some way.
A new urban space will be created, which - if we believe in the computer images of the designers - will contain a lot of greenery.
S21 is harmful to the rail transport system.
The transit station and the construction of the line are intended for passenger transport, which - typically in the 1980s - has been attributed to a huge increase.
At that time, there was no competition for cheap flights.
However, modern transport policy must first and foremost be about strengthening freight transport, because rail transport is far more environmentally friendly than road freight transport.
But the new line is not suitable for freight trains due to steep climbs.
More importantly, the S21 indirectly affects many other railway projects.
A good six billion euros were to be buried in Swabia.
This is the official number.
Experts consider ten to 15 billion real.
It is clear that funding for additional nodes and bottlenecks in the network will be lacking in the next decade.
There are sixty larger projects on the list of the Ministry of Transport.
One of the most important is the construction of a route about 180 kilometers long through the Rhine Valley.
Since 1987, it has been built on this route at a slower pace.
This would need to be pushed hard.
But the S21 will be like a brake.
The Rhine Valley route will become the neck of a bottle of international freight: right in the heart of Europe.
The government is examining the verdict on the airport
The state government has left open in the Wiesbaden state parliament whether it will oppose the ruling of the Hessen Administrative Court of Justice (VGH) on the ban on night flights and have it revised.
The CDU / FDP coalition has commissioned experts to legally assess more than 400 pages of VGH rulings, said Economy Minister Dieter Posch (FDP).
Today, the VGH in Kassel justified in writing that the state would have to amend the night flight ban in the event of the construction of the planned northwest runway of Frankfurt Airport.
The permit for 17 flights between 11 pm and 5 am, as expected by the provincial government, does not comply with the statutory protection of the population against night air noise.
The coalition must decide by January 4 whether to request a revision of the verdict.
The opposition criticized the postponement and reached out to government officials to refrain from reviewing the Federal Administrative Court in Leipzig.
SPD leader Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel called on the CDU and FDP to return to the promises to ban night flights before the election. Otherwise, it can be considered a &quot;violation of the word&quot;.
It&#39;s damn hard if you can keep your word, said Green leader Tarek Al-Wazir, alluding to the FDP&#39;s election slogan &quot;We keep our word.&quot;
Minister Posch rejected Schäfer-Gümbel&#39;s accusation that the state government is trying to get to its night flights through &quot;distortion of law and tricks&quot;.
Accurate legal control takes time.
The coalition does not want to work on the basis of a &quot;quick first impression&quot;.
We need a realistic decision, said Stefan Müller (FDP).
His faction&#39;s statements banning night flights have never been as opposed.
US banks are repaying aid
American, crisis-stricken big banks are getting rid of state ties.
Bank of America repaid aid from the Tarp bank rescue fund totaling $ 45 billion (around € 30 billion) on Wednesday.
According to a report by the American station CNBC, Citigroup also plans to repay the state aid.
The institutes thus want to get rid of the restrictions that have occurred by accepting money - restrictions on the payment of bonuses to managers and the payment of high fees.
Bank of America has raised $ 19 billion in net money from investors through convertible bonds.
She took the rest of the amount from her cash register, which was filled, among other things, thanks to trade union sales.
Bank chief Kenneth Lewis explicitly thanked the American taxpayer on Wednesday night: The cash injection helped us overcome a difficult time.
The financial institution hurt itself at the height of the financial crisis by taking over the investment bank Merrill Lynch.
Citigroup also wants to free itself from its obligations to the state by raising money on the capital market.
CNBC said, citing sources, the US bank could announce a capital increase of about $ 20 billion on Thursday.
A Citigroup spokesman did not want to comment.
In June, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley repaid the aid.
Quick choice
It went faster than expected.
The station introduced a successor just two weeks after ZDF&#39;s board of directors ousted editor-in-chief Nikolaus Brender.
Last night, the board wanted to agree on that person.
Peter Frey, head of the ZDF studio in the capital city of Berlin, was described as the favorite.
But the station did not confirm this - officially, so as not to overtake the process.
However, the fact that they did not want to harm ZDF intendant Markus Schächter if this proposal did not pass at the board of directors could also play a role.
Frey, Schächter&#39;s candidate, needs the support of nine of the 14 members of the board.
The result of the vote was not known before the deadline for this issue.
Two weeks ago, Schächter failed on the board with his proposal to extend the contract with Nikolaus Brender for another five years.
Only seven members voted for Brender, seven against. Brender&#39;s loss of office was a bitter defeat for Schächter, though it was to be expected.
The EU majority on the board signaled several weeks before the election that it did not want to confirm Brender in office.
Opposition to the editor-in-chief was organized by the Hessian Prime Minister Roland Koch.
He refused to remain in the office of the highly respected editor-in-chief, arguing that under Brender, quotas for watching ZDF news broadcasts had dropped.
Until shortly before the election, therefore, there were protests in which the political influence on ZDF was sharply criticized.
Last time, even 35 constitutional lawyers joined the debate, evaluating Koch&#39;s approach as unconstitutional.
It was useless.
About the person
Peter Frey was born on August 4, 1957 in Bingen.
He studied politics, pedagogy and romance.
He then worked for Südwestfunk and Frankfurter Rundschau.
In 1983, Frey joined ZDF, first in &quot;heute-journal&quot;.
Other stations: 1988 to 1990 personal clerk of the editor-in-chief; 1991/92 Correspondent in Washington; until 1998 head and moderator of &quot;Morgenmagazins&quot;; until 2001 head of ZDF foreign policy; since then head of the ZDF main studio.
After Brender, who was elected Journalist of the Year by the journal Magazin on Wednesday, the Greens announced that they would file a constitutional lawsuit.
Koch&#39;s opponent on the board, Rhineland-Palatinate Prime Minister Kurt Beck, explained last week that the Länder should amend the state agreement with the ZDF so that the intendant&#39;s personnel proposals cannot be blocked by a politically motivated majority.
But Beck also refused to exclude party politicians from ZDF&#39;s supervisory boards.
Brender&#39;s supposed successor, Peter Frey, commanded the board with a clever chess move - immediately after Brender&#39;s removal, he strongly criticized the board for it.
Thanks to this proof of journalistic independence, he was able to nominate him to the position of editor-in-chief without losing face, both Schächter and could be elected by the board of directors without suspecting that the party would be pushed into office.
In party arithmetic, Frey is one of the left-wing liberals anyway.
Studying gets rid of junk
Partial success for students: After a year of strikes, culture ministers finally arrived in the Länder on Thursday: At a conference of culture ministers and university rectors, both sides agreed that there was a will to improve study conditions for bachelors and masters.
Students should be able to manage their studies in the future.
In particular, they agreed to reduce the burden of examinations: In principle, each study module should be completed by a single examination.
In addition, the workload of students should be checked, and a &quot;real and defensible degree&quot; should be guaranteed.
To this end, politicians and universities want to facilitate the recognition of examinations between universities in Germany and abroad.
The Länder undertake to create a more flexible joint structural assignment for bachelor&#39;s and master&#39;s degrees.
Earth&#39;s deviations should cease to exist.
Fewer tests
Since the student protests in the worm began, culture ministers and university rectors have had winged words about better study.
Now, for the first time, they are filled with specific content.
The so-called Accreditation Board has decided that the number of examinations will be reduced drastically in part: &quot;Each module will usually be completed with only one examination,&quot; reads a 30-page report, which is partly to regulate the approval of study fields.
&quot;Significantly lower exam load,&quot; said Reinhold Grimm, chairman of the accreditation board, is intended to &quot;stop the erroneous development that has significantly reduced the complexity of the study.&quot;
To this end, the &quot;complexity of the study&quot; should in the future be the &quot;decisive criterion&quot; in the implementation.
Both the modules and the contents &quot;must be checked hard&quot; so as not to unnecessarily restrict students in their choice
seminars &quot;.
Students should be &quot;entitled to a space that allows and supports their own initiative.&quot;
The rules should apply to the approval of new fields of study, but also to existing fields of study after review.
These need to be &quot;re-accredited&quot; every five years - which means, however, that it will take until 2015 for all fields of study to be re-examined.
This is the responsibility of ten accreditation agencies throughout Germany, which are subject to accreditation boards set up by the Länder.
In October, culture ministers called on the Länder to &quot;forcefully&quot; influence the agencies so that the content of the curriculum was not too large and the examination regime was not strict.
In the individual Länder, universities and colleges have already agreed with the state ministries on appropriate measures.
As the only country so far, Rhineland-Palatinate has promised additional funding for the further development of the Bologna Process.
From the money, universities should primarily pay for consulting programs and study counseling, and strengthen examination and foreign offices.
Countries and universities want to spend ten million euros on this.
At the beginning of 2010, the government wants to submit an amendment to the Higher Education Act to the parliament.
According to her, only one single exam should be needed to complete the study module.
The formation of studies should be even more flexible, in order to guarantee the recognition of examinations from other universities and to facilitate access to the master&#39;s degree.
By the end of next year, the complexity of all fields of study in the country should be checked.
The government and the opposition again argued on Thursday about study conditions in the country.
In addition to the praise, there was also criticism of the resolution.
The Federal Board of Higher Education Groups called on Juso to ensure that education policy-making does not take place &quot;behind closed doors&quot; of ministers and university rectors in the future.
At the latest after the strike, &quot;students should also&quot; speak at least a word &quot;.
Future academics also received support from Margreta Wintermannel, president of the College of University Rectors (HRK): &quot;We need student experience,&quot; she said at a meeting with culture ministers on Thursday, HRK consulted on a joint reform report.
According to the Departments of Education and Science (GEW), the Bonn resolutions did not go far enough: They demand a legal claim that would allow any graduate with a bachelor&#39;s degree access to postgraduate studies.
Secondly, the Länder must ensure that for today&#39;s generation of undergraduate students there are enough places available in tomorrow&#39;s master&#39;s degree programs with the best possible study conditions, said Andreas Keller, a member of the GEW Board of Directors.
The Länder need to employ far more speakers.
However, the ministers of culture did not comment on free access to the master&#39;s programs.
More than a footnote to Herta Müller
Getting to Germany and out is nice, almost no control ... &quot;reads the introductory line of a poem by the poet Werner Söllner, who in this torn language piece deals with the experience of the arrival of a dissident who gained freedom, but at the same time lost his linguistic environment.
Werner Söllner was born in 1951 in Banat, Romania, first as a teacher of German and English in Bucharest and later as a lecturer at a children&#39;s book publishing house, then moved to Frankfurt am Main in 1982.
Söllner has been awarded various literary prizes, in 1993 he lectured on poetry at the legendary Goethe University in Frankfurt, and since 2002 he has been the head of the Hessen Literature Forum at the Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
He caused a considerable extra-literary commotion last Tuesday at a seminar in Munich, which dealt with &quot;German literature in Romania in the mirror and the broken mirror of its security acts.&quot;
Apparently insecure and astonished, Söllner left a statement in which he confessed to his fellow Romanian German writers, including Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak and Helmuth Frauendorfer, as a secret informant of the Romanian secret service Securitate.
Together with some of those present, Söllner won the German Language Prize in 1989.
Attempts to recruit are said to have started inconspicuously, first in 1971.
I am, Söllner continued, &quot;that is, someone who has not resisted enough attempts to intimidate the Securitate.&quot;
The poet Werner Söllner is Walter&#39;s secret agent.
Almost simultaneously with the award of the Nobel Prize to Herta Müller and her unprecedented literary dealing with the mechanisms of dictatorial government, the literary scene, and especially the community of German authors from Romania, is shaken by a case that marks the depths and shame of a political system based on control and spying.
Werner Söllner is not only a perpetrator, at least if it can be said from the current state of knowledge, but he is also a victim.
Secret Agent Walter played a role in the Securitate&#39;s acts, Michael Markel said after Söllner&#39;s confession, referring to Secret Agent Walter&#39;s positive influence on himself.
He &quot;cut&quot; me in all the essential points then, says Markel.
He has a moral obligation to make this remark.
Söllner&#39;s statement in this form and in front of this audience was an unexpected, but absolutely surprising confession of the former dissident and his cooperation with the Romanian secret service.
Herta Müller wrote in July, when she read her own files, 914 pages, that Germany was a pleasant reservation for Securitate spitzs.
Concerns, it can be assumed, they will speculate and in some cases probably know what name is hidden behind the pseudonyms Sorin, Voicu and just Walter.
Unlike in the domestic, in the meantime already very certain inspection of the components of the Stazi, the manipulation of the legacy of the Securitate control is still very diffuse.
In recent years, systematic enlightenment has been thwarted and curtailed.
One of the Birthler&#39;s offices, which reports to the National Council for the Processing of Securitate (CNSAS), was not established until 1999, and the issue of the act has been rather lengthy since then.
Only since 2005 has there been a law governing the administration of the files.
That former members of the Securitate still have great influence in Romania was documented after an Nobel Prize announcement for Herta Müller, in which one of the former heads of the Securitate from Timisoara expressed a negative opinion about the winner.
She is said to have psychosis, after all she was questioned only once.
The humiliation of power has been expressed here in the form of freedom of expression.
Of course, the Söllner case, as in the case of the concealed guilt, is linked to inevitable questions.
Why now? Who was hurt? The special reaction of the listeners to Söllner&#39;s confession expects that the continuation of this chapter will be determined by the desire for knowledge rather than the admission of guilt and shame.
This is more than a footnote to the genesis of the work of Herta Müller, which received the Nobel Prize yesterday.
Saturated deposit of the Champions League
It was as if a clean-dressed salesman had come from a cute Christmas party at which a sporting goods manufacturer was handing sweets as a new VfBr coach, Christian Gross, boarded a quarter of an hour after midnight in a new Mercedes C-Class coach accompanied by an orange-colored sponsor&#39;s bag. ¨
A man with a striking bald spot allowed himself to be driven around a foreign city because of him.
Otherwise he could drive alone - alcohol was not in the game, and drunk with luck, the 55-year-old man was also few.
It was a nice evening, but work will continue tomorrow.
Or it will only begin.
In the words of only three days of engaged Swiss: &quot;Although we reached the round of 16&quot;, namely in the Champions League thanks to a 3: 1 victory over Unirea Urziceni from Romania, &quot;but we must not be dazzled by the success: It will be a brutally hard fight against the descent.&quot;
The &quot;far more important task&quot; is ahead of us on Sunday.
It is important to repeat the performance from Main Class in Mainz even on an ordinary league day.
And to prevent another obvious weakness after three quick goals by Marica (5th), Träsche (8th) and Pogrebnyak (11th).
Draw
The Champions League round of 16 (matches 16/17 + 23/24 February / retaliation 9/10 + 16/17 March) will be drawn on 18 December in Nyon.
The joy of Babbel&#39;s successor&#39;s crackling will therefore be preserved.
Not only with the supposed healer, who gave the uncertain Stuttgart professionals self-confidence, willingness to work and the joy of the game in a short time.
I went to the players and told them to focus on their strengths and encouraged them to be bolder, Gross, the soul healer, explaining such a simple-sounding successful recipe, which, thanks to therapist Babbel, proved no more effective.
He was fanning some magic, Babbel&#39;s follower Jens Lehmann admitted, &quot;when a new impetus comes to football, things sometimes happen that you wouldn&#39;t consider possible.&quot;
And Sami Khedira, who, after a break of many weeks due to injury, became the best player on the field due to his dynamics, tried to describe the &quot;phenomenon&quot; with the proverbial &quot;fresh wind&quot; and the work of a new superior: &quot;He is a man who is radical and requires discipline. .
That&#39;s what we need in the current situation. &quot;
Under Babbel, it was obviously missing.
VfB Stuttgart is not yet saved, warns sports chairman Horst Heldt
But VfB Stuttgart needs more stability.
Like Gross, the players and managers do not want to overestimate the victory against the weakened substitute and completely overloaded defense of the Romanian guest.
They would also win in Glasgow before the ugly awakening came after the 0: 4 defeat in Leverkusen, Khedira thinks.
And sports chairman Horst Heldt reminded that while one goal was reached this season, the other is still a long way off.
We are not behind the water yet.
The fact that Heldt did not celebrate his 40th birthday even after the first domestic victory in three months was caused by weekend events, which came to life in the form of a TV interview with goalkeeper Jens Lehmann just before the start of the match.
There are decisions made by others and not Jens, Heldt replied to Lehmann&#39;s harsh criticism.
He overtook the board with weak leadership and decided to change coach after pressure from adolescent fans.
Even the cancellation of his day off after the matches was described by Lehmann as a sign of the lack of sovereignty and envy.
Lehmann&#39;s statements &quot;formulate pure selfishness,&quot; Heldt replied, announcing consequences for the goalkeeper.
Both people in their forties will probably have no more joy in life.
In any case, they agree with the others that without the work of a deposed coaching team, such a strong and combative performance would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants had a &quot;big share in the success,&quot; Heldt and Lehmann say unanimously - and the man agrees with the plastic bag.
Heavyweight World Championship duel
Passionate duel in Bern: Challenger Kevin Johnson constantly provoked with the words and gestures of world champion Vitali Klitschko.
However, after twelve hard rounds, the Ukrainian defended his heavyweight title by the boxing organization WBC.
The opinion of the judges was unanimous.
Hamburg - Vitaly Klitschko remains the world heavyweight boxing champion.
The 38-year-old WBC champion defeated American Kevin Johnson unanimously in points on Saturday night in Bern (120: 108, 120: 108, 119: 109).
For Klička, this is the third successful defense of the title after his return in October 2008.
Before that, the Ukrainian was twice the world champion of the WBO and WBC.
Unfortunately, it did not turn out as everyone expected.
Kličko improved his balance to 39 victories in 41 professional fights, he was defeated twice due to injuries.
Challenger Johnson was defeated for the first time in the 24th duel.
In front of about 17,000 spectators in the Bern arena, the 2.02-meter-high Kličko led the fight mainly with his left hand.
Eleven centimeters smaller, Johnson, who announced the end of Klitschko&#39;s era before the duel, withdrew before the blows of the world champion, so Klitsch could not deliver a decisive blow with his dangerous right hand.
All in all, Passive Johnson did quite a bit to the challenger and just tried to get to the next round.
Although Klička provoked with words and gestures, his blows rarely hit the world champion.
But even so, he is only the second boxer after Timo Hoffmann in 2000, who fought Klička for a full twelve laps.
The challenger caused a stir in the Swiss capital before the fight.
He insulted Klitschko as a &quot;disgusting zombie&quot; who &quot;can&#39;t do anything right&quot;.
During the weigh-in on Friday, the champion was provoked, pulling sunglasses from Johnson&#39;s nose &quot;so he could see his eyes.&quot;
The fourth victory after Klitsch&#39;s return
Kličko remained undefeated even after the fourth duel after his return on October 11, 2008.
After a break of almost four years, he defeated the Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin and took back &quot;his&quot; WBC belt, which he had to hand over without a fight.
This year he defeated Juan Carlos Gomez of Cuba in defense of the title and Chris Arreol of the USA in September.
I only got one shot in this fight and I&#39;m physically in good shape, Kličko explained the quick return to the ring.
However, his dream remains to defend all four important titles in the family.
Brother Vladimír is a world champion of the WBO and IBF organizations.
But the British David Haye wears the WBA belt after he dethroned 2.13 meters tall Nikolai Vulajev in November.
Haye gave up a fight against Klitschko in the summer, which was scheduled for September.
His promotional company is reportedly planning a duel against Klitschko at Wembley Stadium in London.
The Kunduz case
Frontal attack from the opposition: The head of the Green faction, Jürgen Trittin, called Defense Minister Guttenberg a liar due to bad information about the Kunduz affair.
The SPD and Linke (Left) call on the Chancellor to explain.
Hamburg / Berlin - According to the latest findings on the raid on Kunduz, the opposition believes that Defense Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) has committed a deliberate deception.
The minister said &quot;deliberately wrong&quot; about the deadly bombing of two tanks in September, the head of the Green faction, Jürgen Trittin, said in Saturday&#39;s ARD news program &quot;Tagesschau&quot;.
Let&#39;s call it the usual expression: He lied.
The killing order was issued in violation of the rules of the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan (ISAF).
That is the essence of the NATO report that Mr Guttenberg read, Trittin said.
On Friday, it became clear that the attack was not just about destroying hijacked trucks, but about the targeted killing of two Taliban leaders.
According to a NATO investigation, up to 142 people were killed or injured in the US air raid, which was demanded by Colonel Klein, the German commander of Kunduz.
On Saturday, the Greens, the SPD and Linke called on Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) to speak immediately before the Bundestag and also to clarify what Guttenberg really knew about the incident.
Ms Merkel needs to explain whether the targeted killing strategy is part of the Bundestag&#39;s Afghan policy - and whether the Chancellor&#39;s Office, the Bundeswehr and the intelligence service have approved the new strategy, Jürgen Trittin and Green colleague Renate Künast called on.
Government spokesman Ulrich Wilhelm flatly rejected the criticism.
The chancellor&#39;s office has no influence on the specific deployment of the Bundeswehr in Afghanistan, he said.
Doubts were also voiced on Saturday about the ministry&#39;s account of the release of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and Secretary of State Peter Wichert.
According to SPIEGEL, the two informed Guttenberg correctly and completely about the background to the attack on the tanks.
It was officially said that they should have denied the existence of NATO reports and withheld sensitive details from the Minister.
However, it was said from the area around the two top officials that they even drew the attention of the Ministry of Defense to several reports, including a two-page document by Commanding Colonel Klein and one report from the military police.
The &quot;Frankfurter Allgemeiner Sonntagszeitung&quot; reports that Wichert should have asked for clarification in the letter in the meantime.
It is noted that he has not yet received a response.
The ministry did not comment on the allegations on Saturday and pointed out that this would be addressed in the inquiry committee of the Federal Assembly, which will be established next Wednesday.
Dream worlds
Some see images in the waking state and hear voices that others cannot see or hear.
Not only the mentally ill or intoxicated, the boundaries between imagination and reality merge.
As long as it happens in sleep, everything is fine.
If we lie with our eyes closed in our dark room, we may be surrounded by the wildest ideas and fantasy delusions.
However, those who experience dreams in vigilance, see and hear things that others do not see or hear, pay in today&#39;s Western world mostly as a fool or a drug addict, or at least as a weirdo.
However, such images and voices are not only created in the mentally ill or in drug intoxication.
Our imagination is to blame: The same neural processes that allow us to design houses, paint pictures or write novels will make sure that the boundaries between dream, imagination and reality merge here and there.
Dreams altered state of consciousness can occur in various forms, at best we call them visions, at worse delusions.
Although the initiator and effect may vary, the visions of the mystic Hildegard von Bingen, the drug experiences of the New-Age prophet Carlos Castaneda, the shamanic states of delirium, psychosis, and hallucinations can be derived from similar processes.
Hallucinations or visions occur when the balance of brain neuronal transmitters - especially dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin and acetylcholine - is disturbed and the interaction between different parts of the brain is disrupted.
Complex hallucinations and delusions are very common in schizophrenic psychosis.
Gravity has no power over it
The connection between delusion and dream has occupied philosophers and physicians since antiquity.
Aristotle understood hallucinations as a form of dream in the waking state, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychology, stated in 1861 &quot;a great resemblance to delusion with dream states&quot;, for Sigmund Freud the dream was even &quot;psychosis, with all nonsense, delusions, deception of the senses&quot; .
It&#39;s autumn 2001, Henning T. turns into a comic book character.
His body is two-dimensional and brightly colored.
Gravity has no power over him, hovering at the ceiling of the room.
He feels kicked.
Behind him, winged devilish figures with blood-red grimaces, appreciating their teeth.
They chase him, kick him in heavy, fiery boots, throw him against the wall, feel pain all over his body.
Loud, evil voices threaten from the walls and the radio.
He can no longer bear the voices that curse and insult him.
Henning T. pulls two cables out of stereo, knots them in a loop, and attaches them to a hook on the ceiling.
He steps on one speaker and puts a noose around his neck.
He jumps.
The loop allows.
Learn, choir voices tearing his drums, &quot;go to the clinic and get treated!&quot;
Today, Henning T. is 40 years old, having experienced six acute psychoses, the last 2 years ago, the first almost 20 years ago.
LSDs have been launched.
His diagnosis is schizoaffective paranoid psychosis, in addition he is manic-depressive, he takes medicines for depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He learned to live with his illness, he has been married for three years.
In psychosis, I experienced the worst fears and the deepest doubts, he says.
Ghosts are a terrible fact
About one percent of people get schizophrenia at least once in their lifetime, and in psychiatric clinics it is the second most commonly treated disease after depression.
In acute schizophrenic psychosis, people with disabilities can usually no longer distinguish between the inner and outer worlds, they get into an overexcited state, which can lead to hallucinations, size, relational illusions or the illusion of persecution.
Hearing voices is especially widespread - voices that command, comment or conduct dialogues.
Optical hallucinations are not uncommon either.
The affected person is unable to distinguish the important from the unimportant, the brain cannot filter out interfering signals, consciousness is flooded with impressions.
Like a dream, psychosis opens the floodgates to a flood of thoughts and fantasies that come from the deepest layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychosis is centered, says Professor Thomas Fuchs, chief physician of the Department of General Psychiatry at the University Clinic in Heidelberg.
Schizophrenic is at the center of things, everything has a meaning directed at him.
At the same time, he gets into a passive role, becomes, like in a dream, overwhelmed by events and cannot actively shape them.
Therefore, schizophrenics often feel threatened, controlled and manipulated.
Comparison with reality is usually not possible for them, ghosts are a terrible fact, awakening is ruled out.
Experience hallucinations once in a lifetime
Other than in a dream, says Fuchss, &quot;but the sensory and spatial structure of reality, which one perceives in psychosis, remains fundamentally preserved.&quot;
Misleading thoughts and hallucinations are based on reality, the alienation of the experience takes place in a real framework.
Scientists are still faced with the puzzle of why exactly our brains do such throws.
Exceptional conditions can lead to a person&#39;s loss of relationship to reality in the short term, says Fuchs.
But not everyone develops into psychosis.
There appears to be a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, but studies in twins have shown that genes are not the only determining factor.
Researchers believe that people with minimal brain damage.
We believe that at an early stage of development, neuronal maturation of the brain will be damaged, for example by a viral disease of the mother during pregnancy, Fuchs explains.
However, it remains a riddle how the neuronal system will fail, which has not manifested itself in many years.
Environmental influences also play a role - stress or traumatic experiences can be the initiator of psychosis, if available.
Hallucinogenic drugs can also trigger psychosis because they interfere with the transmission system.
When our brain boils
It&#39;s crazy that psychotronics suffer from their hallucinations and swallow expensive drugs to get rid of them, others give money for drugs to get them, says psychology professor Erich Kasten of Lübeck.
Whether we perceive delusions as pleasant or unpleasant is often just a matter of attitude.
Kasten has been collecting reports of hallucinations and delusions for ten years, and last year he interpreted his results in the book &quot;Die irreale Welt in unserem Kopf&quot; (The Unreal World in Our Heads).
Hallucinations are one of the typical accompanying phenomena of psychosis, but also one of the surprisingly many other diseases.
In addition to mental disorders such as borderline personality or depression, there are also often diseases such as migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis or Alzheimer&#39;s or brain trauma.
Surprisingly, under certain conditions, the brain of a healthy person also hallucinates.
Hallucinations, according to Kasten, consist of the contents of thoughts that are normally suppressed.
They occur when the parts of the brain in which sensory perception is processed are too active or little suppressed; when our brain boils, or when stimulation is lacking.
Drugs can trigger this condition as well as brain damage or psychosis.
But also withdrawal of stimuli, stress, worries about love or other exceptional conditions.
In more recent studies, up to a third of respondents have reported hallucinations at least once in their lives.
In the summer of 2005, Sarah K. is 16 years old, lives in a small town in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania and attends a grammar school there.
Actually, a completely normal girl.
If it weren&#39;t for the shapes and voices.
Breaks can appeal to her with long, dark hair.
When she answers, the classmates look at her in surprise - no one but her sees or hears the boy.
This shy girl is considered a tense dreamer, but Sarah K. doesn&#39;t, she knows.
He is awake, he hears and sees the boy, just as he hears and sees the girl sitting next to him on the bench.
He can even feel his presence, at least for a few moments.
It&#39;s a nice feeling, she likes the boy.
Am I crazy? He asks sometimes.
But he knows that this boy and other delusions are not real and will disappear again.
At night, the phenomena are rather depressing
Delusions are often a burden.
When she sits in the classroom, she can&#39;t watch the lessons many times because the teacher is introducing a new classmate in her eyes and ears, but he explains the math equations audibly and visibly to everyone else on the board.
At night, the phenomena are rather depressing.
As she waits in her dark room for sleep that rarely and too late arrives, she often can&#39;t tell if she&#39;s awake or asleep, if the images she sees, grimaces, or a girl with bleeding cuts on her arms and legs are created in front of her open ones. or with eyes closed.
Leave me alone, shouting at the characters.
She doesn&#39;t tell her parents or friends about it, they&#39;d think she&#39;s crazy.
Autumn 2009. Sarah K. is 20 years old today.
She graduated last year and lives with her boyfriend.
A year ago, the hallucinations stopped.
Ever since she contacted psychologist Kasten on the Internet, she knows exactly that she hasn&#39;t gone crazy.
Delusions are also an art of despair
If someone is socially isolated or their stimuli are taken away, they will most likely have hallucinations, says Kasten.
I think the brain doesn&#39;t have enough jobs and takes care of its own entertainment.
Sarah K., an only child, was afraid of other children as a little girl, often playing alone.
Her hallucinations began when she learned at 13 that the man her father had called since she had been thinking was not her own father.
Because the same brain areas are active in visual and acoustic hallucinations, which also process real perceptions and sounds, it is difficult for people with disabilities like Sarah K. to distinguish between delusions and reality. &quot;Every experience,&quot; says Kasten, &quot;takes place in the brain, and reality is also displayed there.
Hallucinations are also images that the brain creates, which is why it looks so real. &quot;
Kasten also evaluates night dreams as a form of hallucination.
Hallucinations of healthy people are not fundamentally different from hallucinations in acute psychosis.
Unlike schizophrenics, mentally healthy people are able to identify their delusions as unrealistic.
Kasten therefore advises his patients to rate hallucinations as an extraordinary ability.
Border state between dream and hallucination
Unfortunately, in our world of over-awareness, the imaginary experience is mostly pathologized, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, a professor in Heidelberg and chief physician of the Psychiatric and Psychotherapeutic Clinic of Florence-Nightingale Hospital in Düsseldorf.
Psychosis is a serious, painful disease, but it also brings positives, creativity - delusion is also an art of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard studied the so-called one-in-one form of experience, a special form of altered consciousness for a dream.
Oneiroid states are highly complex, detailed fictitious dreams that the person in question considers real and cannot even distinguish them retrospectively from the waking state.
One-state state of consciousness arises in extreme situations caused by trauma or illness, such as patients with polyradicular inflammation who experience motor paralysis when fully conscious.
When a person is threatened by the loss of the world and himself, for example by a lasting, complete inability to move, he replaces life-threatening real situations with his own, imaginary world, which is disconnected from reality, says Schmidt-Degenhard.
The type of boundary between dream and hallucination.
Because it is not possible to manage a situation in reality, worlds will change, but the real situation will be presented in the imagination.
An intense form of support for the senses and the transfer of the senses in some unbearable situation, which allows us humans our own ability to form, to pass in an instant into loss of consciousness.
Everything is real, even later in the memories
Art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen also describes his one-on-one experiences in his book &quot;Herzwechsel&quot; (Heart Exchange) as a soul salvation.
He was 49 years old when, after heart valve surgery followed by a heart transplant, his consciousness embarked on a journey of several days, with his body lying motionless in the intensive care unit.
Claussen immersed himself in the world he had created, visiting foreign times and places: He became an old man bedridden, in a train sanatorium, a robot guarding his health.
He lives in the early Middle Ages among the nobility, which produces narcotics from the blood.
A Greek kidnaps him on his motorcycle to his homeland, surfs on a hospital bed in the Alps on a hospital bed and meets a Korean mobster.
He immerses himself completely in the imaginary story, everything is real, even later in his memories.
For Claussen, these inner paths are fundamentally different from any dream.
A dream is a different state, it describes your experience.
In contrast to dreams, the memories of those mental journeys are still clear after years and in insignificant details.
Even brighter and more intense than the real experience.
The intensity of this experience breaks the horizon of our other true experiences, says psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
After all, one-in-one states, psychoses, hallucinations, and drug intoxication show how fragile our inner images of external reality are, even in the waking state.
Every change in the state of consciousness, sums up by psychologist Kasten, &quot;can lead to a deformation of what we call reality.&quot;
A fact that can also be enriching.
Snow can come
Burda
At 27, children are to take over the publishing house
The new head of the Kallen publishing house is a temporary solution: Hubert Burda wants to hand over his business to his two children in the long run, he told SPIEGEL.
The holding should continue to belong to the family 100 percent in the future.
Hamburg - Publisher Hubert Burda has long seen his business in the hands of his children.
Both children will inherit at the age of 27 and have a firm will to enter the company, says a 69-year-old man from SPIEGEL.
We handled the details carefully.
The question of whether they are also active in the company is asked only then.
Even the question of whether they have the skills to do so.
It is not possible to put 7500 employees at the head of employees if they are not capable enough.
That would kill both the children and the business.
Burda announced on Thursday that he was stepping down from the board of directors in January, and appointed Paul-Bernhard Kallen as his successor.
Kallen, 52, has been a board member of Burda since 1999.
At first he was in charge of technology.
Later, with the Treasury department, responsibility for the company&#39;s assets was added, and after the resignation of Jürgen Todenhöfer, also Direct Marketing, Abroad, Press and Finance.
For the first time, none of the family members heads the publishing house.
Burd&#39;s children are 19 and 17, and his son Felix, who would be 42 today, died a few years ago.
Kallen&#39;s appointment also serves to &quot;span 10, 15 years,&quot; Burda said.
The holding should continue to belong 100 percent to the family, says Burda.
With regard to the Schickedanz and Schaeffler cases, Burda said that even family businesses are unsure of extinction: &quot;It has always affected companies that have become infected with a desire for capital, which they have speculated and thought could become big players.
That was never my strategy.
He never had &quot;dreams of world power,&quot; Burda said.
I don&#39;t see myself as the political preceptor of this country like Springer, and I don&#39;t want to play the world league with &quot;Time&quot;, these deals are too big.

Christmas is approaching and this is the time to find out what celebrities are wearing and adjust their festive wardrobe accordingly.
The shape of the cut is very important to highlight the figure, which is necessary to be aware of.
Here are some suggestions.
Singer Fergie chose an extravagant and very complicated cut. We do not recommend.
Endesa and Barcelona, with an electric car
The energy company Endesa, together with Barcelona City Hall, have set up a &#39;LIVE Office&#39;.
This is a project for the development and promotion of an electric car in the capital of Catalonia.
The LIVE &#39;(Logistics for the Introduction of Electric Vehicles) Office will establish and manage a travel plan for the introduction of electric vehicles in the city and will ensure mobility agreements, process, coordinate and submit contributions, etc.
It will also develop the MOVELE project, promote electric cars, gather opinions and results of activities in the sectors involved.
Overall, the purpose is to support this means of transport of the future.
3 &#39;electric cities&#39;
However, Barcelona is not the only city to be involved in the project of introducing electric cars in Spain.
Madrid and Seville will join the project as well.
These are three cities chosen by the government under the MOVELE Plan to support the introduction of electric cars.
The energy company Endesa has already signed a framework agreement with the Catalan government.
The purpose is to support research and technological development activities in the Autonomous Community of Catalonia.
This includes energy-related activities and, above all, energy efficiency.
This is not the only initiative with Endesa&#39;s involvement in promoting electric cars.
The company is represented in European standardization teams and actively implements a number of additional projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero predicts a &#39;clean-up period&#39; for the automotive industry.
Prime Minister José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero predicts that the Spanish car industry, the country&#39;s main export sector, is facing a &quot;rest period&quot;.
In the Prime Minister&#39;s 2009 Economic Report, Zapatero summarized the measures introduced during the year to support the automotive sector.
&quot;Without the Competition Plan for the automotive industry, we would now have a state of abandonment, the closure of some of our main manufacturing companies,&quot; said the Prime Minister.
&quot;Thanks to this plan and the desire of individual brands to continue to operate in Spain in this highly competitive sector, a certain period of calm is expected for this industry in the future, which is our main export sector,&quot; he added.
In this sense, he noted that the Competitive Plan, which forms part of the Automotive Integrated Plan (PIA), earmarked € 800 million for projects from 19 manufacturers and 137 ancillary companies that have mobilized investments in excess of € 3 billion.
The Prime Minister explained that this investment is intended for the development of new models, for the modernization of production and existing processes.
Zapatero also emphasized the government&#39;s measures in support of the demand and mentioned the 2000E plan, which is being implemented in cooperation with the Autonomous Communities and car brands.
According to the president, the plan reduced the average emissions of new vehicles sold on the Spanish market by 6% and ensured a &quot;significant increase&quot; in registrations, specifically by &quot;40 percent&quot; in November.
20,000 square meters of classic vehicles
The first International Salon of Classic Vehicles will open in Madrid, which is a meeting place for professionals and amateurs from the world of engines.
This initiative will take place on 5-7 February 2010 in the Glass Pavilion of the Casa de Campo in Madrid.
It is an exhibition area with an area of 20,000 square meters, which will be represented by more than 200 domestic and foreign exhibitors.
Here you will find not only classic motorcycles and cars, but in ClassicAuto Madrid there will also be products of all types related to the world of engines.
Exhibitors in the pavilion will offer accessories, spare parts, components, textile accessories, accessories, publications, miniatures, etc.
Hundreds of products related to classic engines, real delicacies for collectors and curious people.
Among the participating companies will be the following: Clásicos de Mos and Good Old Times, car sales; Juan Lumbreras, restoration; Coupe-Francisco Pueche, car sales and refurbishment; or Cochera Clásicos, a specialist Mercedes Benz company.
Exterior proficiency tests
In addition, the commercial activities of this salon will be complemented by parallel activities: holding training camps, sports performances, aptitude tests, presentations and competitions.
Eligibility tests will also be carried out on classic cars and motorcycles in an adapted circuit outside the exhibition zone.
Mazda3 i-Stop: maintaining sporty style
Mazda intends to show that environmental friendliness has no negative effect on sports style.
That&#39;s why the Mazda3 has a built-in engine stop and start system - also known as the -Stop -, a device that is currently only available with a 2.0 150 hp petrol engine.
This second generation of Mazda3 is characterized by good characteristics, which it has achieved as a whole.
Surface treatment, vehicle design, habitability, behavior, mechanics, i-Stop system ...
All of these aspects are excellent on the Mazda3.
Front seats incl. the driver&#39;s seats have excellent ergonomics and are perfectly fixed.
The steering wheel is also extremely soft.
Using a set of tools and a console, we conclude that Mazda continues the Japanese trend of developing a futuristic design with many buttons and controls and a distinctive red and blue color.
This style partially reminds us of the style that also presents the Honda Civic.
So we can say that both the Mazda3 and the Civic, both Japanese, contrast with the sobriety of German products, and more specifically with the Volkswagen Golf, which everyone wants to beat.
As usual, this Japanese compact product represents more than enough space for four adults who want a very comfortable ride.
In addition, the large luggage compartment and regular shapes should be mentioned.
The automatic engine stop and start system is currently only available with a two-liter petrol engine and 150 horsepower and a six-speed manual transmission.
This engine is a real treat. It is very gentle, characterized by reduced noise levels, its performance and lower consumption.
Although the most sought-after Mazda3 is in the diesel version, all those who do not drive so many kilometers a year should not rule out this i-Stop with a petrol engine, as it is characterized by greater driving comfort and reduced consumption.
In terms of equipment, the version selected for testing is called the Sportive and includes a larger number of serial elements.
For standard equipment, mention should be made in particular of the Lane Departure Monitoring (RVM) system, which prevents blind spots, traction and stability control, speed control, light-sensitive interior mirror, on-board computer with large screen, parking sensors, separate air conditioning, rain sensor and lights, bluetooth and bluetooth audio and 17-inch alloy wheels.
And if the equipment was not enough, this version was equipped with the Premium Pack, for an additional 1,500 euros: adaptive two-xenon lights and the BOSE sound system with CD holder, among other components.
Conclusion
The Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the most compact cars in its category.
It is characterized primarily by the quality of materials used, its operation and a high level of equipment.
In addition, people who do not drive more kilometers per year can choose this version of i-Stop, which is only with a 2.0 and 150 hp petrol engine.
The only disadvantage of this model is its higher price, which is 21,770 euros for the Luxury version and 23,270 euros for the tested version -Sportive-.
At this high price, the Mazda3 offers us a great deal of satisfaction for every day.

Promise FonPeek
Peek is extremely limited, it is only used to view mail, without the ability to view certain types of attachments or surf the web.
He enjoyed his five minutes of fame in the United States when Time magazine named him one of the products of the year.
It&#39;s harder to see him outside, but the idea can be interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike smartphones, Peek is characterized by a very low price and monthly payments, less than half the amount paid for the iPhone data plan, for example.
Following its success, the company began offering two new devices: one designed exclusively for Twitter, the other based on a permanently provided free data service, but for which it is necessary to pay six times the amount for Peek.
FonPeek, which was presented at the Le Web event yesterday, is a European version of the invention and at the same time its third transformation.
It is limited just like its American counterpart, but it brings surprises.
The monthly price for maintenance is about 12 euros per month and includes roaming throughout Europe.
People traveling with a smartphone already know what it means to lose data services after crossing borders or eagerly looking for a cafe with WiFi (or Fon connection) to view their mail.
The idea of rooming at a fixed price is incredibly attractive and should have been introduced a long time ago.
Yes, some operators have special contracts and travel plans, but in my experience, one would need a doctorate in physics to understand them, as well as very good glasses to be able to read miniature letters.
The European Commission is constantly calling for reductions in roaming tariffs to be made available throughout Europe, which still does not have the desired effect.
There is a well-founded fear of using data services outside the home country.
The fact that a device like FonPeek (interestingly, it still has the name Fon when it doesn&#39;t have WiFi) achieves this type of tariff means that operators are starting to think differently and are considering various offers to compensate for their data network.
The Kindle is another nice example, offering book downloads and other Internet searches.
No contracts, no complications.
This device is connected and paid for at purchase, not after months.
And that&#39;s exactly what I expect to happen once in the case of FonPeek, it&#39;s an option to purchase with permanent access like Peek has already established in the US.
Not because I want to buy it.
I&#39;m looking at the mail on the phone, thank you.
I expect this because I think it is the best type from the consumer&#39;s point of view.
It would be interesting if the same system could be used on a computer.
The color that Michelle adores
Yellow is undoubtedly the favorite color of the first lady of the USA.
She chose a dress and coat in this color for Barack Obama to become president, and she chose the same color when she accompanied him on the second most important moment of his life: the award of the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo.
Michelle Obama used very similar models in both cases: in addition to being a similar color - yellow-green with shimmering effects - in both cases it was a three-piece set - a dress, bag and coat made of the same fabric - decorated with large embroidery or collar .
At first glance, it seemed that the first lady of the USA had decided to follow in the footsteps of the Princess of Asturias and wear similar clothes.
The fabric from which the clothing is made makes the two models quite different.
On the occasion of taking office, Michelle used large lace, in Oslo velvet with a print.
He also changes accessories: green shoes with a medium-high heel, now a similar model, but in gold.
She also wears different hairstyles: this time bun, previously loose hair.
75% of working mothers have work problems related to motherhood.
Discrimination in employment has increased in recent years, especially among younger women who intend to have a child.
This is the result of a study entitled &#39;Fertility and the Career of Spanish Women&#39;, carried out by CSIC in collaboration with the Women&#39;s Institute.
The study involved 9,737 women aged 15 to 75 and the results are clear: 75% of working mothers have limited opportunities in the labor market due to maternity.
The study emphasizes that at the beginning of cohabitation, there are many differences in views on the number of children depending on whether they work or not, and also on the type of employment.
Women who do not work away from home, work part-time or do not have a stable job start living earlier with their partner, give birth to their first child earlier and have more children overall.
On the other hand, women with stable employment, especially in the public sector, postpone cohabitation and motherhood, and have fewer offspring.
&quot;Women aged 35-49 with a stable job have an average child of 3.7 years from the start of cohabitation with a partner. This figure is 4.1 for women who have spent most of their lives achieving a stable job and therefore had to postpone their cohabitation. and the arrival of children.
The type of occupation also has a strong influence on motherhood, although a smaller influence on the time of starting to live with a partner, &quot;explains Margarita Delgado, who is researching CSIC.
Another factor influencing the age of women at the time of marriage and the birth of a child is the level of education.
Research shows that the higher the level of education, the higher the age at which women marry and have their first child.
There are also differences between women of the same generation.
For example, in the age group of 35 to 49 years, women with basic and higher education gave birth to their first child at the age of 25.1 or 25.1. 32.1.
&quot;There is another difference between women depending on their level of education.
Women with a basic education marry and give birth to their first child before finding a stable job, while women with a secondary or higher education proceed in the opposite direction, preferring a stable job to marriage and the birth of their first child, &quot;says Delgado.
Diane Kruger is also worth it
L&#39;Oréal Paris has just added a new name to its prestigious roster: Diane Kruger.
From next year, the German actress will become the face of various products of this brand under the universal slogan &#39;Because I&#39;m worth it&#39;.
The representative of &#39;Joyeux Noël&#39;, one of the most elegant actresses of the international level, thus joins other famous personalities of L&#39;Oréal Paris such as Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and the Spaniard Penélope Cruz.
Even before that, actresses Evangeline Lilly (&#39;Lost&#39;) and Freida Pinto (&#39;Millionaire from the Shack&#39;) joined this selected club.
The men&#39;s part of this cosmetics brand is also represented by important personalities: Patrick Dempsey (&#39;Grey&#39;s Anatomy&#39;) and Matthew Fox (Evangelina&#39;s partner in &#39;The Lost&#39;).
British fashion prices
The British have a lot to talk about fashion issues.
Their most important representatives - designers and models, former and current - met at the annual awards ceremony, which took place in London, at the Royal Court os Justice.
No one was missing from the meeting.
Former model Jerry Hall and her daughter Georgia May Jagger, who were voted the best model of the year.
Poker Manuela Vicenta
In &#39;Ace Poker&#39; (Alfaguara, illustration by Fernando Vicente), Manuel Vicent donates thirty X-rays of writers he has met in his literary life (and in some cases in everyday life).
He does not do so in dreaded and predictable genres (biographical similarity, life and work), but seeks something similar to the core of the creative personality.
The journey brings excitement and Vicent spares no fright or inspiration.
This book is an excellent reading pleasure, even with repeated reading.
Here are some observations.
About Albert Camus: &quot;In the pages of this book, I have found that the Mediterranean is not a sea, but a spiritual impulse, almost physical, the same as what I feel, but it cannot be called: the enjoyment of judgment, guilt without guilt and innocence without any god.&quot;
About Samuel Beckett: &quot;A nihilist, an allegorical Christian, wrote by nature and not intellect, something between helplessness and ignorance, with blinding poetic humor, meaningless as if it were a knife blade that nearly killed him.&quot;
About Graham Green: &quot;Our man has been shrouded in passion for this woman for thirteen years, adultery, pleasure and remorse, which is the spiritual privilege of reaching heaven through damnation.&quot;
About James Joyce: &quot;This Odyssey was published by Sylvia Beach in Paris in 1922. It is one of eight thousand peaks in universal literature that must be overcome from the north side, from which the best climbers often fall.&quot;
About William Faulkner: &quot;He was a strange man.
By himself, he said of himself that he was the heir of a landowner from the county, other times that he was the son of a black woman with a crocodile.
In both cases, it was a big dream. &quot;
About Louis-Ferdinand Céline: &quot;This writer caught on the bridge the mad cry of this man from Munich to bring his echo into the night of the 20th century in his literary form, running away from himself and calling to the future and speaking sharply to the worms.&quot;
About Dorothy Parker: &quot;Once she knelt down and prayed, &#39;God my beloved, arrange for me to stop writing as a woman.&quot;
About Joseph Conrad: &quot;Spenser&#39;s verses were engraved on his grave: &#39;After an effort comes a dream, / after a storm a quiet harbor, / after a war rest, / after a full life death.&quot;
About Virginia Wolf: &quot;He also carried his depression in his luggage.
The husband completely agreed to tell him that Edward VII was watching her among the azaleas or that the birds were singing in Greek.
No man has ever been so patient and in love with a neurotic whose literary talent goes hand in hand with folly. &quot;
About Pío Baroja: &quot;What else was Martin Santos about than focusing Joyce on Baroja?
What was Benet more than having Baroj executed with Faulkner&#39;s weapon?
What else was Cell other than to become famous at the expense of that man&#39;s fame? &quot;
Cowardly aggression
Last week, my 70-year-old mother was walking through our neighborhood, in Fuenlabrada County, and a group of young people aged 15 to 18 passed by and our dog, a cross rescued from a shelter weighing up to six kilograms, was kicked twice and seriously injured without a word.
Our indignation is all the greater because we do not see anything amusing in such aggression against a small and defenseless animal, which was also on a leash.
And the shock of the old lady after this incident, when she encountered these individuals on a walk, began to worry about her own safety, because such a devil-obsessed person who attacks an animal is able to do the same to a woman, child, old man or to anyone who is weaker than himself.
It happened at five o&#39;clock in the afternoon, on Tuesday, in a usually quiet neighborhood.
The dog cried all day.
Of course, we have lodged a complaint with the nearest commissioner, but we doubt that it was for anything, and in order not to raise sensitive questions, we state that these cowardly murderers were of Spanish nationality.
Outrage led us to report this fact.
We do not understand what happens to today&#39;s youth when they have fun tormenting a defenseless animal that gives us love, company and friendship.
We do not understand where the right upbringing, respect for animals and people went.
Michelin and Fesvial together using helmets
The tire manufacturer Michelin, in cooperation with the Spanish Foundation for Road Safety (Fesvial), has launched a campaign to promote the use of helmets, especially among younger motorists, as both bodies reported today.
The purpose of this initiative is to emphasize the importance of using a helmet, as it is the only means of preventing head injuries or even death in the event of a motorcycle accident.
Michelin states that the campaign is part of its road safety commitments, which &quot;means more than designing and manufacturing even safer products&quot;, and has confirmed that it seeks to fulfill this purpose in other ways, ie through an instructional and information campaign.
This new campaign to promote the use of the helmet while riding a motorcycle, under the slogan &#39;To be or not to be&#39;, is the first phase in which notice boards will be placed in more than 500 motorcycle repairs to make it known to the general public.
Finally, Michelin pointed out that road safety &quot;is a constant problem&quot; for this company, which is a manufacturer of tires for two-wheeled vehicles and whose main goal is to continuously improve product safety.
Sales of light commercial vehicles are increasing
After almost two years, the market for light commercial vehicles is beginning to recover.
All 9,425 vehicles registered in Spain in November were an increase of 12.6% compared to 2008, and what&#39;s more, this is the first increase after 22 months of permanent decline, according to figures from the patronage organization Anfac and Ganvam dealers.
However, it is better to quarantine the favorable figure, as November 2008 is a very bad period for comparison and represented a 60% reduction compared to the previous year.
As a result, despite the increase in the last month, the total number of vehicles registered in the last 11 months is 40% less than in the previous financial year.
Since January, 95,853 vehicles have been sold, which includes all possible vehicles falling into the category of light commercial vehicles: passenger car derivatives, pick-ups, vans, smaller trucks and light trucks / chassis.
And the clouds that damage demand the most have not disappeared, even though they have been bought by private individuals, most purchases have been made by small and medium-sized companies, and in almost 100% of cases it is third-party financing.
Other factors, such as the cessation of activities or the continuation of a bad economic situation, need to be added to the constraints arising from the closure of a bank loan source.
In that situation, unlike passenger cars, support for the purchase of the 2000E did not help much.
In addition to private individuals, it is necessary to mention the persons doing business on the trade license of small and medium-sized companies that intend to buy a light commercial vehicle up to 3.5 tons with CO2 emissions not exceeding 160 grams per kilometer, but the number of operations has been confirmed.
Just yesterday, Ganvam reminded us again that special attention needs to be paid to the management of these vehicles as well as industrial vehicles (trucks and buses).
The association of dealers assumes that in 2010 the development will be similar to last year and according to calculations, sales of passenger cars and 4x4s will fall by 19%.
The auxiliary system for the parking brake is already mandatory.
As in the case of the anti-lock braking system ABS, it will also be with ESP stability control, parking brake auxiliary systems, all of which will become mandatory equipment of European cars.
In fact, it is already part of the mandatory equipment of all newly registered passenger cars and light commercial vehicles, while the others have a deadline for eliminating the shortcoming, which is February 2011.
The measure introduced in the EU aims to increase pedestrian protection, while working in such a way that it can help prevent many collisions.
The parking brake assist system increases the pressure on the brakes in an emergency, which the system detects when the driver depresses.
But he is not always able to maintain this pressure until the end.
According to a study by automotive parts maker Bosch, a third of drivers who have an accident did not apply the brake before a collision and half did not make full use of the brake force.
Up to 1,100 accidents
On the contrary, this assistance requires the maximum from the braking system, shortens the braking distance of the vehicle.
According to a study carried out in the EU alone, if all vehicles were equipped with this type of equipment, up to 1,100 pedestrian fatalities per year could be avoided.
Reducing this number will be even more pronounced - according to calculations it would prevent one in four accidents with an impact on people - after the introduction of so-called intelligent handbrake systems.
In this case, the vehicles will be equipped with a system that (using radar or a camera) detects obstacles and reports them to the driver, except for light braking.
If the driver responds, it will help to increase the pressure on the pedal, if necessary.
If the driver does not react, even if the collision cannot be prevented, the device acts as intensively on the brake as possible and reduces the risk of damage to a minimum.
General Motors postpones plan for Opel until January
Nick Reilly, the new president of General Motors (GM) Europe, told Opel employees in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) that production of the new Meriva will begin in the first week of April - probably April 8 - as Javier Ortega reported. meeting the recovery plan for Opel will take more time.
Nick Reilly, the new president of GM Europe, is working to ensure that every point of the plan is first agreed with the party involved.
As a result, the final document, which will be submitted first to employees and then to the governments of the individual countries where the production plants are located, may be issued with a delay in early 2010.
GM, on the other hand, assures that the decision to sell Saab should be made these days.
Not surprisingly, the Swedish government has increased pressure on the US manufacturer to take a decision as soon as possible.
GM is making contacts with some new potential buyers.
One of them could be Geely, who also wishes to acquire Volvo, but is considering the possibility of the Dutch sports car manufacturer Skyper, which operates under the auspices of the Russian group Converg.
If it is not possible to agree with any of them, GM could sell some of Saab&#39;s assets to China&#39;s Baic.
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year if its sale fails remains valid.
Driving a Porsche Boxster Spyder
In developing this magnificent model, Porsche engineers used the Boxster S as a basis and managed to reduce the weight by 80 kg, so the weight shows only 1,275 kg.
Based on it, in the first place, the automatic retractable roof is in a canvas design with manual control, which reduced the weight by 21 kg; aluminum doors such as the GT3 have also been used, which means an additional 15 kg less; removal of air conditioning, 13; the reduction of the fuel tank from 64 to 54 liters also helped to reduce the weight by another 7 kg; after mounting the sports seats another 12 kg, thanks to the lightweight 19-inch wheels, another five kilos.
Finally, removing the CDR-30 audio system means another six kilograms less and replacing the door handles with textile handles means another kilogram.
Also available with a PDK dual-clutch transmission, one vehicle with a six-speed manual gearbox was tested, mainly on second-class roads in California, on mountainous sections with many tangled bends.
His conduct can only be qualified as untouchable.
Reducing the weight does not mean that the vehicle does not print on the asphalt.
Quite the opposite: we have not tested such a small and light model for a long time, which would also transmit such safety when moving in a corner, even at high speeds.
He is a small athlete capable of warming up muscles during a short ride for the necessary time, until we order him to sprint, brake, and resume the use of the engine ...
Whatever we want. Thanks to the steering, which is as communicative as accurate, whatever we indicate with our hands on the steering wheel is what the car will do.
And he will do it with surgical precision.
Engine sound at will
The sound of the V6 boxer, with 320 horsepower (10 more than the Boxster S), is very successful and can be amplified by the &#39;sport&#39; option and through a system that modifies the engine sound previously used on the Panamera.
Acceleration capacity is brutal, whether during suction or recuperation.
The curtains are firm, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The asphalt of the roads we drive with the Boxster Spyder was quite damaged, but the car handled the potholes well.
Electronic support was almost unnecessary while driving; and yet in some corners we came across icing and gravel at dawn, even in the advanced morning.
Definitely, this ultralight car is one of the most fun on the market, as it is more than just a modification of the Boxster S.
The car will go on sale in February 2010 for a price of 70,831 euros.
&#39;Bag Girl&#39;
Karel Lagerfeld&#39;s girlfriend, an icon of the Coco Cocoon series and the occasional &#39;starlette&#39; at &#39;company&#39; shows, the singer shows off her evil girl face as vehemently as her Chanel handbags.
More than &#39;Bad Girl&#39; or &#39;It Girl&#39;, it&#39;s &#39;Bag Girl&#39;.
Baskonia won the victory in Israel
The box office won a brilliant victory in 82-91 while hosting the complicated Maccabi Electra course, despite numerous absences in the Duska Ivanovice team, and thus became the leader of her group after a big performance by Mirza Teletovice, who was named the best in the team with eight triple points ( 29 ratings).
The Vitoria team was able to replace the significant absence of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Mic with a great deal of commitment and collective work, although they had to suffer to the end to win.
In addition, the great accuracy of the circuit with 16 triple points contributed a lot to the final triumph.
The match started with the blue team, who stood on the mark from the beginning.
That the first four baskets for Vitoria were from a distance already indicated that they had attacked the Israeli team very hard.
English and Teletovic were among the main shooters 18-20 at the end of the first part.
The second quarter was similar, but the Alav team opted for Barac&#39;s inner play and Eliyah&#39;s work, which was received by whistling and applause on his return to his original job to increase the advantage before the break (34-43).
Teletovic was already starting to show himself as the best in his team with 13 points, although &#39;out of six&#39; in the evaluation of Splitter already indicated that it would not be the best evening for the Brazilians.
But even though the match was sharp until the break, no decision was made in the slightest, and the Maccabees wanted to remind Vitoria that not everyone on their field wins, and &#39;by the hand of Elias&#39; they managed to win.
Eidson and Pnini definitely helped the &#39;yellows&#39; return to prominence (50-49).
More inappropriate
The members of Ivanovic, wounded but not dead at all, needed several accurate games to catch their breath, and then Mirza Teletovic&#39;s machine gun appeared, which returned the score to a reassuring number (54-67) with three triples almost in succession and with the help of English and Ribas, which reached the local at the end of the third quarter (57-67).
The Alavs rubbed their skins in the last section, and English and San Emeterio (60-75) had already announced that they would not allow anyone to deprive them of the deserved results of the first thirty minutes.
However, Pnini and Eidson, the best in their team, did not give up and tried to keep the team alive from the three-point line (70-77).
Despite this and with Splitter disqualified for the foul, Ivanovic did not rush and defended well, and although the Israelis approached in the final minute (80-85), the match was already won and Tel Aviv lost for the first time in the season.
Injuries prevent Unicaja from fighting
Unicaja lost significantly in Greece to Olympiacos and left him the lead of Group B in the Euroleague in a match marked by three attacks by Unicaja, but above all by an internal game (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), which facilitated the Greek victory.
The Malaga team was not intimidated by the environment of the Pavilion of Peace and Friendship or by an opponent, perhaps one of the sicker in Europe, and with a large budget.
The game in the first quarter allowed the Andalusians to dream. Aggressive defense and three triple points in a row, two thanks to Omar Cook and one Guillem Rubio, lit up the field with 12-18, minute 9.
Olympiacos was surprised by the intensity of Unicaja, although the local arsenal in the indoor game with Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis turned the score 22-20, minute 13, which was the moment when the battle between the supporters of USABeverley and Williams meant the exclusion of both players.
The Greek team became operational and proved its superiority in both zones, where the absence of an English pivot due to the injury of Joel Freeland and three personal mistakes of Carlos Jiménez burdened the Unicaja team.
Between the internal players and the Lithuanian wing Linas Kleizas with a triple point, they increased the advantage to 44-32, minute 19.
Impossible retaliation
The third part was very offensive on the part of Olympiacos, who, although he lost by 19, proved his superiority and even managed to equalize the difference from the match in Malaga Málaga 66-48, minute 27, which shook the lead in the group.
Unicaja tried to overcome the absence and last absence of the Scottish pivot Robert Archibald, who was injured in the last match.
Despite all the disadvantages, Unicaja, thanks to Cook&#39;s lead and triple points and Lewis&#39;s contribution, left some hope of winning 66-57, minute 31.
But it was practically impossible, because Olympiacos proved to be unstoppable thanks to its strengthening and dominance in centimeters in its zone.
Croatian pivot Nikola Vujcic, managed to equalize the basket average of 81-62, minute 37, and Unicaja withered and handed over the lead to Olympiacos.

Brazil has set a date for Zelaya&#39;s departure
The Brazilian government has set a deadline for Manuel Zelaya to remain at its embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The deposed president must leave the diplomatic mission no later than January 27, 2010, when his term officially ends.
Francisco Catunda, chargé d´affaires of the Brazilian embassy in the Honduran capital, confirmed to TV Globo that &quot;Mel&quot; knows that he must leave the embassy by this date, where he has been hiding since September 21.
&quot;He is aware that on January 27, after the end of his term, he must leave and seek another refuge.&quot;
The station also quoted a former statesman as confirming his intention to leave the embassy before the deadline: &quot;I intend to leave as soon as possible, logically under the auspices of the Brazilian government,&quot; Zelaya said by telephone.
After the election on November 29 (when Porfirio Lobo was elected), Zelaya assured that he would remain at the Brazilian embassy until January.
However, the same week he tried to take refuge in Brazil.
The operation eventually failed because Zelaya rejected the condition of political asylum sought by the &quot;de facto&quot; government chaired by Roberto Micheletti.
Thank you
After the days of wine and roses since last spring, when asset inflation was the prevailing mood in the markets, uncertainty reappeared in the markets, which should come as no surprise, as it is already a natural state in an environment where executives make decisions about the future. insecure.
The drug used by central banks to stabilize the market was to monetize debt through the direct purchase of assets and the indirect release of liquidity at a rate close to zero so that financial institutions could buy assets to be deducted.
Central banks have already confirmed that direct asset purchases are virtually over, and without calling into question their disparate liquidity policy, they are starting to throw some sand in the gears, as the Spanish central bank did with its auction last year.
Investors therefore doubt the ability of the world economy to sustain economic recovery without such heterodox measures, and we are participating in the return of reducing risk returns.
The mobility of the stock market and the differences in corporate bonds have regained points, although they are still very far from the abnormal level they reached at the beginning of the year.
States were forced to socialize private risk, which again affected public debt.
They are once again pushing for quality, and the US, Japan and Germany have become a haven chosen by investors, widening the differentiation of eurozone countries from Germany.
Spain was hardly affected by this instability, but at that time Standard &amp; Poor&#39;s came and threatened a new revision to downgrade the Kingdom of Spain.
On the other hand, some uncertainty is not useless for silencing proponents of moral hazard, who have again sought to burden the conscience of those responsible for world economic policy to curb the devastating effects of credit cuts on employment, when in fact a new Thanksgiving Day would have to be declared.
However, the situation in Dubai represents a tribal struggle between the emirs for the restoration of power in the emirates, and as far as Greece is concerned, we have seen this before.
A government that covers the deficit, elections and a new government comes in.
Prodi did it in Italy after Berlusconi and Sócrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso.
It does not make sense for Ecofin to save Hungary from defaulting at the beginning of the year and to allow a euro member country to default.
But what makes sense is that Ecofin is forcing the Greek Government to be transparent and to hold its own citizens jointly accountable when extraordinary measures are needed to maintain the stability of its public finances.
If, as we expect, we are before a period of normalization of temporary risk premiums, after some excesses in supported positions they would be within expectations.
In the Spanish case, while our differences in public debt will increase in the same way as the bonds of European companies, we need not worry.
If Europe&#39;s differences narrow and ours continues to widen, it would be a typical Spanish risk.
The Standard &amp; Poor&#39;s affair is just an anecdote. When our leading indicators force most study services to anticipate their recovery scenarios and revise their 2011 upward scenario, including the OECD and the European Commission, to return to the Japanese scenario, the Spanish economy has little hope of living up to this warning.
Again, it looks like it will be a great opportunity to buy Spanish assets, although for now &quot;carefully, buddy driver&quot;.

Iberdrola President Ignacio Sánchez Galán was the first to intervene yesterday before a subcommittee of the Chamber of Deputies, where he is currently discussing Spain&#39;s energy strategy for the next two decades.
Following his intervention, which was followed by a speech by President Gas Natural-Fenos, Rafael Villaseca, Galán made a few remarks to the press about the proposal he had submitted to the subcommittee behind closed doors.
According to President Iberdrol, Spain needs an investment of 50,000 million euros by 2020 and another 60,000 million by that date by 2030, if the nuclear power plants currently in operation are maintained.
If this did not happen, the necessary investment would not be 60,000 million, but up to 95,000 million.
Indeed, Iberdrola believes that in the next decade, investments must focus not on increasing production capacity, but on distribution networks and international interconnections.
From 2020 onwards, the issue is changing and performance will need to be increased.
Its offer focuses on gas and coal-fired power plants with carbon dioxide capture mechanisms and, above all, on renewable energies.
In this case, he believes that a new 18,000 MW is needed, but with other &quot;support energies&quot;.
Galán, who believes the draft law on a sustainable economy just approved by the government is in line with the company&#39;s line, did not want to live as a royal decree to promote national coal consumption, which runs counter to climate change policy.
In his view, it is a &quot;clear long-term bet&quot; in this sense, despite &quot;precise&quot; measures, as President Iberdrola called them.
Be that as it may, Galán believes that investment decisions, although long-term, must be taken now, because they are maturing and a stable tax framework is needed to start them.
Ferrovial has won &#39;handling&#39; Aer Lingus at ten airports
Ferrovial&#39;s groundhandling airport subsidiary, Swissport, will play the role of Aer Lingus, the Irish airline&#39;s preferred partner for cargo services at the ten European airports where it is present.
Paris, London, Frankfurt or Brussels are among the most important of them.
The agreement, which has not yet resulted in economic deadlines, is valid for five years.
Ferrovial, the Junta of Castilla-La Mancha and the University of Alcalá de Henares, on the other hand, signed a protocol yesterday to work together to create a Center for Smart Infrastructure Innovation
The association expects to invest 20 million by 2012, of which 50% will be accounted for by Ferrovial.
One of the Centre&#39;s tasks will be research into energy efficiency at motorways and airports.
Acciona is aiming for its first highway in Australia against Hochtief and Bouygues
Acciona is fighting for its first motorway concession in Australia, a market where it already operates as an energy and water company.
The construction in question is a tunnel estimated at A $ 1,700 million (about € 1,047 million).
Its rivals are the French company Bouygues and the German Hochtief.
The 5-kilometer-long tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane on the east coast has become the closest opportunity for Acciona to establish itself in this country as a construction and concession motorway company.
City Hall wishes to have the tunnel completed at the end of 2014
After selecting a public-private partnership (PPP according to the initials in English) for further project development in a business plan sponsored by Erns &amp; Young, the administration already has a final list of candidates for the construction and operation of tolls.
The bids are expected to be submitted in May, with an estimated investment of A $ 1,700 million (€ 1,047 million), with three corporations with a significant presence in European construction competing in the final phase.
The group called Transcity is led by Acciona, the only Spanish company in the competition, and its partners are BMD and Ghella.
The first is one of Australia&#39;s largest construction companies and the second, based in Italy, is one of Europe&#39;s largest underground construction specialists.
The Northern Direct Group is at stake against the Acciona group, with the presence of the British Laing O&#39;Rourke, the Australian infrastructure manager Transfield and the French construction group Bouygues.
The third and final group to go through the network is called LBRJV and involves the Australian capital Leighton (a subsidiary of the German construction company Hochtief, represented here by ACS), as well as the local Baulderstone (owned by the German Bilfinger Berger group) and a major civil engineering company. Razel.
The Australian infrastructure market promises large construction and privatization, but carries with it a clear difficulty of entry other than through the acquisition of a local construction company.
The strategy followed by the aforementioned Hochtief or Bilfinger is, in addition to Asian references, still an example for Spanish giants in the sector.
ACS gained market position through its 30% stake in Hochtief, owner of the cited Leighton.
Million assets
Acciona relies on the geographical area of greatest importance for the sector, where it already has a significant presence through its energy supplier activity and in the desalination business.
Among other assets, it has the largest wind farm in Waubra (192 MW) in Victoria and leads a group of companies that build and manage desalination plants in Adelaide with a budget of 700 million.
Its plan is now to consolidate these two areas and use the common energy to enter the areas of construction and operation of infrastructures.
The underground toll road, promoted by the Brisbane City Infrastructure Office, called the Northern Link, is intended to connect the western highway from Toowong with the 5-kilometer tunnel route in Kelvin Grove (see map). This is the biggest action to reduce congestion in Brisbane.
The calendar set by the local government plans to enter the summer of 2010 and start work in December next year.
Although this paid passage would open in the last months of 2014, full completion of the works is not planned until 2016.
The tunnel was designed in 2005.
It will contain two streams in each direction, an electronic toll system and a comprehensive ventilation system.
The Queensland government will provide A $ 500 million (€ 308 million) to fund it.
Brisbane has already offered this contract to Hochtief
Australia is still making a significant profit to Hochtief as it announced a contract with the government yesterday, estimated at 154 million.
Through its local branch, Leighton, ACS will operate a national broadband network with fiber-optic cable.
This situation will allow fast access to the Internet for 400,000 people and provide the German company with work for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company abandoned the project to build a 27-storey King George tower in the Australian city of Brisbane. Construction work was yet to begin, and Hochtief closed sales for 129 million.
In the UK, specifically in Manchester, he will be involved with Laing O&#39;Rourke in the construction and operation of two school centers for 25 years.
The initial investment will be 75 million euros.
The FCC has been allocated a tunnel in Slovenia for 64 million
Through its Alpine subsidiary, the FCC has been allocated a € 64.5 million motorway tunnel for a highway in Slovenia worth € 64.5 million.
The company won the contract a few days after the completion of work on the expansion of the tunnel in Bosruck (Austria) for 130 million.
In this way, Alpine strengthens its experience in tunnel construction.
The start of work is planned for the beginning of 2010 and the deadline for implementation is 32 months.
Mrs. Rushmore won an advertisement in Renfe
Renfe has assigned advertising and marketing services to Sra for the past two years. Rushmore for about three million euros a year, the railway company informed.
The contract includes the possibility of extension for 12 months each year. Mrs. Rushmore was chosen from 16 agencies that competed in Renfe&#39;s competition, four of which advanced to the finals, including TBWA, which was responsible for creating the commercial for the past three years.
From now on, it will be Sra. Rushmore take care of the design and production of campaigns.
A fine of 63 million for France Télécom for hampering competition
France&#39;s competition regulator fined France Télécom € 63 million for anti-competitive behavior in the country&#39;s Caribbean.
According to the institution, the operator reduced competition between fixed and mobile phones by signing exclusive agreements, pricing plans and loyalty programs with consumers on the fringes of regulation.
With this sanction, the former French monopoly and still a state-owned company have bought more than 560 million euros in fines since 1994 for obstructing its competitors.
The fine imposed yesterday was de facto increased because the competition authority considers that France Télécom has committed a similar offense as in the past and that there has therefore been a repeat offense.
App Store
On the other hand, the mobile branch of the French company is still a star among other operators and has opened a shop with applications on the Internet in order to increase revenues that will not come from voice transmissions.
From the beginning, the Orange application store will be active in France and the United Kingdom.
It will be necessary to wait until 2010 to enter other countries such as Spain.
Playing in the Champions League has brought 476.4 million to Madrid and Barça since the beginning
The Champions League has become a source of income for these clubs since its inception in 1992.
To the extent that Real Madrid and Barcelona have since earned 476.4 million, making them the third and fifth most lucrative club in the competition.
The list is led by Manchester United.
The list is led by Manchester United.
Winning the UEFA Champions League is not just about fame. It is also one of the main sources of income for large clubs.
To the extent that the competition distributed 5.362.5 million euros among the 105 teams (including 12 Spanish) that have participated in the event since the inception of the tournament in the 1992/1993 season, according to UEFA.
Real Madrid and FC Barcelona did very well in this division.
The White Club was third on the continent with the most money it received for participating, and the only one along with AC Milan to win the main prize three times.
The current Catalan champion and last winner of the defunct European Cup in 1992 is fifth in the classification.
The list is led by Manchester United and Munich Bayern, the two teams that also charged the most money for participating in the last Champions League.
And this despite the fact that she lost both to Barça.
On the other hand, Spain is only the third country to receive the most money through the Champions, although it won the most titles of all (five against four for Italy, three for England and two for Germany).
Distribution
This apparent paradox is explained by the complex money-sharing process used by UEFA.
For the financial year, the body chaired by Michel Platini plans to earn 1,090 million for the Champions League.
Of this money, UEFA spends 413.1 million on fixed payments: each of the 20 clubs that took part in the preliminary classification round (including Atlético Madrid) received 2.1 million.
in addition, those who achieved participation received 3.8 million for their presence alone, in addition to an additional € 550,000 for each match they participate in.
There is also a prize for a win (800,000 euros) and a draw (400,000 for each team). The octifinalists get three million each; eight quarterfinalists3.3 million.
Each of the last four will receive 4 million.
The champion earns 9 million, while the second finalist earns 5.2 million.
In this way, the club earns a minimum of 7.1 million and a maximum of 31.2 million on fixed payments.
On the other hand, Barça won 2.5 million for winning the European Super Cup in August.
In addition, however, there are variable payments, for which 337.8 million are earmarked.
This money is divided according to the relative value of each television market.
Spanish is one of the main and has four assigned places.
Last year&#39;s champion will receive 40% of the allotted money, the second 30%, the third 20% and the fourth 10%.
The second part will be paid according to the number of matches that will take place this year.
Nueva Rumasa offers 61 million euros for 29.9% Sos
Yesterday, the Nueva Rumasa Group announced details of a share purchase offer, with the help of which it wants to gain a top position between 25% and 29.9% of Sos&#39; capital.
This percentage does not oblige to make a public offer to acquire (option) all securities.
Specifically, Nueva Rumasa is offering EUR 1.5025 per share, which it would pay in ten years and for which it would pay interest for this deferral of 1% per annum.
Yesterday, Sos shares ended trading at 1.85 euros; therefore, Nueva Rumasa&#39;s offer rates the company 18% below market value.
According to Nueva Rumasa, the price of 1.50 euros reflects the fair value of Sos.
The offer is conditional on the appointment of eight of the 15 members of the board.
The Jerez Group provides a period of 15 days for shareholders to announce their interest in selling the shares.
CNMV stated that it had not been informed of the offer, although Ruize Mateose had confirmed that it had contacted the regulator.
If the purchase is made, the price would reach 611.7 million, while the capitalization of Sos is 254.27 million.
Meanwhile, Sos is further changing the structure of its leadership.
As an attempt to stay on the margins of possible bids to buy and compensate for the court fluctuations of its former leaders, brothers Jesus and Jaime Salazar, the election of Maria Luisa Jordá as head of internal audit was announced.
This decision makes her the first woman to hold a senior position in a food business.
It is a newly created position that will report directly to the group president.
And it is not excluded from the controversy, as the company continues to be immersed in a legal battle over the alleged transfer of more than 230 million from Sos to the Salazar brothers.
De facto, it is impossible to shred the possibility that Sos will reveal new fund transfers in the coming months
As for the Salazar credit, former board members Ildefonso Ortega and Ángel Fernández Noriega (CCM and Unicaja representatives) testified before the National Court yesterday, confirming that they had approved the transfer of 212 million without knowing their destination.
CNMV grants the option to exclude Paternina, which participated in Inversora Mer
The National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) yesterday allowed the exclusion of Inversora Mer from Federic Paternin9. October.
The Authority explained that it authorized the operation as it understood that its conditions complied with the applicable standards and considered that the content of the explanatory brochure submitted after the amendments introduced on 2 December was &quot;sufficient&quot;.
CNMV stated that the offer was aimed at acquiring 550,008 shares in Federico Paternina at a price of EUR 7.65 per share, representing 8.95% of the company&#39;s capital, which consists of 6,142,786 shares admitted to trading on the Madrid and Bilbao stock exchanges.
He further explained that 5,592,778 million shares had been immobilized, which could not be transferred in any way until an offer was concluded stating that the price had been set by Federico Paternina in accordance with the provisions of the applicable standards.
New tools for car valuation
These days, storms and accidents are earned not only by car repair shops.
Every day, thousands of cars that have suffered an insured event are towed to a service center, where an expert must estimate the damage and repair costs.
No insurance claim is the same, and calculating the cost of parts and labor time can be a long and complicated job.
Calculating the cost of repairs manually from 20,000 to 30,000 euros, including parts and labor, can take two or three hours.
However, with the support of new computer tools, it would be a matter of minutes
Therefore, almost 100% of experts use this type of system.
Suppliers of services and solutions for estimating claims and maintenance are dedicated to gathering information provided by manufacturers in order to then develop and offer their customers a useful tool.
In Spain, Audatex, from the American group Solera, is the leading company; 80% of the evaluation is done with its products.
Other companies competing in the field of valuation and sector information tools are GtMotive and Eurotax.
Working with data provided by manufacturers is not easy at all.
According to Eduard Velázquez, Audatex&#39;s sales director, they work with 63 manufacturers and importers in Spain, each of which provides them with information in a different format.
In addition, the amount of data to be processed is still growing, as more versions, variants and engine solutions have been introduced in the last five years than in the previous fifteen years.
As soon as a new vehicle enters the market, these companies start working.
This is a very hectic job, because it is necessary to catalog each of the thousands of parts of the vehicle and determine its price.
In addition, &quot;intelligent&quot; graphic processing &quot;is performed on each model, where it is possible to&quot; pinpoint &quot;individual parts of touring cars.
For a model with massive sales, work can be done in a week if the process is very fast.
As for the minor car, it can take three or four months. Audatex currently has complete information on 99.2% of cars sold in Spain.
Among the most exclusive models they have information about are Porsche, but not Ferrari or Lamborghini, for example.
With regard to the rolling stock in circulation, they exceed 99%.
To perform the work of documenting and developing databases, Audatex has eight centers distributed around the world (Spain, France, Germany, USA, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan) and each of them specializes in specific brands.
The national headquarters are in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There, more than a hundred technicians (normally mechanics experts) work simultaneously with three computer screens.
Audatex invests 90 million euros a year in the development of these databases.
2.5 million pieces of data are added every month, and customers receive updates every two days.
The processing of this vast stream of information allows companies to make different uses and provide different products.
The most common uses focus on repairs and maintenance, but depending on the country, there are also tools for managing spare parts or for calculating the sales or residual value of a car.
The only company that has a guide that provides information on the value of used vehicles in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex does not offer them in our country, but it does in the United States.
With the products offered by Audatex, it is easy to get support that can be used by professionals in the sector.
The company offers ten different tools, with the star product being AudaPlus, a standard claims assessment solution for experts.
Includes automobiles, motorcycles, and light and heavy industrial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of parts, it also includes the repair time estimated by the manufacturer or the paint shop.
This tool is paid according to the use for each evaluation.
The highest price is 5.75 euros for customers who use it a little, a maximum of ten times a month.
Then every insurance company that makes thousands of estimates will negotiate its price with Audatex.
Other products such as AudaVIN allow the complete identification of the vehicle and the equipment with which it came off the assembly line only on the basis of the first chassis number.
AudaGlass focuses on vehicle windows and AudaSubastas is an open service to the professional sector on the Internet that allows you to dispose of vehicles with a total insured event.
Its statistical service is very useful for identifying trends, performing geodemographic analyzes or detecting deviations by makes or models.
For example, it is possible to study how many models of a certain brand have been serviced due to an accident or how many have suffered serious insurance claims during a certain period.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company to develop this type of tool.
Among other things, it sells Gt Estimate, which is also intended for experts, as well as providing digital images, access to parts or prices, and official times of the manufacturer.
Gt Motive is a company of the Einsa Group founded in 1971 as a supplier of services and solutions for damage assessment, accidents or car maintenance.
Gt Guía Valuation is its reference historical product in the market.
They work with 24,000 service users, 3,100 experts and 53 insurance companies.
Turnover has increased by 20% per year over the last three years and in 2008 accounted for 10.8 million euros.
At the beginning of last year, the process of internationalization began with the installation of an office in Paris.
Audatex was founded in Germany in 1966 and established itself in Spain in 1979.
According to the company&#39;s sources, 62% of its brother originates in Europe and 38% in North and South America. It works with 900 insurance companies and 33,000 services, of which 3,000 in Spain.
Solera Group&#39;s global invoicing (Audatex, Sidexa, Informex ABZ, Hollander and IMS) will reach $ 557 million, 3.3% more than in 2008.
In our country, the company earns 19.1 million euros, which is 7.2% more than last year.
In 2005, the Solera Group stood on the stock exchange for $ 1,000 million and now its shares are estimated at a total value of $ 2,400 million.
It has been listed on the New York Stock Exchange since 2007 and is included in the Standard &amp; Poor&#39;s reference index.
Internet auction of crashed vehicles
Last October, the Solera Group bought Autoonline, an online base for selling cars and motorcycles or special vehicles after an insured event.
The operation envisaged the subscription of EUR 59.5 million out of 85% of the company&#39;s capital, which could be expanded by the remaining 15% next year.
The aim of the purchase was to provide more value-added services to customers with access to a huge international market.
This valuation and purchase and sale service is guaranteed exclusively to professionals in the sector such as insurance companies, experts, rentals, services, spare parts sales and professional dealers, who must register before the start of operations.
Founded in 1996 in Germany, the platform manages more than 650,000 operations throughout Europe, including 500,000 in Germany.
Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey stand out among the main markets.
The website currently has more than 1,500 registered resellers and 4,000 experts.
It manages 3,000 daily ads and about 100 new ads are added to the Spanish market every day.
Under Spanish law, a car whose chassis number has been discarded cannot be put back into service, but can be used as a source for spare parts that have not been damaged.
Vehicles with historical value may be allowed to operate, although they have been scrapped, after a preliminary procedure.
Service budget in four steps
With the Auda-Taller tool, Audatex guarantees that the user obtains a budget in just four steps: identifying the vehicle, finding a spare part, creating a budget and generating a budget.
Ease of use is an essential condition for these systems, especially for convincing older professionals who are more or less reluctant to use new driving techniques.
The database contains 1,034 vehicles, of which 666 tourist vehicles, 109 off-road vehicles, 137 motorcycles, 78 vans and 44 trucks.
Naturally, you need a computer with an internet connection to use it.
After identifying the model to be repaired by the chassis number, a realistic graphical representation of the model appears and then the required spare part is selected.
The user can include variables such as labor cost, surcharges, or discounts, and then print and pass on to the customer.
AudaTaller is not a valuation tool like AudaPlus, but rather a reference catalog.
The main difference between the two systems is that it is service-oriented and does not include labor force estimation.
The cost of using this tool for the workshop is 350 euros per year, which the customer can finance.
Audatex is currently working to make these images three-dimensional.
This is an innovation that mechanics welcome because, for example, it allows you to select a door and rotate it to display the inside.
