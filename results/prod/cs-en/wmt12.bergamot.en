Parliament did not support the amendment to the liberating Tymoshenko
Ukraine's parliament today rejected a proposal to repeal a section under the amendment to the Penal Code, on the basis of which opposition leader Yuliya Tymoshenko was convicted.
The adjustment, which would open the way for the liberation of the imprisoned ex-PM, was rejected by MPs at the second reading of the proposal to allay the sentences for economic offences.
Tymoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison in October for concluding an allegedly unfavourable contract with Russia to purchase natural gas.
The verdict is not final; the court is due to hear the court in December.
Tymoshenko calls the ruling a political vendetta of the regime, the suspected bias of the court was triggered by the trial in the West.
The motion to drop section 365 on the basis of which the ex-PM was convicted of the Penal Code was supported by 147 deputies in the vote.
It required 226 votes to be approved.
Libyan victory
The story of the Libyan liberation, or the Libyan rebellion, which has its losers.
Muammar Gaddafi is buried in an unknown place in the desert and without it is over.
It remains to define the winner.
As is customary in the county, the election will be won by the Islamists, but it is a question of whether the moderate or the radical.
The Transitional National Council has applied to the customary Sharia law, and we already have some idea about it.
Libya will become a crime-free country, as theft is mowed.
Women can forget about emancipation, any apostates from the faith are facing execution, and so on.
Instead of a dictator, a company consisting of rival tribes will unify the Koran.
There will be order in Libya that we cannot imagine and which we would certainly not want.
But our way of life is neither the only nor, objectively, the best, and it would probably not suit the Libyans just mentioned for a change.
In fact, it is surprising that the Islamic fighters took advantage of the help of infidel dogs.
The only excuse for them is that, from their point of view, it was not the American general who was driven by NATO airstrikes, but by Allah, whose greatness they celebrated in every hilarious intervention.
So when the victors are sought in Libya, the West is not one of them.
We took part in the shootout, served Islam, and our politicians, in the person of the dictator, got rid of a political ally without guaranteeing any profit.
After fresh bad experiences in Afghanistan and Iraq, we do not buy Libya militarily.
That leaves the locals with the issue of the "crusaders."
But will they have, without the occupation of the oil company, for a slice of Libya's black gold?
They may well not be, and the west will finally be able to boast of selfless protection of human rights.
Unless, of course, the rulers of the Sharia law merge it.
A new era of crisis is beginning.
The focus of investors is France and the rest of Europe
The statistical whirlwind swept across Europe on Tuesday.
Individual states have released GDP figures for 3Q.
The Czech economy has stagnated quarter-on-quarter, with Germany and France growing.
But the bond market is now breaking records.
Investors are no longer looking only at Italy, but also Spain, France, Austria and others.
The eurozone's statistical authorities, Germany, the Czech Republic and some other European countries have published preliminary estimates of the development of the economy for the third quarter.
Germany's GDP grew by the expected 0.5%, France by 0.4%.
At the same time, the two countries adjusted the second-quarter data, in which Germany, in addition to better than expected (up 0.3% instead of the original 0.1%), but France said it appeared in a slight 0.1% decline (original figures indicated a stagnation).
The Czech economy grew by 1.5 percent year-on-year in the third quarter of this year.
Quarterly, however, the gross domestic product (GDP) stagnated and, according to the CZSO, confirmed the trend of a gradual slowdown in growth in the economy's performance.
The results are worse than analysts' estimates.
Major events:
The Czech economy grew by 1.5 percent year-on-year in the third quarter of this year, but stagnated in a quarter of a year.
The German economy grew by 0.5 percent in the third quarter, according to preliminary and seasonally converted data.
The euro area and the European Union's economy grew by 0.2 percent between July and September compared to the previous quarter, in line with analysts' expectations.
The Greek economy declined by 5.2 percent year-on-year.
The yield on her 10-year bonds is at 28.45%.
Italian and Spanish bond yields are rising to critical boundaries.
The problems are also beginning to be felt by Austria, the Netherlands, France, Belgium, etc...
Yields for Czech 10-year bonds remain below 4%, even as the situation in the region is deteriorating.
There are voices from Germany that the ECB should be a creditor of last resort.
The Czechs qualified for EURO.
They won 1-0 in Montenegro and celebrate their 200 million promotion
The football team has mastered the toughest task of the season!
In Montenegro, thanks to the great Czech and a beautiful goal, Petr Jiráček, she won 1-0.
Czech football, even with a large portion of luck in the second half, defended a luxurious lead from the home leg and will not miss the European Championship again.
IHNED.cz watched the postseason match in a detailed report.
Almost no excitement in the first half and a great deal of luck in the second.
The Czech national team, also thanks to their home game in the end, the great Czech and hero Jiráček, won happily 1-0 in Montenegro and celebrate their progress to the European Championships.
The Montenegrin, due to the precise defence of the Czech Republic, came under pressure in the second half.
The match's smola were Damjanovic and Vučinič, who scorched two big chances.
Even thanks to the great Petr Cech, the Czech national team will not miss the European Championship next year, and a reward of around 200 million crowns will also be added to the Czech football box office.
Ever since the opening minutes, there was a lot of fighting football.
Both teams found it difficult to get involved in the combination and were played mostly around the halfway line.
The pressure from the home footballers did not come in the first half either, as the Czech defence-seekingly deflected the Czech defence.
Iranian students are prepared to die for their country's nuclear program.
Created a living shield
Several hundred college students created a living shield around a nuclear facility in Iran.
With their gesture, they want to express their country's support for their country's nuclear program ahead of a possible Israeli attack.
The students prayed in front of the premises at noon on Tuesday and then cheered the death of the US and Israel.
Several hundred students at universities in Isfahan, Iran, set up a living shield on Tuesday around the Isfahan nuclear nuclear technology center, which is processed by uranium.
They are thus demonstrating that they are ready to defend their country's nuclear program with their lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) noted in its recent report that Iran did not appear to have stopped seeking a nuclear weapon.
A possible attack on Iran's nuclear facilities is being discussed in Israel.
Students prayed at the midday before entering the Ishahan nuclear facility and then hailing the death of America and Israel.
In the event of an attack to cripple Iran's nuclear program as much as possible, according to the Israeli press, the target would also be the Natanz facility in which uranium is enriched, according to the Israeli press.
The menu of the obese child: does not eat and dines sausages
More than a third of children aged 9 to 13 have overweight problems, with an oversized weight of 9 per cent of schoolchildren and an obese of 5 per cent of children.
At the same time, the obese children tend to come from families with unhealthy lifestyles, as the current survey showed.
It shows once again how important it is for the healthy development of a person to the environment in which he grows up and the patterns he is surrounded by.
Tables at the obese children, for example, see sausages up to half as likely as many as in the families of children with a normal weight.
Fried fries had a dinner day before the research associated with an awareness-raising event called Obesity is no coincidence of more than 19 percent of the obese.
Fats are also not used to play sports in fatty families, but this applies to most families of today's schoolchildren - only 15 percent of children said that their parents find time for active movement at least once a week.
Survey among 900 children
The survey was conducted at the end of last year's school year and was attended by nearly 900 primary school children from all over the Czech Republic.
It was the second annual Oesity event is no coincidence supported by the General Health Insurance Company and Unilever.
So far, more than 12,000 schoolchildren from 4th to 8th grades have joined the project.
Meanwhile, the right eating and exercise in the family is one of the determining factors that is caused by the dramatically rising number of overweight or even obese children.
"For example, only half of those polled said that they were eaten five times a day in breakfast-Svach-najam-baby-chamber mode, which is one of the basic prerequisites for the right nutrition," reads one of the survey results.
No breakfast and dinner in the evening
Experts point out that relative details are also essential for healthy development, such as regular family breakfast time.
In the Czech Republic, only 23 percent of schoolchildren's families eat breakfast at the same time.
In most families, everyone eats breakfast alone.
And the worst part was finding that in a tenth of households, it would not eat at all.
Breakfast is the basis of the right daily diet.
The questionnaire showed that unhealthy fries are much more likely to be consumed in the families of obese children.
Almost everyone - regardless of weight - drinks sugary lemonades every day (70 per cent).
While more than 40 percent of respondents regularly play sports, their parents' result was less than half - 15 per cent.
Build your diet
Another part of the survey allowed selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to build their own diet from the options on offer according to their own taste and self-awak.
"The electoral preferences of Czech children aged 12 to 15 are far from an ideal in terms of a healthy diet."
Among their favourite dishes are a lot of flour, meaty and sugary dishes.
"The big popularity of sugary sodas is particularly alarming," the final survey report reads.
For lunch as the main meal, pasta triumphed just above the poultry.
But the children barely wanted legumes at all, and the popularity of fish and the midday vegetable dishes is also low.
A Lend to Health
At the same time, the survey showed that children are willing to adjust their eating habits if they get the right information.
"For the survey review group, who completed a questionnaire after the end of the enlightening lecture Obesity, there was a significant shift in preferences towards the principles of a healthy diet in a number of cases," the results of the project read.
This was striking, for example, for sugary lemonades, where more children would start to prefer plain water.
Children were also much more likely to tick off poultry and fish as the main meal of the day in the questionnaire, restricting sugary foods and dumplings.
Stylist must also be a good psychologist, pros say
In the opening article about how stylists learn, I complained a little that there was a lot of it in the opening hours.
I had no idea what was coming next.
Lectures in three industry pros, dressing up problematic characters, and a seminar on how it goes on set.
And it gets worse.
The closer to the final exam, the more information and practical tasks await us.
And even though the course is held every Saturday and Sunday, it is really "trodden."
This time, the director, Alice and I discussed (there's not a single boy in the course) to dress up a woman who doesn't have a perfectly serious figure.
And there are the vast majority of them.
Someone has a short neck, someone has a boyish figure with no proper curves, and someone is overweight.
The stylist must know how to optically soften the broad shoulders, extend the neck or deliver the necessary curves.
We were given tips on how to make it for a woman like Jennifer Lopez, the bigger breasts and hips and narrow waist, to highlight the character nicely while not wearing the woman too challengingly.
For example, if the difference between the waist and the hips is such that skirts or trousers really don't fit, then it pays to have at least one of those tailored pieces made.
You certainly won't regret it, because perfectly fitted clothes are priceless.
You will feel much better in a tailored skirt than in one that keeps moving, healing, pulling out at the waist and the like.
The boy's character, for her part, can afford to wear laggers' clothing with eyelashes, apps, embroidery or recruitment.
Of course, there's a lot of information and the types of characters, so I'm glad to have a whole week to sort out all the information in my head.
And I'm still worried that given the homework assignment, it's enough.
For each of the female students has been given an assigned celebrity to devise two outfits: the day and the evening.
We have to take into account the current appearance, the fashion style of the personality and the character type.
I'll be "dressing" Mirand Kerr, you may know her from the Victoria's Secret campaigns.
In my mind's cheers, for me personally, it is certainly better for me than the kind of Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, who has gained perhaps a hundred pounds lately (please take into account the pitch), or the young Selena Gomez.
We have to cut the clothes out of magazines or search the internet and print them out and then process it graphically.
Moodboard, as the result is called, then expresses our personal style and relationship to the graphic representation.
Thinking about the graphic side of the styling is also important.
The stylist not only nourishes physically, but also creates, for example, so-called product pages in magazines (for specific terms of reference, such as trendy handbags, coats, etc.).
This was told by the stylist and designer Mario Kameník.
But that's not until Sunday.
Stylist must have a general overview
Saturday's lecture charged with information about the types of characters was sparked by three industry-specific guests.
Stylist Honza Pokorný, fashion designer Jakub Polanka and fashion photographer Ben Renč.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and a stylist should be able to take advantage of it.
And a skilled stylist can work with one piece of clothing in different ways.
Variability is crucial in this case.
For example, a trench coat (or if you want originally trenchcoat) can be worn classically over jeans and a T-shirt like a cloak, but you can also dress it on the bare body, put on pumps and take pictures of it as a dress.
Or just roll up the sleeves or collars and the whole look looks different.
"Play with it," he emphasized.
But I praised the following advice the most: "You need to know the rules perfectly for the job."
"Then you can start breaking them," Jakub said.
Finally, I can see why we are crushing down all the precepts, what to combine with, for what, why, when we sometimes see something else in fashion magazines.
Not to mention the shows.
Thanks to photographer Ben, I know that the stylist must have many more clothing options ready than they can take pictures.
So with the fashion story, which will be ten pages (that is, ten outfits), I have to be ready to "run" at least fifteen.
And also that in the photo of the outfit looks and works in combination with other pieces quite differently than in reality.
So we have to expect that when creating the outfit.
That image and style sometimes does up to half the success was confirmed by Honza Pokorný.
Just look at Madonna, who is not exactly a miraculous singer, but her image and marketing have made her a world-class star.
In the Czech Republic, so far, access to the use of stylists' services has been rather cold.
Even the familiar faces sometimes find it unnecessary (it is enough that I can do something, the way I look at it, the second-rate).
And if someone has already had a styling made by us, then we are to expect to be highly likely to dictate a completely different (smaller) size to it.
Then there's nothing to do but Google and see if the tabloids wrote about the fact that the celebrity had grown/did shea down, and the like.
Both Honza and Mario were telling us on Sunday that it was not enough for the stylist to navigate fashion and to be able to put together an outfit.
In his work, he primarily communicates with the people he dresses, and so it is important to be a good psychologist.
Being able to judge people, not to get undergone, to stand up for your opinion.
"If you're ordered by a manager to sort out her wardrobe and add nice pieces to her, you can't throw out her the whole closet and say, my God, that's terrible."
"Find at least a few things that you will praise and recommend what they are to wear for," says Mario.
He also specifically showed us what the so-called "placovka" or set bag must contain.
It's the one you turn around the waist and you have all the necessary propriety.
In addition to clear things such as scissors, a roller for hairs or closing pins, there is also a nylon thread (with which the stylist helps himself to take pictures of products such as handbags or hats), special clips to tap back of the outfit if it is larger (the pin or other clam is not allowed, they would damage the garment), or the sewing.
So we wouldn't just listen, but actually tried something out, we learned how to get your shoe right.
Even with a photo shoot in the studio where the surface is flat, the sole could be damaged, let alone outdoors.
So we glue and glue.
We mustn't touch the shoes with scissors, so they don't accidentally get damaged.
So it takes really skill.
Mario was pleased to be complimented on my creation without reservation.
The aforementioned skill is really not my friend.
This is just a tiny fraction of what we heard about the second weekend continuation of the course.
It's becoming more and more clear to me that it's not really a cakewalk in the park to be styling on a professional level, no matter what anyone says.
In Need for Speed: The Run, there's a race across America.
Review
The initially carefree ride, due to a series of completely unnecessary lazy lazy mistakes, turns into a routine morning ride to the shift.
The ambitions have largely been fulfilled, but it is no avail when no one seemed to want to do anything extra.
The new episode, subtitled The Run, attracted high expectations before it was released.
He promised to move the years-long Need for Speed racing series again in a new direction, appearing from playable previews as a game that might not just be in the number of numbers in the genre of action racing.
We were also curious to see how the inserted passages would turn out, in which the main character would get out of the car and run his own way.
But, as is customary with the NFS series, much is a bit different in the end than we expected.
These are potentially decent arcade races, but the whole is dragging down some unnecessary errors that have been appearing in the series for more or less for several years.
So it's not really even mistakes, but rather a manifestation of some incomprehensible laziness of developers.
The adventure begins very well.
You are inducted into a story whose main character, Jack, has some personal problems and is offered as a solution to participate in an illegal race across America.
You get behind the wheel on the West Coast in San Francisco and your job is to arrive first in New York.
The idea brings with it some interesting elements.
The route is divided into ten stages, and then more than fifty races.
It follows that each race is run on a different track and the stages are set in different, sufficiently different and interesting environments.
It doesn't feel for a moment that the game would offer the same thing all the time.
In addition, some of the backgrounds are very pretty to look at, even though the technical level of graphics matches the previous episodes of the series.
So it's not a big deal.
But driving across the desert, the autumn landscape or high in the snowy mountains feels very pleasurable visually.
In addition, the races are enhanced from time to time by some atypical element.
In the desert, for example, you get stuck in a sandstorm that reduces visibility considerably.
In the mountains, on the other hand, you have to be careful not to be swallowed by an avalanche.
Alongside this, the individual races are pretty well in a row.
There are only a few types of them, but that's enough.
For a while you try to overtake the required number of rivals (basically a classic race), then catch up again (the classic duel with the stopwatch) and then there is a duel with a single opponent waiting for you.
This is still the police who make your whole effort even further unpleasant in the making.
The new feature are the passages outside the car.
Rather, it's just interactive animations, with Jack mostly fleeing from someone and you have to help him do it by printing the right buttons in the right moments.
Nothing complicated.
But it comes as a surprise that there are far fewer of these passages in the game than you would have expected (specifically perhaps only three).
In the end, however, it is to the benefit of the cause, because this element has no chance of becoming annoying and, in the context of the above, thus ranks among the elements that make the game more interesting.
The driving model follows in the footsteps of previous episodes.
That means it's definitely not something these days, but you can't say it's a downswing.
If you are looking for a realistic simulation, you will have to look elsewhere.
But the more acclaimed racing of the local driving model still suits quite well, even though we could find a better one for the competition.
So far, therefore, everything is in perfect order.
But problems are starting to emerge after a while.
Unlike the driving model, the collision model is no longer very well.
We don't expect a game of this type to count the complex deformations and collisions, but if you have no idea before any crash into any object how your car will behave, then I guess everything is not quite right.
Typically, when you're overtaking or passing cars in normal traffic, you'll sometimes just lick each other lightly, but at other times in an almost identical situation, your car ends up in wild pirouettes.
Or even just fuck off.
Thanks to the reboots system, it doesn't particularly matter, but it will make you feel special.
The reboggarts are designed so that if you smash or go far out of the track, the game will throw you back to the last clue point on the track.
But there are only five of the reboots available in each race.
If you exhaust them, you have to start the race again from the beginning.
It is, therefore, a kind of aid in case something goes wrong than being able to rely on them in a downright way.
Sometimes, however, even the reboots don't help, solving them only when the need to learn the given section of the race from memory.
The big ailment of the game is that the same things often happen in the same places.
For example, some turns need to be driven in a specific way, otherwise you simply can't fit into them.
Other times, you will meet "civil" cars in the same configuration at a given location, whether you arrive there first, fifth, five seconds earlier or a minute later.
It will be particularly annoyed in situations where you see the opponent driving easily between the two oncoming cars in front of you, while when you get there, the cars are already in such a position that you have to drive around or brake them.
It doesn't matter when you reach them, because it's "calculated" so that the situation is always happening just in front of your nose.
Rivals have another advantage.
Throughout the playing time, you will come across several places where, again, no matter what time, you are always overtaken by the same opponent in the same place.
It hits the most in the end of the game on the long bridge, where you drive in the opposite direction.
The opponent must obviously get there in front of you at any price.
When he rides in front of you, he's making you worse the overview of oncoming cars, so you'll probably get a few times over there at first.
It is possible to understand the intention to make the game more exciting and adrenaline-fuelled, but the execution is so obvious that it will quickly disgust you with reliability.
And it's a shame, because despite the simple driving model, the playing is fun and, in places, so action-packed that sometimes you literally can't keep track of where what's flying.
And it doesn't really matter whether it's the credit of a concept with fifty unique tracks, gearing up races so that boredom doesn't stand a chance or anything else.
An unconventional idea is to replace cars during races.
You have to be careful of the gas stations by the roads, because that's where you can change the car, even though in the vast majority of cases you can do with what you're having right now.
The cars are divided into three categories.
The sports cars are suitable for urban areas, heavy American highway bumps and exotic supersports for technical riding, for example, on winding mountain roads.
With the main story mode goes hand in hand with the challenge mode, which are races in individual locations you know from the story.
Here you get not only medals, but also experience points in your profile, which is common to the challenges and the story.
For obtaining a higher level of driver, different items are unlocked: from the cars to the background for the profile.
It is also again linked to the online feature Autolog, which, among other things, compares your achieved results with other players and provides additional community functions.
One of the other hard-to-understand kicks is the situation of the last race in the story.
With your car you will get to the subway tunnel (be) where you are in the dark by the rails (be).
The number between 150 and 200 km/h (let) you flash on the speedometer, and in that, a subway train comes in from behind and uncompromisingly scraps you.
In the newsroom, we will probably still have a few more discussions about whether no one really thought a little when creating the game, or whether the authors think of us as really such a big jerk.
The technical side of the game is nothing extra, but at least the overall visual impression is in most cases very pleasant and, in a few cases, even great.
It freezes so much that in some of the more tense imaging drops, in some cases quite tragically.
But it mainly concerns crashes with more participants, when smooth imaging would no longer be of any use to you.
The sound side is fine and the soundtrack is a matter of taste.
In an attempt to appeal to the widest range of rather younger audiences, the soundtrack from the category of "every dog a different village" was created, but it can be assumed that, because of listening to music, the game will probably not be bought.
The overall impression of Need for Speed: The Run is so highly embarrassed.
If the game were to avoid completely unnecessary errors, then we would not be afraid to say that The Run is the best part of the NFS in the last few years.
This is how the game feels unfinished.
Fun is certainly fine, but be prepared to be framed in the eyes of the speed of airport headlights.
Singing choirs of UK to be heard at concert Students of Velvet
The combination of the celebrations of the International Day of Student and the Anniversary of the Velvet Revolution with a musical experience is offered for the third time by the Festa Academica festival.

Ambassador to the EU Vicen:
Czechs have a reputation for negativeists and Eurosceptics
"The Treaty of Lisbon has significantly upset the balance between the institutions."
"I didn't expect it to be such a tough war."
"It will take five, six years for the situation to stabilise a bit, calm down and before all the players get used to their new roles," Czech Ambassador to the European Union Ambassador to the European Union, Helena Vicen, began her lecture at the Faculty of Law.
In the first part of the lecture she took her motto "Incliferably and openly about Europe" was already shown in the first part of the lecture, when she managed to describe the various EU institutions and their relations in such a clear and comprehensible way that a number of lecturers from the Faculty of Law of Charles University could envy her.
Viceen also praised the work of the new Permanent European Council President Herman Van Rompuy:
"At first there was criticism that it was bland, that he was a grey official, that he could perform no role, and I have to say that it took everyone's breath away, that he had performed well for the role."
"He is a man who can listen to the 27 or seven Member States, communicate excellently with them, and has a clear vision of where the European Union should go."
She then explained the new post of High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy as an answer to the question: 'Who is this European Union? Which phone number should I call?", that is, as a major step toward unifying and more readability of the EU policy towards states such as China or India.
Nobody wants to ban us from whelks
Vice has also addressed the agenda that the European Council has lived, lives and will live in the near future.
The previous year's Czech Presidency was described as a success.
The Czechs dealt with the emerging financial crisis, resolved the gas crisis or held a summit for the Eastern Partnership.
The fall of the government at this time was described as a major negative, which damaged the Czech Republic very badly.
The Czech representation in the EU is currently very busy.
In the words of the ambassador, "eplace the rush" was not only the Presidency but also the ensuing financial crisis, which is still being addressed today.
In addition, the new seven-year budget of the Union has yet to be approved, which is being significantly complicated because of the current economic situation.
Whether the budget will be lean and economical, which sectors will take precedence, which countries will be supported more and which are less, all on the agenda for future negotiations.
The ambassador also recalled her main slogans with which she came to Brussels: 'On Europe in a clear way'.
"I really don't like ugly shortcuts, foreign words, lingo, that no one understands.
How is a citizen to understand that there really are no curved or round cucumbers in Brussels, bananas of different sizes, or that we really have to be banned from the whelks."
It also wants to make better use of the EU environment and to bring more Czechs to the European institutions.
We are in for a multi-speed Europe
According to the ambassador, the Czechs have a reputation as Eurosceptics and people who notices the negative rather than the positive aspects of the matter.
In addition, it is annoyed by the low representation of Czechs in the European institutions.
A lot of factors are to blame, such as the modesty of our candidates, their inability to write motivational letters, but also low support from the Czech side.
In addition to the successful Czech Presidency, she highlighted the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Four.
"Believe me, if the Pole and the Hungarian come to me and the Slovak is coming, the Frenchman next to me will say, "Hey, what are you seeing, what's your Visegrad Four again?" and he doesn't look at it enthusiastically."
In the future, according to Vicen, the Union is mainly facing new tough rules on the budget policies of the Member States.
He sees the concept of a two-speed, if not multi-speed, Europe, as very real, rather than a new "European federation."
"We have eurozone countries and countries outside the eurozone."
"We have the space of Schengen, we already have an institute of enhanced cooperation."
"For the first time, it was said that only the countries they wanted and the ones they didn't want to work together to be standing nearby."
"There will be more of these institutes and it will be a strongly two-speed Europe," Vicenová expects.
In this respect, it also praised the role of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuy in promoting the principle that all the topics that have an impact on the whole of the Union are to be discussed between all the Member States, not only between the euro area countries.
Brand story:
The IBM innovator begins the second century of its existence
If someone were looking for a word that would most accurately express IBM's strategy, the closest thing would be "long-term."
For the general public, IBM is a symbol of the technological revolution, the company is perceived as very contemporary, and yet it has been a century since its inception.
The basis of this long-termism was laid by the company's first chief executive, the visionary Thomas J. Watson Sr.
He has already coined the slogan that many of the world's problems can be easily solved if people are willing to think.
His slogan, "Think!", was thus a print imprint around which the future giant's life (and also the name of an internal magazine that began to be published in IBM in 1935).
It was also the basis of Watson's carefully constructed corporate culture.
"For us IBM, long-term thinking means a continuous move towards the future.
IBM survived and prospered for a century because it remained loyal to its basic values while not afraid to change everything else around it.
This allowed us to transform technology, business and society during our first century.
We hope to be able to achieve even more in the second hundred," the company's current director, Samuel J. Palmisano.
Elaborate system
Watson approached the care of his employees in the 1930s in the same way as entrepreneur Bata in the Czech Republic - the people of IBM were one of the first U.S. employees with paid leave, insurance from the employer, plus an elegant employee uniform, and a sophisticated system to reward the best inventors and merchants alike.
The same elaborate long-term IBM has a relationship with the customer.
The company was brilliant at the extraction of talent from the start - as one of the world's first companies, it abolished any discrimination, so it could choose.
In line with the anti-discrimination strategy, the current plan is to be replaced by a woman - Virginia Rometty - at the forefront of IBM next year.
She has been with IBM for 30 years, still holding the position of head of sales, marketing and strategy.
In recent years, IBM has been doing so-called jams, online brainstorming, from which many future strategies and innovations arose.
No wonder there are enough ideas - there are nearly half a million people working at the company.
Institution with a good name
The firm's firm position in the business is provided by its strong internal and external image.
"From the beginning, IBM had the concept of the institution rather than just a technology company," Harvard Business School and author of the book's book, told the Economist by the Harvard Business School, an author about IBM, by Rosabeth Moss Kanter.
"IBM is not a technology company, but a company that helps solve business problems using technology," added George Colony of the consulting firm Forrester Research.
As the company itself says, it is the difference between entering the market and thus creating the market outright.
IBM - or "The Great Blue," as it has been familiarly dubbed because of its logo in the United States - has grown into one of the world's largest companies in a century.
It is perhaps the most versatile technology company - developing hardware and software, infrastructure, hosting and consulting services in the range of products from pootechnology servers.
It holds the most patents of any U.S. technology company, and five of its employees won the Nobel Prize.
Her invention includes an ATM, a credit card, a financial swap, a barcode or a floppy disk.
IBM, with some $220 billion, became the second-largest technology company by market capitalization this year (the first is Apple) when it overtook Microsoft for the first time since 1996.
View forward
Not all products and innovations hit the taste of customers and times - for example, IBM failed to bet on its own OS/2, Prodigy's online or IBM PCjr computers.
"If your business is built on the forward movement, you can't attach yourself emotionally to the past," Samuel J. Palmisano.
That's why IBM has no problem building its foundations on many platforms - and if they don't work, leave them.
Unlike, say, rival Microsoft, which essentially stands and falls on the Windows operating system.
Perspective technology
Services accounted for the largest share of IBM's sales, with software and hardware accounting for about a fifth.
At the same time, as recently as 1990, he was the most powerful representative of the hardware with more than half a share.
Since 2000, IBM has sold $15 billion worth of low-yielding assets, investing $58 billion over the same time to buy prospective technologies.
Investment has continued since 2008, when the modern financial crisis swept the world for the first time.
IBM is acting according to the legacy of its first chief, Thomas J. Watson, who also increased investment during the Great Depression.
So far, IBM seems to be going through the current crisis intact.
IBM's share price has risen by a rocket 120 percent since the beginning of 2008, with the company's net profit steadily rising.
IBM's corporate password is to change everything, just not your values.
It can therefore be expected that even if there is another crisis, this flexible giant can handle it.
History IBM: From cheese slices to space flights
IBM (International Business Machines) was founded in New York a century ago, originally called Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
It did not take over the name IBM until 1924 - originally a brand used for the company's branches in Canada and South America.
The basis for the later IBM was given by the merger of four companies, whose history dates back to the eighties of the nineteenth century.
They owned technology such as the famous "sticks," the hours-recording staff's arrival and departure.
The architect of the new firm was businessman Charles Ranlett Flint, who also chaired the company's supervisory board until 1930.
Flint hired the head of rival firm, Thomas J. Watson to help him run the company.
The leader then overshadowed the founder of IBM - Watson's ideas are still built on Watson's unbeatable corporate culture and identity.
Watson ran the company until 1952.
IBM, as its name suggests, started with the production and sale of all sorts of machines for the business - from meat and cheese slices to cash registers.
In the first four years that Watson ran the company to head, turnover to $9 million doubled and the company's widespread expansion into all continents began.
Watson was so indispensable for the company that after nearly forty years in the chief's chair, he was succeeded by his son, Thomas Watson Jr.
Under his leadership, IBM began work on the development of artificial intelligence, developing the first programming language.
In the 1960s, people and computers from IBM helped NASA manage space flights - the Mercury, Saturn, and the famous human moon flight in 1969.
Meanwhile, in 1964, IBM developed the first computer family - the IBM System/360, series.
The classic "pécéka," which established the computer standard of the time, called the IBM 5150, came on the market in 1981.
Twenty years later, IBM sold the computer production to the Chinese company Lenovo, on the contrary, it bought the consultant's part of PricewaterhouseCoopers and began to devote itself to high-value-added consultancy and services.
A strategy that has paid off for the past three years by IBM is the Smarter Planet concept, the "smarter planets."
Its aim is to make smart use of technologies in hitherto or not planned areas and to improve the situation in, for example, transport or urban management.
For the trade sector, the IBM recently introduced the "Smarter Commerce" platform, which helps merchants manage the entire commercial cycle.
IBM also has a strong history in the Czech Republic.
She founded her branch in Czechoslovakia in what was then Czechoslovakia in 1932 as the first country in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, in addition to IBM, the Czech Republic also operates a strategic outsourcing centre in Brno.
The Central Centre for Central and Eastern Europe is based in Prague and there is also a world-class research team dedicated to voice recognition.
Rychtářová on the unfaithful husband:
Iveta, you don't want to do the donkey again!
Darina Rychtářová (53) said the end!
After her husband Josef Rychtář (53) became not only the protector of Iveta Bartošová (45), but also the lover, Darina still hoped that Joseph would wake up from the pink dream and come home.
But now he no longer intends to wait, and she has set clear rules for the next life.
"Pepa can come home, but not as my partner," Rychtářová explained.
When Darina Rychtářová granted asylum to Bartošová's house in the summer, she did not seem to dream how her marriage would end in the end.
Despite the fact that Iveta moved out of Říčany at her urging after 30 days, Pepa did not leave the singer.
He even publicly admitted that he loved her.
Over time, Darina resigned, had taken a sudden acceptance of her husband's relationship, and now even said goodbye to him forever.
Quickkeepers don't care who his wife sleeps with
If the speedster and Bartošová had broken up once, his wife's open arms would not be waiting for him at home.
"He is the biological father of my sons, and if he wants to live his life in our shared house, no one will expel him."
"He will, however, be reared by him not as my beloved, stray old donkey, but as a person with whom I have certain ties," Rychtářová said, noting that she has already detained herself from her husband and insists only on mutual decency.
Joseph didn't mind the fact that Darina had closed his back door.
"I respect the wife's decision."
"I will be with Iveta, and I'm not going to change it."
"My wife set up a paper marriage, and I respect that."
"The company goes on, I take care of repairs, the garden, the property, I buy."
'Daina and I talk to each other perfectly normally, only we don't share a bed,' said the Quickwalker.
If the speedster also found a new love, she said, she would not stop her.
"We don't sleep together, and I don't care where he's going, who he's going with, and if he has a boyfriend.
I know it's my fault, I fell in love with Iveta and I take all the responsibility," Josef concluded.
Worst female bad habits: Do they concern you?
If you ask the men if they could list any typical female habits, they generally all into one of them are very promptly sprinkled out of the sleeve.
Dear women, will you know each other in the following lines, which lists several female bad habits that can perfectly pump up men's blood in their veins?
Shopping
Does your other half blame you for being addicted to shopping?
Do you have to buy at least one cloth a week?
Do you like to buy in bulk at discounts?
Then, in your case, you can talk about shopping as a bad habit.
Some women are aware that they should at least restrain their buying passion a little.
But tell me, which would resist just walking around in clothing stores, looking for well-fitting tops, and then try them all (ideally in different colours) in the stalk?
While shopping is a hobby for most women, it can literally become a hell of a man.
Just remember how many times you've told your parents to wait for you in front of the entrance...
Constant dissatisfaction
"I'm not too fat?"
"I need to lose at least five kilos - should I start exercising?"
"Do you even like me?"
Don't these sentences remind you of anything?
Isn't it?
Then you're one of those women who's obsessed with the way they look.
Not that you should stop taking care of yourself, but a lot of men are downright allergic to how their partners complain about their looks all the time.
The stronger sex also agrees that the more the frequency of this complaining increases, the more annoying women become.
Order and cleanliness first
It's like an endless carousel.
Washing windows, vacuuming, mopping the pavement, dusting, scrubbing the tub - at least twice a week.
Do you blame your partner for stepping on the clean pavement with his dirty foot, to the children's for soiling the scrubbed sink and cherishing the glassing living room, with the polishing of which you went to so much trouble?
In case you suffer from this "dango," try to realize that nothing should be exaggerated and order and cleanliness should definitely not be the first place within the family.
This harmless desire for purity can jeopardize your interrelationship between your relations and your family well-being.
Rake
"Get the used shorts in the trash."
"Are you going to wear those old socks tomorrow?"
"A wet dish towel doesn't belong on the ground."
If you dig into your partner like this several times a day, know that you can reliably dial it up.
Of course you don't mean any harm, you want to make sure everything is in order.
Maybe if men knew, the women wouldn't have to dig that much at them...
The slandering, the scratching
For some women, gossip, gossip, but also are insulted and collied against someone.
Women are focused on relationships, so they like to discuss things like who, where, with whom, how and why.
Perhaps each of us will release a little harmless gossip or gossip and out.
Hand on heart, it's my own to all women.
But the opposite is the gossip of the grossest grain, which they like to gossip and waste, perhaps despis each and are particularly dangerous to their surroundings - especially within the female workstation.
Jagr and Voracek helped with assists to win Philadelphia
Hockey forward Jaromir Jagr has had two assists in Philadelphia's 5-3 win at Carolina in Monday's NHL game and is once again at the top of the Czech players' productivity in the competition.
The 39-year-old star's list was mined both times by Claude Giroux, who added one more pass and was named the game's best player.
Two assists in the match were also scored by Jágrův's teammate Jakub Voracek.
After the match, Jagr told overseas journalists that he had predicted Giroux a big night.
"I told him before the game that he was going to score a hat trick."
"I felt it."
"Sometimes you feel that feel like that comes over," explained Jagr, after whose action Giroux scored a goal from the Flyers' first shot.
Moments later, the team's second hit was also a Czech footprint.
Voracek won the rebound behind the Hurricanes goal and presented it between the rings to the scoring Maxim Talbot.
A second before the first break, home player Patrick Dwyer was reduced in a weakened position, but the start of the second period again belonged to the Flyers.
Specifically, the Giroux.
After working with Jagr, he scored his third goal, then his shot was converted by Wayne Simmonds in the fourth goal.
"I love playing with him."
"I don't want to say he's the best player in the league, but he's definitely one of the top three," said Jagr of his center.
"I never thought I'd play with a hockey player like him at the end of my career."
"That's what I'm happy about."
"I want to play him."
"All those years in the NHL, my teammates were trying to play me, now it's turning to it," Jagr added.
Carolina still made drama out of the game, with a goal from Tuom Ruut, and again Dwyer, who broke through from the penalty spot, came within one goal.
But another complication was not made by Matt Read, who finished outnumbering two to one.
"He made a great impact in our Pronger band."
"He punched the puck, I picked up speed and (Read) drove to the far pole."
"I tried to hit him and I'm glad it worked out," said Voracek, describing the last goal of the game from his point of view.
Philadelphia's victory took the lead in the Eastern Conference.
Montreal's Czech defenseman Jaroslav Špaček did not finish the game against Buffalo, withdrew in the second period due to an upper-body injury.
Candiens lost a two-goal lead alongside the experienced back and lost a penalty shootout 2-3.
One of their raids was not converted by Tomas Plekanec.
The home coach was annoyed by the extensive sickbay of the back-row, with only five defenders finishing the game.
"It's bad."
"We only played the game with one experienced player, the rest were youngsters."
"But there's just nothing you can do about it, we have to deal with it," Jacques Martin said.
"The alternation after the rotation was coming at us and we couldn't resist."
"We should have simplified the game more, moving the puck from our zone."
We had gaps in that," added one of the defensemen P. K. Subban.
Czech goaltender Ondřej Pavelec contributed 30 saves for Winnipeg in a 5-2 win over Tampa Bay.
The Jets' goals, which were interrupted by a five-game losing streak, were shared by five different scorers.
How tour prices have evolved since 1989
Until 1989, only five state travel agencies were allowed in Czechoslovakia at the time: Čedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist.
At the time, travel agencies overwhelmingly sold only trips to the socialist bloc countries, as travel to the west was very limited.
Czech tourists thus travelled on holiday to the sea to the GDR (German Democratic Republic), the Soviet Union (Sochi in Crimea by the Black Sea), Bulgaria, Romania (both to the Black Sea) and Hungary (the Balaton).
The bright exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, when it was also possible to travel to Yugoslavia, but then the Yugoslav regime went to the West and the trips of Czech tourists to Yugoslavia were subsequently very limited.
The great paradox of the time of socialism was that the citizens of the socialist bloc (i.e. also the Czechoslovaks) were not allowed to travel freely individually even within socialist countries.
In case a citizen of Czechoslovakia wanted to travel individually to, for example, Poland or the Soviet Union, he needed an invitation letter from this country, otherwise the individual way was not possible.
Travel agents at the time also offered tours to the West, but it was necessary to queue up overnight with a sleeping bag or have "good acquaintances" in the travel agency.
Even so, it was not won.
The so-called foreign exchange promise, which was a condition for travel to the West, was not given to "politically unreliable people" who were thus unable to travel at all.
The Czechoslovak currency was not a freely convertible currency, so without the foreign exchange promise it was not possible to raise funds (the Western currency) to travel to the West.
However, the most frequently spent the Czechs vacationing in the Czech Republic, resulting in a large number of cottages and cottages that the Czechs acquired and this custom survives to this day.
The travel of the Czechs has thus experienced a real revolution since 1989.
While until 1989 holidays in the GDR or Bulgaria were our maximum, last year the Czechs spent 4.5 million holidays abroad in countries around the world.
A huge paradox, which we are no longer aware of today, is that it was not possible to travel freely to us in the most popular Croatia at the moment, as it was part of what was then Yugoslavia.
Early in the 1990s, the visa requirement was lifted to neighbouring Western European countries, triggering a huge wave of short-term visits to Austria's Vienna or Germany in particular.
The Czechoslovaks could not get enough trips to the West for a long time, everyone wanted to at least take a look there for a while.
In Paris, for example, the tours of Czechs slept in parks in tents, as our income at the time did not allow us to pay for a hotel or a guesthouse.
A typical feature of Czechs' travel at this time was to drive their own food, canned food, salami, etc. to save money.
Another important moment was the introduction of a freely convertible Czech crown, which our tourists were able to buy the Western currency freely after many of the years.
But our standard of living, and with it, the average salaries were rising, resulting in another important moment around 1997.
Thanks to the increased demand for travel, travel agents have started to regularly prepare tours with charter air connections since 1997, making air tours incredibly cheaper thanks to the possibility of contracting quantity discounts compared to the past.
By the end of the 1990s, the Czechs already had visa-free travel to virtually all developed countries of the world, except the US, which continued to make our travel easier.
Another interesting moment in the history of post-revolutionary travel came as early as 2000, when, thanks to considerable demand, the first direct charter flight to exotica was dispatched from the Czech Republic, it was to Thailand.
From this year, direct charters fly out with Czech tourists to warm far-off countries, this winter will be flown directly from the Czech Republic to twelve exotic destinations.
Exotic countries are now visited by around 100,000 Czechs a year!
Another interesting moment in this period, which is symbolized by our post-revolutionary development, came in 2008.
On November 17, 2008, the US revoked visas for Czech tourists, and thus our country was finally among the most advanced countries in the world.
In 2008, Czechs also spent more than half of their holidays abroad for the first time in their history (50.3%) and spent more than 15,000 on one foreign holiday, including the cost of the stay, for the first time in their history. CZK per person.
The general meeting is to find the chairman, but again the threat of a stalemate
For almost five months, Czech football is without a chairman and there is a risk that the successor to Ivan Hašek at the head of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FACR) will not be known even after another extraordinary general meeting that will take place on Thursday in Nymburk.
There is still no agreement on which election rules to be followed.
Without it, there will be no vote on which of the three candidates will be elected.
The interest of Czech football is to be played by Jindřich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Paclík.
Hasek resigned in office in June and, as he left, called on colleagues to unite and find a strong figure to lead football in the future.
But in the post-Hass era, football slipped back to the fight between the two Solarian chambers, which cannot agree on a common candidate.
This was fully demonstrated on 16 September, when the new chairman was to be chosen.
Delegates of the general meeting came to the National House in Prague in Smíchov in needlessly, as the negotiations remained blocked and it was not just a matter of choice.
Nor was there to be a consensus on who has the right to actually vote on the pile - whether only the statutory representatives or even the functionaries credentials of the power of attorney.
At this one point on that single point, a partial consensus has since been helped, helped by the recommendation of the Constitution for the State and the law, according to which representation on the basis of a power of attorney is not possible.
But there are still controversy over the electoral code.
Not too clear in the situation has been brought to the situation by the Executive Committee, which is already addressing virtually nothing else at its meetings, whether regular or extraordinary.
The view of the choice has changed several times, but the neuralgic point is still the same.
The question is: how to proceed in the 3rd round to avoid the possibility of a heel?
"The dispute is whether to proceed in accordance with the statutes or to find another model," stated one of the three vice-presidents of the FACR, Dušan Svoboda, who represents professional football in the association's leadership.
According to the statutes of the proposed model in the third round, the candidate who will have more percentage support in the chamber for which he is running will win.
Moravia is reportedly willing to take a concession to win a candidate who receives a higher total of the votes from both chambers.
And the Czech side advocates the condition that the winner must obtain at least a two-thirds advantage at this percentage count.
"But then it would make sense of the two previous rounds, that would completely negate the bicameral concept," the Freedom Party of Moravian understands, according to which it would be best to disown the order and vote according to the existing statutes.
Tomáš Paclík agrees with this, somewhat surprisingly, although it is estimated that the statutes determined by the electoral code suit Pelt the most of all the candidates.
"I wish you to vote at most according to the statutes."
"Not to make up any of the proxy nonsense as at the last general meeting," said the owner of Viktoria Plzeň, who is running for the first time and in his comments he defined himself primarily against Pelt.
Pelta remains optimistic.
In Nymburk, he said, the new chairman would be known and believe the candidates would work constructively together in the future.
"All passions will be reassured by the national team's possible progress at the European Championships today."
"Football will be on a happy streak again, there will be more willingness to work together," says the Jablonec official, who has the most experience in managing football at both professional and regional level.
Rajchl is more restrained.
"I hope for a deal, but unfortunately the situation is very ambivalent."
"It's not between people from Bohemia and Moravia, but there are efforts to purposefully adapt the regulations."
"This may cause the blocking of the general meeting to happen again."
"I hope, however, that common sense will prevail," said Rajchl.
There is little time left for the agreement of all parties.
Some of the negotiations were supposedly to take place directly in Montenegro, but who knows whether the football generalism will be complete by the match at all.
The aerial special, in which the vice-presidents Dalibor Kučera and Rajchl, among others, were to travel to Podgorica, did not leave Prague in the morning due to a technical malfunction and a replacement option was sought to transport part of the Executive Committee to the venue of the barrage retaliation.
Finally, a ministerial-level meeting may be crucial, which may be reportedly on Wednesday.
The Minister of Education, Youth and Sports, Josef Dobeš, would like to get the ambivalent parties within the country's strongest sports association to agree.
There is a lot at play: state subsidies, the credibility of football and also the forthcoming general meeting of ČSTV, which will address the new direction of Czech sport after Sazka's financial problems.
Paclík goes to battle for the chairman because he doesn't see a suitable candidate
Had the head of the Pilsen Pilsen, Tomáš Paclík, before the extraordinary general meeting, saw a strong candidate who would have met all his ideas about the new chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FAČR), he would not have entered the fight for the top job.
"If there is a quality adept, I fight for him and I'm not going to the poll."
"But in the current situation, no one like this has been found," Paclík told the Czech Press Agency.
In the fight with Miroslav Pelta and Jindřich Rajchl, Paclík is being motivated to try to stop Pelt, the alleged favourite of the election, from trying to get away from his way to the FACR leadership.
Paclík also stresses that, if he won, he would only last until 2013, when a proper general meeting is on the agenda.
In the position he would like to see an experienced and top manager who is not very attached to football events.
"I have spoken to some of the people who would be considered."
"It was crazy for me when some said that at the moment they did not even want to identify with Czech football."
"I would like to change that view," he said.
Paclík is said to be most bothered by Pelt's association with the chairman of the Pilsen Regional Football Association, Roman Berbre, a man with a controversial reputation who is known behind the scenes as a powerful lobbyist with the ability to influence the delegate's vote at the general meeting.
It is so unacceptable for Paclík to stand in the chairmanship position.
"If he won, the current state of affairs would be mothballed and nothing would move forward in football."
"Combined with the support of Berbro, who is a skilled businessman, it would not have benefited football even more," Paclík said.
He also alludes to the fact that Pelt's name was mentioned years ago in the wiretaps in the investigation of the corruption scandal, but from which Pelta went unpunished.
"I don't know the prestige of football Pelt's victory would bring."
"And as we would look in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA," said Paclík, who is also taking in his former statement that he would "sell the Pilsen club if Pelta became chairman."
In the event that Paclík triumphed in Thursday's election, he could imagine future cooperation with Pelta.
So is another candidate, Rajchl, whom Paclík supported before the September general meeting, which ended in a fiasco.
"He (Pelta) would be the first person I'd go to."
"He has great powers."
"I could have imagined him as the head of the national team."
"But he couldn't manage the association managerially."
"I also don't have my nose where I can't," said Paclík, who drew great attention in September by the fact that he was behind the dismissal of the referees' committee headed by Luďk Macela, who was replaced by Dagmar Damk.
Paclík says he would dare to run the association.
He refers to his ability to manage private companies, and since last summer he has also headed Pilsen, which celebrated its premier league triumph with its support in May.
"I have the strength to make a difference in the football environment, to contribute to a certain cultivation of it."
"To limit the influences of some interest groups, which need to be influenced by the disciplinary and appellate board, which goes all the way to disgusting situations," said Paclík, who makes no secret of his antipathy to Spartan boss Daniel Křetínský, for example.
He would also consider one of the priorities to be the strengthening of the relations of the FACR with the Czech Olympic Committee, with which he would lobby for political leaders to receive more money from the lottery tax in sport.
"It's one of the key things the new chairman should be addressing."
"If gambling is taxed, as the political parties declare, I understand their reasoning, but they must be honest with where the money will go," he noted.
As a liability, Paclík now does not take his connection with the Pilsen club, although he claims that the president of the FACR should be "suprano."
Pelta is again connected with Jablonec, Rajchl with Prague's Dukla.
"It's not ideal."
"But I don't even see the point of transferring to someone hypocritically transferring their shares in the Pilsen club and go back there in a year and a half," Paclík said.
Pelta promised new FACR statutes to rule out electoral stares
Two days before the Football Association's general meeting, one of the candidates for chairman, Miroslav Pelta, promised to make the cut, if elected, to make a new statute for the FACC, which would ultimately rule out disputes over the electoral code in the future.
The Jablonec official is optimistic ahead of Thursday's meeting in Nymburk and believes the election fight will be significantly dampened by the potential success of the football team today.
Pelta had already promised before the September non-realized election that he intended to concentrate on the representation and fundraising if elected.
He decided to go to the last-minute election before the previous general meeting, so the two-month delay could be useful to him to defend his ideas about the football management and present him in a broader context.
"People at all levels have been doing football for a long time and expect the chairman to be known on Thursday."
"It feels it is high time for someone to lead the association," says the man, who is mainly associated with the Jablonec club, but who served for many years in Sparta and the executive committee of the union.
That is why he believes he has enough experience to manage Czech football.
He believes that behind the current problems with the choice is the euphoria that prevailed during the reign of Ivan Hasek.
"Unfortunately, at the General Meeting in June, the statutes were approved that were not as perfect as everyone thought."
"If they didn't allow for different interpretations, we've had the chairman since September," Pelt pointed out.
It was the reworking of the most important document of the civic association that he took as a decoy to the delegates.
"If I become chairman, I'll take it as a personal task, and I'm willing to take personal responsibility if it fails."
"It's a principled thinglessness we can't be without," Pelta says.
He says he tries not to define himself against his rivals.
He had previously announced that he could envisage working with Jindřich Rajch, whom he acknowledges because of his legal training, and he knows well that his opponent would be his first vice-president.
He did not attack for a long time for Tomáš Paclík, who, on the other hand, did not leave the thread dry on Pelt.
"He's been in football for a little over a year, he's had some successes."
"But his attacks were undignified, and he caught a lot of people off guard by the election campaign."
"That's why many of them now doubt his true character," he said of his opponent's address, Pelt, who is said to remain loyal to the proclamations he announced in September.
His strongest weapon, he says, is knowledge of football from the lowest competitions to the national team.
This should be a showcase for football.
"And I'd also try to end all the affairs from the Bohemians case or the repercussions of last year's corruption scandal."
"I would rush to the meeting with the private and state sectors right out to secure enough money for the whole of football," the 46-year-old candidate told the Czech News Agency two months ago.
He also promised then that his arrival at the top of football would not mean any staff purges.
"I would first have to familiarize myself with the duties of individual employees," he said to Strahov, where there is an understandable nervousness from the long limp.
Despite the current catastrophic scenarios surrounding the forthcoming general meeting, he believes the delegates will not travel to Nymburk in vain on Thursday.
"If the only point of contention is how you vote in the third round, then we can get over it."
"Football needs credibility, and he will gain that only by finally having his leader again," Pelta remains optimistic two days before the crucial date of his official career.
Rajchl promises that under him, FAČR would start working hard
If the current Vice-President, Jindřich Rajchl, were elected the new chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic at Thursday's general meeting, many people in the association would say not be pleased.
For, in fact, Rajchl promises that work will start to work hard if he is elected.
It wants to push through systemic changes and make the executive committee members responsible for the various football areas.
He also promised to solve the Bohemians case, improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, bring more money to football and continue the work started by previous chairman Ivan Hašek.
"As chairman, I would like to devote myself to football as a whole."
"From international contacts with UEFA and FIFA to national team, professional football, performance football to youth."
"But I'm not saying I'm doing everything myself," Rajchl said in an interview with the Czech News Agency.
"I am a team player and I want to distribute the competencies on the executive committee so that each member is involved in a certain area."
"And I'll be handing out my homework hard to get a mile ahead of football in each segment."
"I don't think it would make many people happy, because work would start to be really hard and not just criticized for the work of others," he added.
Because of the critical atmosphere in the football movement, he said he had considered not running again.
"I'm known to do 20 hours a day."
"But I need to know that it will make sense and that I will not have people behind me who will constantly throw a spanner in my life and question my every move," he said, explaining why he hesitated.
"But many people told me I couldn't give up, because then others would give up."
"This is a trust that I cannot just throw away," he said.
He is said to be motivated by the continuation of the work he began with Hasek.
"A great deal of work has been done over the past two years, and I don't want to throw it away now."
"There are trials that will have a reverberation of a few years from now, and I would not like to be stopped by someone," he said with fears that if another candidate, Miroslav Pelta, if the election of another candidate, Miroslav Pelta, the situation on the union could return to the time before Hashk.
"I believe in systematism, and that's the thing I don't think Mirek Pelt can do."
"Behind him, above all, there are people who would do football in such a way that it would only be for the elect."
"A lot of things can be blamed for me, but certainly not that I'm siding with someone."
"I'm trying to be objective."
"I want to do football for everyone, because then everyone will be fine and not just the chosen ones," Rajchl observed.
It also refutes the claim that he would only be the Czech chairman.
"Although some people are trying to say otherwise, I plan to do my best for Moravia."
"For example, it is time to consider dividing the second league into the Czech and Moravian parts, the winners of which would go to the first league."
"It would not be such a current situation where there are only three Moravian teams in the league, which is a problem towards the young players in Moravia," Rajchl said.
As the head of the Pilsen club, Tomáš Paclík, was also involved in the fight for the chairman, Rajchl does not dare to estimate his chances of being elected.
"But I still feel strong support in the Czech Chamber, which elected me as its vice-chairman and sees that there are clear successes behind me," said Rajchl, who sees saving tens of millions of crowns for unfavourable contracts, negotiating televisions and negotiating the lottery law as his achievements.
On the contrary, he makes a co-inspiration that the union does not pull together.
While he claims to be "discredited from returning confidence to Czech football," he considers the second of his opponents, Paclík, a strong candidate who has a lot to offer football.
"No one can dispute that he did a great job in Pilsen that year."
"If he was elected, he would perhaps continue with the things that Ivan Hasek started here, and he would not fundamentally change the staffing in the commissions."
"He wouldn't want to twist it to his advantage," Rajchl says.
Europe's most beautiful swimming pools
Jump to the blue
Julia Stanek
The paddling from the point of view of Ufono, a sumptuous swimming pool in Budapest: Those travelling in Europe can experience their blue miracle - and, after exploring the cities or travelling, let your tired legs rest in the thermal baths.
The book will show where the wellness is the most beautiful by the water.
As Iris Meder made her make the voyage in the past one-and-a-half year, she was not to be absent from her luggage: her swimsuit.
Lying on the water, she looked up at the artistically formed dome, swam across from the marble putti (I'm standing a little naked boy, a child (with wings) waiting for her at the edge of the pool and admiring the carefully restored Art Nouveau swimming pools.
If she liked a swimming pool, she took it in her notebook in an instant - with the remarkable details of the way the building was built and the history of the building.
More than 200 swimming pools were explored in this way by the architecture historian Meder and now present them in her just-released book "Badefreuden (Junkage: People's swimming pools in Munich, the historic palace of swimming pools in the Schwarzwald,"Thevrd Corest Culture of Concrete Construction" in Taunus.
13 countries ran it with her "Tourney to the most extraordinary spa in Central Europe": Alongside Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she visited locations in Italy, France, Bohemia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland - and one city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
The 46-year-old German is a true enthusiast of swimming culture.
It's not too far off with sport, says Meder - it's just something else in the water.
The only thing to say about anger is that swimming fans have to settle for the blue tiles and the smell of chlorine, while runners for health can inhale the intoxicating scent of spruce forests or listen to the hilarious chatter of the birds in the park.
"One day I asked why the swimming pools must always be so ugly," says the living Mrs. Meder, living in Vienna.
"So I started gathering nice swimming pools."
Water level doubles architecture
Splashing in the jumper pool and the essential oils for the sauna - the well-being factor is therefore so great that it affects all the senses, so much to the Meder.
And when the founders tried, the swimming pools can be a real eye-bath: "The floor is in the spa's water level."
"It's both transparent, but on the other hand, it reflects the beauty of the entire building."
Everything is adulse in optically: a tall vault, a colourful tile, a diving boards.
The formworking picture volume "Badefreuden (Steam Preacher)" provides in 190 pages everything that is needed to know about the architectural and cultural history of historical oáz wellnes - but above all, it inspires the desire to jump into the blue.
The remarkable specimens were discovered by the swimming pool collector Ms. Meder during her search in Hungary.
In addition to the beautiful healing spa, like the 100-year-old Széchenyi spa in Budapest, it found nitrate-containing water in the original karst cave (the jeskyna spa in Miskolc-Tapolca) as well as the thermal baths, whose pools are filled with alkaline water and are placed in the shape of a bottle in the shape of a bottle (Városi Termálfürdö in Jászberény).
A beautiful spectacle, on the other hand, is offered by many heated open-air swimming pools in Switzerland and Austria. While you have the city in the eye of the Zurich cityhouse, the outdoor swimming pool of the spa in St. Anton look at the snow-covered Arlberg - and: There is a window in the steam baths from which to watch the traffic on the ski slope.
Perhaps the most remarkable design of the pool is expected by spa guests in Längenfeld: Aquapark Ötztal looks like a ufo that has just landed in the Alps.
From the three uped open pans in the winter, the steam rises as the mountains of Ötztal tower up to the sky in the background.
Alhambra in Schwarzwald
Not in every swimming pool, the pool collector Mrs. Meder rose into the nostrils of the chores.
Many of the thermal baths are felt after the sulphur, in the spa Árpád in Békescsaba, Hungary, it smells of fuel oil to the point where one hardly realises to believe that you have reached the healing spa.
The smell comes from healing water containing alkaline hydrodenhlicates, which is almost black and whose sediment clustles on the skin as soon as one slips into the pool - a rather special wellness experience.
However, one place was also disappointed by Iris Meder in her search for a nice spa: When she wanted to visit the Czech solar and climate baths Luhačovice, she stumbled upon the closed terrain.
In 1902, the architect Dušan Jurkovič's designed spa was closed in the meantime.
When Mrs. Meder looked at the crumbling windows of the red-and-yellow Art Nouveau building, she saw the weeds growing mightily between the tiles.
The demise was built, on the other hand, in the magical swimming pool at the Schwarzwald: Palais Thermal in Bad Wildbad.
These spas have already undergone three phases of construction; one can discover not only the Newroan elements that date from their creation in 1844, but also the Alhambra-style Moorish Hall, which was connected around the r. 1900.
Since the meticulous modernization of 1995, Palais Thermal has been a popular spa place for the swimming pool connoisseur Ms. Iris Meder, and not only because she is from the Schwarzwald.
"It's already a feat, combining such a variety of building styles in such a beautiful complex," says Ms. Meder.
At such a palace, immersion in the thermal pool is apparently a marginal issue.
Agricultural speculation
Deutsche Bank to be vetted by commodity deal
Christian Teevs
Does Deutsche Bank leave its trade in agricultural raw materials?
According to SPIEGEL-ONLINE, Josef Ackermann commissioned a working group to investigate the consequences of speculation for the poor world.
Then, in January, the chief executive of the concern wants to draw the consequences.
Hamburg -
For the federal citizen, the issue is clear: 84% of Germans consider it unacceptable, according to one study, for banks to speculate with agricultural raw materials such as wheat or corn.
Indeed, two-thirds of those surveyed demand that Deutsche Bank and other credit institutions pull out of the deal because it deepens the problems of the poorest world.
This is the result of the Forsa poll on behalf of the consumer organisation Foodwatch.
The study relies on a report presented by Foodwatch in mid-October.
In it, the author, Harald Schumann, shows that betting on global commodity exchanges is driving prices up to the height, and banks are therefore complicit in the world's problem of hunger.
The Consumer Protectorate campaign is specifically aimed at Deutsche Bank chief Josef Ackermann, although also large bans such as Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley act in a similar way.
Originally, commodity betting was intended to make sure traders would insure against price fluctuations.
But in the meantime, most experts agree that capital market participants with an interest in high-risk deals have detrored themselves from supply and demand - and made gains in the poorest's account.
Other than competitors in the United States, Ackermann responded to the criticism: He promised to test the reprimands and said that no deal was "would be worth it to put Deutsche Bank's reputation at stake."
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, the international working group controls the complaints from Foodwatch-Report.
The check is due to be closed by the end of the year, then the results will be presented to the board of directors of Deutsche Bank - along with a recommendation on how to do so.
Then, at the end of January, the bank's leaders want to say what consequences they will draw.
At the end, there could be a reduction in the commodity trade or even a complete rejection.
Ackermann is working on his own image.
Foodwatch's chief executive Thilo Bode welcomed the report, but he also intensified his criticism of the financial sector: "The betting on rising food prices shows particularly drastic how, ruthlessly, banks are now hurting the general well-being."
Let Ackermann, as the top banking lobbyist, live up to the obligation.
"Deutsche Bank must cut all the items that are used for food price bets" from its portfolio, Bode said.
"Despite whether Mr. Ackermann is concerned with starving people or the reputation of Deutsche Bank."
Ackermann's insight seems surprising at first glance, but it is clear that the Concern's chief executive would like to leave the office a perfect picture a few months before he left office.
On Monday, Deutsche Bank announced that the chief executive officer of the board of directors otherwise than planned would not pass to the supervisory board.
By revocating from disputed agrarian speculation, he could improve his image.
And he doesn't have to worry about the potential losses - that should be dealt with in the end by his successor.
One in two would testify to investment in raw materials
Foodwatch is trying to maintain high pressure on the manager.
So far, more than 30,000 internet users have already participated in the organization's campaign.
On Tuesday, Bode released a poll in which 1001 people were interviewed by the Forsa Institute on 7 and 8 November.
It is eleven per cent who consider it legitimate that Deutsche Bank offers investments involving bets on food prices.
Many bank customers would also draw personal consequences if they learned that their bank was involved in such deals: One in two would terminate all investments that the money drains into raw material speculation as a result of the poll.
43 percent would warn of acquaintances of such a bank, 49 percent said they would think about terminating their account and switching to another institution.
21st century house in Vienna
Moved pavilion
Ingeborg Wiensowski
The story of architecture with peaks, falls and a happy ending: The Austrian Pavilion from the World Exhibition in Brussels in 1958 won the awards, became a museum in Vienna, remained empty and deserted.
It is now reopened as a show house.
When it rages for modern post-war architecture, for clear forms, glass halls, bold boomes and new building materials that are typical for faith in technological advances, then the Austrian Pavilion of the architect Karel Schwanzer for the 1958 World Exposition is apt and famous example.
The Schwanzer Pavilion received the Grand Prix d'Architecture for its light and lofty design of steel and glass.
The building is still seen as a milestone in contemporary architecture.
He became famous for the architect to build the pavilion of Austria for the next world exhibition.
With his legendary four-cylinder BMW-palace plus key performed by a secondary structure in Munich, he was finally famous for himself in 1973.
His as a temporary exhibition building, the projected pavilion after the world exhibition was placed in the Schweizer Garten near Vienna's Südbahnhof (Southern Railway Station), and in it they opened the Museum of the 20th Century in 1962 - it was named the "Dench of the 20th Century."
But the building was not suitable for the museum, neither in spatially nor technically - the walls for hanging art exhibits were missing, no compliant climate.
Yet it was used until contemporary art was received in Vienna by a new booth.
Since 2001 the building has been vacant and dilapidated more and more.
Now the architect Adolf Krischanitz has reconstructed the pavilion, now called the "Denny of the 21st Century" and will be used as the Museum of Contemporary Art in the future.
On Tuesday evening, the Museum Belvedere, to which the palace belongs, will open the first exhibition - a happy intention in every respect.
A new start by Agnes Husslein-Arco, who became the new director of the Austrian Gallery Belvedere, has come through.
Husslein-Arco, a graduate art historian with a prominent career, a figure skater in her youth, later at Sotheby's, the Guggenheim Museum and the founding director of the Museum of Modern Salzburg, pushed for a major renovation from politicians and preservationists, procured public funds and private sponsorship money and determined the use.
In addition to contemporary art, the works of sculptor Fritz Wotruba's foundations should be exhibited, a café and a bookshop should be created, and an office building had to be built to do so.
Strict surveillance, low budget.
To perform, Krischanitz was then the ideal cast.
Not only did he sensitively reconstruct and expand Joseph Olbrich's Art Nouveau buildings in Vienna and win the competition, but because he studied at the Technical University of Vienna with Schwanzer, and the pavilion was an "extremely important place" for him to view exhibitions "almost every weekend."
He knew the original project and also knew the problems of the building, which had already lost its generosity and lightness when it relocated to Vienna and the change in use.
The current reconstruction was far more of a problem: The building was a "catapult for energy," says Krischanitz.
The glass facade window profiles were replaced, used with glass fibers reinforced insulating glass and a glass roof replaced with a special safety glass.
Cold bridges-eyed girders were reinforced or replaced, and asbestos-filled ceilings were remediated.
The two underground floors provided a place for new use, a recessed lighting channel between the building and the street, with a bridge leading to the entrance - a near-new building, but still a lofty Schwanzer Pavilion.
The original entrance door has been preserved, with the building painted in an old antique, reddish-brown colour tone.
And the cinema hall is even exactly the same as it used to be.
And all this under the strict supervision of the Heritage Office and the low budget.
"Often material had to be found that is good and inexpensive and also liked the monument office," says Krischanitz, pointing to the broken basement floor.
Despite all the pressures, problems and reconstruction, the building remained flexible and airy.
Difficult, he said, was with the pavilion "that came here from Brussels," Krischanitz, a typical "Drop-in-the-City-Honor."
Such architecture is said to stand "always in the wrong place" and still wants to "fake proper self-confidence."
In this case, however, the 21st-century House is not in a place of inappropriate place, as an urban happy coincidence has occurred: A completely projected "Municipal Quarter by the Central Station" with office and residential houses are underway in the circle around the Schweizer Garten.
And perhaps there will be another happy coincidence: the 21st-century house could receive support from another Krischanitz building, as the collector Francesca von Habsburg bought the Berliner Temporäre Kunsthalle and, as you can hear, is already in talks with the city of the neighbourhood at the post at the Schweizer Garten post.
The runway plans a package for the winter crisis in the millions
The runway has pipped a contingency plan to prevent train failures in the winter.
The number of employees is to be doubled.
That'll cost millions.
In the fight against winter's train failures and delays, Deutsche Bahn is issuing more than 70 million euros this year, according to a newspaper report.
The "Bild" newspaper reported tentatively, citing an internal group plan, that it said to be expected to foresee a total of around 300 million euro investments by 2015.
It is said to provide a better use of trains and the rail network also under extreme weather conditions.
Among other things, it is planned to double the number of internal and external staff to 16,000 people to remove snow on railway facilities and platforms.
The aim is to get rid of the platform by the start of service and 90 percent for the operation of the necessary switches during the four to five hours of snow and ice.
Two months ago, the rail chief Rüdiger Grube, warned after a summit meeting with government and industry officials against train outages and delays during this winter.
Last winter, the passenger car has had considerable problems as it has had a shortage of reserves, among other things, under difficult weather conditions.
So numerous new regional trains have been waiting for years to be approved by the Federal Rail Authority.
This is also the delay in the deployment of ICE trains
The runway has also not been able to cope for years that the axles of ICE trains must be checked more often by workshop when a green axle destruct occurred at one of the ICE trains at Köln Central Station.
Deutsche Bank pays $1 million fine in US
After the uproar over Chief Josef Ackermann, new tramples are being made in the US: Deutsche Bank must pay a million-dollar damages there.
As if Deutsche Bank's problems were no longer enough at home, the industry giant was caught up in his US past: the Frankfurt institution pays $145 million (€106 million) in a single countervailing process to settle disputes over the bankruptcy of five major cooperative banks in the course of the financial crisis.
This is the sale of the mortgage lists.
The financial market regulator NCUA reproaches a number of major banks for bringing together cooperative banks with bogus promises to buy financial products; that they may have reduced the risks.
Such papers lost considerable value in the course of the crisis, and the banks brought with them into the abyss.
"We are satisfied that we were able to resolve the issue without the need to drag the parties to court," said a Deutsche Bank spokesman in New York.
The bank does not blame by the settlement.
This is also true for Citigroup, which is committed to paying out $20.5 million.
NCUA President Debbie Matz welcomed the friendliness of the two financial institutions.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is competent for cooperative banks in the US and helps with bankruptcies to protect customer claims.
NCUA is attempting to obtain compensation for the billions of dollars of damages incurred.
Compensation now completed are the first of their kind.
The regulator also became fixated on other Grand Bobsons and sued JPMorgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs in the summer.
For dubious mortgage lists, this is the so-called Mortgage-backed Securities.
These are based on bank loans.
When the American bubble around the properties in r. 2007 deflates, it has proved fatal to a number of financial firms.
In September 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, the US-Investmentbank Lehman Brothers changed its mind.
Although the events took place a few years ago, a sharp wind is now blowing in the banks' mouths.
Investors and supervisory authorities have filed numerous lawsuits to obtain redress or befaserid wronged.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has launched the biggest wave of lawsuits.
He accuses 18 international grandstands of having brought the two state-owned US real estate financiers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac at about $200 billion at a mortgage store worth of handles.
Deutsche Bank is also facing a lawsuit against FHFA, here it is a multiple deal worth a total of about $14.2 billion from 2005 to 2007.
By grading, the office demands that the Frankfurt Institute be responsible for "substantial losses" without, however, giving any exact amount.
Deutsche Bank rejected the requests as unfounded and said it wanted to defend itself.
Warren Buffett enters IBM with 10 billion
Financial guru Buffett is investing heavily in the IBM IT-undestern.
Since March, he has bought more than $10 billion worth of stock.
The hitherto major US investor, Warren Buffett, has always claimed to have no investment in IT and computers, as long-term corporate developments will be given difficult to predict.
But he has now read the IBM business reports and changed his opinion of investment in the business.
It has had to understand much earlier that IBM offers primarily services and acquires computer systems for the IT-unit of other businesses.
Warren Buffett's investment is considered knighthood in the financial world.
As a result, it is allowed to call the motherbadic rock of IT IBM now "Sir IBM."
For Buffett revealed on the US economic radio station CNBC that he had purchased $10.7 billion worth of IBM shares since March.
His Investmentholding Berkshire Hathaway became one of IBM's largest shareholders, with a 5.5 percent stake.
Buffett sagte that even IBM did not know anything about his engagement so far.
He praised the management, which tried to even make proper returns in the economic crisis.
"You've done a great job," Buffett said of the strategy.
IBM has been betting for a long time on lucrative IT-services like the operation of computing centers.
The more than 100-year-old computer pioneer also offers software and consultancy as well as powerful computers for companies.
Buffett has been rather avoiding technology firms to date.
It claims to be invested only in undertakings whose activities he also understands.
Instead, Buffett reached for the freight rail, for the manufacturer of lubricants, or for machine manufacturers.
In addition to about 80 of its own subsidiaries, his Holding Berkshire Hathaway also owns stakes in a wide range of Grand Hallcensors such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, the former Münchener Rück.
The 81-year-old gentleman took over the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway in the 1960s and built it with wise investments one of the most valuable businesses in the world.
Yet his way of life is modest.
He is therefore a cult figure for many investors around the world.
His almost infallible sense of money making brought him the nickname "Orakel of Omaha (Message of the Omaha."
When Buffett's investment became known, IBM's stock rose by one percent before the stock market began.
"Big Blue," as IBM is also called, has a total price of more than $220 billion on the stock market and is considered to be the world's most valuable technology companies, along with Apple and Microsoft.
At Microsoft, so much Buffett, he wouldn't want to start.
Founder Bill Gates is said to be his intimate friend.
Threatening is palpable
After the discovery of the "Buna in Zwickau", the Turkish media have questioned the German rule of law.
The newspapers even speak of a "bloody ideology" that is now coming to life again.
The murders of eight small-time businessmen of Turkish origin and one Greek one between 2000 and 2006 had a right-wing extremist background.
This report was responded to in Turkey and within the German-Turkish population in Germany with fear and concern.
For many German Turks, this brings back the spectre that has long been considered dead: There has been no comparable violence with the right-wing extremist background since the Mölln arson attacks in Möllen in May 1993 and in Solingen in May 1993.
That there is a xenophobia in Germany, however, there was never any doubt about it.
But the discovered right-wing extremist network reveals a magnitude of which can no longer be overseen.
"Does he revive the bloody ideology?" reads the headlines of the Turkish newspaper's "Haberturk" online edition.
The "Sabah" newspaper, on the other hand, emphasizes that one of the perpetrators was to be a secret police officer to the constitution's protection officer, and they fear that the German authorities might also be involved in the right-wing radical swamp.
The Turkish community of Germany responded deliberately: It recalled over the weekend with a demonstration in silence in front of the Brandeburg gates of the victims of racist violence.
Only two weeks ago, the Turkish Municipality in Berlin, together with German and Turkish politicians, recalled the ceremonial act of the fiftieth anniversary of the German-Turkish recruitment agreement.
In cheerful colours, a life together was staged - as a history of success.
As a slap, the coverage of several Turkish media: "German's present for the fifties" is the title of an article in the Turkish online platform "Haber X," which reports on the background of the murder series.
Also, the publication of the "Hürriyet" paper for Germany will not be taken to ensure that it does not make this intellectual connection.
"It's starting to smell," is the headline of a post by Ahmet Külahci.
It underlines that people who paid taxes and made an important contribution to Germany's recovery were murdered.
Most criticically, the actions of the police and their late success in the search are in German-Turkish online forums.
Why it had not occurred to the German authorities much earlier to search for suspects in right-wing extremist circles, the authors wonder.
Thus, many are shown at least rhetorically prompt to use drastic means: 'If the activity is carried out here so superficially, immigrants will have no choice but to defend and armed themselves'.
"That's perhaps the best self-defense."
"The quality of the clarification and proportionality of the punishment of the entire network is very strongly dependent on internal peace in Germany ", writes "Selen."
What does it mean if internal peace in Germany is threatened is explained by the assassinations in Mölln and Solingen in the 1990s.
The photo of the burnt-out in Solingen is deeply etched in the memory of the Germans and the Turks.
For no other event has shown the Turks living here more clearly that there is a tangible threat and to the Germans that mistrust and distance can result in right-wing violence
But the assassinations made the Turk's side a more evident sense of reciprocity.
Do not repeat the mistakes of the past
In the Turkish press at the time, it was primarily criticized by the failure of German policy after the assassinations: Helmut Kohl refused to visit those in the Mölln survivors.
After the arson attack in Solingen, he sent a telegram of condolence to the Turkish state president, but was allowed to be enlisted by his foreign minister, Klaus Kinkel, at his speech, in his speech.
Quite as if a person's value is measured by the height of his taxes.
The current coverage of the Turkish media shows once again how profound the distrust of many German Turks in the local state-lawed arrangement is.
In addition to efforts to make extensive clarification and a new evaluation of right-right-extra terror terrorism in Germany, this time it requires open words.
Scandalous bank at Lake Zurich
Europe's most adventurous bank is not established in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
UBS suffered almost bankruptcy in the financial crisis, and has since slipped from one crisis to another.
Now a German is to straighten it out.
That's not what Axel Weber thought.
After his noisy departure from the leadership of the Federal Bank's leadership, he became known in July for a fresh new job in 2013, he would take on an almost equally spectacular new job: the president of the board of the Swiss Grand Brigade UBS - an unexpected and lucrative step in his career.
Axel Weber was looking forward publicly to Switzerland, praising Switzerland for its beauty and UBS for its newly acquired solidity, and called friendly remarks to future colleagues.
"Die UBS has achieved a turnaround."
"I look forward to working with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel."
But it was clear in September that things would turn out very differently.
A UBS dealer in London bypassed all of the bank's security systems and lost around 1.7 billion euros.
UBS Chief Executive Oswald Grübel, not only a respected banker in Switzerland, had to leave.
The president of the board of directors of the UBS has been a scalded ever since, and everyone is asking: When will Axel Weber finally come?
It has already become known that Weber has been allowed to advise the bank since February 2012.
And it will take over the chairmanship of the Governing Board in May - not only in 2013, as the Bank said on Tuesday.
It's going to be tough for Axel Weber.
He is not a banker, rather a professor of economics and an emissary banker, and he would certainly need a time to work.
It will then take responsibility for the bank's strategy, which has just once again proved that it deserves the title of "The Bank of the Greatest Scandals in Europe"
For, on the one hand, UBS is huge - until recently, it was the world's largest property manager - and has been gobbling for years from one scandal to the next.
Nothing, so it seems, will not be spared the proud Swiss bank.
It started in the financial crisis.
By 2007, UBS enjoyed an excellent reputation.
The image of the silent and solid but also shrewd asset manager is combined with ambitious goals: She also wanted to mean something in investment banking.
So UBS 2007 managed, on the one hand, with $1.6 trillion, more money from wealthy clients than any other bank in the world.
And on the other hand, as an investment bank, it advanced to the league of the world's biggest banks
That impressed you.
Former banker and later longtime banking professor at Zurich, Hans Geiger, tells us: "I always cited UBS as a model for a good bank at the time."
"From today's point of view, one asks: How could I be so wrong?"
He was wrong.
In 2007, it was first apparent that something had gone wrong in UBS.
In the middle of the year, the board's chief executive, Peter Wuffli, resigned, and has so far been seen as a highly intelligent and also brilliant banker.
A few months later, he suspected why he had left.
The bank's investment division wasted the Subprime-paper treatment and had to write off billions.
To stand this, UBS announced a capital increase of really 13 billion francs.
But it did find investors, but one that would recently sneer at: the opaque Asian State Fund from Singapore and the Arab State Fund, which was so discreet that one did not even learn its name.
But that was just the first crash.
In April 2008, it developed worse.
The bank had to admit new billion-dollar losses, the chairman of the board Marcel Ospel, the second highest-paid board of directors of Switzerland in 2006, resigned.
A disaster ensued in October 2008: UBS, given its erroneous investment in the financial crisis, faced a breakdown and had to be rescued by the state.
Nationalbank bought up problematic securities from UBS for tens of billions, the Swiss Confederation gave six billion francs to make it mandatory to exchange bonds for which it could become co-owner of the bank.
The whole of Switzerland was shaken - noting how dramatic it was for a small country to have such large banks on its territory.
After all, the UBS 2007 balance sheet total was more than five times the performance of Switzerland's economy (see picture).
"We could not save UBS one day," says tech expert Geiger.
The first disaster is followed by a second.
For months now, UBS has capitulated to this in a tax dispute with America and has shown a willingness to release data from wealthy customers who, if possible, with the help of the banks, have been taxed.
In addition, she agreed to pay $780 million - as a return of unauthorized profits from those deals, including a penalty surcharge.
This undertoon UBS more or less openly that it aided tax cuts.
At the same time, she had lost something that had always been her capital in the competition for wealthy clients: a halo of discretion.
After this scandal, the Swiss banking secrecy was no longer what it was before.
This was followed by the resignation of the chief executive board of directors and the president of the board of directors.
And the customer's exodus of money.
Thus, the bank lost its credibility in both central commercial areas over the course of a few months: In investment banking, due to poor speculation and asset management to aiding and to cut the tax.
And just when it calmed down a bit again, just as it was thought that UBS had recovered, this unfortunate trade anabase is coming: A single dealer wasted 1.7 billion euros before the bank noticed something was wrong.
And it's clear: with risk management in investment banking, it doesn't seem to be working.
"The Adoboli case has probably found that risk control has changed too little," says Martin Janssen, economist and Finance professor at the Zürich University Banking Institute.
The finance director of the big German bank is also sure: "The Problem of UBS is that it does not manage to control the risks."
Yet it was exactly the idea of being cautious, with which the Swiss bankers had set out a long time ago to become watchdogs of the world's great fortunes: not too much of a risk, but security for money - the Alpine Republic's side had collapsed the world again.
The Swiss banks' vaults have become a symbol for unshakable reliability as Lindt and Sprüngli for particularly high-quality chocolate.
The UBS headquarters in Zurich are still suited to the cliché of a good Swiss private bank - it's just a little bigger.
The position is already classic.
The bank has its headquarters in Zurich's Bahnhofstraße, which leads directly to Lake Zurich, framed by the snow-capped peaks of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are beautiful, with store rentals among the highest in Europe.
Jewels such as Tiffany's will be found among the Swiss traditional shops like the Sprüngli confectionery.
For centuries, there have been Swiss banks: from Nationalbank to Palast der Credit Suisse to elite private banks like Julius Bär.
The UBS receptionist is entered through heavy revolving doors.
Inside are the marble-lined walls, with massive leather chairs in front of them, a large rudder to "sejfu" alongside the bank's logo.
UBS knows what the customer is looking for here: safety.
This idea of the Swiss Bank of the two Swiss big booths, UBS and Credit Suisse, but sometimes - was suppressed or betrayed, as the head of a small Swiss private bank finds.
He would rather not want to read his name in the newspapers, he concludes, like all Swiss bankers, with the two grandbanks also in business.
UBS has probably gotten too much bigger, it's finding out - especially in investment banking, where the Anglo-Saxons have also expanded.
The Swiss probably have nothing more to say about it.
"And if they had, they had adapted long ago to the Anglo-Saxon ways."
Indeed, it was Anglo-Saxon investment banking that changed UBS, brought in at first high profits and then a disaster: No European financial institute lost as much money in the jungle around Subprime as the Schweizer Großbank.
15. October 2008 the disaster was obvious.
"At that center, the ruling coalition of a small seven-million-strong country decided to take the largest rescue effort in the history of its nation," writes author Lukas Hässig in his book "Der UBS-Crash."
Up to 68 billion francs or some 45 billion euros were approved by politicians to save the bankrupt bank from bankruptcy.
How could this have happened?
If they talk to Swiss bankers, they see a problem primarily in the size of UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three Swiss Grand Banks merged into a massive concern.
A bank was created that was already too big for a small Switzerland during the merger - and continued to grow.
In the process, it helped that UBS's two different banking predecessors were complementing: One rich but sleepy bank in Zurich with a centre of gravity in property management and poorer but more internationally more heavily involved.
Suddenly, internationalized investment bankers came up profitably with a lot of money that they could spin a big roulette.
Two names are associated with this rise of UBS: Peter Wuffli, UBS's chief executive and Marcel Ospel, then chairman of the board of directors, from 2001 to 2007.
"I have always thought that Wuffli and Ospel were a team of the future," says banking expert Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the highly intelligent, modest one who knows a lot about the models and the statistics, and the Ospel, the man guiding the feelings around his stomach that has developed completely up from the banking science."
But Ospel was said to be relying on Wuffli at the end.
And Wuffli was probably making a decisive mistake at the end: "I guess he thought his models were a reality," Geiger says.
"This is a tragic case."
Tragic, perhaps.
What is clear is: Pride preceded the fall.
UBS employees clearly recall the leaders' meetings at which Wuffle's chief executive, the group's chief executive, repeated the same slogan again: bring Goldman Sachs down from the throne.
The US bank was the world's most powerful investment bank.
She cited the "League Tables," a waiting list that documents the success of the banks of that time.
In it, UBS was trying to get the placement at the top.
A few steps had already been successful.
In the trade in foreign exchange and shares, she participated in the game at the very top.
But the business advisers in charge of stress one weakness: In the international interest rate business, in the language of the "Fixed Income" bankers, there is probably a big distance behind the biggest banks.
UBS probably has gaps in American mortgage products.
To close the gap, UBS committed to an adventure that had almost cost it its existence.
A hunger for growth, the bank itself and its own fund have invested to hedge risks in the US investment of Subprime.
It developed into a massive machine that reproached the securities to US mortgage loans and passed it on - but it also retained the risks itself.
Also, when other banks were looking for a way out.
"As late as the summer of 2007, when the real estate market was on fire, UBS was buying there," says banking expert Geiger.
How big is the euphoria, the downfall.
One manager after another had to leave when attempts to clean up were more difficult than thought.
The UBS positions have become a catapulting seat and are swinging to this day.
Whoever runs the Grand Broom now has an almost unmanaged job.
They must find a strategy for a bank that has disappeared all the nearby business models.
Bank expert Geiger already has the idea: The end of investment banking, the concentration on asset management, a return to the Swiss roots.
The bank doesn't want to go that far.
But investment banking is to be severely dwindled, so much is now clear.
Next Thursday, the bank's new chief executive, Sergio Ermotti, wants to present his future strategy to the world.
In fact, the 51-year-old Swiss Italian was only seen as a transitional solution when the bank surprisingly broke up with its predecessor, Grübel.
In the meantime, he asserted himself: He is to run UBS's business for a long time, the Zurich Bank told Zurich on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to put the investment bank back on the situation in the mid-1990s.
3,500 seats will be cut.
But that will not be enough.
UBS needs a vision.
Who is she?
How does he want to make money?
These are the questions that Axel Weber is already asking himself.
But he has only publicly said that he and his lady will first find an apartment in Zurich.
Next year.

Europe will probably not recover from the recession so quickly, and there are other signs of bank weakness.
The novenda of investing Warren Buffett only confirmed this outlook: He said in a CNBC-Interview that it would probably not yet be clear whether Europe was strong enough to do everything to end the crisis.
That is why, from his point of view, it is probably too early to invest in European state loans or banks.
Instead, Buffett left the decades-old principle and entered the American tech business.

Smart crows expand in cities
In many places, field ravens are considered "problem birds": But these highly intelligent animals can no longer be expelled from cities, experts say.
Some like them, others would like to get rid of them quite quickly: The crows have been in the city's image for centuries, yet in some municipalities the complaints of the residents are accumulating to the impurity and noise caused by the animals.
At the same time, there is no means of viewing the "problem birds" yet.
Ravens of the field may not be banished from the cities, the first sympathies said of the first sympathia's churches in East-Warland Leer.
There, experts from all over the federal district consulted on possible starting points.
Looking for alternatives in cities
Meanwhile, conservationists derived the problems of cities from the exodus of specially protected field ravens: The use of chemistry in agriculture is about a growing destruction of traditional areas for life.
The persecution, the growing development and the felling of typical trees to nest for the birds make life difficult.
Crows are protected.
Large colonies with more than 600 nesting pairs are, among others, in the Westphalia Soest, in the northwest, including in the Jever, Diepholz and Achim at Bremen and in Leer.
There, 2005, the disputed project of mass killing of crows in the country district sparked negative headlines.
Critics called the capture of animals in bird traps and the killing of the sticks to be particularly brutal.
"Normal expulsion, scares, brings nothing," the urban planner and landscape painter Werner Klöver of Leer found so much.
Removing nests by spraying water or cutting down trees often has undesirable consequences, environmental expert Manfred Kaiser from Lahr, Baden-Württemberg, also said.
"The animals retreat, the large colonies are split and divided into other places."
The cry is conceivable only as an exception to hospitals, nursing homes or schools.
"We have to live with them, we can't get them gone."
Without the surrounding territory, the problem of cities cannot be solved, was the opinion of Mayor Wolfgang Kellner of Leer.
Thinking is a combination of expelling animals from sensitive residential areas and gracing them to settle in other places.
"Information board instead of chain saws" was promoted by the psychologist and ethnologist Uta Maria Jürgens for a completely different treatment of animals: "One pincome in the face can be best at ease with confidence."
Ms Jürgens co-founded the Ascherberg Educational Trail in Schleswig-Holstein, on which the information boards provide lessons about the life of a highly intelligent field raven.
The project is said to have already been accepted by tourists.
Mrs Jürgens also had her own opinion on the criticism of the noise caused by the birds: "This is about every volume of communication, they have much to say to each other."
The intelligence and skill of the animals are legendary: Field Ravens use not only aids to achieve a treat, but even make their instrument as an aid.
Researchers at the University of Cambridge have recently tested the behaviour of four field ravens as far as the intelligence of birds reaches.
In one experiment, the birds quickly learned that they had to bring the stones to collapse the structure to reach the cather of the pier.
Without much training, they knew the size and shape of the stone to cause the platform to collapse.
In the second attempt, the cunning crows then had to solve a more precarious problem.
In a vertically built cylinder, the researchers placed a tiny jar of a catwalk with a larvae of the pier.
The beak could not have reached the birds of their prey.
But the researchers put bits of wire for them.
From these, she shaped the hook of all four animals, using as a stoning to hunt the container by the handle of the container.
Three of the four field ravens managed to do so even with a cut.

But after the break, the European vice-captain from the r. 2004 with four shots.

With that, the European Champion is leaving the r. 1976 for the fifth time in a row at the European Championships.
Team coach Michal Bilko with the legionnaire of the Bundesliga, Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomáš Pekhart (1. FC Nuremberg) was also lucky and had to overcome a terrible second in the early stages.
Goalkeeper Petr Čech reflexively prevented Tomáš Sivok's own goal (9th).
Montenegro had its greatest possibilities when the duo of Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damyanovic were in action.
Damjanovic fired in the 40th minute from the rev from the edge of the penalty area just past Chekhov's goal.
After the break, the crossbar had to save the place of the already hit-and-run goalkeeper of the Czechs of the world class, again cutting down by striker FC Seoul (50th).
The goaler finally cleared up shortly before the conclusion.
Turkey missed a football miracle from Zagreb at that moment.
Four days after 0-3 in Istanbul, the Turks did not exceed 0-0 in Zagreb.
While national coach Guus Hiddink must almost securely clear his place on the bench of the third time at the 2002 World Cup, the Croatians are allowed to rejoice in their fourth appearance in the final round of the European Championships.
In front of the 31,000 spectators at the Maksimire Stadium, the Turks should have a near-tale start.
Selcuk Inan hit only the post with a long shot in the seventh minute, the striker Kazim also could not have hung the bounced ball in the goal.
After this terrible second, Croatia was taking over but increasingly control.
Also after the interruption, the Croats did not get the goal.
Alongside Mario Mandzukica of VfL Wolfsburg, who released Dortmund's Ivan Perisic from the 62nd minute, the legionnaires from the Federal League, the Liga Danijel Pranjic (Bayern Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht Frankfurt) were still in action.
Trapattoni goes to the European Championship
In Dublin, the Irish celebrated their first appearance at the European Championships since 1988 in Germany.

Konstantin Vassiliev (57th) equalised for the visitors.
Ireland set the pace from the start, but had to wait until the 23rd minute before Robbie Keane of the Los Angeles Galaxy had his first good chance.

After a failed defence by goalkeeper Pavel Londak, Ward was in place and pushed the ball over the line at 1-0.

SAP wants to double its workforce in China.
The largest software manufacturer in Europe, SAP, is investing billions in China in the coming years and wants to nearly double the number of its employees in the country.
Do r. 2015 is said to be around $2 billion (approximately €1.5 billion), Dax Group reported on Tuesday.
"We will create more research and development facilities and employ the relevant staff," said acting chief executive Bill McDermott at the Beijing customer trade fair.
The staff is now set to rise from the current 2,500 employees to 4,500.
The number of world number one branches in software for businesses will double from five to ten or eleven.
So far, the SAP is present in Beijing, Shanghai, Guanzhou, Chengdu and Dalian.
About 4,000 of the world's more than 176,000 SAP customers are booming in the country.
The growth plans for China are also an important building block of Dax's strategy for r. 2015.

Massacre on a personal level
Peter Englund's empowering new book, Beauty and Sorrow: The Beauty and the Sorrows: An Intimate History of the First World War, begins with a long list of performant characters.
One piece of advice on how to act at that moment: carefully rip this page out of it and make a bookmark of it.
For you will be very familiar with all persons in Mr. Englund's novel narration, and this list will serve as a navigation - as a kind of beacon - at times when, like the men and women in the story, you will feel confused and lost in various situations.
Mr. Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new deputy at the Swedish Academy, which awards the Nobel Prize in Literature.
The book we're talking about here is very unusual - the author describes it himself, quite aptly, as "anti-historical work."
It contains several very well-known names, important treaties or famous battles, on the contrary, it is almost missing ambassadors, energetic journalists, and debates about tactics and equipment.
It's not so much a book about what happened, the author explains, as "a book about what it was like." It is mainly about "feeling, impressions, experiences and moods."
"Beauty and grief" combine the war experiences of 20 more or less ordinary men and women, on both sides of the barricade, from female students and botanists to climbers, doctors, ambulance drivers and clerks.
Some of these people will become heroes.
Others become prisoners of war, lose their limbs, go crazy or die.
Their lives are shimmered like the flames of candles lit in the church - new ones are added to the intrigues of the fates while others are extinguished.
Mr. Englund's book is different from the classic historical novels.
It corrects the notion that World War I was only about the fearsome trench fighting on the Western Front.
"Beauty and grief" deftly explores other places where war dramas were taking place: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
The soldiers in this book solve the problems of falling bee's nests on them, have to spend Christmas in the shade of the pyramids, or they are faced with the presence of the tse-tse.
Almost from the beginning it is a very moving read.
The war will engulf people's lives like a natural disaster, like Hurricane Katrina, smelling of gunpowder.
When gunfire starts to come forward in the distance and you are the woman who is at home with her children, will you run or stay?
Who's coming?
Almost no one understands what's going on, or even why the war was started.
"The vacuum arose from a lack of facts," observed Mr. Englund, "concerns, conjectures, hopes, fears, prejudices, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumors were filled with."
"Beauty and grief" follows the stories of individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young sailor serving in the German fleet.
Their stories are mostly readmitted from biographies, letters and other already published material.
Descending their lives may sound both terrifying and engaging, but thanks to the inclusion of small moments and details, they are completely lively and believable.
Many of them are about hardship and dealing with it.
In the story of a German student, the author says: "Purposites, all substitutes everywhere."
"Coffee tray, a copycat of aluminium, imitations of rubber, paper bandages, wooden buttons."
He goes further and describes food substitutes in Germany.
It mentions "a mine made from pressed rice cooked in mutton fat (and supplemented with a false wood bone), dried-cream tobacco and dried potato skins, wooden-soled shoes.
It mentions that there were "837 registered meat substitutes for the production of sausages and 511 registered coffee substitutes."
Some stories are about honor and bravery.
One American finds an inner impetus for savagery and brutality, then declares the war: "Finally, you will understand that this is the human nature. Not to sit in comfortable chairs with a cigarette and whisky, evening paper or a good book, and to pretend that this mask of yours is a civilization, and that there is no barbarian behind the starchy me inside."
The British soldier, on the other hand, realizes that he will most likely die soon, and no one will even notice, let alone mourn.
"When one finally accepts the fact that one is sacrificed, one would at least expect to do so in the face of a grateful audience," he writes.
Instead, however, he feels like a "doubt with a conchwoman who is being secretly hanged."
Other comments relate to the departure of old Europe and the emergence of new horrors.
"The conflict became more and more an economic competition and a competitive fight," writes Mr. Englund, "a war between the factories."
He captured what he calls "the new kind of beast of the coming century: an eloquent and ideologically sworn mass murderer in a tailor-made dress that makes his bloodshed without rising from the table."
People behave completely unexpectedly, the meanness alternates with heroism.
Mr. Englund also describes the soldiers who deliberately tried to catch an STV to avoid serving at the front.
"The most grotesque example of this behavior was the goncoccal pus that the soldiers bought and smudged with their genitals in the hope of ending up in the hospital," he writes.
"The most desperate ones intramigated him to their eyes, which often blinded them for the rest of their lives."
In this Swedish translation by Peter Graves, Mr. Englund's prose is brisk but not spectacular, which is well suited to his human subject.
In dozens of small outputs, it captures the way the war "disapults of utterly unmanageable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred."
People are beginning to ask why their leaders are making them fight.
The best World War I books mostly worked with hints, such as "First World War and Modern Memories" by Paul Fussell, or novels such as "On the Western Front of Calm" by Erich Maria Remarque.
Mr. Englund prefers an unconventional concept.
His book has the most overwhelming ending unparalleled in the popular educational literature.
But I will not reveal it to you.
But you will feel as if suddenly the author jumped out of the book, snatched the page from the list of heroes out of your hand and set it on fire.
After a previous mistake this time amedly planned raids
Hundreds of police officers participated, some in the helmets used in the street riots.
The night from Monday to Tuesday was chosen because the Zuccottti Park should be almost empty by then.
No one knew about the action except a few high-ranking officers. The others were first told that this was an exercise.
The event was headed by Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly, whose presence she emphasized how many problems the police department had to face in the operation.
It was not to be relicened in the last weeks of the use of pepper spray against protesters, for example, in violation of the department's rules, and a wave of public sympathy spilled over to squatter.
That is why the police operation to clean Zuccotti Park from the demonstrators was launched only after two weeks of careful planning and exercise.
Leaders were inspired by the operations conducted in other cities.
A massive behavioural exercise in crisis situations took place in the section of Randalls Island, which was a preparation for the event in Zuccottti Park.
Leaders have stepped up so-called riot-out training - counter-terrorism measures involving the rapid transfer of large numbers of police officers - focusing on the city district of Lower Manhattan.
The last part of the training took place on Monday night, on the Manhattan side of the East River.
The orders to move to the park came literally "at the last minute" someone who was originally explained to whom the event was originally explained only as "exercise."
"I know a few police officers who were also called to this event, and they were certainly not told that they were going to Zuccotti Park," said the person, who spoke only on the condition that he remains anonymous.
"The fact that it was going to Zuccotti Park was the highest-ranking members of the department."
One reason for the secrecy was a lesson the city had already received once.
1. In October, city officials planned to clean the park, but then withdrew from the plan, because as soon as the demonstrators heard about it, they flocked to the park for hundreds of them before the operation began.
Tuesday's action was attended by police officers from different units, including intervention groups from all over the area - dozens of police officers who are commonly used to reinforce neighbourhoods with higher levels of crime.
Mr. Kelly explained that a large number of people were coming and out of the park during the day, so one hour a night was the perfect time to start the event.
"It was appropriate to do this at a time when as few people as possible were in the park," he said.
Before the troops set out, they lined up on the border of Pike Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near the Manhattan Bridge, the emergency trucks with arched lamps and amplifiers.
The lights and the recorded news roaring from the amplions frightened many of the demonstrators.
When the members of the riot squad entered the park in their blue windbreakers, many demonstrators packed their belongings and left.
Police say she didn't touch a single tent until 1:45 a.m., which was to give the demonstrators time to pack up their belongings.
Other teams of police officers were spotted gathering on the edge of the park to enter it if there were any arrests to be made.
Reporters were forced to leave the park.
Police Department Chief Prosecution Officer Paul J. Browne claimed to have been the case for their safety.
However, many journalists are of the opinion that the police wanted to prevent them from seeing their troops in action, and in addition some police officers were rude to them.
Mr. Browne argued that the television cars on Church Street, running along the western boundaries of the park, could easily be filmed.
Police moved in a westerly direction, weaving through the dense jumble of the protesters' personal belongings, including luggage and plastic bags full of clothing. Behind them, teams from the sanitation department set off, immediately raking for all that was left in the park.
Some demonstrators who refused to move were dragged out of the park. Documenting pictorial material appeared on the internet moments later.
The most daring group of demonstrators took refuge in the vicinity of the kitchen in their camp, which lay near the center of the park.
Some formed a roadblock and police began their methodical arrests.
About ten people in the center of the campile tied to each other.
And two people were tying up to a tree, Mr. Kelly said.
Emergency personnel were called in to cut the locks.
There were no arrests at the park until 3:30 a.m. in the park, Mr. Kelly announced.
The entire operation was completed about 75 minutes later, the police commented.
Mr. Browne said that approximately 142 people were detained in the park.
Most of the arrests were made because of "an organisation of riots and resisting arrests," he clarified.
The highest-ranking police officer at the scene of the event was Joseph J. Esposito, chief of police, highest-ranking uniformed officer in the department.
The operation was also personally attended by Phil T. Pulaski, the detective's commander in the department.
Mr. Kelly was present, but "did not participate in the management of the operation," Mr. Browne said.
A second group of police officers waited along the eastern side of Broadway, between Liberty Street and Cedar Street, in case it needed to be called in.
On Cortlandt Street, a block north of the park, and on Pine Street Street, a block south of the park, roadblocks were erected.
From these places, the police then developed a protective strip even further from Zuccotti Park.
Police officers were spotted at one of the sites, many of whom were equipped with shields, as they push people even further beyond that border.
There were about 28 people on the northern border.
The wildest events of the night took place south of the park.
Around 5 a.m., a demonstrator was spotted, south of Pine Street, jumping onto the hood of a police car, and several others who were releasing air from the tires of the police van.
At one point, a piece of plywood flew out of the crowd.
At the end of the surgery, one police officer and one protester were hospitalized.
Trade union of auxiliary workers to sue city for release
Unions representing hundreds of school auxiliaries who lost their jobs last month plan to sue the city on Wednesday. He argues that the redundancies were not necessary and, moreover, they were discrimination, because of the disproportionate impact on the schools attended by poor students.
The lawsuit is probably the last resort left by the departments in the District Council area in their efforts to overturn the redundancy decision.
On October 7, six hundred and seventy-two school assistants, parental coordinators, and other staff who were among the city's worst-paid staffers lost their jobs. Their release was described by union executives as retaliation for the city's retaliation for not allowing him access to a health care fund managed by work crews last spring, using which city wanted to sew a hole in the budget.
City officials categorically rejected the accusation.
At a city council meeting last month, Education Minister Dennis M. Walcott said the layoffs were part of the budget approved in June.
One of the council members immediately countered that the budget was not specifically mentioned in the budget for the release of the auxiliary staff.
Representatives of the District Council 37 announced that they had already completed the necessary documents and warned the Ministry of Education that they would sue him. They will call a press conference on Wednesday to formally announce the lawsuit at the Supreme State Court in Manhattan.
The defendants in the trial will be Mr. Walcott and the Ministry of Education, while the plaintiff will be eight redundant workers, all of whom are African-American or Hispanic, as will most other assistants who have lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokeswoman for the city's legal department, said the city had not yet seen the lawsuit, so she would not comment on the individual charges.
Under the draft complaint obtained by the New York Times, the unions focused on the number of dismissed people in the poor parts of the city, thus supporting their claims of unjust conduct. They take the view that poor schools have lost more assistants because they have been denied sufficient funds in the long run.
They point out that while schools in the Staten Island section did not go at all, and in the Upper East Side, in the Upper East Side, 17 school assistants lost their jobs in District 23 in Brownsville, and 46 assistants were fired in parts of District 8 and 9 in the South Bronx.
He recalls that at the Public School 36 in Harlem, five of the eight assistants lost their jobs, even though it is a school where 68 percent of students live in poverty. The lawsuit says: 'This is not a neighbourhood of full movable parents who can procure funds to compensate for the deficit in the budget.'
The Public School 36 budget was cut by 3.26 percent this year, and the school also lost money when the city changed the way the city was to calculate bonus funding for each of the losers' registered student.
The unions argue, among other things, that the headmasters of secondary schools may have been confused in the manner in which a document approving the dismissal of parental coordinators was written.
The word "excess" was used to describe the action in describing the action, i.e. to cancel the position, even though the word is much more often used to describe the teacher's move from the school's payroll to the database of available workers whose remuneration is paid by the central authority.
"Sixty-six parental coordinators have been laid off," the complaint's draft statement reads, "and not merely moved to the database for the position of available personnel."
Mission over, Congress ready to accept deal on situation in Libya
Finally, the Republicans and Democrats in the Congress appear to agree on something in terms of the uprising in Libya.
But before that happened, the revolution had to succeed, for a long time the reigning dictator Muammar Gaddafi had to be captured and killed, and the participation of United States troops was terminated.
On Tuesday, the Senate International Relations Committee will decide on the comments supported by President John Kerry (Mass.) together with Senators John McCain (Ariz.) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Conn.), in which she should congratulate the Libyans on their successful uprising and thanking the American troops for "brass."
"With this statement, we want to applaud the courage of the people of Libya who started to rebuild their country," Kerry said.
"Both parties of the political spectrum would like to express their support for their democratic efforts."
The sentences in question may look innocent, but no debate about Libya has been an easy one so far.
During the summer, lawmakers from both sides kept arguing with each other and with the White House about the wording of a series of statements to approve or, conversely, reject the United States' military role in the NATO mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain presented a resolution authorising the limited use of the US armed forces in Libya.
The motion was rejected in the House because of the differing views of the two political parties, so it was never even voted on in the Senate.
However, on the same day that the bill was rejected in the House, the chamber also rejected a measure that would stop funding for American operations in Libya.
This found the US mission in Libya literally in legislative purgatory - Congress criticized the way President Obama ran the mission, but it clearly did not irritate its members enough to stop supporting him in his actions.
The hesitancy of the congress was eventually overtaken by other events.
The rebels captured Tripoli and 20 in August. In October, Gaddafi was killed.
The Nato mission officially ended on 31. October.
Now the Senate may be ready to act.
In its statement, the International Relations Committee "claims the people of Libya for their immeasurably courage and admirable tenacity they have made in an attempt to free their people" and "chewen the men and women of the United States' armed forces, as well as their allies, who have engaged in the operation to protect the Libyan population, for their extraordinary bravery and professionalism."
The statement also "confirms the national interest of the United States at a successful and irreversible transition to democracy in Libya."
Will the new proposal get the full support of the Commission for International Relations, or will the legislators be split in two again, as was the case when approving the June proposal?
The latest version was opposed by Senator Richard G. Lugar (Ind.), the Republican Party's chief representative on the commission.
Lugar's spokesman said Monday that he had not yet seen the final version of the new proposal.
The House will vote this week on an amendment to the Constitution that would require a balanced budget, which should be the highest legislative priority of almost all Republicans and Democrats in Congress.
This measure, advocated by Bob Goodlatt (Va.), will be the first amendment to the Constitution on the budget or other subject, which will be voted on by the entire House or the Senate.
For the time being, despite considerable efforts, the other legislators have yet to push their proposals to the vote itself.
Goodlatt's proposal is just one of the 68 amendments to the Constitution presented in the Congress and touched on a wide range of different topics.
Some of them were the same - the same motion to both the House and the Senate - and others were just minor variations by others.
In the House alone, at least 15 versions of the a balanced budget amendment and a handful of other ones that would like to "regulate federal spending."
While some of the proposals are identical, their advocates - especially aspiring Republicans who want to improve their reputation - boast their "authorism."
The revenue for budget regulation, which was approved in August, required both the House and the Senate to vote on the amendment to the balanced budget.
In March, 58 senators voted in favour of a non-binding declaration in support of the creation of such an amendment.
In addition to the budget, several members also want to discuss the limitations on the number of periods in which congressional members could serve, while Jose E. Serrano (N.Y.) wants to increase the number of periods that may be president.
Deputy Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Ill.) has offered a whole series of additions that would, among other things, guarantee the right to quality education and medical care.
The permanent proposal remains an amendment banning the marriage of same-sex couples as well as an amendment banning the burning of the national flag.
Some lawmakers also want to allow the annulment of federal laws if two-thirds of the states oppose them.
While members of Congress appear to be very active in proposing different additions, they do not significantly deviate from the average compared to previous years.
111. Congress offered 77 additions, while in the 100th. Congress was 66.
Their activity even pales to the early 1990s, when members offered more than 150 amendments every two years, according to Senate library statistics.
But they were not much more successful than current politicians.
The last supplement, which was added - 27th Amendment - was ratified in 1992, but was in fact proposed by Congress in 1789.
"Funched, but not defeated," Gifford says in her first television interview since the shooting
Ten months after she was injured at point-blank near close by a gunman in a public meeting with voters in Tucson, Gabrielle Gifffords (Ariz) appeared on national television on Monday night, sang along with a tune of the Broadcasting show "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" and said that she wanted more than a return to Congress to recover.
Giffords appeared on ABC News with Diane Sawyer. You could see that the making of sentences still caused her problems and she needed help when she walked.
The entire show documented her difficult convalescence, which was necessary due to a bullet-induced wound that punched her skull in the front, penetrated the left half of her brain, and out of her head at the back.
Surprisingly, three months ago, she returned to the House to triumphantly take part in the debt ceiling vote.
In her first television interview since the January shooting, during which six people were killed and the other 13 were injured, Giffords smiled, laughed and sang - describing her recovery as "difficult."
When Sawyer asked her how she felt, the 41-year-old Giffords replied, "Pretty well."
The interview with Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of the "20/20" episode of the "20/20" interview, which was broadcast on the eve of the pair's new book, entitled "Gabby: A Story of Courage and Hope."
The special watched the entire convalescence of Gifford since the shooting on January 8.
In the videos shot by Kelly in the first week, Giffords can be seen in a hospital bed with a shaved head and a long scar across her forehead.
While her husband encourages her, she can't do more than lift one or two fingers at the time.
A few months later, Giffords is captured sitting in a wheelchair, and the therapists are taught how to perform simple activities.
The nod of the head.
Pissing the lips.
And then, her first word: "What."
Within a few days, Giffords had spoken another word - "toast" as she demanded a change in her breakfast.
Videos aired by ABC show that music played a pivotal role for Giffords' recuperation: The congresswoman sings on them along with the therapist for the melodies of "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" by Cyndi Lauper and "Free Fallin" by Tom Petty.
During the interview, Gifford, who devotes two hours a day to therapy, told Sawyer that she could not remember anything from the day the shooting occurred.
Her husband said he didn't read to Gifford newspaper articles about the shooting until March 12, when she first asked him who the six who was killed in the incident were.
The shooting is suspected of the shooting, Jared Lee Loughner, who is being held at the Missoury prison, where he is awaiting trial under the influence of forensic drugs.
"A lot of people died," Giffords told Sawyer.
"Terrible, horrible, horrible."
Kelly told Sawyer that at one point his wife said during her recovery, "I lost."
'So I said to her at once, Gabby, you didn't lose,' Kelly described.
"You just got beat up.
But you make it, pull yourself together, and come back even stronger than ever."
Military troops encounter compassion rather than respect
The event was a gala on Wall Street that raised millions of dollars for war veterans in New York who have no roof over their heads.
Kid Rock sang a ballad of powerlessness, frustration and loss.
Hundreds of soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines ran around him.
The solemnly dressed crowd rose and applauded enthusiastically.
"The men and women serving in the military were considered heroes," said David Saltzman, who hosted the spring benefit.
The gala evening was attended by the then chairman of the committee of the chiefs of staff. In addition to him, Admiral Mike Mullen was in place, but he saw the role of the military units somewhat differently.
"They were all introduced as orphans," the officer wrote in an e-mail.
I'm sure the organizers thought that was right.
I know you do.
But what I saw was not respect. It was regret.
Thus, the very opposite impressions only illustrate the plight of the military's plight, and the often aloof, sometimes celebrated by the American public.
The army is boundless by praise for its victims.
But this praise comes at a cost, the soldiers say.
The public is increasingly acting as if they regret the individual in uniform.
"We're not the victims at all," Brigadier General Sean B. MacFarland, who commanded troops in Iraq and will soon leave Afghanistan.
"But the only way in which some can support us seem to be to put us in the role of unhappy souls."
This topic is very sensitive for army commanders who do not want to appear ungrateful or to spoil the public relations they serve.
They also realize that the anger that the troops returning from Vietnam had to face was far worse.
As a result, most of the words about remorse are spoken in silence and in private among war veterans.
As the two sons of retired Colonel Mark Cancian returned from combat actions to serve as Marine Corps members, their father warned them that their service would be viewed from two angles by people outside the military.
From the point of view of some, he would feel respect and awe, as they defeated the enemy rebels and visited exotic places.
But others will be wondering if "an evil, violent veteran is hiding under the surface," said Cancian, who took part in the fighting in Iraq and took up a position in Washington in government on his return.
He claimed that when he was looking for work, some of the people interviewed him subtly hinted at whether, so soon after returning to the fight, he could withstand the stress associated with the work in Washington.
"If you talk about your service, you have to reckon with negative reactions," Cancian instructed his sons.
The military's concern stems in part from American indifference to the wars.
Successes on the battlefield rarely get the recognition in a country that has little awareness of its own army and finds little of its own benefit in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
"As a nation, we no longer value army heroism as we were common in World War II," said Lieutenant General David Barno, who commanded U.S. troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the recognition from politicians and the public is focused mainly on the suffering of the men in arms.
The soldiers are honoured for the number of events they have endured, the number of friends they have lost, or for the extent of their injuries.
The military faces growing pressure to crack down on rape
This week, it will be decided whether the 28 women and men's trial against the military for allegedly inaction in the event of rape will be launched.
If not, hundreds of other claimants are prepared to sue.
The first-class soldier, Elizabeth Lyman, was 25 years old on the night of allegedly being raped by her military colleague and was at the 11th week of pregnancy.
It happened in October 2008 and she was heading to the barracks at the Miramar Air Force Base, north of San Diego. After dinner with a friend, she came across her male colleague carrying a box of 12 beers.
He asked her if she could join her, that they might have a little drink in her room.
"My warning light came on in my head," Lyman said.
But the native Texan completely ignored her objections.
I thought: No, he's 19.
"He's from Texas," she said.
"I wish I'd listen to my instincts."
She claims that just a few minutes after they entered her room, the man walked over to her, threw her on the bed and raped her.
This week, on 18 November, Lyman and 27 other current or former members of the military will await the verdict of the hearings, which could have a historic impact. This will take place in Arlington, Virginia, and it will be about whether the charges against former Defense Minister Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will go to trial.
The charges state that Gates and Rumsfeld failed to fight the spread of rape in the military, contrary to the constitutional rights of the soldiers.
The charges were filed in February by Washington lawyer Susan Burke, and the plaintiff had 17 members at the time. Over the following months, however, their numbers grew to 28-25 women and three men, all of whom claim to have been raped or otherwise sexually assaulted by their colleagues in the military, and that the military, after the announcement of these oppresses, failed to investigate, punish and any pursuit of justice.
Burke says she's at the throats of the Army's top-ranking commanders, because the problem starts with them.
"The army is a directive system," he says.
'Who are the people who are in the position to stop trying to introduce measures against such acts? The High Command.'
Burke also claims to have contacted at least 400 other survivors since February, many of whom could become part of other lawsuits filed in the future.
Her strategy: Rather than grouping all the charges into this case - stacking all the eggs in one basket, as she puts it - she will sue in multiple different cases if the pressure needs to be dismantled.
The team defending the Ministry of Defence is led by U.S. Attorney General Neil MacBride, who, together with his associates, has filed a motion to dismiss the case.
The court documents obtained by Newsweek detail the defense's strategy - essentially, the case is that current or former soldiers cannot sue the military for the injuries they have sustained as members of the armed forces.
Under a Supreme Court order in 1950 called the Feres Doctrine, the federal government is not responsible for the injuries suffered by active-droned soldiers.
"The alleged injuries relate to the military service of the plaintiffs," the document reads.
The Ministry of Defence declined to comment on the matter.
But things have changed since the 1950s.
Although women are still officially allowed to serve in the fight, it is just a quibble: in modern wars, it is difficult to find a clearly given front line.
In the wars in both Iraq and Afghanistan, teams of female soldiers played an increasingly prominent role, especially in the area of communication with civilian women found in the war zone.
The result: 150 female soldiers were killed between these wars - two-thirds of them in the fight.
The time has come for modernization to be modernized in the military, Burke explains.
She is not alone in her fight. In addition to this, the case is being handled by three other attorneys.
At the Yale Law School, visitors to the veteran's legal services seminar are preparing a lawsuit against the four major military academies for the supposedly developing an atmosphere promoting hatred of women.
Independently of this, the nonprofit organization of American Vietnamese veterans is gathering the groundwork for its action against the military. This lawsuit focuses on the diagnosis of the "personal personality disorder" allegedly found in rape victims to give the military a pretext to release them - according to activists such as Ana Bhagwati, a group of human rights activists Service Women's Action Network, it is a perfectly normal practice.
Her group had already filed a motion for a lawsuit against the State Veterans Organisation in December, accusing of discriminatory practices that were to be taken to process requests for assistance by those who claimed to have been sexually assaulted in the service.
Nine separate proposals were presented in Congress, presented by a group of senators and members from both political parties, and proposed a number of corrective measures.
According to the Office for Preventing and Addressing Sexual Violence of the Ministry of Defence, 3,158 sexual assaults were reported in 2010.
However, this type of attacks remains unannounced in most cases, and according to Pentagon's own estimates, the figure is equivalent to about 13.5 percent of the estimated 19,000 incidents that occurred in that year.
The report issued in March also dismantled the level of prosecution of suspects: In 2010, 20 percent of the cases reported in the military - half of the civil justice system - were taken to court.
In the case of Deputy Burke, the prosecutors describe the attacks only as the first of a number of trauma.
For example, the first-class Private Lyman reported the alleged rape to the military police less than an hour after it was to take place.
During the night, she says, she was asked to repeat the details of her rape 11 times to various members of the police, doctors and commanders.
She underwent all the examinations necessary to determine the rape, and the blood of the attacker was found in her bed - from the wound she had given him on his arm.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman attended a hearing in court, during which she was asked questions about whether she had made love to her boyfriend on the day of the attack.
Six people were summoned, as witnesses to the legend, in favour of the alleged perpetrator, who was eventually acquitted.
"I remember the day the verdict was handed down," Lyman says.
"I felt like I'd give birth on the spot right there - I ran out of the courtroom screaming.'
"I was placed in a psychiatric unit, and when I got out, I remember saying to my commanding officer: That wasn't his trial. He was mine."
The Lymanians were ordered to see a military psychiatrist who eventually diagnosed her with a personality disorder, calling her ineligible service.
In January 2010, she was dismissed from the army without honour and therefore without the claim for the pension.
Whether the case of Lyman and the other prosecutors moves to the next stage or not, it's a long shot, says John Turley, Lawyer professor at George Washington's Law.
Of course, he notes, "From my point of view, they should be able to advance to the next stages of the deliberations."
Between them and the verdict, however, stands the aforementioned doctrine, which has been criticised since the first moment of seeing the light of day.
I myself am a lifelong critic of the doctrine of the Feres Doctrine.
The military has been behind for several decades because their duties do not give in to the same degree of motivation incentives and deterrent means.
He adds, "The chances are hard against them... but it's important for them to try."
The only way to change will happen if the good people are willing to fight.
If the hearing is not decided in their favour, Burkevoya, the plaintiff's lawyer, will collect hundreds of other people ready to sue and begin work on further cases concerning the subject.
"We will not continue to fight the military on this issue, from where there will be no reform," he says.
Or until we die, from what comes first.
Walls have eyes: How scientists examine you on Facebook
Before Anders Behring Breivik became the new face of right-wing extremism in Europe, he was just another young man who presented his anti-immigrant views online.
On Monday, Braivik, who confessed to the July murderous fury, left over in Norway with 77 deaths, attended his first public judicial hearing.
Although Breivik could act alone, he was certainly not lonely in cyberspace: he spent a lot of time at the computer during the preparation of the attack, chatting with some of the millions of nationalists supporting right-wing groups on the social networking site.
After this summer's tragedy, scientists want to learn more about these people.
But how to find them?
Easily - just go to Facebook.
"We realized that getting them is not really that hard," says Jamie Bartlett, the lead author of a recently released report by the British research team that was about European digital populism.
The Facebook's personal information supply is so comprehensive, Bartlett says, all scientists needed to simply use advertising was a website to simply use the ad for the site to determine the wanted demographic group with absolute precision - something that marketing workers have been doing for years.
Bartlett's team across Europe found half a million fans of right-wing groups, then drew attention to them and sent out the ads. However, instead of inviting them through them to the newly formed group or offered them some dietary products, they called on them to fill in a questionnaire on questions about their level of education, their relationship to violence and optimism, given their own future.
Through Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues managed to get results from more than 10,000 fans of 14 different right-wing groups in 11 European countries - without even leaving the office.
"This is a whole new way of conducting research," Bartlett notes.
Some of the results are not that surprising: online supporters of right-wing groups are all young men who are irritated by the rising immigration rate.
But on the other hand, "those who combine their online activism with offline activism are more sensible, democratic, and less violent than those who remain hidden behind the computer screen."
The work of the DEMOS team is just one example of how Facebook is becoming a new tool in the hands of scientists.
Research teams, health scientists and political researchers use these sites to study everything, from health problems to social trends hiding in state updates, posts on the walls, and the buttons pressed for "I like you."
Facebook reports more than 800 million active users. Each of them provides three different data a day on average, which makes this social network a literal "information supernova" that is behind the development of many new research. The number of academic papers in whose name the word Facebook is found has risen to almost 800% compared to five years ago.
For some scientists, the magic of Facebook is that it gives them the opportunity to study people without having to harass them on the streets.
"It used to be that when you wanted to do a survey of the British National Party people, it was very difficult to identify them."
"You'd have to get to the party, where you'd never be allowed to go," Bartlett says.
"All of this is downright by Facebook - you're just going straight to them."
Others argue that the site can offer a way to identify and avoid a socio-health problem.
In a recent study by Dr. Megan Moren of the University of Wisconsin, a research team found that university students who discussed their drunkenays on Facebook were much more at risk of the problem of alcoholism than the students who kept quiet about the subject.
Moreno suggests that students' peers should monitor the site and come forward with an offer to help a student who posts too many drunken statuses.
"The problem can't be solved unless you can diagnose it," Dimitri Christakis, co-author of Dr. Moreno and director of the Center for the Health, Consecution of Children's Research Institute at the Seattle Children's Research Institute, told the Washington Post.
"We've found a way to identify at-risk children who we wouldn't have had a chance to discover."
Facebook itself is constantly probing the data of its users.
The site's information team has produced statistics on the context of the relationship statuses and the day of St. Valentine's Day, 2010 voter turnout and the nation's satisfaction coefficient (mainly using the information they had access to - Internet freedom advocates have long argued that the site should make its information treasure available for research to others).
But Facebook users know that the site is watching them, whether they like it or not - in exchange for the chance to play Scrabble with a friend who is thousands of miles away, you need to give the page of your personal information.
But what if Facebook users become part of a research they don't even know about?
Scientists have clearly defined rules on how to collect off-line data. However, online data is accessible to everyone.
"I don't think most users thought scientists could look at their profiles," says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at London Knowledge Lab, a 2006 study he conducted using the public Facebook walls of his students.
"As far as they were concerned, they took it as information only between them and their friends."
It is also then weighed the question of methodology.
Even in the off-line research, there is no guarantee that the subject is completely honest.
There is no way to verify in any way on Facebook how much of the information on the profile and the posts on the wall are true.
"What do you say on Facebook and what you do outside of Facebook are two completely different things," Selwyn explains.
That is why Selwin, who spent years researching new technologies, thinks that a pencil and a notebook remain the best possible tool to be used in the research.
"When you go out into the real world and talk to real people, it's something that can't be replaced," he says.
"Social research should be about society and social activities - and a hell of a lot of social activities are still going on off-line."
"Cold and Inhabitable": Anders Behring Breivik attends his first public trial
Anders Behring Breivik, a man who has admitted to ploting two attacks during which 77 people were killed in Norway this summer, described himself as a "deliberate" as a fighter during his first public judicial hearing in Oslo.
"I am the military commander in the Norwegian Resistance Movement and among the Knights of the Knights of Norway," he said in court, where 500 people gathered.
"I object to the court of justice because you were given a mandate by organizations supporting the ideology of hatred and because it promotes multiculturalism."
"I confess to my actions, but I do not plead guilty for them."
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during this monologue because "he did not want to give Breivik the opportunity to use the hearing as a stage from which he could proclaim his views."
For the same reason, he refused to allow Breivik, who had brought a prepared speech, to address relatives of his victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered the police to keep Breivik in custody for another 12 weeks, banned him from having any media coverage for 4 teens, and announced that the final authorities would have complete control over all his visits and all the correspondence for eight weeks.
The hearing was attended by about 30 relatives of the victims and the survivors.
Some came in the hope of being able to look the Breiviks in the eye, others to make sure he was held firmly locked up.
They all took part in order to move the case to an early closure.
"It seemed to me that he looked cold and inhuman," one of the survivors of the attack told NRK.
"It wasn't pleasant, but for all I can tell that after I saw and heard the suspect, I'd mentally moved on a little further."
Breivik, in a dark suit and a blue tie, remained calm and professional throughout the hearing. Upon arriving and going into the building, without difficulty, viewed to the audience of the journalists and the survivors.
Despite Breivik's bizarre notion that he was part of a larger "resistance" movement, the judge found that he was not insane, and noted that there was no proof that he had an accomplice.
It may be a comfort to some that the attacks of 22. June seems to be the work of a single extremist and not a group of radicals.
But this does not automatically diminish the grief and confusion that is still in the minds and hearts of the nation.
"I wish she'd look like a monster, but she's not," a relative of one of the victims said.
"If I did, things would be a lot easier."
7 lessons learned from a lost interview with Steve Jobs in a movie heading to cinemas this week
As soon as Steve Jobs 5. He died in October, the opinions of people who compared him with Henry Ford - and elected him as his genius The greatest modern inventor.
At the recently rediscovered Jobs interview, which was brushed off for a special film that is heading to cinemas this week, it will be the fact that his creative mind perfectly understood the business processes and the workflows behind its products.
He was an amazing designer, a dreamer and self-appointed member of the hippie movement, but also a pedantic organizer and a man who matches each detail to the smallest detail - he believed that many entrepreneurs suffer from "the idea that a truly great idea is 90 per cent of their work... [but] there is still a long journey of mourning work between the excellent idea and the excellent resulting product."
In 1995, Bob Cringely worked on TV's TV show, the Triumph of Computer Fools, which was about the dawn of personal computers. During filming, a unique, more than one-hour interview took place.
By this time it had been a decade since Jobs had been forced to leave Apple, and he was busy with his new computer company, NeXT, and was eager to see how the general public would receive the Internet.
In the end, only a short portion of Cringely's entire interview was used on the TV show, and the original copies of the interview were said to have been lost in the transfer.
Shortly after Jobs' death, however, the VHS copies were found in the director's garage.
It is this material, slightly edited, that forms the basis of the 68-minute Steve Jobs: Lost Interview, which is heading to selected cinemas this Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone who is famous for his reluctance to provide longer interviews, Jobs seems surprisingly enthusiastic about having to talk about his technological philosophy and business strategies.
And he also turns out to be a very thoughtful person.
Four times during the interview, there will be a longer pause between the question and the answer - 10 to 15 seconds of thinking about when you can see how Jobs thinks through the answer perfectly, to be as apt and accurate as possible.
There are also moments when Jobs' perfectionism surfaces, when he seems impatient at Cringely's questions and propels it to get to more important issues and themes more quickly.
The interview was filmed before the Pixar, iPod or iPhone era, and there are terrifyingly prophetic ideas when Jobs evaluates what other companies do well and badly, offering their own vision of the future in the field of computer technology.
It is one thing to read through the posthumous reviews of Jobs's career, but there is something raw and inspirational about Jobs, whom we see here as an eager dreamer in the flourish of his genius.
Here he has his own vision of what a thing could and should look like.
It wasn't long before he spoke his thoughts, he also began to put them into practice.
A quick summary of the seven scenes from the Lost Interview, which is definitely worth noting:
How he learned to run a business:
"During the years of the business, I always asked: Why do you do this? and the answer was always the same: Well, that's just how it's done."
No one knows why he does what he does, he never thinks about business-related things in depth.
I found that out.
Jobs continues to describe his efforts to simplify the accounting of Apple.
He was utterly confused by the way the cost was recorded - often beginning with the sign that "standard cost" was the one to speculated. At that moment, he decided to set off in his own path - developing an automatic tool that guaranteed that they could determine the commercial costs in a moment.
How he made the rascal on the Pope:
Jobs recalls the "Blue Box" he had built with Steve Wozniak - a device that allowed people to hack into the phone company effectively and call anywhere in the world free of charge.
A number of the devices have been written about the device in the past, but the enthusiasm of describing the Blue Box as a tool of power is literally infectious.
It tells how he and Wozniak tested the device using a paid phone and were switched from one AT&T network to another during the call, while using as many satellites as possible.
"We've trampled around the world at least half a dozen times, so when we yelled something into a paid phone, it came in from the second phone at the door a minute later," Jobs laughs.
"We were young, and we found that we could build ourselves a thing that was capable of managing infrastructure worth billions of dollars worldwide."
Two of us made a tiny thing that could control a much larger giant - it was an incredible experience and, in my opinion, Apple would never have been created without it.
Jobs continues with the description of the joke he and Wozniak almost completed. They called the Vatican to the Vatican through the Blue Box in the middle of the night, asking if they could speak to the Pope, making the best of their pass for Henry Kissinger.
Gradually, members of the Catholic Church were summoned to speak to the American diplomat in the middle of the night, and it was only just before they roused the Pope himself to the phone that the pair laughed and put the earpiece down.
How he fell in love with technology (and phoned Bill Hewlett):
When he was 12 and looking for spare parts to build a vibrator, he found the number on Bill Hewlett in the phone book and called him.
Not long after their 20-minute interview, Jobs already had a secure summer job at Hewlett-Packard.
"She influenced me inappropriately. It was the only company I recognized at the time, and it was shaping my view of what such a company was and how to treat its employees."
Jobs later became one of HP's employees who visited the company's research labs in Palo Alto, where he saw "the first desktop computer ever made."
It was the size of a suitcase, had a CRT monitor, and I immediately fell in love with it.
As a teenager, I was up and up at HP, hanging around that computer and started writing programs for him.
How to devise innovation:
In several places, Jobs talks during the interview about how he devises new products while on the fly.
Early in his career, when he set out to sell a few straight-line records, a customer asked him to assemble a whole computer for him.
He had only 30 paid days at his disposal, during which time he had to devise, assembled, and deliver the finished equipment.
When he was later at Apple, he recalls the problems they faced in developing computer mice:
"I remember when we argued quite wildly . . . they shouted at me that it would take five years [to build a mouse that would cost $300] to get tired of it, I came out and found a designer."
Ninety days later, we were able to produce a perfectly reliable mouse for $15.
How big companies are at breath:
A long time before he led the resurrection of Apple, Jobs foresawly predicted that many industrial leaders would falter and lose their market share.
"Let's say you work with IBM or Xerox, so you do better copiers or printers, and then what's next?"
You have a monopoly on the market, so the company could no longer be more successful.
At that point, sales and marketing are in the system, so the companies are headed by the people in charge of this, while the people in charge of their own products are out of the decision-making process.
The technology genius who led the company to its unshakable position is now replaced by people who have no idea about good or bad products - skill and technical knowledge are essential.
That's exactly what happened at Xerox...
Xerox could have owned literally the entire computer industry.
It could have been ten times the size of it, it could have been Microsoft's '90s...
But instead of winning, they set up a loss.
How he sees innovation as a form of art:
"There's still a long journey and a lot of work between the excellent idea and the excellent result of the product . . . and as the great idea develops, it changes and grows."
During that time, you learn a lot about him.
You have to accept a whole series of compromises - certain things you just can't make the electrons, glass, robots or factories do.
You have to keep in mind 5,000 things in mind at all times - different concepts - and compose them together...
In the end, it depends on taste - you try to think about the best things that mankind has ever created, and in a way you try to project them into what you do yourself.
Picasso said that good artists copy, but the best artists steal.
I was never ashamed of stealing the best ideas.
The Macintosh Society was so amazing and successful because the people who worked in it were excellent musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians and, coincidentally, the best computer experts in the world.
If it weren't for computers and new technologies, they'd do amazing things in completely different industries.
Scalia and Thomas dined with opponents of the Healthcare Act at the time of their case being dealt with by a court
The day the Supreme Court sat behind closed doors to discuss the politically controversial question of whether to accept an objection to President Obama's health care law, two of his judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, attended a formal dinner sponsored by a law firm that will attend the trial.
The event took place last Thursday, when all nine judges met to discuss the submitted motions.
One of the cases discussed was a lawsuit brought by the 26 states challenging the radical overhaul of health care passed by Congress last year - a law that mobilized conservative activists around the world.
The judges agreed to hear the suit. But a 5.5-hour meeting is expected in March, the result of which will further stir up the presidential election, which is scheduled for 2012 and will be in full swing at the time of the decision.
A lawyer to face the court and seek to refute the law will most likely be Paul Clement, who served as the United States Attorney General under George W. Bush.
Clement's law firm, Bancroft PLLC, was one of nearly two dozen companies that helped sponsor the annual Federalist Society's annual dinner, which has been involved in defending conservative legal principles for years.
Another company that sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, is represented by one of the business associations challenging the law, the so-called National Independent Business Federation.
Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc, for which huge financial resources are at stake in the process.
Dinner took place at a Washington hotel hours after a court discussion on the subject of the case.
It was attended, among others, by Mitch McConnell, the Senate Republican's top official and a confirmed opponent of the Health Care Act.
And the guests' show? Scalia and Thomas.
This is nothing new: This pair of judges have been involved in the Federalist Society's events for years.
Nor is it anything that is contrary to the rules of ethics.
In fact, these judges are exempted from the obligation to comply with the conduct to which junior federal judges are subject.
However, if this were not the case, their conduct would certainly fall under the C4 principle, which states that "the judge can participate in the events that are currently related and other organisations are organising to raise funds, but the judge must not be a speaker, a guest of honour, or be a guest of honour."
Still, Scalia and Thomas's relationship with the two law firms performing in the case, as well as companies with a huge financial interest in the case, were more than enough to alert activists calling for ethics in government.
"This shocking violation of ethics and indifference to the code of conduct is contradicting the claims of several judges that the Supreme Court behaves according to the same rules that apply to all other federal judges," said Bob Edgar, president of Common Cause.
"Judges drank and dined at the social benefit together with the legal representatives awaiting the case before the court."
Their presence and assistance in raising funds through this action undermine the legs with all claims of detachment, which is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas showed little sympathy to their critics, telling them that they also easily combined their courtesy with actions such as the Federalist Society.
Thomas's wife, Ginni, is a high-ranking conservative activist.
Moreover, the Conservatives argue that the ethical problem lies mainly with Judge Elena Kagan and not Scalia with Thomas.
Kagan worked as Prosecutor General under President Obama when the first objections to the law emerged in court.
Kagan's critics are pressuring her to renounce her involvement in the case, claiming that she was fighting for the law so much at the time than she could be unbiased now.
Kagan gave no indication that she was about to step down.
Boeing wins record $18 billion for jet aircraft
The Emirates airline is ordering 50 two-wheel-drive Boeing 777 jurdible jets, with the option to buy 20 more.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliner aircraft to Aman Air, for which it collects more than $1 billion.
When a company gets an order for 50 pieces of its products, it's usually no cause for celebration.
However, if the company is the aircraft manufacturer Boeing Co. and the price of these 50 aircraft is a combined record $18 billion, it is a different matter.
Equally important news is where Boeing received the order: the Middle East, a growing gold mine for future aircraft orders.
According to a forecast released on Monday, the Chicago company estimates that the airline in the Middle East will need 2,520 aircraft worth $450 billion over the next 20 years.
Over the weekend, Boeing announced its biggest order in history in terms of dollar value for commercial aircraft - 50 two-wheel jet Boeing 777.
The sensational contract came from the Emirates airline, a Dubai-based airline.
Boeing told the 2011 Dubai Air Show that the airline had the option to purchase an additional 20 aircraft, which would allow the total value of the contract to rise to USD 26 billion.
On Monday, Boeing announced that Oman Air had ordered six Boeing 787-8s, sometimes also called a Dreamliner, which boasted significantly better fuel consumption and passenger equipment.
The total cost of these six aircraft exceeds USD 1 billion.
"This is an excellent report for the whole of Boeing," said Neal Dihora, an analyst for the Morningstar.
"The quality of these specific customers is very high."
Many airlines in the Middle East belong to the country's oil-producing nations.
This means that they not only have the money to pay for the planes, but the rise in the price of fuel - mostly damaging to the airline, because it is one of its largest costs - is not so decisive, because the country alone makes money on higher oil prices.
This is important because they are not as likely as in other airlines to cancel or delay aircraft orders in order to increase fuel prices, says Dihora.
"They have such natural protection," he says.
The contract from Emirates airlines consolidates Boeaing's leading position in the broad-flagged aircraft market and is driving into the shorthand of Airbus SAS, which wanted to try to break Boeing's dominance with its transport model A350.
Boeing's victory comes four months after Airbus officials announced that the first flight of their largest A350 aircraft, a direct competitor to the 777-300ER, would be postponed.
The postponement was made because customers demanded a greater utility load on the aircraft and hange, so the manufacturer took time to give the machine more engine power.
The cost of Boeing Co's actions rose 1.5% to $67.94.
The Mexican president's sister appears to have been defeated in the Michani elections
Luisa Maria Calderon claims that her opponent, Fausto's PRI, was helped by drug traffickers in the hunt for the governor's chair.
Felipe Calderon's sister appears to have lost the governor's post in Michoacán in the violent state election. On Monday, she subsequently said that one of her opponents had been helped to win by drug traffickers.
Preliminary results were attributed to the leadership in the Western-state governor's election, Fausto Vallej of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI.
"The involvement of the members of organized crime in the whole electoral process and especially until yesterday's election process is alarming not only for Michoacán, but for our entire country," Luisa Maria Calderon said in an interview with the radio day after the election on Sunday.
"They threatened our candidates, members of the polling group... They seized the ballot box, built roadblocks... and let people vote to order for PRI.
The PRI ruled Mexico for seven decades until it lost its presidency in 2000.
But he plans to return to power soon, and winning the Michoacán election is an important step in this effort.
The PRI Party hopes to win the presidential election in July.
It seems that Vallejo beat Calderon, who was in charge just a very close day before the election.
Calderon, the Conservative candidate for her brother National Action Party, or PAN, refused to recognize Vallejon as the winner.
The third was Silvano Aureolis, the candidate for the left-wing Democratic Revolution Party, or PRD, which until now controlled the governor's office. For the fractious and unlucky persecuted party, it is a very unfortunate loss ahead of the 2012 presidential election.
Aureoles also refused to recognise the preliminary results as valid.
Vallejo, the former mayor of the capital of the state, named Morelia, rejects any relationship with drug traffickers and encourages other candidates to be recognized for the results.
For a long time, Michoacán was controlled by drug cartels specializing in marijuana, heroin and methamphetamines.
This is the native state of President Calderon, and it was in Michoacán that he launched a military fight against traffickers in December 2006.
But the violence persisted.
The mayor of the PAN party, a supporter of Luisa Maria Calderon, was assassinated just a week before the election, and many candidates withdrew from the election out of fear.
However the results of the elections in Michoacán look like it for the PRI, the victory will help the party gain a new boost.
The expected PRI representative in the presidential election, Enrique Pena Nieto, from Wahington, congratulated Vallejo and said: "I think this victory could be very encouraging, given the coming year."
ADB calls on Asia to help save Eurozone
Asian Development Bank has called on India and China to be ready to help rescue the Eurozone ahead of its severe debt crisis, or there could be an overall downturn in the world economy, which would also have a negative impact on the growth of the economies in Asia.
Rajat Nag, the CEO of ADB, a company-based company based in Manila, said that the world's two fastest-growing economies must "do everything in their power" to help help the monetary bloc's rapid recovery through the International Monetary Fund, or direct bilateral agreements.
He warned that the states of the Bric [Brazil, Russia, India, China] group were following all European difficulties "too dispassionately" and said that Asian financial assistance, combined with European leadership, would help spark the long-term collapse of the global economy.
"We're all in this together."
"So anyone who could help Europe out of the crisis is useful," he told the Financial Times during an interview at the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
"Asia may be protected to some extent, but it's certainly not immune."
"So if China and India can help, they should certainly do it."
The European Monetary Association has been heavily tested for months by a major debt crisis.
In recent days, Italy's borrowing costs have risen dangerously, with the prime ministers of both Italy and Greece resigned.
The growing debt crisis in Europe has raised concerns about being dragged back into recession by the global economy, and calls have begun to emerge to bring new booming front-running uprights economies to help the Eurozone find a solution.
Mr Nag had predicted that all Asian support would be channelled through the IMF, but noted that mutual assistance - such as the purchase of the European Union's financial assistance fund, the European Financial Stability Fund - would give the Asian partners European countries more bargaining opportunities.
Anand Sharma, India's trade minister, said that "India will do what it can to do," to help the Eurozone, as its own economy is now suffering from a decline in exports and a drying up of foreign capital inflows.
"No one wants the Eurozone to remain unstable and restless," he said.
"We face a tough task and we must maintain a high rate of growth."
"This is not an alternative, it is a bare fact, because how else could we find employment for tens of millions of our young men and women."
Others argue that emerging economies, such as India's, have nothing to help European economies when they are forced to face their own serious economic problems.
Ashutosh Varshney, a professor at Brown University in the US, said it would be very difficult to explain to Europe's aid to the 1.2 billion people of India, with 800 million of them living from USD 2 or less per day.
"Someday they might find out that the Greeks retire at 50 and enjoy their holidays on their holidays, which would be difficult to explain to them," he noted.
Similarly, Lee Howell, the Director General of the World Economic Forum, questioned why India's stock markets should be used to maintain well-paid jobs for many Greek citizens in poorly managed and loss-making sectors such as rail transport.
Mr Nag stressed that the Eurozone crisis is threatening a "dangerous domino effect."
The bank's forecast for 7.5% economic growth in Asia between 20112012 is now facing a "risk of decline" due to the European threat.
He said that vulnerable emerging markets must create "plans of unpredictable spending" to be protected from decline and significant capital outflows from their economies.
A Pentagon warning about possible defense cuts
In Congress, on Monday, Defense Secretary Leon Panetta gave a big swipe to the boiler, warning that looming, automatic budget cuts could threaten national security and trigger a financial chain reaction starting at the Pentagon and continuing through the battlefield in Afghanistan to civilian assembly lines.
The Pentagon will already have to spend a $450 billion budget cut over the next ten years, but is now worried about a reduction of an additional $600 billion if Congress fails to conclude an spending deal.
"The effects of these cuts would be devastating for the entire resort," wrote Panetta in a letter to senators John McCain, Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, South Carolina.
He said the failure of Congress to reach a budget agreement and the resulting so-called attachment would cause a 23% flat drop and a halt to many new projects.
"Due to such a huge reduction, used in this reckless way, it will not be possible to carry out most of our construction or shipbuilding projects - you can't buy only three-quarters of a building or a ship. In addition, there could be a serious damage to further modernization efforts," the Panetta wrote to the senators.
"We will also be forced to separate many of our civilian employees, and since the reduction is to take place so quickly, we will also almost certainly have to send civilians on a forced holiday in order to be able to meet the target requirements."
"These changes can shake with the faith of those who care for our army and seriously damage its readiness."
Eventually, the cuts will also affect the combat units, Panetta announced.
"Although the accounts for financing possible war operations overseas will not be directly affected by this subshuffle, the operations there will be negatively affected by serious changes in other budgets," Panetta warned.
"There will be cuts to the contractors, too, resulting in a delay in the agreed contracts supporting the war efforts of our people."
"The stocks of paid staff will be reduced, which will also result in late payments to contractors and subsequent breaches of legal and political support."
Both Senators had written off the Panetts ten days earlier, asking for details regarding the potential implications for the automated cuts at the Department of Defense.
"The consequences of the Ministry of Defense could cause a rapid degradation of the view of the United States as a world military power."
"We are strictly against this harsh measure," the senators announced in a joint statement Monday afternoon when they released the letter of Panetta.
"It's not a conclusion we can live with, and we certainly don't want to sign off on it."
"The cut-and-mere plans are a threat to the national security of the United States, which we should not allow."
"It remains to be seen whether the Panetta letter and fresh warnings will increase the pressure on Congress to the authorising budget and intensify the votes calling to skip the Pentagon's list of cut-down areas.
The Panetta had been increasingly open in interviews recently in conversations about possible cuts, even though he had moved to his senior position in the Pentagon, with years of experience in congruent budgeting in Congress and the White House, so he knew he was in a tough fight.
At a press conference held in the week of the week, the Defence Minister hinted at a brief picture of what his resort might be in store for - the army's shell, but inside which the core would be missing.
"It will be like a ship without sailors."
"He'll be like an amoeba-free brigade."
"He'll be like an air force without trained pilots."
"It will be like a paper tiger, like an army of barracks, buildings and bombs without enough trained soldiers to complete the mission," the Pentagon's speech said at the start of the Pentagon's speech.
"She will be like a force without morality, unprepared and unable to cope with a possible enemy."
"As a result, he will welcome the aggression..."
In the annex, supplied with the letter to McCain and Graham, the Panetta specifies how the reduction will result in "significant operational risks: a late response to crises, conflicts and disasters; a significant reduction in the possibility of drops and deployments around the world; the anticipated unacceptable risk in future combat operations."
In addition, the Panetta added that some of the largest defense projects could face an end, including those already being tested, as well as those that are only in the early planning stages.
The list included the F35 project, the planned new bomber, a new-generation ballistic submarine, a new-generation offshore battleship and a new ground combat vehicle that the military and the Marine Corps wanted to replace the Humvee.
By halting further development and testing of the F35, $80 billion would be saved over the next decade, but its proponents say it is a necessary next step in improving the military, which needs to be dealt with by the country's potential threats from China and other rivals.
How to recognize a lie
A glimpse of recent newspaper headlines suggests how serious and pervasive lies and deceitfulness in everyday life are.
Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain is busy accusing him of sexually harassing several women - both parties claiming that the other is lying.
Administrators at Penn State University were accused of perjury when they tried to hide records of a retired football coach sexually assaulting the boy.
Last week, French President Nicolas Sarkozy was caught calling US President Barrack Obama with a microphone running that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is a liar.
The lie has been able to ruin the entire career and undermine the stability of many countries.
New York congressman and online exhibitionist Anthony Weiner made a fool of himself by releasing information that was immediately refuted by unquestioned evidence.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards has been accused of using the funds of his campaign to try to conceal his illegitimate affair.
And no one will ever forget the media circus that came around Bill Clinton when he lied during his second term in office about his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinenski.
It's crawling with stories about cheating at school and university.
There are cases where teachers themselves give their students test answers just to make them look good in their assessments.
Mentors who should teach the contrary send a message that the lie and the deception are acceptable.
How many scams do we encounter?
Studies show you're lying somewhere between 10 and 200 cases on a single day.
Let's assume that many of them are merciful lies.
Another study showed that strangers had lied three times in their first meetings in their lives during the first ten minutes of their first meeting.
Determining lies, or "recognizing lies," is a necessary skill that should be adopted by everyone, whether for personal or professional reasons.
But it is not a social game that is similar to, shall we say, Sharad, when one cries out, "I have you." Recognition of deception is a serious science industry working with scientific data collected during the last six decades at prestigious universities during detailed research projects, especially in the fields of psychology and philosophy.
One of the research results is that most of the old myths about the lie have been disproved.
The liars feel up to you in the eye.
It's not like they're stumbling, stuttering, blushing or fidgeting.
But don't infer from the fact that it's somehow difficult to spot and detect the liars.
A trained lie identifier can detect the truth from a sentence structure, small facial expressions, the way questions are made up and their timing.
I have spent several years gathering scientific knowledge from a large and evolving lie-recognition industry, and it is clear that exposeing deception is a modern skill that can be easily learned and can be very helpful in today's complex world - especially if your work duties include hiring, interviewing, negotiating or leading people.
Good liars can read well in others, let them relax in the vigilance, direct their emotions, and intuitively realize how the other side accepts them.
We know from research that extroverts lie more often than introverts, that men uttering more "besty" lies, while women call more lies "focused on others" - mostly to protect someone's feelings - that married people lie less often to their partners than single people (but the lies they say tend to be "outrageous").
We also know that if you are seen as a sinner, others feel less guilty when they lie to you.
How do you know someone's lying?
First observe the subject's normal behaviour.
It's called "incoming sighting."
Thanks to him, he will have a later finding out with what to compare with.
Note the subject's posture, his laughter, his voice work.
You should know if someone is routinely tapping your legs all the time so you don't improperly indict him of a lie just because he starts tapping his foot in the middle of the meeting.
Then try to identify clusters of false verbal and non-verbal behavior.
But take this as a warning signal, not as evidence of a lie.
People who utter the lie can stop moving the upper half of their bodies when they try to remember their imaginary story, they can turn their shoes to the door, romp to the exit, significantly change their posture, or show "reliven after the interview" - an exaggerated relieved sigh and a change of position when the confession is difficult to confine after them.
People conducting interviews often release a false signal that the interview is over, only to see what the relief will look like after it is over.
Also feel the subject's language.
Famous is the story of Scott Peterson's once miscooning and using the previous time when he claimed that his murdered woman was alive, which ran a nationwide search for her body.
The urging individuals can also be aloof: "I had no sexual relationship with that lady... Miss Lewinsky" or the difficult question will be repeated.
The most common verbal characters are very slight.
Some may use a lot of "moning language" when they answer the difficult question: "Well... to tell you the truth... from what I know... to the best of my knowledge."
We don't learn too much of the facts in that answer, and it's often another warning signal.
There is no spell to reveal every lie, but it is possible to master the skills by which the lie can be viewed.
Using these skills, one will have a better chance of not falling for a liar and a con man in his personal and work-working.
The controversial plan to build an oil pipeline will be redirected after the threat of a delay in US government approval
A few days after the Obama administration threatened to postpone approval of the planned oil pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico - setting the unions against each other, but reassuring the environmentalists - a company in charge of building the pipeline that it was willing to redirect the project to set things in motion again.
TransCanada announced on Monday evening that it would move the planned pipeline route from the ecologically sensitive Sandhills area in Nebraska and is confident that the project will be approved anyway.
The company announced the decision at a press conference at the headquarters of the non-Autilus government.
TransCanada's Otter, Alex Pourbax, claims that the company is confident that the pipeline will eventually be approved, even though it will take a different route.
That announcement came after the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced last week that it was postponing a decision on a federal permit for the project, from which it would not carry out studies of possible alternate routes by which it would be possible to not interfere with the Sandhills area of Nebraska and the waterproof layer of Ogallala, the vast underground water supply pool.
"This is really a move forward," Republican Republican Representative Lee Terry of Nebraska told Fox News.
A new environmental report commissioned by the State Department would likely postpone any decision until 2013, a year after next year's elections, but the authorities refuse to play any role in the decision.
In a written statement last week, Obama described the decision as a request from the State Department and expressed his support for it.
The 1,700-mile-long pipes will be connected by the Gulf of Mexico.
From the province of Alberta to the Refinery in Texas, 700,000 barrels of oil flow daily.
This path will need to be crossed by six states.
This project is absolutely hated by environmentalists, but it is loved by the work crews, who estimate that 20,000 new jobs will appear when working on the pipeline.
But the Nebraska legislators opposed the plan, considering introducing laws that would force the company not to interfere with the Sand Hills region and the waterproof Ogallal layer, the main source of drinking water and irrigation.
An existing study on the environmental impact commissioned by the State Department found that the project would only have a minor negative environmental impact, but a source in the energy industry said that the inspector general from the Ministry had commissioned a new review of the entire process of the original study, focusing mainly on two issues.
It was once whether the lobbyist hired to TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was a Plary Clinton adviser in 2008, was not in a conflict of interest program.
Others, whether the firm, which was hired for the original study, was unsuccessfully chosen because it had ties to TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle is accused of vomiting a toddler in fear
The New York City family claims that singer Patti LaBelle furiously stormed into the lobby of their Manhattan house and terrified their daughter in a hurry to get her startled.
The singer's "Lady Marmalade" climb scorched the 18-month-old Genevieve Monk so much that she suffered "involves of personality, sleep disorder" and "an increased fear of strangers," her family says in a lawsuit filed with the Manhattan Supreme Court.
On November 10 of last year, stage technician Kevin Monk, his wife, Roseanna, a kindergarten teacher, and Genevieve were planning a family trip.
When Kevin Monk brought the car, Roseanna Monk and her luggage came down to the vestibule of their home in the Riverside Boulevard section, carrying Genevieve with her.
Roseanna Monk said she had stopped by the door for a moment and put the child down for a moment.
"Someone appeared behind my back and said, "Do you know what your daughter is doing?" I said "yes" and I left to pick it up"
LaBelle rebuked the pregnant woman in an irritated manner.
"In an aggressive tone, she said to me, "You shouldn't put your daughter at the door,"" said Roseanna Monk.
"I told her, "I don't care about your opinion.""
She became enraged and began to speak obscene - loudly shouting the simplest expressions...
She was carrying a bottle of water and began splashing water at me.
She claims that Genevieve had a hysterical attack.
"I said to the woman, "Look at what you did to my daughter.""" said the child's mother.
LaBelle lunged at her mother - who was still in Genevieve's arms - and had to be stopped by her entourage, who subsequently dragged her into the waiting car, Roseanna Monk testified.
The daughter, meanwhile, was screaming so much that she threw up, she added.
Later, the family sent a letter demanding an apology from LaBelle, but received no reply.
Lawyer and spokesperson for the singer LaBelle are not responding to our phone calls to comment on the case.
The lawsuit is seeking unspecified damages, but the family attorney, Sam Davis, said he had taken the case up for free and that the family planned to donate all the extra money to a charity dedicated to cancer children.
"The purpose is to get Patti LaBelle to take responsibility for her actions," Davis said.
"This behavior is completely unacceptable, especially if he is directed at a school teacher holding an 18-month-old baby in her arms."
Adverse climate hampers economy
During the first year of Mario López Valdez's government, unemployment and unreliability rose in Sinaloa, with falling foreign investment, and with them the economy
2011 will be written in the economic history of Sinaloa. This is the first year of the government of Mario López Valdez, which itself is called the government of change. This government has brought with it high expectations in terms of economic progress, however, due to adverse climatic conditions at the start of the year, no growth was observed and there was even a decline in the main economic development indicators.
Low February temperatures caused millions of losses in agriculture, curtailed the growth potential for the state economy, responsible for a 3.6% reduction in economic activity in the first semester of this year. In the area of agriculture, there was a historic 31.16% decline, which disrupted the dynamism of other economic sectors as well.
According to the damage report issued by the Mexican Council for Sustainable Rural Development, the damage was recorded on 582,835 hectares of cultivated land, of which 78.03% were completely destroyed and partial damage was found for the remaining 21.07%. The main crops destroyed include vegetables, corn and peas.
The drop in economic activity until November was caused by a constant rise in unemployment in the state. According to the National Institute for Statistical and Geography, the unemployment rate in the state recorded an increase in the first three quarters. Between January and March, the 55,053 Sinaloa residents were not employed, representing an unemployment rate of 4.53% of the economically active population. In the second quarter, unemployment rose to 5.28%, and between July and August, average unemployment continued to rise, reaching 6.19%, representing around 74,000 unemployed. Compared to the first quarter, the number of unemployed people increased by 18,969 people.
Less liquidity
Unemployment during the year in the state of Sinaloa is due to multiple factors. According to Gerard López Cervantes, director of the Faculty of Economics and Social Sciences at the UAS, the rise of unemployment can be explained indirectly, based on steps that have been taken at public policy level.
"We are seeing rising unemployment, which is related to various factors. These include, among other things, the loss of liquidity in the market due to resource constraints on the basis of legislation passed by the Congress in the context of the fight against money laundering. It is not easy for people who illegally seize up with dollars to earn them, invest them or use them for something," he stressed.
Stopping migration
López Cervantes said the demographic factor was also involved in the rise in unemployment.
"The number of people going abroad to work, to the United States, has been reduced, both for reasons of difficult entry and then because, even if these people cross the country, it is difficult for them to get a job. So people stay and demand work from our state, so unemployment is rising," he said.
Unreliability
The analysis of the Sinaloa labour market is also deteriorating due to the growing unreliability that prevails in the area of working conditions. According to the National Institute for Statistical and Democracy, 60.38% of the employed population in the state works without paying benefits to the Social Security Administration.
Unemployment and unreliability are joined by other features of the labour market, such as low pay. In this administrative territory, the lowest salaries are from across the country, as reported by the registers of the Mexican Institute of Social Security and the Labor Secretariat and Social Planning.
The average monthly income of the Sinaloa working state was 5,352 pesetas by September, well below the national average, which is at 7,375 pesetas.
Shortening foreign direct investment
Along with a decline in economic activity and an increase in unemployment, the sharpest drop in foreign direct investment in the last 10 years was also recorded in 2011. According to the Ministry of Finance, between January and June, foreign direct investment amounted to $630,6970, a decrease of 87.74% compared to $5,143,312 for the same period the previous year.
On the other hand, the Ministry of Economic Development of the State Government lists investments of 17,280 million pesetas per year. These investments were mainly directed to services businesses.
Dolv
In the context of the scenario of the downturn in the economy, the government asked the state's congress in July to approve a loan of 3 billion peso. This would be earmarked for investment in infrastructure projects in 18 urban areas to revitalise the economy. The local congress approved a loan of 2,600 million peso. By November, no debt gains had been recorded, in any sector of the state economy.
Reactions
According to business sector representatives, the first year of the government of Mario López Valdares pointed out the lack of management of the government's management capabilities.
Miguel Loredo López, president of the National Chamber of the Transforming Industry, said that in 2011 there was a lack of aligning the will of individual sectors, including the state's very government.
"The development of the Sinaloa economy was really tiny during this year. We need to work intensively to get back the land we lost this year. We must redouble our efforts in 2012, a lack of harmonisation of the efforts of all of us and, in particular, the right and synchronised functioning of this new government. Hopefully next year will be much better," he said.
The Grease of the Economy
Loredo López said that the frost-welling events at the start of the year halted the state economy and curtailed its development and growth.
"Favorbital economic movements were caused by a number of events, including frosts. One of the main consequences was a slowdown in the economy, which did not recover quickly enough to restore the dynamism that would allow an acceptable level of movement for processes, products, and services to be achieved. That is why we were well below the expected forecasts at the end of the year," he said.
Redefining the mission
According to Teodor Salazar Uriarte, president of the Employers' Confederation of the Republic of Mexico in Sinaloa, the state should be pushed to more dynamic productive activities.
"In general, we observe that we are in the works. We believe that a long-term plan needs to be prepared in which the objectives and economic direction of the state would be redefined, because it is important that the full potential of the material and human resources that Sinaloa has is mobilised," he said.
The work ahead
President Coparmex stressed the importance of setting a vision for the future to better guide the government's efforts.
"In general, I would say that the government has tried to achieve good results in various areas, with some progress in the area of economic development, but it is important to create a long-term plan," he said.
He said the current administration had shown progress in public policy leadership.
"There are elements that make it possible to claim that the government is trying to be welcoming. I can say that the work done is to be seen here and I believe that the Government is aware that there is also a lot of work ahead of us," he said.
Convicted for 8 kg of marijuana
The acquerer of Navolato was sentenced to five years in prison and 100 days of fines for possession of eight kilos of marijuana.
The Attorney General's Office of the Republic informed that the convicted dealer was Omar Alexis Valenzuela's Sandoval. He was convicted of the offence of health endangerment, specifically for possession of marijuana for commercial purposes.
According to AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I, Valenzuela Sandoval was detained by the branches of the Mexican Army on 7. June 2010 on an errand in Cipriano Valdez Street, opposite Station 80 in the El Castillo district of Navolato.
The dealer was in a pick up white-coloured picked delivery. In the car in the shelf he wore a black bag and a small backpack in the passenger seat. The soldiers found 8 kilograms of 23 grams of marijuana.
For these reasons, the secured man remained available to the Judge of the Second Unit and the proceedings remain internal within the Centre for the Implementation of Legal Impacts of the Offences.
Gives contributions to projects
Social projects, which are part of programmes such as Hárabhat, Rescuing Public Places and 3x1 for Migrants, face the risk of being undeclared or being in a major delay due to the lack of economic resources, said Miguel Ángel López Miranda.
The director of urban social development said that if construction work has moved forward until now, there is now a risk that the government of the state will not be able to secure the appropriate supplies, which require funds of more than 11 million peso for three programmes.
He said the total investment in the three programmes was almost 50 million peso. The state accounts for 25%. Until now, only the Federation and the city have supplied the resources for the work, so it is possible that the projects will be delayed.
"They're supposed to be able to secure almost 12 million, and although the year is coming to an end, we've gotten nothing at all. This is despite the fact that we were supposed to receive part of it in July," he said. "To keep us not wasting time, we have started the projects and are progressing very successfully, but we lack the money'.
He said that last year under the administration of Jesús Aguilar, Padilla, the state did not meet the relevant deliveries, so at the beginning of the new period the city had to apply for a loan in order to be able to pay for more than 7 million not given to them by the state administration.
"The same thing happened to us in the previous six-year term because the state didn't have the economic capacity to participate and the programs went on. To get to the aforementioned programmes this year, we had to raise funds to cover what the state did not finish," he explained.
Despite the fact that there was a promise from state officials regarding the transfer of these resources, he said that a request from Armandu Villarreal, the secretary for administration and finance had been sent to expedite the proceedings and to arrive as soon as possible.
"They were to give us 12 million and although the year is coming to an end, we haven't even gotten a peso yet."
The Court of Justice approves 'end of analogue broadcasting' in Mexico in 2015
Replacing analogous digital signals is one of the most important changes the world has seen in recent years.
The Supreme State Court (SCJN) dismissed the constitutional action brought by the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies against the Presidential Decree, which wants to hasten the so-called "off the switching of analogous signals" and implement it in 2015 instead of 2021. He noted that the necessary eight votes had not been found to invalidate him.
A minority of four ministers, including the president of the court, Juan Silva Meza, believed that President Felipe Calderón had not exceeded his authority by issuing a decree setting out the individual steps that would lead to the transition to terrestrial digital television.
With that result, the action brought by the Senate was dismissed, because a qualified majority of the eight votes required to enable the court to rule on the constitutionality or unconstitutionality of the decree, which thus remains valid, was not reached.
The draft judgment drafted by Minister Olgou Sánchez Cordero submits the possibility of declaring the decree unconstitutional, as the regulation of all issues relating to radio and television is a matter reserved by law for the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cofetel). This violates the principles of hierarchical subordination and exceptions to the law.
Only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero themselves voted for the project.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies supported the constitutional dispute in an attempt to combat the decree. Minister Sánchez Cordero has accepted the requirements and suspended the application of the decree and all the actions described in it leading to the digital shift.
The ministerial meeting also decided to reject the lawsuit filed by the Chamber of Deputies without entering the discussion on the proposal also in charge of Minister Sánchez Cordero.
In his remarks, the Prime Minister stated that he did not endorse the arguments of the proposal to the effect that the Federal Executive could not structure measures through the general standards of the measures to prepare public administration.
"I don't think that even if it did, it would offend the autonomy of the regulator," and recalled that the planning of public policies in strategic areas like the telecommunications sector is the responsibility of the federal executive, which has a constitutional mandate to determine the direction of the state.
The digital comparison of analogal signals is one of the biggest changes experienced by the world in recent years. It is related to better use of the radioelectric spectrum, better signal quality and multiple channels.
He believes that delaying the change would be to delay the benefits of digitisation, which requires decisions on the public interest. Digitisation has not only a technical dimension, but "sends also to economic, social, political and national security issues."
As he pointed out, these questions "require to operate the entire established system, in accordance with the principle of the state's economic direction. It includes a number of competences that the Constitution entrusts to the Government of the State."
He recalled that a number of countries around the world had already completed the transition to the digital system and had done so through their governments, even though they had at their disposal highly specialised technical bodies.
He said that it was not possible for the government, by issuing a dissenting decree that extends to some extent to the area of congressional powers, to introduce in the area of administration to comply with laws prepared by the legislative power.
In Michoacán they analyze the possibility of census "voice in the voice"
According to the data published by the PREP, the difference between first and second place in the governor's election is less than 27 percent. The votes of 879 of the 6074 electoral districts have not yet been counted.
The "voice" census option appeared in this year's elections in Michoacán, where, in line with the data published by the Preliminary Election Results Programme (PREP), the difference between first and second place in the governor's election is less than 27 percent, and this has not yet been included by the votes of 879 out of a total of 6074 electoral districts.
In this context, the chairwoman of the General Council of the Electoral Institute in Michoacán (IEM), María de los Ángeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that a few days ago, on November 9, the electoral authority had approved a number of measures to harmonise local standards with federal electoral reform.
As will be recalled, Michoacán has not officially confirmed his political constitution or his State Electoral Code or the Electoral Justice Act. Indeed, the State Congress approved the reforms shortly before the legal deadline for their entry into force was to expire in that parliamentary term, and the governor of Leonel Godoy, neglected to publish them within the deadline of the Law of the Official Journal, saying he had some objections to them.
On November 9, the Supreme State Court (SCJN) resolved a constitutional dispute initiated by local legislative power and declared the head of state's vote in the case of constitutional reforms to be "invalid and illegal" because it has no right to "neither approve or veto them."
Asked by the possibility of a "voice" vote of singles, María de los Ángeles Llanderal said that the approval of the relevant measures by the IEM Board of General Council would make it possible for both the partial and overall census to be carried out by the local electoral body.
In this way, a partial counting of votes, one or more electoral parcels, will be possible to make under the following conditions: the election results do not agree; there is no record of the counting of the votes and calculation in the relevant box, or the President does not have it available; or if errors have been made and obvious violations of the election results.
In addition, the total recount of the votes in all ballot boxes will be made if there is an indication that the difference between the potential winner of the election and the candidate in the second place is less than or equal to one percentage point; whenever the explicit request of a representative of the party and/or coalition that proposed the candidate in second place appears at the start of the session.
A total recalculation will also be made when, after a proper addition, it is found that the difference between the likely winner and the candidate in the second place is equal to or less than one percentage point, and also whenever there is an explicit request from a political party whose candidate has come second. In this case, the election parcels for which a partial census has been made will be decommissioned.
It should be noted that in such a situation there is an election in Morelia, where according to the PREP the difference between the first and second place is less than 0.16%, although 129 of the total 923 electoral districts have not yet been counted.
His will
His ashes will be scattered in the Nurasom Mountains, the family confirmed.
The remains of pilot Felipe Bacio Cortés were transported to Saltillo, his hometown, on Sunday night. During Monday, there will be a ceremony and a memorial service.
According to the family, the lieutenant's last wish was for his ashes to be scattered in the upheaval of the Zapalinamy Mountains.
After receiving the highest honours, along with the other persons who died in the accident, the family, Bacio Cortése, returned to the capital, Coahuila, aboard a Mexican air force plane. The family and closest friends attended the ceremony at Campo Marte.
At noon the lieutenant-colonel's ashes arrived in the chapel located on the avenue of Nazario Ortiz Garza, where family and friends also came.
At 5:30 p.m., the farewell was held at the Saltillo Institute of Technology, organized by his former high school classmates and members of the American Football team, of which Felipe Bacio was also a member at the time of his graduation.
"He wanted to return to Saltilla, and his wish was to be scattered in the Nurasom Mountains. He always told his family and his friends this way," said Sandra Bacio Cortés, the pilot's sister.
According to her, the lieutenant colonel fulfilled all his wishes, he was at the top of his life, "he was a wonderful man, an extraordinary father, a son, a loving brother living for his family."
Felipe Bacio Cortés left the town of Saltillo very young and joined the Colegio del Aire flight school in Zapopán, Jalisco.
Some didn't believe it because they said he even drove a truck, however, he always went to his dream to become a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Dávila Bacio remembers him as a very good man, "as a sooner as he came to Saltillo, the whole family wanted to see him, as he did when he brought Martha Sahagun to Saltillo."
The young man even remembers that when he was seven years old, he went to Zapopan at the graduation of his uncle, so he is convinced that he died doing what he liked best in his life: the driving of the plane.
They said their last goodbye
With Felipe Bacio Cortés, the lieutenant colonel in the Mexican Air Force, we said goodbye to all the honors that Governor Jorge Torres López, the citizens and the government of the state, the Mexican military through the sixth military zone, the Mexican Air Force itself, the leaders and students of the Technology High School in Saltillo, where he studied in 1985 and excelled in both his studies and in sports.
Bacio Cortés died in recent days after a helicopter he was driving fell. Also on board was the secretary of the government, José Francisco Blake Mora, and six other people, all officials of this state.
At 18:05, the remains of the Solford native Bacio Cortés (fallen) arrived to be handed over to the Mexican Air Force, led by Major Jaime Martinez, through a funeral service, to the area, where his family, his daughter Amanda, and wife Cristina, the mother, siblings and other relatives, students and teachers had gathered.
Three abandoned bodies found dead on Cadereyta NL farm
Hours before the discovery, military officials presented to the media 11 people who were detained in this area for crimes related to organised crime.
The bodies of the three men murdered by gunfire in various body parts and head were found at the abandoned farmhouse of the village of Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo León.
The discovery took place on the 1.5-kilometre road from Cadereyta to Santiago, the level of the area known as El Castillo.
People who moved in these places noticed that the beige-cock fence's hut had an open door from time to time.
When they looked in, from a distance of approximately three meters away, they noticed the corpses of three people, so they immediately alerted the relevant authorities.
One of the people wore a yellow-colored sports T-shirt and dark cotton trousers and was not wearing shoes. Next to him, you also lay in a white-strike sports T-shirt.
A few yards away, the body was another person dressed in a red sports shirt and blue cotton trousers.
The three of them lay facing the ground.
According to the data obtained at the sites, all three people were probably murdered in a different place because the shells were not found.
On the fence of the cottage were found messages addressed to one group of organized crime of the other, as well as a series of bullet marks, both on the building and on the doors.
Cadereyt arrested 11 suspects
The secretary of the National Defense introduced 11 people, including juveniles who were members of the criminal group she operated mainly in the Cadereyta area and who are associated with kidnapping, murder, persecution and illicit burigging.
According to the information released during the first attempt on 11 November in the colony of Los Alveros, 8 people were detained and one detained person was freed.
Three properties and a mobile phone were secured. They confirmed that they were members of a criminal group called "Los Zetas."
The next raid was taken on 12 November at 6 a.m. Military personnel were on the footage in the Rancho Viejo area of Cadereyta when he spotted a car without a license plateau and two people in it.
After stopping the car, they inspected and discovered one rifle, a shell casing and 18 rounds of ammunition.
Then, on the basis of these statements, one of the accomplices in the La Frauda area was detained at about 14:00 on 13 November. When he saw the soldiers, he tried to run away.
They were charged with illegally burial in the municipalities of General Terán, China and Cadereyta.
A new Italian government to be appointed on Wednesday
Appointed Prime Minister Mario Monti will meet with the Italian president tomorrow to present him with a new government facing the crisis that holds the country over the aze of economic disaster.
Appointed Prime Minister Mario Monti will meet with the Italian president tomorrow to present him with a new government to face the crisis that holds the country's landrebill and which has put the eurozone in danger.
The presidential palace issued a report announcing that Monti, appointed on Sunday, would meet with President Giorgio Napolitano on Wednesday to confirm that he could form a government.
It is expected to present a government composed mostly of technocrats, though it is not yet clear when the new government will take power.
Monti said he would present to the president the results of his conversations he conducted with the political parties in an attempt to form a government.
"I want to confirm that I have absolute confidence in our country's ability to overcome this difficult phase," the former European Commissioner told reporters.
Monti did not explicitly say that he would be able to form a government, but the tone of his comments suggested that the obstacles were overcome.
"The door is now well marked," he added.
Monti has completed the process of forming a government in less than three days, at a much shorter time than usual. Meanwhile, Italy is trying to combat the political and financial crisis, which has brought debt levels to an unsustainable level.
The new administration, led by former European Commissioner, Monti must approve a harsh austerity package required by European leaders. Only in this way will it be possible to restore Italy's wrecked credibility.
There's a lot of pressure on Monti to hurry up. Due to the instability of the markets, the interest on the Italian BTP bonds with a 10-year maturity of the 7 percentage exceeded the level when Greece and Ireland had to apply for rescue.
Emma Marcegaglia, chairwoman of the Italian employers' organisation Confindustria, told reporters after the meeting with Mids: 'We said we would support this government very much'.
We believe that this government is a last resort to getting Italy out of this burning situation.
Monti's hopes for success were significantly appreciated thanks to support from PDL Silvio Berlusconi, whom the crisis forced to resign on Saturday.
"We believe that Professor Monti's efforts are destined for good results," Angelina Alfano, secretary of the center-right party, told reporters.
The support for the PDL, Italy's largest party, is significant because, until now, many of its members have opposed a technocratic majority-compensated government by Monti.
Support for the Parliament
The new Monti government must have the strong support of parliament to promote unpopular austerity reforms.
Any obstacle or delay in the effort could trigger a new and devastating attack on the financial markets.
The Italian Association of Foreign Banks has joined the pressure and warns that Monti's failure could be a disaster.
Monti opened negotiations with political parties, trade unions and business groups, youth and women's organisations on Monday.
The round of negotiations will close on Tuesday night.
Monti was appointed President Napolitano on Sunday, which allowed for a very rapid advance in response to the crisis.
After a brief drop at the end of last week, when it was already clear that Berlusconi would resign, Italian bond interest rates have returned to a critical threshold, responding to the uncertainty of whether the new Prime Minister will reap success.
Saving Italy, whose public debt is at €1.8 trillion, would be beyond the capabilities of the euro area's current financial reserves.
Monti said that his government should last in power until the next election, which is scheduled for 2013, despite general forecasts that say politicians would give him time to implement reforms and then call an early election.
Monti said that he would like to integrate politicians into his cabinet, but the major parties insist that this government must only be made up of experts to draw Italy out of the difficulties it has reached because of the financial pressure.
Political sources said that mutual distrust and disapproval between the parties were complicated by an attempt to integrate political figures into the government.
Spaniards take part in international matches more often than Costa Ricans
Of the 22 Spanish footballers, ten will be over the 50 international match-placed.
On the Costa Rica side, only one of the 22 players called up to the number of 50 matches.
A huge contrast on the Costa Rica side if we compare the 22 players from the two countries who gathered today for a 3:05 p.m. friendly at the National Stadium in San José.
While the world and European champions, FIFA's one monthly rating, have a wide range of intercourse Class A-class A-series, Costa Rica has only defender Michael Uman, who is the only one to play 50 international matches.
He reached that figure last Friday in a match against Panama (0-2) at Rommel Fernández Stadium.
The Spanish footballers, who play in the All-Star and the powerful English First League clubs, have maintained their intense activity at the league championships and domestic cups and high-level European Cup matches for over a year.
To the previous one we must also add the experience from the national Spanish team in the complicated knockout matches at the European and World Championships.
Costa Rican players, on the other hand, have very limited opportunities for foreign matches in the area. For example, there is Concacaf, which is considered to be the lowest level in FIFA.
We see that the biggest number of foreign appearances from the Spanish national team is to be played by goalkeeper Íker Casillas, who drew on former goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarret with 126 international matches last Saturday before England (a 0-1 loss to London).
Casillas will also take on Costa Rica today and earn a new record for Spain - 127 international matches.
Xavi Hernández, the key player for Barcelona, has 106 matches to his name.
Casillas and Xavi were even officially announced last week to UEFA, along with other Spanish players with a hundred matches to their credit. Among them the aforementioned Zubizarreta with 126 and midfielder Schalke, Raúl González, with 102.
Carles Puyol also came close to the 100 with 97 games.
Followed by Xabi Alonso with 91; Fernando Torres with 90; David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81; Andrés Iniesta with 62; Cesc Fábregas with 61; and David Silva with 53.
On the side of Costa Rica and close to Michael Uman, the left winger Júnior Díaz is moving with 48 games and goalkeeper Bryan Ruiz with 45.
There were only 5 tops the 30-game mark: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
The smallest number of matches.
With less than 30 matches in Spain, there are Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Álvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
On the national side with less than 30 games, it's Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest was not exceeded by 20.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba has two, in Costa Rica, Víctor Bolívar has only one and Ólman Vargas and Edder Nelson are still waiting for their first game.
Spain's top scorer is David Villa with 50 goals, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
On the Costa Rican side, Bryan Ruiz, nine, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
The quintet has included the country in its tour to celebrate 20 years of existence
"The trip to Costa Rica is a dream that is becoming a reality"
In an exclusive interview with Viva, bassist Jeff Ament of Pearl Jam said the band was ready to offer one of the best gigs at the National Stadium next Sunday.
We have waited more than 20 years, but the group itself assures that the opportunity for them to play in Costa Rica is a dream come true.
This is what bassist and founding member Jeff Ament, who spoke exclusively to Viva from Brazil last week, said.
The group is located on the South American continent as part of a tour to celebrate 20 years of existence and will be at a unique stop in Central America on Sunday 20.
He will perform this day at the National Stadium from 7:30 p.m. with the angel band The X and the national musicians of Las Robertas.
This is a sample from the interview, the full transcript of which can be found on the website La Nación on the internet.
It's a dream come true for your Costa Rican supporters. Pearl Jam will play in Costa Rica. Do you realise what your fans are experiencing?
The journey to Costa Rica is also our dream, which is becoming a reality.
In South and Central America, we've barely been the second time and the experience so far has been great.
I've only been to Costa Rica once, on holiday. It's a beautiful country, and I believe we'll be able to stay here for a few days.
So we're so happy to bring you our music.
I ask because they literally adore the group here, the fans are experiencing these days of preparation very intensely.
What do you say to your most ghastly supporters?
Thank you for standing by us for years.
It took us almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica. Thank you for waiting so long and we are sorry that it took us so long.
Some people already refer to the concert as the biggest show of the year.
Does it give you more pressure?
Some of the biggest shows we've put on in the last 21 years have been made in a matter of weeks.
We have performed some great shows in Sao Paulo and we hope to get into shape for a concert in Costa Rica.
In fact, we're really looking forward to the concert.
We love this country, we like to surf, we like to like the jungle. For both activities, Costa Rica is the best country in the world.
How did you get to know Costa Rica and its waves to surf?
We have a lot of friends of surplators, and I have a good friend who lives in Tamarindo. The waves here are incredible.
My friends go to surf Costa Rica or Nicaragua, or Mexico. These are the best surfing spots. And so we found out about Costa Rica, through people who love to surf.
If we look at your tour, you've set up a huge show with many songs.
What did you plan to present in Costa Rica?
Since we've never played here, we have no limitations on what we can't do.
We will try to put on the best show possible with a variety of tracks. We will try to play a few songs from each album and present our fans with a good and diverse repertoire.
You never repeat the repertoire.
What for?
I think in part it's because we have nine albums and we can play more than 120 songs and everyone likes different songs, so it's hard to choose which songs we'll play every night.
When we have two or three songs in our repertoire that we haven't played for a long time, we focus on them and we're also surprised because we remember why we liked them so much and that maybe we've already forgotten about it.
So the show is more interesting for us, which is why I think it is more interesting for people.
With this tour you celebrate 20 years of artistic career.
When you look back, is it hard to believe everything you've accomplished?
Yes, I'm sure.
First, I think that none of us could have imagined that we would be in one big rock band and that we would stay in it for more than 20 years. Sounds like a dream.
We realise how much we have been given and are touched by the fact that we can continue to play together.
We love each other and like to make music.
We are fortunate to be able to look at the places we have always wanted.
We couldn't have done better.
What did it mean to you that you were an important part of the origin of the grunge genre?
It has always been an honour for us to be a part of this group in which the great greats are represented.
The people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains are our friends.
It's surprising when a movement emerges from a group of friends, it doesn't happen very often.
A group emerges from time to time in the city, but it is far less common for five to ten groups to emerge from one city at once.
We are proud of this and we are honoured to be part of the Seattle group.
Sometimes we still play with some of them.
Last year we were at the Alice in Chains festival and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden on tour. We are fortunate that these are all our friends and we are honoured to be a part of this movement that was formed in Seattle.
It's also very unusual for a group like yours to keep together and still have the same members after all these years.
Yes, the four of us have been together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, which in itself is a much longer period of age than the usual duration of the group.
I think, first of all, we are all lucky to be still in this world and, secondly, the fact that we are constantly interested in each other plays a part of the role.
We are all close friends and, as a result, we have managed to open up musical paths that leave everyone with sufficient freedom to experiment themselves.
We trust each other, we value each other's music, and I don't think it could be better.
Your relationship to the word fame was not easy. However, thanks to your success, you can do what you like.
How do you find the balance?
The way we grew, it was gradually getting easier to find a balance.
We try not to go too much on tour because it's very easy to fall into this trap of the crowds and people who love our music.
When you realize that people came for the music, you remind yourself that you have to respect the music and what you have given it. You mustn't get carried away by being famous, rock stars. This was never really of interest to either of us.
How do you remember the next Mother Love Bone project?
I think we were writing great songs and at the beginning it was something spectacular.
We had been around as a band for three years and we never released an album until Andy (Andrew Woods) died.
It was very frustrating because it took so long. Most importantly, even today we are friends with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore) who started out in the band with us. When I listen to a song or look at the photos, I remember Andy being unbelievable, how much I laughed with him. It was always a pleasure to work with him, to laugh, to talk about music or football and much more.
She was an incredible person and we miss her so much.
The national band Las Robertas will be commissioned to launch a show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know their job, especially Eddie Vedder, and that's why you chose them as the opening actuators?
Yes, the production sent us videos with several designs and we liked this group the most. That's why we're wondering what Las Robertas will offer live and they need to be very entertaining.
Why do you always change the words Yellow Ledbetter live?
That's a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), so I don't know.
He sings it, and I think he adds the first thing he thinks of.
Who is influencing you as a bassist?
Lots of people.
First up, I'm first thought of Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramon, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There's so many, I could talk all night about the bassists I like.
How did Pearl Jam manage to keep grunge, even though it is no longer in vogue?
I think we've all always felt a little separate from the word grunge.
When you say grunge, I imagine the groups I mentioned as Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all the others that were created at the same time. And if music is still this valid today, it's something great because it's music worth listening to and the bands like Mudhoney are playing better music today than ever before.
At the beginning, your music had a slightly gloomy character and is now more positive.
What is behind this change?
That's interesting because I have a feeling that there are a few songs in the new album that are lighter, but there are also songs like The End or Juste Breathe, which are considered very gloomy, although they may come off as positive.
With both of them, when Ed played them for me, I cried, and they're songs deeply dark.
I think when you grow up and have some trauma in your life, you lose someone in your family or boyfriend, these things start to affect your arts and music, and these two songs represent this to me.
I also think you can be a happy person and still make gloomy music.
Peru:
Fujimori was hospitalized again for medical tests
Former President Alberto Fujimori was hospitalized on Tuesday at a public hospital to test him for the muscle loss he has suffered in the lower extremities, his attending physician reported.
Fujimori, who is serving a 25-year prison sentence for human rights abuses by his government (1990-02) suffers from several diseases, including tongue cancer, for which he has been operated on four times and is already under control by doctors.
MP Alejandro Aguinaga, who is his personal physician, told the TV station Canal N that Fujimori would undergo tests in three days at the National Institute of Occupational Images, where they should find out why he is in pain and why he is losing his strength in his lower extremities.
Aguinaga said that in his view, Fujimori might be pardoned on humanitarian grounds, but the former president himself does not want a pardon because he feels innocent.
He was operated on four times for tongue cancer, lost 18 kilograms, and these problems were added by other ailments such as severe erosive gastritis, aficionados, kidney stones, high blood pressure and circulatory problems in the legs, the doctor listed.
Fujimori has been serving his sentence since September 2007 at the National Headquarters of Special Police Operations.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the deaths of 25 people who were killed by a murdering squadron of troops operating illegally in the early years of his reign.
Mujica on a visit to Mexico to strengthen political ties
The official delegation, led by the Uruguayan president, José Mujica, accompanied by several ministers and businesses, will begin a visit to Mexico on Tuesday. It aims to achieve the expansion of trade between the two nations and to touch on the political issues of the region.
Mujica will meet with his Mexican counterpart, Felipe Calderón, on Wednesday. This is the most important meeting of a wide-ranging meeting of meetings with policy, trade and representatives of the Uruguyas community living in Mexico. The program was released by the Uruguayan Presidential Office.
The meeting of the two presidents in the city of Guadalajara will be used to exchange information on political matters between the two countries," the Uruguayan Presidential Office posted on its website.
According to local media outlets, Mujica will try to get Calderón to support Uruguay in a dispute with France when French President Nicolas Sarkozy placed the South American country on the list of tax havens at the G20 meeting in the French city of Cannes.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened to have countries that would continue to remain in the position of tax havens to be removed from the international community. This statement drew a negative opinion from Uruguay and a consultation with the ambassador to the European country.
Mexico has been chairing the G20 since November. The G20 is a group made up of the world's most powerful developing and developed countries. With the Latin American country, an agreement is to be concluded from January this year on the exchange of information intended to prevent double taxation.
In recent years, the Uruguayan government has sought to concretise the fiscal exchange agreements to come out of the "blacklist" of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), to which countries that have not established all the required international standards of cooperation in tax.
From a commercial point of view, Mexico and Uruguay have concluded a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) since 2004, which has made the exchange of goods between the two countries strengthened.
The bearded plumber runs in 3D thanks to "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario has been fighting relentlessly for more than 25 years to save Princess Peach from the clutches of the villain Bowser, but he has never appeared in 3D: in "Super Mario 3D Land" he will fight for the love of a girl with stereoscopic technology.
The title, which comes to all stores around the world this month, was made up of the start to take advantage of all the characteristics offered by the Nintendo 3DS portable console, which allows you to play three-dimensional games without having to use your glasses.
"Mario is a character who has to tell how stereoscopy without glasses should work," said a press official specialized in Nintendo, Spain, Omar Álvarez, during a video game presentation in Madrid.
Álvarez said that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "the first video game of Nintendo created specifically for this carrier" because, up to this point, successful images such as "Star Fox 64 33D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" were the adaptations of existing titles.
A Nintendo spokesman said that in addition to the image being 3D, "Super Mario 3D Land" is a "accessible" video game that allows you to enjoy a quick and smooth game.
Álvarez confirmed that the "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part is "simple" to attract less skilled users.
Once you have surpassed this level, you can embark on the "second round" at the game's levels, which are more challenging this time.
In addition, users can choose the real time between the "aggressive D" or one that affects only the depth of the action. But it will be necessary to play in 3D in order to overcome all sorts of challenges and "not to succumb to optical deceptions."
This new emergence of Super Maria in 3D is also expected to return the character to the portable console, which has not happened since 2005.
In this video game, Nintendo plays to the notes to those who watch the saga and repeat the successful formula from previous episodes. It is that the bearded man's plumber will have to go through dangerous minced platforms to free Princess Peach.
Although the player finds the news in the movements, in the surroundings, in disguises and also among the enemies, there will also be a "playful" Luigi.
Colom approves extradition of Portillo to the United States
President Álvaro Colom announced Tuesday that he has taken steps on the issue of the extradition of former President Alfonso Portillo, who is to answer for a $70 million conspiracy in the United States.
This is the end of the process to enable Guatemala to respond to the Northern Land's request to be extradited to the Puertoilise so that she could try him.
At a press conference, Colom confirmed that his decision was in line with the independence of the judiciary and the executive branch, and that he had in mind that the criminal court had already ordered extradition.
He assured that during his mandate he did not "attach" in court rulings and allowed all extraditions that had reached his desk.
In addition to Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroquín for murder and grievous bodily harm, and Edgar Estrada Morales and Víctor Estrada Paredes, both for drug trafficking, will be extradited.
Colom's move marks a move by the execution after all judicial and constitutional instances have been exhausted to lead the process against the former president, who ruled from 2000 to 2004.
In accordance with the decisions of the Fifth Criminal Tribunal and the Constitutional Court (CC), Portillo will be extradited after his legal situation in Guatemala has been resolved and human rights are guaranteed.
Portillo was found not guilty in the matter of embezzling 120 million at the Ministry of Defence during his presidency. This trial was preceded by the release, but the Public Ministry appealed, bringing the case back into play.
Trinijove helped 6,000 young people in emergency
The organization was created to help children without an education, not to be on the fringes of society.
The balance of the first 25 years of the Trinijove social support organisation is very important: the 6,000 young people at risk of social exclusion have been helped. For 25 years, the organization has been helping them to overcome difficult situations.
To this must be added the long hundred jobs that have been acquired for this social group.
Yesterday's anniversary also served to present a record as part of a ceremonial act that took place in the former manufacturing premises of both the Fabra i Coats factory, attended by more than 300 people.
The Trinijove organization was founded in the Trinitat Vella district in 1986 to help young people with low education, jobless, dealing with drug addiction or in a situation where they might fall into social exclusion.
Yesterday's meeting in Sant Andreu was attended by a large number of representatives of the organisations and institutions that have worked with the association over the past 25 years.
The diverse political representation, at the time of the elections, showed the uniform nature of the work carried out by Trinijove.
Together with the president of the Generalitat, Arturo Mas, and his predecessor, Jordi Pujol, the ceremony, attended the ceremony by former Socialist Education Advisor, Ernest Maragall, and former deputy mayors and current environmental-socialist councillor, Ricard Goma.
The Grand Hall of Fabra and Coats were also attended by the current Social Well-Assistance and Family Advisor, Josep Lluís Cleries, and the Social Works Director General at La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa.
Mas said that Trinijove originated in a very difficult time and that today also offers a number of obstacles, but added that the work the association has brought to this day "is a good foundation."
The president cited Trinijove as an example of how to combat adverse circumstances and how to encourage people in difficult situations.
"The crisis is nothing new to this organisation and the work he is doing," he said.
There was the eviction of a busy house hosting gigantic parties
The intruders appropriated 11 of the 13 apartments in the building in Balmes, 51
12 occupiers left the house yesterday at noon without resisting
All indications are that the nightmare experienced by the neighbours of Number 51 on Balmes Street is finally over.
Yesterday, at noon, 12 people voluntarily left the building they inhabited illegally and where they organized the gigantic parties that woke up the neighbours. They left the building by order of the court and without the police having to intervene.
At the end of the operation, the lock on the door was replaced to avoid a repeat of the situation.
"From now on, entry will be guarded," the caretaker said.
The occupiers, who took 11 of the 13 apartments in the building - the remaining ones are inhabited - took all the electric and partly water equipment, in addition to painting the walls and leaving the garbage after all kinds, especially the cans of alcoholic beverages.
The first three apartments held huge parties that lasted up to two days and woke up the other tenants.
Next to the building is a disco, the Balmes 51 which was also damaged.
Its owner, Maria Pantinat, explained to Europa Press that sales fell by 80% while the building was occupied.
The owner of the disco emphasizes that the occupiers of the building made unfair competition for her because they sold drinks for 3 euros, whereas the disco costs 10.
In addition, the owner of the entertainment establishment had to respond to the neighbors' lawsuits for the noise. But the problems were caused not by the disco's visitors, but by the residents of the busy house and especially those who attended the parties here, whose frequency and intensity had increased in recent weeks, according to the excitcered residents of the surrounding area.
The owner of the disco explained that the problems were so great that they even agreed with the owner of the building and have been forgiven her rent for nine months.
The municipal police also confirmed that they had received more complaints from neighbours about the situation in the past few weeks.
Last week, the chairman of the city's CB Group of the City Hall, Alberto Fernández Díaz, demanded that "the building be evicted immediately and put an end to the civil coexistence problems suffered by the neighbours and the destruction of the area."
The president of the Peoples explained that only one floor had been taken, but in recent months the occupiers had reached all the floors of the building and almost all the flats, and in one of them there were even thefts.
In this respect, he added that "it is necessary to put an end to impunity and to be consistent when it comes to acts against the civil liability that took place in the building."
Yesterday, the city's police department also cleared the building in Nou Barris.
At 3:30 a.m., police reached Building 35 on Mont-ral Street after being summoned by neighbours who saw four people entering the building.
All four were immediately detained.
Park or mountains?
The architects met on the occasion of the announcement of the procedure, which carries with it more than the controversy over the royalties
The city's 16-gate ballot box is once again opening up a debate about the role of the Collserola Park in Barcelona.
In the mid-1980s, at the height of the blossoming of the already defunct Corporación Metropolitana de Barcelona (CMB), the municipality printed out several pamphlets to support the Collserola Park.
The flyer defined the mountain as the large park of metropolitan Barcelona.
What's more, it was accompanied by a numerical comparison with New York's Central Park.
After CMB was dissolved in 1987, the park returned to the minds of many as the top of Barcelona. The Catalan capital is one of the few that do not orient to the north-facing south, but up (up) - down (sea).
Collserola's qualification as a natural park goes in this direction.
The reference was no longer Central Park, but Yellowstone with boars instead of the Yogi bear.
That was the position until September, when the town hall announced a mega competition consisting of 16 auditions for the same number of entry gates to Collserola.
Of course, the gate plays more into the idea of the park.
Either this or someone's trying to place the gate on the field.
So there is only one question: Collserola, a park or a mountain?
During the competition, both in terms of purely organisational and reflection on the city, this issue becomes the central theme of all Barcelona architects.
It is already a subject as wiped out as when the two members of this old cast of the chosen one shake hands at the rendezvous meeting in the elevator.
And it was this feat that triggered one of the rare coincidences between what three Barcelona architects and the coming university professors think.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: the selection process has merit.
According to Roldán, after the question of the Gulf side has been asked, "it is also necessary to" discuss the "Hountain Party" so that Ildeonons Cerdo's speech about the green apples was not brought to an end.
"We have to assume that the most extensive park in Barcelona is the beach.
Among other things, its great accessibility.
Collserola is more complex," said the architect, for whom the name "gate to Collserola" bears a "lexicological trap": we must not imagine them "as entrances to the park, but rather as a delimitation of the zones where it is possible to operate."
Modol, like Roldán and Bayona, with its experience in the world of urban planning, qualifies the proposal as an "intellectual challenge" offering "some dangers."
The danger resulting from the "uncertainty posed by the Public Place project today" after the experience of the 1980s, which had a "its swan singing" in the field of the Forum.
The first concern is the very demarcation of the boundaries where it should be built.
"Simming something is to take the next step," that is, in principle, to move one step further.
"It is important to remember the new urban and planning tools, because the current ones (referring to the General Metropolitan Plan (PGM)) can cause a real disaster."
If we focus more in detail on the question, Modol believes that the Collserollo valley slope can be "considered a park" but not the Barcelona section, for reasons of purely topographic.
Modol also recalled that there was already a work carried out by the Patronat de Collserola, which "should not end up in the dust-mounted dump," although he welcomes the fact that the town hall is offering his board to make an impact on the project from the "first moment."
Moreover, he understands that the proximity of the mountain and the city is a kind of pass that allows architects to engage in the debate, but "doubts," that it should be this very technical profile that will lead the multidisciplinary teams ("it's all about the skills" that needs to be created, which must be created: "Architeks should only be tools."
Bayona suggests that the answer to the question that gave the name of this game is complicated because Collserola's global vision is missing from the documentation for the competition: 'There have been 16 tenders that deal with all the axis of the mountain - the sea - but there is no longitudinal study to look at the area and to see it as a whole'.
This causes him, at least, to apply for all 16 competitions.
Otherwise, the one-gate project may run into the concept and definition of the architect of the neighbouring gateway.
In his view, the City Hall should guarantee that the zone immediately located above the Ronda de Dalt should secure the full length of the equipment zone, which would ensure a smooth transition between the city and the greenery.
Casino pardons Jonas Larrazabel, who will be released
After 72 days of imprisonment, the legal commissioner, Cadino Red, pardoned Mayor Monterrey's brother in a trial in which he was prosecuted for alleged blackmail.
Manuel Jonas Larrazab has spent 72 days in prison and will now be released after the legal commissioner Casino Red p p p p p p pardon the precinct in that district hearing an extortion case in which the mayor of Monterrey was indicted.
Following the Casino Royale bombing, Casino Red's owner, Sergio Gil García, released a series of photographs and videos in which Manuel Jonás was asked to pay for an economic quota to allow the Monterrey City Council to make it possible to operate an illegal betting home operation.
Following a public indictment, the State Prosecutor's Office launched a criminal prosecution against the brother of the pan-technical mayor. On September 2, he was detained and imprisoned for 30 days.
Then, after four hours in front of the Public Ministry's Agent, 3 for property offences, he was transferred to Prison 1, stationed in Barrio Antiguo in the capital of the state.
He remained at this post for the following 49 days after a second imprisonment was issued and a Public Ministry agent refuted the possibility of complicity or organised crime.
On 19. On October, he was taken to the Criminal Court in Cadereyt on suspicion of blackmailing the owners of the Casino Red's owners with one and a half million peso. However, he remained only in a moderate-second prison for a few hours because he was threatened with death.
Leaders allowed him to stay in the city's cells in the San Nicolás de los Garza during the trial.
25. On October, he was presented with an arrest warrant issued by the secretary of the Second Criminal Court, Jorge Yánez, who said that after almost two months of investigation, sufficient evidence had been gathered to prove Jonas's guilt. The evidence includes, for example, the payment of the £1.5m peso to the casino's representatives in exchange for the promise that the operation would be allowed.
This Monday, the legal commissioner, Casina Red, Víctor Aldo García Gómez, approached Judge José Luis Pecin and asked for a pardon for the brother of the region's mayor. On the basis of this, he will be able to return to freedom soon.
During the legal proceedings, the representative of the Public Ministry assigned to that court, Ramiro Arias, asked García Gómez whether the damage had been corrected and which of the associates had decided to pardon. But the lawyer made it clear that the name would remain classified.
On the basis of the official file 197/2011, the legal pardon is given to Jonás Larrazábal. In the process conducted against him, it will not be possible to file any complaint. It is also not possible to claim damages or punishment.
After a trial with the legal commissioner at about 15:50, the court ordered the immediate release of Larrazal Bretón.
The court secretary, Jorge Yanéz, appeared at a prison in the city of San Nicolás de los Garza to tell Jonás that he had been granted an official pardon and his case was dropped in the archives.
He also told him that the judge had issued an immediate ordinance for his release.
The secretary, Dionisio Pérez Jábě, presented details of the air accident that killed the secretary of the governor, Francisco Blake, and the other seven people.
The Communications and Transport Secretariat (SCT) reported that the results of the investigation into the accident that killed government secretary Francisco Blake Mora and seven other people show that the helicopter landed directly on the terrain with full force, without the pilot having a chance to attempt a forced landing.
At a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jácome, Secretary for Communications and Transport, said that before the plane took off, the pilot stated that the climatic conditions allowed the flight.
"The few appearing suggest that the unit came into contact with the terrain several times, the wings were entangled in the tree branches 25 metres from where the unit lost its hull."
He also reported that the unit was designed for 19 people, therefore it met all the requirements for transporting the staff.
In addition, he stated that no components were found on the ground based on the investigation carried out in the impact area.
"In the search, it was found that parts of the aircraft were not located at another point, so the plane hit the mainland as a whole.
"The helicopter was intended for 19 people, meeting all the requirements for the transport of people.
The terrain shows a slope with a gradient of seven to thirty degrees.
The secretary assured that the most important thing at the moment was to get the results as quickly as possible. However, the investigation may take several months or up to one year.
Gilberto López Meyer, the director general of airports and ancillary services, said that at the moment of impact, the Presidential General Staff helicopter was moving at cruise speed and the accident occurred on soft-uphe terrain.
"This information supports the hypothesis that it was a routine overflight operation at the time of the accident," he said.
At the press conference, SCT representative Pérez Jábě named the six basic points of the investigation:
Visual flight:
In accordance with aviation standards, the flight was implemented according to the rules of the visual flight, which means that the crew must see the terrain during the flight.
Meteorological conditions:
The AICM reports indicate adequate conditions at takeoff, in accordance with this the aircraft is moving towards the border, between the DF and the state of Mexico there were visible layers of clouds at low altitudes.
Selected routes:
It is probably that, because of the clouds, the crew was looking for a lower area and more visibility up to the Cuernavaca Valley.
Position of impact.
The colleges of the impact and the last recording of the helicopter from the radar coincide, it is likely that there was no loss of control or a disruption of the ferry.
Distraction of the aircraft's remains in a restricted area:
The information we currently have allows us to assume that the impact occurred on a straight trajectory and from the side.
The scattering of the plane's remnants indicates that the helicopter was complete at the time of the impact on the mainland.
There was no fire or explosion.
No evidence was recorded at the crash site to indicate that there was an explosion or fire.
The latest investigation results show that there may have been several contacts with the mainland.
During the field work, the remains of the aircraft were found at an altitude of up to 9200 feet above sea level, the terrain slopes, the pitch level ranges from seven to 30 degrees.
The photographs show footage in which there was probably a disintegration along the route.
The information provides elements that appear to suggest that the helicopter may have come into contact with the ground in several places.
A careful search around the accident, in a territory that is more extensive than the area of the set-ascurator, the remains of the helicopter were not found, reinforcing the assumption that the impact occurred in a state when the helicopter was still complete.
Mexico's health insurance institute launches research into the gene that causes obesity
The Institute of Health Insurance is conducting research to discover the gene responsible for obesity of children and adolescents. Research is carried out with the support of experts from the IPN
The Mexican Institute of Health Insurance (IMSS) has announced that it is conducting research to detect a gene causing obesity in children and young people. Research called "Obesity Genetics in Children and Teenagers" will make it possible to get results on overweight.
In a report by the head of the Biochemistry Research Medical Unit from the Specialized Hospital of the 21st Century National Health Center, Miguel Cruz López, explained that a multidisciplinary team of doctors, nurses, nutritionists and social workers had been set up.
This team relies on the support of specialists and pupils of postgraduate studies from the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) and the Centre for Research and Advanced Studies (Cinvestav) of the National Polytechnic Institute (IPN).
The research can also involve the general public, having or not authorized. People can come to the participating IMSS sports centres in Valle de México, where tests will be performed by the teens each reindeer from 8 a.m.
He stressed that the research began at the Cuauhtémoc Sports Centre (Mexican State) and from 8. October, this activity is also carried out at the Unlandalcóyolt Sports Centre (East of the Mexican State).
Once data from 500 to 600 children are obtained, the study will continue at the Independencia Sports Center (south of the Federal District) and finally at the Morelos Sports Centre (north of the Federal Center).
He explained that the aim of this research was to identify the components and importance of genetics in terms of obesity development and to trace to Mexican children and young people to risk factors and thus prevent the emergence of chronic degenerative diseases.
On the occasion of the International Diabetes Day, which is celebrated on 14 November, he recalled that the aim was to collect data from 3,000 children and young people between the age of six and 14, with the consent and under the supervision of parents, for the application of specific nutrition questionnaires.
The questionnaire will also ask about physical activity and a family history of hereditary diseases in order to avoid risk factors that could cause diseases such as diabetes or renal insufficiency.
He specified that every Saturday, all participants are being given anthropometric measurements (weight, height, waist circumference), pulp, blood pressure is measured, glucose, triglicerides, cholesterol, insulin are determined, and genes are studied (the genes involved in developing childhood obesity are sought to be identified).
Cruz López said this research reflected the concerns of health professionals over the alarming increase in child scales.
'Health polls conducted between 1999 and 2006 showed that in just six years, there was a 77% increase in obesity in boys alone and 47% for girls. There has also been a dramatic increase in the case of overweight," said the IMSS expert.
He said that one of the reasons for the search for indicators was the assumption that the country's population was different from that of other populations in its genetic history.
He reported that the average Mexican has 65% of Indian-American genetic makeup, 30% European and 5% African. This is reflected in the genes responsible for the formation of diabetes and the overweight.
He explained that, in general, the genetics of obesity are commonly explained as an inability to burn the excess energy we consume (calorie) and stored in the form of fats.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit of the participants is that they will receive an overall assessment of the condition of the children, thus determining whether they exhibit any known overweight or obesity.
He said that even the presence of dark-coloured wrinkles (acantosis) on the neck and forearm indicated the likelihood that the individual would suffer from metabolic problems and pre-curklar conditions.
The information is still confidential, with doctors handing it in writing to their parents and explaining to them all the measurements and lifestyle changes they have to make to avoid the disease.
Cruz López explained that there are three major ingredients that cause overweight, obesity and other chronic diseases: a sedentary lifestyle that means a lack of daily physical activity, sitting in front of the TV all day, and using means of transport instead of walking for short distances.
Overweight is also due to great caloric intake, i.e. greater consumption of sweetened beverages, carbohydrates (tamales, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) with high fat and protein content, and the genetic burden that is the subject of this research.
In Asphalt from UNAM there will be no potholes
Rafael Herrera, a scientist at the Chemical Faculty of UNAM, forms modified asphalts with polymers to create a mixture with better functionality, independently of climatic conditions and temperature
If the cobbles were properly cared for, there would be no need to repair nearly 200,000 potholes after each rainy season in the Metropolitan area of Valle de México, Rafael Herrera hijacker, a scientist at the Chemical Faculty (FQ) at the UNAM, who also added that if the design and maintenance of asphalt paving were adequate, there would be a significant reduction in potholes, or even be able to be removed altogether.
In his lecture, the Technology Cue of Colour, he delivered in the International Year of Chemistry, announced that the laboratory under his direction was developing modified polymer asphalt asphalt, creating a mixture with similar characteristics to the asphalt, but at the same time greater mechanical resistance, both at low and high temperatures.
Herrera Nájera believes that this type of modified asphalt could be used in places with extremely warm climates, such as in some cities in the north of the country. This would improve functionality and reduce the creation of potholes.
He explained that asphalt, the hardest part of the oil, is a cluster of hydrocarbon molecules, a molecular molecular mass called asphalten, and others with low molecular weights called mortars. Together, they give the asphalt a typical visco-elastic character.
The viscoleastic character of asphalt is that at high temperatures, around 180 degrees, it behaves like a liquid, at 120 degrees has a high viscosity and is almost in firm state at 50 degrees, while at low temperatures asphalt tends to break, he added.
This means that the resistance of asphalt in the streets is not uniform, but changes during the day according to weather conditions and temperatures, the chemical engineering expert pointed out.
A University of Chemics scientist observed that most of the streets in Ciudad de México are covered with flexible paving, which consists of six layers of materials, the last three of which are mixed with asphalt.
Among the top layers are the asphalt insert, made up of small stones topped in asphalt and then compressed.
He stressed that every stone that forms the liner is to be bathed in asphalt.
When cars pass or when you create pressure, it is so possible to disinheritate the forces in the pavement well.
If it was modified asphalt, they would break up even better, the chemical engineer believes.
He added that the asphalt insert was the last layer called the cloak, made up of fine rock, that is, the sand also encased in the asphalt.
As this layer will come into contact with the rims of the vehicles, it must have more mechanical strength than the asphalt insert and ensure the friction of the road.
As part of the cobbles, it will be subjected to a heavy load, the casing must be of sufficient thickness and care must be taken to the material from which it is made.
Climate, especially humidity and temperature changes, are also a very important factor to be kept in mind. Water in particular has a major impact on the functionality of the asphalt insert.
Once the terrain is damp, the water travels inwards and it is difficult to get out, this causes all layers of pavement to be softened and thus the formation of potholes.
He explained that the film of the cladding was the first to be damaged during the potholes, and only then did the asphalt insert be damaged. However, the damage does not occur at one point, but it is a gradual process that should be stopped at the first signs using the appropriate maintenance programmes.
As a member of the National Researchers' System, he also explained that the load on vehicles is another important factor in creating potholes, and therefore the thickness of each individual layer of paving must correspond to the load of vehicles and must ensure that this burden is not exceeded. Only in this way can we prevent the frequent emergence of potholes.
Rafael Herrera pointed out that there is still a lot of work to do when it comes to asphalt, and the research is at the beginning. For example, asphalt emulsions, which are already available on the market in other countries and make it easy to repair potholes without having to use high temperatures, are worth mentioning.
What was missing from the Valle candidate to become the new Miss Colombia?
Analyses of factors that contributed to the fact that Melina Ramírez Serna did not receive the crown of Miss Colombia.
Valle wins the 14th title of the first multi-Nearchiss.
The Valle del Cauca again failed to reach the Miss Colombia crown.
Melina Ramírez Serna had to be content to find herself on the podium of the winner, winning the silver crown and the sash, on the basis of which she became the new first multi-Pripe.
Based on the results of yesterday's final in Cartagena, in which she won and took the sceptre Miss Atlántico, the department received the 14th title of the first multi-Near. Melina thus joined the crowds of women from the Valle del Cauca, who came within reach of the winning crown, but were eventually named by the first multipack. These include Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Mónica Evers (1989), María Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero3), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008).
A question that many ask. What was missing?
The result is the defeat of the big favorite, who in all previous rounds showed that she has the gitias to become the new Miss Colombia, and she has not for nothing become the Queen of the Police and the Most Beautiful Facute of Joile de Volgue. These titles were achieved by Taliana Vargas and Natalia Navarro, who subsequently took home the title of Miss Colombia.
One of the key factors that decided that the jury decided to name only the First Multiss is that it did not convince with its answer to the question: "Which book did you like best and why?", which was written by Martín Murillo Gómez from the Literary Editor's Leamos.
Asked by the candidate, she replied:
"I do a lot. I believe in the role of literature, I think it is one form of cultivation. The book that most affected me in my childhood was "Little Prince," a very deep book.
I am currently reading "Crime and Punishment." It is a book that is part of the world's literature that we should all know. And today I have a book with me by Irene Nemirovski, a Russian author. It is a beautiful book called "El ardor de la sangre".
This answer did not sit with both because of the term "culturalisation" and, secondly, because the candidate did not explain what the various books mentioned had been to her.
After the ceremony was over, Melina said she was at peace and pleased with the result: "The world is wise, what is to happen, it will happen.
And you people read, if you can. The Little Prince is a beautiful book."
One of the other hypotheses is that Valle has destroyed the position of the favourite.
The Bogota journalist suggested that the candidate had been the most popular, most celebrated from the start, and the one who had won all the previous awards (Oster's Gastronomic Challenge, the Public title for Best Artistic Dress and the Queen Mother), aroused the envy of other contenders, stressed out the Queen, who then failed on the scene.
This was evident during the first presentation of the swimsuit at the Hilton beach and during the two shows before the final coronation.
Although she was glowing with both of them, it was evident that she lacked the strength and fervor shown by the representatives from Magdalena and Atlántico.
Ariel Osorio, a journalist for the "Latom" program at the Canal RCN, believes that Melinda won the title of first multipiss is confirmed by the fact that the candidate who will win the most titles in the end does not go with the Queen's crown during the competition."
Moreover, Valle has held a rather unkind attitude towards the media in recent days, and that has not paid off.
Another hypothesis is that Valle failed to convince the jury of its interest in social work, which is the basis of the National Beauty Competition.
Just in the margin, two days before the election, international jurywoman Lucy Doughty said they were looking for a woman who would be aware of her country's social needs.
"In the Miss Colombia competition, beauty alone is not enough, you need to see even more than just physical beauty. We need to focus on social feeling. It is important that the candidates are involved in such projects before they enter the competition," she explained.
There is also speculation that the candidate, Valle, has lost points due to shortcomings of her background and fibrosis that was evident in the bottom. But this is completely at odds with the jury's verdict, which chose miss "natural beauty" for the healthiest body, the right nutrition and responsible physical activity.
Jorge Hernán Orozco, who prepares the queens, acknowledges that Melina did not have the best body, that there were better girls, "but the problems with fibrosis on the bottom, which I don't think were very noticeable, took away her points until the last day."
Meanwhile, journalist Guido Hoyos of Cromos believes the native of Valle made the mistake of undergoing several surgical procedures.
'The surgical hits are fine, but they didn't work out in Valle.
The body was never her forte, and here she took her toll'.
Because of this award, which was first awarded by the National Beauty Assembly, after the swimsuit show, there was a cruel prediction that came to fruition. It was claimed that this was the satisfaction Raymundo had given Melina so that he would not have to award the crown to her at the end.
Whether it's true or not, what is certain is that this day Melina has started her year of reign, not as a queen, but as a princess, from a position that gives her the opportunity to represent Colombia at various international competitions where she will be named the National Competition itself.
However, he will go down in history as one of the queens who, despite the riveting success in Cartagena, have not made it to the highest crown.
Such was the work of the Cali resident who identified the corpse of Alfons Cano
The Cali fingerprinting expert went down in history as a man who confirmed the death of "Alfonsa Cana."
The work of these officials is crucial.
On November 4 of last year, the CTI fingerprint expert in Cali made history as a man who confirmed the identity of the Supreme Leader Farc: "Alfonles Cana," by comparing fingerprints.
Of the seven fingerprint experts working in the CTI department, this week was the turn of Eliazar González, a man from Puerto Tejad who has worked in forensic research for 21 years.
Early in his career, González worked at the town hall in Chocó, where he often had to make his way through the forest for more than five days to get to the place where the corpses had to be identified.
He moved to the capital, Valle, in 2000, and after taking the courses in question, began specializing in fingerprints. This science deals with the study of friction of the skin, i.e. the hands and feet of the hands and feet.
In the week of the operation being carried out against the aforementioned Alfonsian, Eliazar was told to take his clothes with him for at least three days.
Something big was expected.
On Friday night he set off for Cauc in a helicopter from Palmiro.
He knew he would have to identify two corpses, and that he was suspected of being the man who ran the world's oldest guerral. That's why they asked him to take a fingerprint card with Guillermo León Sáenzo (his real name).
However, when he arrived with the investigating team at the scene where the corpse was located, he did not recognize him because of his physical appearance. He looked quite different from the media.
He had no beard, he was dressed as a villager in the area, no glasses, much slimmer.
But the prints don't lie.
Along with the galton magnifying glass, ink and the transponder and the light, Eliazar began comparing the dactyl recordings of the corpse with the card's entries.
The eye did not disappoint him: it was "Alfonso Cano."
The same night, a man originally from Puerto Tejad was tasked with confirming to Defence Minister Juan Carlos Pinzón whether he was indeed the High Commander Farc.
Searching for the tracks
For the dactyloscophocope from Sijín de Cali, the recognition that President Juan Manuel Santos has shown to Eliazar González at a press conference of the operative service against "Can" is very significant.
A lot of people don't know our jobs.
Dactyloscopy is an exact science, without the possibility of error, which can play a key role in the decision-making of crimes.
In addition to identifying corpses, these people help in researching crimes such as theft or murder and corrupt the identity of the people caught.
When they are caught, a lot of offenders present fake documents or do not have papers at all.
We take their fingerprints and look for them in the database.
The investigator told the investigator that in the event of an injury, he had to remove a piece of the house's wall, because at this point the thief was leaning to pull out a safe full of jewelry and money.
The walls are difficult because they are not intended to collect prints, but in this case we could get the imprint of the whole hand and identify the perpetrator involved in several thefts," he reminded.
Fingerprints can also confirm or disprove suspicions in the case of murder.
Not long ago, they found a dead man with bottles of alcohol around him.
Based on the investigation, it was discovered that one of the family members could be responsible for the murder and the bottle print actually confirmed it.
Although it is not 100% to be confirmed that he was indeed a killer, it is obvious that he appeared on the scene of the crime.
The CTI fingerprints expert explained that the items are "shaped with chemical or physical reactive substances."
When they appear, a transplant or tape is used for their collection.
The prints are then sent to Asif, which is a database of offenders, or to the Registration.
"The problem is that there are still many Colombians who are not recorded anywhere," the CTI expert said.
He explained that not everything is as shown in the CSI television programme.
Like everything that glitters, there's no gold, not everything you touch, there are clues.
However, if it can be used, the appropriate comparison must be made.
"Intercract" protests in New York
Hundreds of manifestants crowded into Zuccotti Square, where they wanted to camp.
A large part of them waited for the order to clear the area and moved to a nearby park.
Members of the Uousing Wall Street movement provoked New York officials on Tuesday as they tried to re-run in Manhattan Square, from where they were escorted out in the morning. They then tried to take another New York park.
Hundreds of manifestants crowded into Zuccotti Square, where they wanted to get through a court order that allows "effraffic" to return to the site of the city. The second part of the movement responded to the eviction by taking over a park in the north of the city, where further detentions took place.
"If the court does not allow us to return to the square, we will settle in a different place and continue the legal battle in order to return to Zuccottti, both through rallies and peaceful rallies," said one of the spokesmen of the "Cardiants of Wall Street" movement, Mark Bray.
Bray clarified that the "extraged" response to the evictment of the camp, ordered by the mayor of New York, Michael Bloomberg, had reached the court, where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order prohibiting the forcible evicting the site and allowing the manifestoers to continue to be set up there.
In addition, the "extraction" took over another park located at the intersection of Central Canal Street and 6 Avenue, near the entrance to the Holland tunnel that connects New York and New Jersey, and the rectory grounds at Trinity Church.
They managed to take up the place for at least an hour, but then the police came in and detained some of the manifestants. Bray did not know the exact number, but said he saw that handcuffs had been placed on some of the journalists.
The organization assures that several hundred people have taken up residence on the spot. A delegation of religious leaders also came to express their support and also try to negotiate with the police.
Meanwhile, Zuccotti Square, which is private property, remains closed. A court hearing is expected to take place on Tuesday, during which the legality of the morning evacuation should be analysed.
Some of the displaced manifestants even distributed and handed out copies of the court order and even gave them to members who guarded the square, sparking "some small clashes," Bray said, condemning the fact that some officers were beating the manifesto.
The court order prohibits authorities from evicting members of the "Ocupa Wall Street" movement or using " laws that were published after the claim began, or to prohibit the manifestos from the park with shops or other places they used to use."
Mayor Bloomberg told the press that due to this court order, the city had suspended the opening of public space again and warned the manifestants that local laws did not allow them to return to their tents and sleeping bags.
The city's top official personally defended the morning eviction of Zuccotti Square, an operation in which 200 people were detained and who were approached because the manifestos were "violated by the law."
Bloomberg explained that he had ordered the evacuation of the square because it was becoming "a place that people did not attend to protest, but to break the law and in some cases to hurt others," because "some shops received threatening letters" and "neighbors feared for the quality of their lives."
"The dramatic eviction was appalling and shows that Bloomberg is trying to maintain financial interests at the expense of the American working people," added a spokesman for the movement, accusing the mayor of "not weighing the freedom of expression."
Representatives of the "Ocupa Wall Street" movement also said they planned to organize "great events" for Thursday in cooperation with community and trade unions to commemorate the two months after which the protests last. They began on September 17.
Pamela Anderson will present the Virgin Mary in a special Christmas TV show
Together with Michael Bublé and other major Canadians, she will appear in the television programme "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" on 1 December
Canadian Pamela Anderson was Tim Allen's assistant at "Home Improvement," a lifeguard at "Baywatch," bunny in "Playboy," wife of rock-at-year musician Tommy Lee, and now the actress and model will be Virgin Mary on a special Christmas show for Canadian television.
CTV's private television station announced today that Anderson, along with the singer of sentimental songs, Michael Bublé and other major Canadians, will appear on the TV program "It's and Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1, and will embody the Virgin Mary.
CTV today showed footage of a television program in which Anderson, also known from online domestic pornographic images, will appear with her ex-husband, the "Mötley Crüe" engine, Tommy Leo, as the Virgin holding a doll presenting Santa Claus in the manger.
As Josef, Peters, a well-known Canadian comedian of Indian descent, appears on the scene, having recently served as a presenter on the "My Violent Torpedo of Truth" tour, Charlie Sheena.
In a special CTV Christmas broadcast, Canadian singer Bublé, who married in Buenos Aires at the end of March with Argentine model Luisana Lopilato, will appear on CTV's special Christmas broadcast, and who is close to controversy.
Recently, Bublé called the American Kim Kardashian "family" at one of her concerts in New York.
Japan returns to life after devastating earthquake
GDP grows by 1.5% thanks to household consumption, ending the fall period that began in March
Since March last year, Japan's economy has been paralysed, now recovering from a devastating earthquake that has grown into a nuclear crisis, the worst disaster the country has faced since World War II.
The first estimates of the Tokyo government put material losses at $300,000 million, a blow that heals well despite the difficult global situation.
After three quarters of falls, the value of GDP between July and September came to such a position that it was possible to turn the page around with a definitive validity: GDP grew by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and by 6% a year.
In addition, the results of the second quarter - for the Japanese, the tax year starts in March 2012 - predict the highest growth rate compared to the January-March 2010 period.
The recovery can be partly explained by the purchase of the machines that are necessary to rebuild the earthquake-damaged areas and the subsequent tsunamis.
Businesses have increased their investment by 1.1%, spending will fall by 0.9% from the January-March period. This is the first decline after six months of uninterrupted growth.
Nevertheless, the real awakening of the Japanese economy is based solely on the impetus that forces the crisis to emerge from it to strengthen or to rebuild infrastructures. It's about using the scarcity to start from scratch.
Japan woke up. In particular, thanks to the development of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of Japan's GDP.
This variable increased by 1%, thanks to an increase in expenditure on vehicles, travel and leisure activities.
Stigma yen
The flows were put in the hands of the internal market when yen - the Japanese currency - became one of the "rescue values" for investors fleeing the eurozone's debt crisis and the worrying US forecasts. It is a privilege, but it is also a heavy burden on export companies.
With a stronger currency, products are more expensive abroad, which is negative for a country whose economy is determined by the financial health of the major technology groups.
Toyota or Sony, for example, attributed their weak results in July to the yen course in September.
While markets continue to be besieged by the EU's peripheral countries, Yoshihiko Noda's government is cautious.
"We must look out for the risks that persist, such as the destruction of some foreign economies, the impact of floods in Thailand and the rapid increase in yen," said State Secretary for Economic Policy Motohisa Furukawa yesterday.
Indeed, the perspectives are not encouraging.
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) clarified that most member countries showed clear signs of an economic slowdown in September.
The indicator, which anticipates inflexibility in the world economy, has shown that the economy of the major powers is slowing.
It dropped four-tenths to 100.4 points, compared to 100.8 in August.
The euro area has even been below the average at 100. It reached the level of 99.3.13 points.
Athens spreads uncertainty again
Papadimos says austerity will be approved, but the Conservatives will not sign a written commitment
With the rapid and risky marginal guarantees and the uncertainty that has reigned again, Greece is increasingly getting involved in the labyrinth that leads to the exit from the major debt crisis in Europe.
The assumption that the "comfort" of the new transitional Greek government is due to the demands of Brussels rather than by the real conviction of political forces is being confirmed.
While the new prime minister, Lukas Papadimos, admitted yesterday that there is no alternative for structural reforms and that the 100-day period he received when he appointed is likely to be short for their application, the leader of the conservative New Democracy party, Antonis Samaras, said he would not support the new austerity measures in any case and reiterated his demand for new elections for the expected date of 19. February.
"The main task of this government is to apply the decision of the summit of 26. October," Papadimos said yesterday during a parliamentary debate that will culminate in a vote of confidence in the government tomorrow.
The package with 24 programmes to support employment, the reform of the disciplinary code of officials and the new measures against tax evasion will be among the first initiatives.
However, Samaras's message does not clear the doubts about his position: 'We were committed to helping the transitional government, but we did not commit to anything else'.
The Conservative leader went a little far in his speech to the EU and the IMF. These organisations are to unblock the 8 billion that Athens urgently needs. But he also said he would not support and sign any commitment to the austerity measures.
Yesterday, the European Commission, already enraged by the impact of the referendum, the European Commission stressed to the referendum that its demands were insurmountable: it would not unblock any assistance if the new government and the leaders of the parties did not sign a "script commitment to ambiguity and as soon as possible."
A spokesman for Economic Affairs, Amadeu Altafaj, explained that the inspectors from the Troika would return "very soon" to Athens and discuss with the new government "what it needs to pay for the sixth part of the 8 billion. But there is no definitive date.
The Greek spillway has a moment to knit.
Queen Sofia: "There are tools for progress and hope"
The Queen highlights Spain's privileged position in relation to this kind of funding
Spain has "reached a significant position at global level in terms of microfinance."
Queen Sofia yesterday recalled that the country has become the planet's second donor in the last two decades in terms of this instrument of cooperation, the essence of which is "that this is an instrument of social progress, justice and a hope for a better future for all of humanity. It's a tool based on trust in man."
Yesterday, the Queen launched the 5th Global Microwal Movements Summit in Valladolid with the belief that there is no doubt" that this type of operation is "consciously necessary" to reach the Millennium Summaries set by the UN by 2015. "In particular, it is about achieving the objectives to achieve a reduction of half the number of people who live with less than one dollar per day, the amount that sets the poverty thresholds."
Spain will "multiary to continue to work" and expand a network of volunteers "in all corners of the planet and takes this task responsibly," stressed Queen Sofia, who hopes that the Summin's initiative and contribution, which will last until Thursday, "to ensure the creation of better capacities and opportunities for the poorest and especially for women" to whom these loans are primarily intended.
"We have already accomplished much" and "many challenges are still ahead of us."
The Micro-Lent Summit is intended not only to be a discussion forum, but also a platform to support "basic objectives."
Her Majesty explained that the aim was for 175 million families to have access to these financial services by the end of 2015 and for 100 million families to get above the poverty threshold they currently live under.
The concept of micro-loans to Spain and other nations of the world spread after "as the pioneer of the idea, Muhammad Yunus, embarked on this journey," the Queen said, adding that this was "an act of justice and the necessary recognition."
She described the father of this instrument as "an admirable idealist who embarked on the path of fighting poverty." She met his work 15 years ago when she went to Bangladesh to meet his lending policy on the spot.
This experience was followed by others. The first global summit in Washington and other meetings such as Côte d'Ivoire in 1999, Canada in 2006. "In all these meetings, I was able to establish a constant development, explained the Queen, who, thanks to her support for this project, earned the title of "head of the family" yesterday, awarded to her in Valladolid by the "movement of the poor."
The Queen Sofia concluded her performance by urging the participants to engage in discussions and the search for solutions, thus allowing the fight against poverty to continue.
"Ethical imperative"
Minister of Foreign Affairs, Trinidad Jiménez, said solidarity "is an ethical imperative" that must be governed by all democratic states.
In this sense, she said it would be a mistake to link cooperation with developing countries only with the balobytes, because this cooperation is a "permanent duty."
Jiménez believes that micro-loans represent a "serious and honest policy to eliminate poverty," and now, more than ever, the governments of developed countries must work in accordance with the solidarity criteria and not allow solidarity to be the victims of cuts.
For Spain, micro-loan is one of the main lines of development cooperation.
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, has welcomed the success of the concept based on giving the trust to the people who are all stranded by the door. Mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, welcomed the participants to the city, who "open their gates with a spirit of solidarity that is contagious."
CDU proposes to vote for European president on the basis of universal suffrage
Without serious trouble for the chancellor and Christian Democratic Party leader Angela Merkel, the first day of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) congress took place in Leipzig on Monday, November 14.
The question of Europe's future was not originally on the agenda, but it did not happen until the autumn, in particular to be satisfied with party members who view the government's policy today against the Greeks and perhaps as lax to Italians tomorrow.
The proposal for the president of the European Commission, led by the leadership, was adopted almost unanimously.
Only nine of the 1001 delegates were against and 10 abstentions.
A few minutes of standing up at the end of a performance by Angela Merkel and then a few hours later by Wolfgang Schäubl, a very pro-European finance minister, left no room for doubt.
The chancellor's main idea and the proposal can be summarised in the slogan: the response to the crisis is "not less Europe, but more Europe."
Not only because Europe means peace, but because "nine million jobs depend directly on the euro."
According to the chancellor, in Europe, "the time has come to change."
This could be expressed in the amendments to the Lisbon Treaty by the European Union making it possible to strengthen the European Union's budgetary policies for the euro area members, but could also result in the election of the President of the European Commission on the basis of universal suffrage by the aim of giving Europe one face."
Such, in any case, is one of the ideas of the draft adopted by the congress, the inspiration of which is clearly Wolfgang Schäuble.
It is certainly unlikely that all twenty-seven countries will quickly agree on this revolutionary step: the UK is opposed, and the CDU leaders think that Nicolas Sarkozy will also take the same position.
But the direction is being set.
Similarly, the delegates rejected by a large majority the proposal to evaluate the weight of each country on the board of directors of the European Central Bank, depending on the weight of its economy, which will evidently result in Germany's weight gain.
Led by the concern to calm the climate within her party, the chancellor made several references to Conrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl. But it did not seek congress to talk about "small" European states or states in trouble, willing to criticize the arrogant Germany.
Though the proposal for Europe is devoted to one paragraph of the importance of the "French-German friendship," Angela Merkel did not quote France.
Only indirectly.
When she recalled that just two hundred years ago there was a bloody battle at Leipzig.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleonic army.
What is the fraud of incapacity for work?
After the aids, the UMP and the government are launching an offensive against work-incompetitation.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be in Bordeaux on Tuesday 15 December and will visit the Social Supporting Authority, where he will give a speech on a speech on the subject of a recurring 2007 on the fight against social fraud and the redistribution of solidarity.
As an entourage of this offensive, which is based on the will to make savings in the context of increased severity but is no less clear from the perspective of the right-wing presidential campaign, the right-wing majority wants to focus on disability.
First, because of budget savings, the government intends to impose on private sector employees the fourth day of disability before taking sick leave support.
Clearly, without the approval of the business, an employee who gets sick would lose four days' wages, or at least 15% of his monthly income.
A measure that risks causing much bad blood, but which, according to Les Echos, could bring in €280 million.
Also, a measure that would be accompanied by another symbolic reach measure: to give civil servants one day of unpaid sick leave (until yet they have no incapacity to default compared to three days in the private sector).
While these questions are under discussion, the right-wing majority also launch a scamme targeting this time of mischief tied to work incompetence.
"The inspections will be much more extensive, and furthermore: if you are caught, you will return," Xavier Bertrand pointed out during an interview given to RTL on Sunday, November 13.
As in other cases, the effects of the notification appear somewhat disproportionate to the truth of iniquities in sick days.
These have in fact been subject to constant surveillance since 2002 and of the political onslaught that bore fruit.
The French are not more ill than elsewhere in Europe.
Let's stop first at a few official numbers.
According to the Caisse nationale d'assurance maladie (CNAM - the state health insurance company), more than 237 million euro euros of daily compensation was paid out in 2006.
According to the French Institute for Research and Documentation in Health, in 2008, daily compensation, with its 11.3 billion euros, was 5% of health-care spending.
Of this amount, 46% related to maternity and occupational accidents and 54% were related to incapacity for work, i.e. 6.2 billion euros.
That is, only 2.5% of the cost of health care.
According to a study by the Alma Consulting group, the French had an average of 14.5 days of incapacity for work in 2010, compared to 17.8 days in 2009.
Average that holds some variations: another poll published in the r. 2007 on the website dealing with the opportunities for work, Monster.com showed that 75% of the 40,000 French employees surveyed said they had not chosen any sick leave day.
Another study, this time carried out by the institutions of sickness insurance, specifies that in r. 2010 37.8% of the incapacity for work was shorter than 8 days, 22% from 8 to 14 days, 15% from 15 days to 1 month, 15% from 1 to three months, and 11% lasted longer.
When we compare them with their European neighbours, French employees are no more prone to work-incapacity other than elsewhere.
One long study conducted in 2010 by two CNRS researchers (The National Research Centre) showed that between 1994 and 2001, the overall absence (for health reasons or not) oscillated in France between 10% and 11.8% against 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the UK and 18% in the Netherlands.
Cheating on work incapacitations represents only a small part of it compared to black-market work.
As far as fraud is concerned, these are only small in scale.
Strengthening legislation from r. 2002 has caused systematic checks to exist on incapacity for work for work of more than 45 days.
In 2008, CNAM noted that with 1.5 million inspections, 13.8% of the 285,000 were carried out due to the short-term inability of "unauthorized or too long," i.e. 37 050 cases.
In the case of systematically controlled incompetencies of more than 45 days, 11% of "inadaptable or unauthorised" cases were counted at 1.2 million inspections, i.e. 132 000.
A total of 169,000 "unjustly" cases per several million employees who were incapacitated.
A number that represents far less than a number expressing work on the black.
According to UMP MP Dominique Tiano, the author of the June report on the issue, this figure would be 9 to 15 billion euros missing for tax collection per year, i.e. more than the total amount of daily daily compensation and thus infinitely more than the fraud associated with the latter.
Papademos: Greece will have to apply new rescue plan
Greece will need a new bailout program to re-establish its economy.
On Monday, December 14, Prime Minister Lucas Papademos made the words to the parliament, adding that the hundred days given to his unity government would not be enough to fulfill the task.
"To get back on our economy, we need the support of our European partners and a new bailout plan," the head of the government said as he made his first public address on Wednesday at the opening of the debate on the confidence vote in parliament.
Application of decisions taken 27. October at the eurozone summit will be the "main challenge" of the new government, as our country's participation in the eurozone is in play, he added.
As a result, Mr. Papademos had assumed that the country's public deficit would be "quarter in the neighborhood of 9%" of gross domestic product from now until the end of the year, after it was 10.6% in the first place. 2010 and 15.7% in r. 2009.
The Right Rejects New Average Achieved Achieved
On Monday, the leader of the right, Antonis Samaras, voiced his support for an already-approved measure to try to escape the debt crisis, but cautioned that his party is not taking any additional austerity measures.
"We will not raise our hand for any new measures," Samaras stressed at a meeting with his New Democracy MPs.
We have agreed to the targets for reducing the deficit and debt and combating waste, but we are against any policy that would hinder economic recovery.
Mr Olli Rehn, the European Commissioner for the Economy and the Curd, who warned that the IMF and the EU would not unblock the necessary €8 billion loan without a written guarantee from all the parties to support the envisaged measures, Antonis Samaras replied that his word was enough and that he would not sign anything under the external pressure.
Euthanasia and assisted suicide must be legalised, says expert commission
According to a report by the Royal Canadian Society, the Canadians are being denied death.
In the matter of the Palliative Care, the Commission urgently requires governments, health care institutions and doctors to work together to provide the best foliative care, even in cancer cases.
Canadian society lives with the idea of denying death.
Only 9% of Canadians do accept the ability to talk to the doctor about the conditions in which they want to die and take a decision to that effect.
This is one of the conclusions of the Royal Canadian Society's extensive report, which involved six experts working in different fields, including ethics, law and medicine.
This commission recommends that the Government change the criminal right to allow assisted suicide and euthanasia if this choice appears to be necessary for the patient considered competent to take such a decision.
At the outset, experts cite a recent poll by the independent Economist Intelligence Unit, which compared the quality of death in the 40 countries of the planet.
Though Canada ranked 10th, the study notes that the "medicalalization of death in Canada has given rise to a culture in which people are afraid to talk about death."
Medicalisation yes or no, 77% of Canadians do not have access to petition care, experts with the mandate of the Royal Canadian Society tell us.
And despite the wish to die at home, which most Canadians have, 68.6% of them die in the hospital.
This average is true for the whole of Canada, while in the province of Quebec this is the highest figure with 86% of those who died in hospital.
As for the delicate issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the report's authors come to conclusions that go against the position of the federal government, which has already said that he does not want to change anything about criminal justice regarding euthanasia and assisted suicide.
According to the experts, who have also checked all countries where these approaches are legalised or not considered a criminal case, there is no evidence that this criminalisation is caused by any misuse in the application, i.e. in the practice of euthanasia or assisted suicide, to persons not competent or disagreeing.
On the contrary, p. Yesterday, Jocelyn Downie, the report's co-author, confirmed more than numerous cases of these missteps in teleconference in countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are not legalised.
"Euthanasia is also being carried out in Canada, where it is clearly illegal."
"Assisted suicide is also carried out in Canada, where it is clearly illegal," explains Jocelyn Downie.
Canadians are in favor of euthanasia
Recall that, according to an investigation conducted by the Angus Reid Forum in 2010, 85% of Canadians have already spoken in favour of euthanasia because they believe it will allow those at the end of their lives to ease their suffering.
And 66% believe that legalizing euthanasia will not mean that we are sending out a message about the fact that the life of old or handicapped people is worth less.
As for those who practice assisted suicide, 41% of those surveyed think they should not be prosecuted.
The situation is less clear in maintaining or interrupting patient care, say the authors of the report.
They also propose in the list of their recommendations that it should be stated in criminal law that the withdrawal from the treatment for which there is a legally confirmed refusal is not criminal.
The expert's commission also requires that specialist doctors be trained to be required to respect the refusal of treatment at the end of their lives without fearing prosecution.
In the matter of the Palliative Care, the Commission urgently requires governments, health care institutions and doctors to work together to provide the best monetavative care, even in cancer cases.
Finally, in the case of a paliant or final abortion already widely used in Canadian health facilities, the commission requires that it be considered euthanasia when it is no longer used to reduce physical pain and to be subject to the same procedures.
Reservations of other experts
Some medical law experts have already voiced their reservations about the findings of the Royal Canadian Society's experts' report.
Mr. Pierre Deschamps, a specialist in medical law, qualified the position of expert-signator report as "extreme" among other things because it does not restrict the practice of euthanasia to the sufferers in the final stages.
"This opens the door to a situation where anyone who is tired of life and who is over 18 years old might ask to help commit suicide," says Pierre Deschamps, who studied the racial news yesterday.
P. Deschamps also underlines that it looks as if the authors of the report are putting the self-suit of a person above all the other values that shape the social fabric of society.
For "in society, he says, there are warning signs and restrictions."
Medical law specialist Margaret Somerville also expressed strong objections to the conclusions of the report, which she classified as a ""manifesto for euthanasia."
Margaret Somerville, who is herself a member of the Royal Canadian Society, doubts in particular the reports on the absence of misconduct in some countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legalized, i.e. in the Netherlands and in the US state of Oregon.
King of Jordan calls on Assad to resign
Damascus talks about "complote"
Syria is increasingly isolated
Bashar al-Assad's followers rallied in front of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs yesterday.
Yesterday, diplomatic pressures on Syria intensified against President Bashar al-Assad, who, with the support of Russia, resists them and talks about "the cap" against his country.
Two days after the suspension of Syria's membership of the Arab League, the European Union intensified its sanctions against Damascus, while Turkey and Jordan, countries bordering Syria, took a stand in favour of the departure of President Assad.
King Abdallah II of Jordan was the first ruler of the Arab state yesterday to call on President Bashar al-Assad to be killed in Syria, where about forty civilians and members of the regime's military forces were killed," he said.
"If Bashar had the interests of his country at heart, he would have to resign, but he would also have to create the conditions necessary for the new phase of Syrian political life," the King of Jordan, a country bordering Syria, said in an interview with the BBC.
For his party, the head of Turkish diplomacy, Ahmet Davutoglu, regretted that the efforts made to the Turkish mediation by the Syrian regime since the start of the year were not crowned with success.
"Those who do not live in peace with their people in the Middle East and cannot satisfy them will leave," he said, alluding to neighboring Syria, to which Turkey is applying an increasingly harsher line.
The United States rejoiced at the "manthemum of the consensus against Assad and the dishonest negotiations of the Syrian regime" after the decisions of the League of Arab States and the European Union.
"International Community, the United States, the European Union, the League of Arab States, countries such as Turkey are applying an increasingly harsher tone" against the repression in Syria, noted Mark Toner, spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
As announced by the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, 16 civilians and 19 members of the pro-regime forces died in the city of Deraa in the south of Syria during this time.
According to this NGO, two other civilian persons were killed during firefights and concentrated shooting from heavy machine guns in the town of Jobar" in the Homs area.
After all, however, at a press conference, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Mouallem estimated that the country had been "left on a way out of the crisis."
Indeed, he also reacted vividly to the Arab League's decision to suspend Damascus' membership, which he said was a "dangerous move."
Syria"he will not bow to it," he added, assuring that "Complots made against Syria will not succeed."
Following his decision to suspend Syria, the Arab States's "mechanism for the protection of civilians" is currently undergone, and plans to send 500 human rights activists, journalists and military observers to the country.
French Foreign Minister Alain Juppé is also favourably in favor of the idea of sending UN observers to help protect civilians from the repression of the regime, which he believes is "paranoidid."
A new special meeting of the League is being convened for tomorrow in Rabat to take a position on the plan to resolve the crisis, decided on 2 December, which was foreseen in particular to withdraw armies from cities plagued by disproverses and the freeing of imprisoned manifestants.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov considered the League's decision to be flawed yesterday, while China urged Syria to accept the plan to resolve the crisis, but in doing so, to avoid fully encouraging possible sanctions against Damascus.
Italy
Monti demands time and victims after Italichs
The next head of the Italian government, Mario Monti, has asked the markets for a little time to shape his team and start implementing a program that includes"victs" in order to regain credibility lost in the last months of Berlusconi's government.
Yesterday, the former European Commissioner discussed with the political parties before meeting with trade union and employers' representatives today.
It should form a relatively slender cabinet made up of technocrats not belonging to parliamentary parties.
"Monti spoke of an important programme with many victims," said Francesco Nucara, a member of one of the numerous parliamentary groups taking part in the talks, after meeting the designated Prime Minister.
Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies Gianfranco Fini expects Mario Monti to ask the Parliament for a vote of confidence by Friday to make sure that the new government has sufficient support.
The consultation will end with Mario Monti's introduction of a small team of twelve ministers to President Giorgio Montolitek.
Mario Monti commented on the jitters in the financial markets yesterday and asked for time.
In "democracy, the exact terms apply" when it comes to the preparation of the government and its agenda, he stressed, adding that he is "certain that the markets will be patient and understand."
His appointment as president was favourably received by the markets at first, but the concern reiterated after the eurozone's unexpected fall in industrial production in the eurozone in September.
The appointed Prime Minister should form a team involving mainly technocrats, although he stressed that he would like to accept"politicians."
He expressed confidence that the new government would last until 2013, i.e. the date of the next election.
According to the Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, the new government will receive the confidence of the parliament until Friday.
After taking office, Mario Monti promised to act with particular urgency and with the aim of making Italy a strong link in" Europe.
A spokesman for European Commissioner Olli Rehn stressed that "i with the new government, our diagnosis of the Italian economy is unchanged'.
The European Union is convinced that, despite the austerity plans adopted in recent months, Rome will not achieve its goal of a balanced budget in the r. 2013, and calls for new harsh measures.
Confindustria, the head of the Confindustria business union, Emma Marcegaglia, who will meet with Montim on Tuesday, has focused on the need to revive the economy"s, as a country that does not show growth, cannot adhere to deficit parameters."
Mario Monti, former European Commissioner (1994-2004), recognized for his expertise and independence,"profesor" symbolizing, according to the authors of the editorial, a call to the seriousness" and "jima Italy," represents for Italy's "epochch" after 17 years of "berlusconism."
The great unknown will be the time of his team's life.
President Napolitano would like to avoid an early election, as Italy must place state-of-an-monthly €200 billion in government bonds by April 2012.
Soviet scientist helped Iran's nuclear program
Soviet scientist Vyacheslav Danilenko helped Iran develop a detonator for the atomic weapon, an American NGO specialized in atomic risk announced on Tuesday.
The Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS) relies on a recent report by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and other documents leaked by the UN Agency in identifying the scientist.
Last week, the IAEA gave its "serious concern" about the "possible military dimension" of Iran's nuclear program.
According to the ISIS Institute, drawing widely from the IAEA documents by V. Danilenko (b. 1934) was to work for three decades since the 1960s at the Soviet military research center in Chelyabinsk (Ural), where he was to be involved in the production of synthetic diamonds using the blast method.
In the r. 1989 or 1991 he was to leave the resort to set up a business producing "nano-diamonds" in Kiev."
His company's economic difficulties were to have led him to contact him in the morning. 1995 of the Iranian Embassy in Ukraine.
Prior to his return to Russia, he was then to work together from 1996 to 2002 on the Iranian programme.
In its latest IAEA report, it recalls the "clear data that the development of the detonation system carried out by Iran" was based on the work of a foreign specialist who not only knew this method well, but who - as one member state informed the agency about it - worked during a substantial part of his working career on this technology within the military nuclear program of the country where he comes from."
Anti-Muslim criminal acts and offences up by 50%
According to FBI statistics released Monday, the number of criminal acts and offences targeting Muslims has risen since the r. 2009 to r. 2010 by almost 50%, while at the same time other racial and religious violence fell slightly or risen slightly.
According to these figures, the total number of violence committed against Muslims rose from 107 in the beginning. 2009 in 160 in R. 2010, i.e. A 49% increase from the procedure of 13% for violence against Catholics, a decrease of 4% for offences against Jews, and an overall increase of 14% for anti-religion criminal offences and offenses.
The total number of "hateless criminal acts" has risen very slightly to 6.628 cases, of which 47.3% were motivated by racial differences and 20% of religious differences, according to the FBI.
"After the decline in the r. 2009 it is disturbing to see these criminal acts and the offenses to rise again", stressed Human First rights organization dedicated to human rights," the increase in anti-Muslim violence is particularly significant," the organization added in its communiqué.
"Human Rights First has long emphasized that the violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crime, must be seen as a serious violation of human rights," adds one of the organization's leaders, Paul Legendre, one of the organization's leaders.
"The American government can and must do more to deal with these abuses," he adds, estimating that this could be done by improving police reports of "hateful criminal acts."
The "homile criminal act" in American federal law is a legion of the age of the fight for civil rights.
This legal order was adopted after the death of Martin Luther King to punish violence associated with race, colour, religion, origin and now sexual orientation.
Twitter changes and resembles more Facebook
The Twitter microblogging service site's site was introduced on Monday to allow its users to observe the activity of the successors, which is somewhat likened to its Facebook services.
New offers""responsibility" and "name" allow you to do better and directly know the activities of other people who follow you or those whose answers ("tweets") are being watched by you.
This allows you to know if it allows you to track posts, whether they sign in to new accounts, whether they have favorite posts, etc.
This new face of Twitter was tested" in August on a small percentage of users" before it was expanded to the entire network on Monday, Twitter spokesperson Carolyn Penner told AFP.
Twitter, which was known for its under-intlisted work, with the rather incomprehensible terms (RT for the repeated dissemination of someone else's post, followfriday pour recommander de suivre un autre utilisateur) faisant le bonheur des naiti, s'ouvre ainsi ainsi ahne publici and un public plus avec un maniement plus a comparable celui des réseaux grand public Facebook et Google+.
On the network, users immediately assess in their "tweets" the importance of this innovation differently.
"It's useless, it takes up a lot of space and it looks too much like Facebook," writes @jemb123.
"Function Action will help me follow some of the elements of my Twitter feed," he sent @dannykronstrom.
Austria
the inclusion of a golden rule on a balanced budget in the constitution
The government of the grand coalition of the Social Democrats and the Christian Democrats, which is in power in Austria, decided on Tuesday to write the "golden rule" of the budget policy in the constitution in order to reduce the public deficit and thus avoid a possible reduction in Austrian ratings by credit rating agencies (AAA).
It was the Social Democratic Chancellor Werner Faymann who announced this decision at the end of the ministerial meeting in a situation where the Austrian public debt, with its 74.6%, is well above the criterion of a maximum 60% laid down by the Maastricht Agreement, but much lower than the debts of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
"If Austria's solvency had been reduced by just one degree from AAA to AA+, we would have to pay three billion euros more in interest each year," argued the Vice-Chancellor and Foreign Minister, the christmasc democrat Michael Spindelegger.
Austria is thus following a request for a summit of the euro area countries held in Brussels on 26. October 2011, where the heads of state and government strongly asked to come to the end of the r. In 2012, the reduction of the public deficit and the balance of public accounts were entered into the constitution or in the law of the same value.
The instrument adopted by the Austrian government is approaching the "German model," Germany was the first European country to take such a "rule."
By 2017, the public structural deficit will have to fall by 0.75% of gross domestic product (GDP) each year, and from 2017, the federal state's public structural deficit will not be allowed to exceed 0.35% of GDP each year, while the Länder, as well as municipalities, will have to report a balanced budget.
The aim is to bring public debt below the 60% criterion set by the Maastricht Treaty in the horizon of 2020/21.
Strong only
Noda threatens to intervene in foreign exchange markets
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that Japanese institutions would have to intervene again in the foreign exchange markets if he were to just continue to strengthen.
"We will intervene as we did for the last time, if we find too much volatility" in the yen's exchange rate, he explained to the Senate Y. Noda.
On Tuesday, he only rose again to the historical values of 31. October forced the Japanese authorities to intervene.
On that day, Tokyo sold only for dollars to reduce the value of the Japanese currency, which had only recently broken the record against the dollar in force since 1945.
But only since then has it regularly risen supported by purchases by investors who see it as a "safe harbour" in the uncertain times of the world economic slowdown and the European crisis caused by debt.
The dollar was again below 77 yen on Tuesday, and the euro fell below the symbolic bar of 105 yen near the levels that triggered the latest intervention.
Before the financial crisis of 2008-2009, the dollar was worth around 120 yen and the euro was worth more than 160 yen.
This outburst of the Japanese currency is detrimental to island exports, as it makes the price of Made in Japan's products more expensive and reduces the value of the proceeds generated by Japanese firms from abroad when they are transferred to the domestic currency.
"Japan is recovering" from the destruction caused by the March earthquake and the tsunami that devastated the region of Tohoku in the northeast of the country, Y. Noda, who fears that this hike to the yen will not yet be killed by a fragile revival in the egg.
The world's third economic power resumed growth in the third quarter (1.5% in the previous quarter) for the first time in one year thanks to a survey of growth in disaster-stricken exports and household consumption.
But the Prime Minister concluded that the high value of the yen did not reflect the "national economy of Japan."
Japanese Finance Minister Jun Azumi called on the Bank of Japan's Central Bank (BoJ), which launched a two-day meeting of its political and monetary council on Tuesday to take all possible measures to weaken the yen.
But the institution's multi-seat governor, Hirohide Yamaguchi, pointed out that BoJ had previously taken "subversive measures" suggesting that no additional monetary weakening could be expected on Wednesday.
At its last meeting at the end of October, the Securities Emissions Institute increased by 5,000 billion yor (€47 billion) of his purchases of Treasury bills and raised to 55,000 billion yen (519 billion euro) the ceiling for the amounts he devotes to purchases of various securities in order to flood with liquidation.
Eurozone:
rates rise, stock exchanges fail
The risk of contagion of the debt crisis is still undermined by European indicators.
Despite the appointment of new heads of government in Greece and Italy and better growth figures in France and Germany, the rates of weakened countries continue to rise.
European stock markets still concerned about the stability of the euro area are falling into negative expectations on Tuesday, November 15.
In Paris at 10 a.m., the CAC 40 is down 1.4% to 3,064 points.
The Dax index in Frankfurt is down 0.4% and London 0.1%.
"With new tensions around the proceeds of the loans of the eurozone states in difficulty, stock markets around the world continue to yield only part of recent gains."
"Nervous investors are only too aware of the risk of infection," explains Terry Pratt, a broker with IG Markets, quoted by Reuters.
The Tokyo exchange was closing with a 0.70% drop, which it suffered because of concerns from market participants over Europe's ability to deal with the debt crisis.
"Japan, like the rest of the world, has eyes on Europe and the shift will only continue in a narrow corridor of variations until investors have evidence that the situation is stabilised," estimates MitsushshigeA Akino, the fund manager at Ichiyoši Investment Management.
This rearpection of uncertainties about the eurozone's future is hurting the currency itself, which continues to decline on Tuesday.
The euro is at its lowest level since a month and a half ago.
At 10am, the European currency is worth $1.3570 in a 0.4% drop.
According to the brokers, the currency backed down after Chancellor Angela Merkel's CDU's CDU party at its congress on Monday adopted a proposal to exit the eurozone for countries in trouble without therefore having to leave the European Union.
Italian and Spanish rates far beyond the 6% threshold
Interest rates on loans in Italy and Spain remain at a very worrying level.
This morning, on Tuesday morning, the Italian 10-year bond yield is 6.85%, and the yield on Spanish 10-year bonds is 6.2%.
These tensions at the interest rates of the southern European countries, but also in France, continue to reinforce the concerns of market participants.
The head of the future Italian government, Mario Monti, strongly demanded time in the markets to remedy the situation in Italy at risk of poisoning caused by its debt.
Greece's new Prime Minister, Lucas Papademos, confirmed that the application of the decisions taken by 27. October at the eurozone summit will be the "main task" of his government.
Spain is once again in a deliberate line of markets when the country's elections to the House of Commons are held in the country on Sunday.
The rate gap ("spread") between Germany's 10-year bonds and Spain has reached a new historic high.
Expectations of euro area growth notifications
Statistical figures say that France recorded economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter mainly caused by household consumption, i.e. a little better than the expected growth of 0.3%.
However, the French National Institute for Statistical and Economic Studies INSEE revised downward figures for the second quarter to a 0.1% decline in GDP instead of stagnation.
And, in fact, it's the fourth quarter that's the most worrying economists.
From its side during the same period, Germany registered growth of 0.5%.
The first estimates for the entire euro area are expected at 11 a.m., while the European Commission has just highlighted the risk of a new recession.
Energy policy:
facts must conquer dogma
If there is a theme that cannot be grasped on the basis of short-term balance sheets or under emotion, it is an energy policy.
The dispassibility and price of electricity have a direct impact on the purchasing power and competitiveness of businesses.
It is only natural for the meeting at the polls to be an opportunity to think about such deposits and the place that is occupied by the energy from the core.
The debate will only be successful when all the economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options are explored.
The French must base their position on objective facts and rational data.
So far, there are 7 billion human beings on the planet, but demographic developments will spark a duplication of electricity demand from now until 2050 if we do not want to rid a significant part of the world's population from an important part of life.
At the same time, a lack of fossil resources will need to be faced to continue to be generated, while it is impossible to forget the necessary need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to combat climate change, a theme that is currently disappearing from environmental debates.
The Fukushima accident affects none of these parameters.
That is why Germany remains alone in its decision to reject nuclear energy.
But this is not the case for Belgium, which submits its decision to the need to find some other resource capable of replacing itself, nor by Switzerland, which it considers it right to build only the power plants of the last generation.
Conversely, the UK, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil, to quote at least some countries, continue with determination in their projects.
The United States decided to expand its park with one unit after Fukushima by the resumption of the construction of one power plant interrupted after the Three Mile Island accident.
If the German model based on renewable energies is sometimes presented as an example, reality contradicts this.
The choice of Berlin will be reflected in the price of electricity rises, increased energy dependence on gas imported especially from Russia, the sharp rise in CO2 emissions generated by the construction of natural gas and coal power plants.
All of these unpleasant effects will be felt in a few months.
The case of Denmark deserved to be considered.
The European Wind Power Plant Champion, from which he takes 30% of his electricity, is also one of the largest consumers of coal and gas because of the irregularity of the wind, which makes CO2 emissions and Danish electricity prices higher by 65%, respectively. 50% than the European average.
Conversely, thanks to the immutability of our energy policy, our neighbours will pay the electricity invoice 40% higher than the payment of French households.
While in a globalised economy the cost of energy is a key factor in competitiveness and a guarantee of keeping industry in the national territory, French companies enjoy the benefits of the cheapest electricity in Europe.
For this reason, any significant reduction in the share of nuclear energy would trigger a strong increase in the price of electricity, making illusory beautiful declarations of re-industrialisation of our country and defending purchasing power.
The price that a large majority of French people refuses to pay, just as it is not fundamentally opposed to this energy, as the opinion polls show.
Recall that our country's energy policy has allowed the sector to be built with 125,000 direct jobs and 410,000 downstream jobs.
The heavily export sector is dragging a large number of small and medium-sized, specialised, job creation firms to international markets that cannot be transferred abroad.
If France had decided to leave the core, it would sacrifice a small number of these small and medium-sized enterprises, losing the 6 billion euros a year the country receives for the export of nuclear facilities and services.
Which plant owner would order a nuclear reactor designed to operate for 60 years while the bankruptcy of its manufacturer was planned?
In addressing the energy equation, it must be accepted that there is no magical source for the production of energy, or that there is no evil one.
The development of low-CO2 emission installations, nuclear installations and renewable energy installations carried out by the French industrial group AREVA is indicative of complementarity between energy sources.
In the case of nuclear energy, it is absolute a must to maintain the highest level of safety.
In France, we have the State Office for Nuclear Safety, which carries out uncompromising and transparent oversight of the existing nuclear power plants as well as the construction of a new power plant in Flamanville.
Our teams, whose professionalism is recognized, have the idea of safety in their blood.
Fifty years, the nuclear industry has known three serious accidents.
The only one in Three Mile Island happened in normal traffic conditions and remained free of human casualties and consequences for the environment.
In Chernobyl, the drama was caused by the design of the reactor and inexcusable human errors.
In the case of Fukushima, some seem to forget that the crash was the result of two natural disasters of an unprecedented scale that caused the deaths of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will learn the lessons of this crash just as it did for the two previous ones.
The fruit of this step and cooperation between the French and German nuclear safety authorities, the operators and the designers is that the EPR-type reactor is a concept capable of resisting such phenomena.
While all those interested in hiring a nuclear power plant consider it to be stopped by its construction in Flamanville would be an excellent gift offered to the rivals of AREVA and EDF's competitors and the freeing up of the way to seize a leading position in nuclear development.
It is essential and legitimate to seek the best energy solution for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let the emotions, dogmas and machinations dominate the debate thus crucial for the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Is immigration a burden or a chance for the economy?
The immigration policy for Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticised from different angles - the overloatting of the police, the courts and administration subjected to the calculus policy, the compatibility of this policy with the status of "the country of human rights" boasts of France.
Recently, it was an administrative harassment of which was foreign students, which became topical when the Minister of the Interior (see the Libération paper on 23 May) said that France "doesn't need foreign talents, bricklayers and waitresses."
But it has rarely been dismantled at the outlook for the economy.
It must be said that there is a rather broad consensus between the left and the right in this area.
To the right tone in 1976, Jacques Chirac set the tone with his statement that the "900000 unemployed should not be a problem in a country where there are 2 million immigrant workers" and on the left Michel Rocard when, in 1990, he said that France "can't accept all the misery of the world."
The only difference is the degree of generosity
In 2005, the fear of invading the hordes of Polish plumbers on French territory was shared on the right and left.
In both camps, immigrants are seen as a burden on the economy and French society.
The only difference lies in the degree of generosity that we deign to immigrants.
In his programme, François Hollande confines himself to banality, stating that joint development will make it possible to solve our "migration problem."
This idea of immigration as a burden and a problem is perhaps in elections, but it is very expensive economically.
As economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron recall in their recently published work synthesizing the latest knowledge of immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 p.m.: among specialists there is a broad consensus on the positive impact of migration movements on economic growth, wages and employment in the countries that receive immigrants.
Restricting immigration is crippling growth and harming employment.
Fears of the effects of the migrants are based on the idea that these people can replace French workers, especially the less skilled, and put pressure on lowering their wages.
But experience shows that, in fact, immigrants are much more complemented than replacements for French employees by doing work in sectors with a lack of staff.
Not qualified immigrants in sectors that attract French employees and the most qualified in the dynamic sectors in which education is not enough to offer places.
Positive effect on wages
Like a surgeon, he will have difficulty working in a country where there is a shortage of an anesthesiologists, these additions between the French and migrants are making immigrant arrivals a positive impact on the wages and employment of French workers.
Giovanni Peri thus calculated that the growth of migration movements by 1% would trigger a long-term increase in real wages between between 0.6 and 0.9%.
And yet he does not take into account the fact that the diversity brought by immigrants contributes to the creation of ideas and economic growth (a high proportion of naturalized immigrants among American Nobel Prize winners; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay, eBay and Yahoo have been set up by immigrants).
Migrants are also net contributors to social systems in European countries at an average of 1% of the total budget.
For example, the World Labour Organisation estimates that in Germany, one immigrant arriving at the age of 30 will bring a net contribution to public budgets in its entire lives (income minus expenditure) of €1,500,000.
At the start of his mandate, Nicolas Sarkozy made a wish to go for the lack of growth's shortage with bared teeth'.
The aforementioned teeth to deter immigrants had the opposite effect.
Europe invents democracy, needs to think about European democracy
Democracy is a rare and very fragile commodity.
The European continent should remember this, for even though he invented it in Athens two thousand years ago, he experienced the tragedies of the world wars, totalitarian regimes, the Holocaust, the gulags, but also Franca in Spain, Salazara in Portugal and colonels in Greece during the XXth century.
Some people could believe that to make a final triumph of democracy triumphant over its enemies, it would be enough to make a choice and implement it in the most direct way possible.
But it is known from Napoleon that it was an ease of thought.
General suffrage, though a prerequisite for democracy, is not a sufficient condition, and can become a "something of oppression" as the Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot once said.
No, democracy requires much more: public space, public space, public spirit, values, organization of department and control of power, education, the Enlightenment, social and economic solidarity, the judiciary.
The crisis of Europe we are experiencing is an economic crisis, but it has been just as it has been and since the start of the crises of politics and democracy.
The admission of a mistake by a Greek referendum of yes-no will have the value of a double revelation in this regard: the revelation of the need for a great return of political power, but also to reveal a disturbing sense of its impossibility, its inappropriateness.
This ambivalence must be thought through in order to be overcome.
The truth is that the front lines of the democratic struggle have been relocated today, and that many of the Republican fighters are no longer shooting in the right direction.
We cannot gain anything if we demand a series of national referendums held according to necessity and disorganised.
Bianko on display to the European absolutist monarch or jump with his feet tied to the emptiness of the nationalist depths: what choice for the citizen!
No, we do not want guillotine knives, but a common, full, peaceful and round-the-clock performance of selection and democracy, this time at European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal - nor would we know where to stop the list - as the crisis is in Europe.
For it is the whole of Europe bowing to the dictates of markets and credit rating agencies that suffer from their incompetence and lack of solidarity.
It is the whole of Europe that is humiliated on the international stage.
We are alarmed in the transfer of sovereignty to Europe - but it is the whole of Europe that is slowly losing its sovereignty and with it each of its peoples.
Urgently, the governance of the European project of democratic sovereignty needs to be returned.
For only together will Europeans be able to reduce the burden of their debts, to get rid of the rule of markets and to prepare the future by investing.
The east of the crisis will envisage decisions at European level that cannot be taken without complete democratic legitimacy, otherwise it would lead us to disaster.
Having long fought against this proposal by the Socialists and Jacques Delors, everyone is now strongly demanding a European economic government.
So be it.
But to think so without stronger political and democratic integration, and experienced as such by the citizens, would be a new folly and a new dead end.
We need to take on a new phase of European building.
To create a republic in France, it was necessary to "be" the Republicans.
A revolution in interests could not be enough.
This lesson remains valid.
We must build a Europe that is more economically integrated.
This will only be done by building a Europe of more politically democratic and genuine European democratic sovereignty.
Let us become Europeans to build Europe.
"Contactless" chip cards are spreading
In an optimistic atmosphere, the World Chips Card Fair will open on Tuesday in Villepinte near Paris.
According to the Eurosmart cabinet, 2011 should end with an increase in world sales of microprocessor (bank cards, SIM card phones) to 11% more than 6 billion units.
The most supporting feature is the contactless technology segment, which allows you to pay for mass transit or to handle purchases simply by approximating the card to the reader.
This year should be sold 460 million chip cards worldwide against the 320 million sold a year earlier!
Their share is expected to rise even further in 2012 (a expected 580 million units) and reach around 10% of the total chip card market (6.925 million cards).
Having long been in the grip of APEC countries, Europe is gaining ground in contactless payment.
Approximately 26 million Visa bank cards are already equipped with this feature and 75,000 payment terminals are receiving them.
In France, the beginnings are more modest: 400,000 Visa contactless cards have been issued.
But the big supermarket chains work for two.
Carrefour has issued 2.5 million MasterCard contactless cards this year.
To line up the higher gear, banks need to equip their clients with them from now on.
"Two major French businesses have committed to systematically distribute contactless bank cards to their clients in the future," announces Gérard Nébouy, CEO of Visa Europe France.
Banks test paying by mobile
But this is only the first stage on the means of payment for the future: a mobile phone.
The NFC (Near Field Communication) technology required to conduct transactions today is equipped with only a small number of devices.
"Backed late."
"But their real boom should take place next year."
"For 2012, we estimate their sale worldwide at 80 to 120 million units," explains Marc Bertin, president of Eurosmart.
But the banks are already preparing in advance.
Yesterday, Crédit agricole announced the launch of a test conducted in Caen, which will run from December to June next year.
The iPhone devices of approximately 200 clients and associates will be equipped with a case that allows contactless payments.
BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
Also, Société générale announced yesterday that it was preparing to introduce an offer to allow its clients to pay with a mobile phone without a touch.
Terrorist Front extends from the Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is concerned about the al-Qaida ties in the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
Long-term suspicions that there are alloys by the Al-Qaeda terrorist group in the Islamic Maghreb (AQMI) and the Niger sect Boko Haram are being confirmed.
On Sunday, Algerian Deputy Foreign Minister Abdelkader Messahel even admitted that Algiers had now "safe" made sure of it."
"The way the two organizations operate and the intelligence reports show that there is a great deal of cooperation between them," he explained without elaborating.
Paris seems to have similar analyses.
Investigating the abduction of two French people in Niger in January 2010 could help illuminate the connecting bridges.
After being abducted by AQMI members from a restaurant in Niamey, Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory were to be killed the following day at the same time as several of their hijackers in an operation conducted by special French troops.
In the rubble after the crackdown, French and Nigerian investigators were to find several phones with chips belonging to the terrorists.
Terrorist axis
The analysis of the calls carried out leads to several people in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), investigators are particularly interested in two figures: one leads to a Nigerian who has been at length in Maiduguri, a city in the north of Nigeria, which is the cradle of Boko Haram, and the other to a man who is said to be close to AQI and a sect.
"This is progress, but it is no doubt necessary to wait for more convincing evidence before we start talking about the operational co-operation between AQMI and Boko Haram."
"But it's possible."
"We have seen for years that the sect enjoys external financial and intellectual support and that it is manifesting itself more and more actively," tempered by Nigerian investigator Kunle Amuwo.
In recent months, this "support" has been more and more obvious in the Boko Haram's development and speeches or in its operational procedures, which from now on include human casualties or increasingly complex explosive devices of the same mode of execution as those used by the AQMI.
The international community, led by Washington, has since exerted pressure on Nigeria to take into account the problems posed by Boko Haram.
In fact, the Nigerian authorities have long regarded the group as a community of enlightened mystics of little interest.
Fast Success
The Boko Haram sect was founded in the morning. 2002 in Maiduguri around the mosque, school and fundamentalist Mohammed Yusuf. Boko Haram, which in the language of haoussa means "Western education is a sin" he approves of the founding of the Islamic Emirate in the Muslim north of Nigeria.
In this poor region, such a link has been a quick success.
The sect is politicized and requires strict adherence to Islamic sharia law, while its followers begin the fight against the 'central government.
These people first target churches, bars and offices.
In the r. 2009 with Boko Haram supporters become extremely active and multiply their attacks against police stations.
As usual, the government's response is still the same.
The army will surround the city and the result is 800 dead.
The sect's founder, Mohammed Yusuf, is caught and killed in prison.
From that point on, the group is radicalized and leaves its location in the north.
At Christmas 2010, the assassination in the city of Jos will detain 80 people, then another one in the capital, Abuja.
In June, it's again in Abuja, where Boko Haram will attack police headquarters in their first suicide attack.
And in August, the UN Local Bureau will be the first international target.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa to run from Mauritania via Nigeria to Somalia is now worrying all security specialists.
Now that Al-Qaeda of the Islamic Maghreb has been surrounded by Mali and ighers and Al-Shabaab militants are operating in Kenya, Boko Haram appears to be a new danger to the continent.
In Nigeria last week, in an interview with President Goodluck Jonathan, Alain Juppé, said that France was on alert and ready to "forward all information."
The world by the presidential candidates
On issues related to China, Iran, or aid to Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, and Rick Perry are all racing to simplify and unknowledge.
Can a crisis-weakened America manage the world through simple or even simplistic ideas?
Listening to the presidential candidates, voters might think so.
For days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and others have been reviewing loudlide statements and brief foreign policy tutorials, which has traditionally been a strong point for Republicans.
Often unsubstantiated slogans about China, Iran, or help Israel merge with each other.
Mitt Romney, the best-placing candidate in the Republican"Grand Old Party nomination race," threatened Chinese by profession before the World Trade Organization and their accusations "for manipulating their currency," a theme in America-spattered by migration through the entire parts of its industry to Asia.
Worse, if this must include the launch of a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, Obama's former ambassador to China and the only candidate with some sophisticated vision of foreign policy, has almost stalled in an attitude that "smooths" emotions.
He called for a tough but constructive dialogue with Beijing (President Obama's current stance).
But Huntsman, who is in the last seats on the electoral estimates, remains in-use.
The image of President Reagan
Romney also promised military strikes on Iran if sanctions fail to halt its nuclear program.
"If I am elected, I will imprison Iran," he said in a fanfare.
"If Obama is re-elected, they'll have a bomb."
He also promised to increase military assistance to Israel, accusing Obama of failing to his responsibilities toward his partner.
Businessman Herman Cain, the second best-placed candidate, is demonstrating an embarrassing ignorance of the documents.
He recently called for a sharp stance against the Chinese military threat, because he will rehearse to develop nuclear capabilities" - evidently ignorant of the fact that China has owned an atomic weapon since 1964!
Texas Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants strikes against Iran, says he is ready to send the U.S. military to Mexico to fight drug cartels.
The use of torture against the presumed terrorists banned by Obama in the morning. 2009 is also recommended by Cain, Perry and another candidate, Michele Bachmann.
They're all far away from him in the morning. 2008 Republican candidate John McCain, heavyweight in foreign policy.
The current president's opponents say Reagan had simple ideas, too, and still won the Cold War.
They recall that Obama himself was an amateur and that he added water to his wine in the fight against terrorism.
They highlight the failure of his naive dialogue with Iran, the hasty departure of the "boys" from Iraq, his excuses concerning Libya and thus give him the label of the weak
But the attack is not easy.
The population is judging President Obama's national security policy, which removed Ben Laden, rather positively.
He has no confidence in the military interventions from Iraq that lead to mired up.
And with the argument that it is necessary to reconstruct America economically in order to resuscitate its leadership, Obama is knocking to a more correct position.
Nord Stream, the new entry port of Russian gas to Europe
The Nord Stream long-distance pipeline connecting directly to Eastern Europe to Russia and along the bottom of the Baltic Sea has started to work.
It must deliver gas equal to the equivalent of 30 million households.
Gazprom, a Russian gas giant, wanted to celebrate the event properly.
More than 500 guests, among them 4 heads of state and government, attended the inauguration of Nord Stream, a new pipeline that will be joined directly by Russia and Germany under the sea.
Symbolically, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fillon and his Dutch colleague Mark Rutte turned together around the control valve to the Russian gas control input into the Western European network.
With this new pipeline, 27.5 billion extra cubic metres of Russian gas will begin to flow to Western Europe every year with the first 1,224 km pipeline connecting the St. Petersburg region with the Province of Mecklemy-Pomerana.
The second pipeline, which must be completed at the end of the r. 2012, will make it possible to supply a total of 55 billion cubic metres of gas, which is the amount that equals the entire French consumption.
And it is already recalled to be able to build a third pipeline pipeline on the same route.
For Gazprom, the timely completion of this huge structure has the character of a victory.
Poland and the Baltic countries strongly protested against the project.
Nord Stream will actually make it possible to supply gas directly to Germany without being run around the country by a third state (Poland or Ukraine).
At the same time, these two countries are losing some of power: the possibility of pushing Russia with threats to close its access to Western European markets is becoming more difficult for them.
This was most strongly expressed by Warsaw when it did not hesitate to compare Nord Stream to the "new German-Soviet pact," citing the alliance between Hitler and Stalin in the Polish occupation in the r. 1939.
It means to say that this is a politically sensitive subject.
Western Europe, with its support for this Russian project, has gained more certainty of its purchases.
But it's at the cost of weakening Europe's energy, because the project has created cracks between Europeans from the East and the West.
Russia managed to push through its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and rich, high-intensity, gas-intensive Western nations, the deposits of which are nearing their end, with its deposits coming to an end.
"This pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, a new artery that organically connects us," confirmed François Fillon at the opening ceremony of this pipeline and demonstrated at what point the big gas contracts of affairs are both political and economic.
All of this is explained by the broad smiles of Gazprom leaders present in large numbers in Lubmin, the gas supply point.
The construction of this pipeline is also an important technical act.
The undersea pipe is made of steel fitted with a concrete shell to be protected from the anchors of the naval vessels.
It rests at the bottom of the sea at an average depth of 200 m.
In its construction, it was necessary to avoid the minefields from the time of World War II.
"For security reasons, almost a hundred had to be removed or destroyed," says Jens Müller, a spokesman for Nord Stream.
It was also necessary to increase the measures to protect the fauna and flora.
The pipes themselves are a long metal snake weighing like the 242 Eiffel Tower, which is not interrupted anywhere by the valves or maintenance stations.
One control platform was to be built near Sweden, but the project leaders rejected it when the Swedes were little greedily to see the Russian state-owned company permanently settling off their coast.
"In the event of a defect, we will stop the gas passage in less than 1 minute," Jens Müller states.
In the event of a leakage, the gas contained in the pipeline escapes into the air.
But this case is considered unlikely by the builder, after all, the welds were designed to create a leak once every 100,000 years.
The inspection of the state of the pipeline from the outside is carried out by an underwater robot towed by the ship, while the interior of the pipeline is controlled by a device that circulates inside.
This digger-shaped device of 1 metre in diameter is inserted into the inside of the pipe and is being pushed by the gas.
At the target, after three days of travel at 3 m/s, it will provide accurate information about possible deformations of the metal parts.
The long-distance pipeline was designed to operate for fifty years without the need for the slightest repair.
The circulation of gas is simply ensured by pressure.
The value of this pressure is the 200 bar at the start and the 100 bar at the finish.
Five companies joined forces to implement this project.
Gazprom remains the leading position, which holds a 51% stake.
It was joined by the German companies E.ON and BASF (15.5% each), as well as the Dutch company Gasunie and the French group GDF Suez (9% each).
The five companies formed a joint venture called Nord Stream in charge of building and running the pipeline.
The business is based in the city of Zoug, Switzerland, where taxation is extremely advantageous.
Gazprom subsequently leased the company for five years with a contract that can be renewed, all of its gas transport capacities.
"Gazprom will have a profit from the total capacity, whatever the amount of actual gas," states Jens Müller.
Funding for the construction of the pipeline was provided by 30% shareholders and 70% bank loans.
The total cost of the work should reach €7.4 billion for both pipelines.
For the GDF Suez group, the investment costs rose to 240 million.
But minority shareholders are certain that their costs will be refunded, because only Gazprom takes the risk.
The pipeline exits the Baltic Sea in Lubmin on the sandy coast with pine forests.
The 4.5-metre-high valves form the output gate of gas.
The sensors measure the pressure, temperature and other characteristics of the incoming gas before it is transported to the German pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, this terminal has been receiving one million cubic metres of Russian gas every hour.
At full capacity, it will be 3 million per hour and in the r. 2012 6 million.
Moleskine - a mark notebook
The Italian firm Moleskine, which was founded as early as fifty years ago, wants to reiterate the joy of writing.
It brings the scent of adventure, the hours spent writing by candlelight.
The Moleskine notebook is easily discernible in its black rectangular plates and its tarnished white-coloured leaves as if in time aged.
After all, the Moleskine notebook, as we know him today, was born back in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, based in Milan, will decide at that time to launch a new design but distinguished notebook.
Maria Sebregondi, then a consultant working for the business, takes up the launch of the new product.
The notebook is inspired by the old "moleskin" production technique (shinimitation), which is, for example, used to adjust the surface of the benches.
This type of notebook was greatly appreciated by the writer and traveller.
"Moglene returned to popularity an old and forgotten subject that was an icon of avant-garde artists until the XX century," says Maria Sebregondi, who has since become a leading person at the brand at Modo Modo.
Success is here.
Sales rose by 26% between 2006 and 2010, to settle at 12.7 million units last year.
The situation is remote undercover production from the first years, when only 3,000 notebooks were made.
Moleskine crosses Italian borders and exports to 70 countries from France to the United States.
It is difficult to compile some artificial portrait of the buyer, as the notebook captures the businessman as well as the student or the professionals.
The image of the Moleskine notebook is that its owners are people cosmopolitan, cultured and open-minded.
The small Italian business, which had 12 employees in its early days, has nearly a hundred today and has two offices since 2008, one of which is in Milan and the other in New York.
He sends his notebooks to bookstores and, through the FNAC store chain, to small boutiques in the middle of cities, where he could assert his identity.
"We have pursued the spirit of the times and this need for new writing, through the turbulent development of emails," explains Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural signature accompanies the development of the Moleskine notebook: recently, the brand opened an exhibition" to "Scurtain" where architects or artists exhibit their notebook.
In August, on the occasion of the Locarno Film Festival, she also released new recordings of the leopard-like notebook.
Moleskine profits from its success and this cultural aura and diversifies its products: bags, diaries, pencils, notebook cases ... The brand extends to a variety of carriers.
Success that aroused envy: in the fall of 2006, Modo Modo Modo was bought by investment funds SG Capital, today Syntegra Capital, a new site in the history of Moleskine.
Why is the proportion of unemployed handicapped workers so high?
About 19% of handicapped people looking for work.
Today it opens on 15. A week for employing the handicapped.
Through the voluntaristic public policy established in the r. 2005 the percentage of unemployed people of disabled people is twice as much as the average, i.e. 19% versus 9% for the entire population.
Is it depressing?
"No, underlined by Éric Blanchet, the CEO of the Adapt Association, which organizes the Week for the Employment of the Handicap."
"The years since 15 years' time are remarkable."
"At the time, the percentage of unemployed wasn't twice, but three times higher."
"However, there remains much to be done."
It should be said that for the unemployed handicapped people, numerous obstacles to take up work remain.
These are the elderly: 37% are over 50 years old (17% aver averaging).
They are low in qualification: 80% do not have a high school diploma, and of the 2.3 million university students, only 10,000 are handicapped.
Finally, long-term unemployment is widespread: 53% for the handicapped, up from 38% on average.
In short, such are criteria that particularly complicate the return to work and which represent the "core of the problem"," according to Christian Grapin, the director-general of the Tremplin Association, which was founded in 1992, to help businesses recruit disabilities.
So much for objective brakes.
What remains is the unfinished, the ways of thinking that are surely evolving, but too slowly.
A study conducted in April by the IMS-Entreprendre pour la Cité association found that the managers interviewed have a weak level of knowledge of handicapped persons" with an exaggerated notion of persons in a mobile chair and mental or mental shortcomings."
As a result, private businesses with more than 20 employees are still a long way from reaching the target of employing 6% of the handicapped workers provided for in the 1987 Act.
The last known numbers that come from a r. 2008, they give a flat 2.6%.
"We are now around 3%," says Pierre Blanc, director-general of Agefiph, the organization charged with charging fees from businesses that do not comply with the law.
The evidence is the number of "honour" paid-for-as-you-go enterprises, as well as the amounts paid, which fell from 59,000 offenders to 46,000 (and from 606 to 480 million euros) between 2007 and 2011.
"The law of r. In 2005, which increased the contributions, put up strong pressure on businesses, Pierre Blanc explains."
"But this improvement is also demonstrated by genuine awareness, especially in large businesses."
According to the Labor Ministry, only 59% of businesses with 20 to 49 employees employ handicapped workers compared to 82% of businesses with 100 to 199 employees.
Gambling: "What a Happiness"
Before the French national team (Bleus) were challenged on Tuesday evening (h$2045)), Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens did not hide the pleasure that this friendly match will bring them.
We don't go so far as to write that there was a collusion between them, but the picture is symbolic.
Sitting side by side in the stands of the Stade de France auditorium, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard, in short, reconciled.
Five months after his striker's angry gesture in the match against Turkey, the Belgian coach was uttering words of praise for his player.
"I am very happy with Eden and his progress, even with the fact that he loves his country."
"I want to move forward," assures the French Lille player.
As for the difference between his performances in club matches and national team matches," it is one and the same, justifying himself."
"I've been in Lille all year round, which is not the case with Belgium."
"I need to clear my mark."
Hazard, spared against Romania on Thursday night for this match against France, arrives at the stadium in Saint-Denis to finally "shallar."
It is impossible to ignore the concept of "radity".
Play against Bleus, which he cheered from the age of 7 and in their victorious campaigns in 1998 and 2000.
"I've always been a fan," he claims.
This necessarily contributes even more to the "special" nature of this meeting.
All the more so because "it's against Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami) ", it recalls.
"We cruised at once."
"Too to play against them, that's just a pleasure!"
The fairness of Leekens also recalled "pronity".
"Hride" to fight"game - a holiday."
"Prinket" also to state with the quality of the "sneakers" that France, a little more than a year after the trauma in the southern African city of Knysna" has become a team of very high standards."
"Laurent Blanc has done a tremendous job," he sighed.
Although Belgium will miss the next European Championship, the technical footballer would like to see himself in the 2014 aircraft with the French on the course... Brazil.
"Our little Belgians will become big," he underlined.
"We're building something right now, the players are ambitious, they're hungry."
"You'll realize it for the next games." Including the one against France.
Portugal very confident
Portugal's Paulo Bento is in for a draw with great optimism against Bosnia Bosnian (22 hp) this Wednesday in Lisbon.
On the way there, both teams lacked realism.
"At the end of those 90 minutes, we will be a happy team and, above all, a happy country'.
Paulo Bento is already seen in Poland and Ukraine.
There is no shadow of doubt for him. The Portuguese national football team, whose helm he has been at the helm since 2010, will qualify for the Euro 2012.
Portugal is actually 90 minutes away from luck.
One game and one opponent to play - Bosnia - to play.
Conscious of Friday's result (0-0) in the inferno of Bosnia's Zenica, it seems clear that nothing is won.
Portugal certainly had the edge for more than an hour, but they were unable to score such a rare goal to relieve it.
"It's a good result, which nevertheless contains a risk because we didn't score outside."
But at home at their stunning Stade de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced that they will advance in front of the audience, which should create a boiling cauldron there, even if the match certainly appears to be "very balanced," says the optimist but the shrewdly-thinking Bento.
"We expect a very even game, but we are quite convinced that we can have the upper hand," said the 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
"We still have a 50% chance to be Euro 2012," the successor to Carlos Queiroz nevertheless relativized.
Friday's match in Bosnia forcing the Portuguese to score a goal and win.
An undeclared match may be enough for the Bosnians, who also need to score a goal.
"It's a good result, which nevertheless contains a risk in itself because we didn't score a goal out there," regrets Bento.
"We will play against a team that has great technical qualities and has players with great individual qualities," he added.
As in the Zenica, the Portuguese will be interested in putting maximum pressure on the Bosnian team right from the start" they would not give them time to think about."
Good thought, on the condition that this time it becomes realistic.
