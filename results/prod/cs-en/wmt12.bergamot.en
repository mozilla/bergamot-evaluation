Parliament did not support the amendment to the liberating Tymoshenko
Ukraine's parliament today rejected a proposal to repeal the section, on the basis of which the opposition leader Yuliya Tymoshenko was convicted.
An adjustment to open the way to the liberation of the imprisoned ex-PM was rejected by MPs at the second reading of the proposal to allay the sentences for economic offences.
Tymoshenko was sentenced in October to seven years in prison for entering into an allegedly on-usual contract with Russia to purchase natural gas.
The verdict is not final; the court is to hear the court in December.
Tymoshenko calls the ruling a political vendetta to the regime, the suspected bias of the court's bias aroused by the trial in the West.
The motion to drop section 365 of the Ex-Prime Minister on the ground of which the ex-PM was convicted was supported by 147 deputies in the vote.
It required 226 votes to be approved.
Libyan victory
The story of the Libyan liberation, or the Libyan rebellion, which has its losers.
Muammar Gaddafi is buried in an unknown place in the desert and without it is over.
What remains to be defined is the winner.
As is customary in the county, the election will be won by the Islamists, but the issue is whether the moderate or the radical.
The Transitional National Council has signed up to the customary Sharia law, and we already have some idea about it.
Libya will become a crime-free country, as theft is chopped off.
Women can forget about emancipation, any renegades from the faith are facing execution, and so on.
Instead of the dictator, a company consisting of rival tribes will unite the Koran.
There will be a line in Libya that we cannot imagine and which we would certainly not want.
But our way of life is neither the only nor objectively the best, and it would probably not suit the Libyans just mentioned for a change.
In fact, it is surprising that the Islamic fighters took advantage of the help of infidel dogs.
The only excuse is that, from their point of view, it was not the American general who was driving NATO raids, but by Allah, whose greatness they celebrated in every hilarious intervention.
So when the victors are sought in Libya, the west is not one of them.
We took part in the shootout, served Islam, and our politicians got rid of a political ally in the person of the dictator without guaranteeing any profit.
After fresh bad experiences in Afghanistan and Iraq, we do not buy Libya militarily.
That leaves the locals with the issue of the "cruckers" being banished.
But will they have, without the occupation of the oil company, for a kiss of Libya's black gold?
They may well not be, and the West will finally be able to boast of selfless protection of human rights.
Unless it's what the tabers of the Sharia lawman will do it.
A new era of crisis is about to begin.
The focus of investors was France and the rest of Europe
The statistical whirlwind swept across Europe on Tuesday.
Individual states have released GDP figures for 3Q.
The Czech economy has stagnated quarter-on-quarter, with Germany and France growing.
But the bond market is now breaking records.
Investors are no longer looking only at Italy, but also Spain, France, Austria and others.
The eurozone's statistical authorities, Germany, the Czech Republic and some other European countries have published preliminary estimates of the development of the economy for the third quarter.
Germany's GDP grew by the expected 0.5%, France by 0.4%.
At the same time, the two countries adjusted the second-quarter data, in which Germany, in addition to better than expected (up 0.3% instead of the original 0.1%), but France said it had emerged in a slight 0.1% decline (initial figures indicated stagnation).
The Czech economy grew by 1.5 percent year-on-year in the third quarter of this year.
Quarterly, however, the gross domestic product (GDP) stagnated and, according to the Czech Statistical Office, confirmed the trend of a gradual slowdown in economic performance growth.
The results are worse than analysts' estimates.
Most important events:
The Czech economy grew by 1.5 percent year-on-year in the third quarter of this year, but stagnated in a quarter of a year.
The German economy grew by 0.5 percent in the third quarter, according to preliminary and seasonally converted data.
The economy of both the euro area and the European Union grew by 0.2 percent between July and September compared to the previous quarter, in line with analysts' expectations.
The Greek economy declined by 5.2 percent year-on-year.
The yield on its 10-year bonds is at 28.45%.
Italian and Spanish bond yields are rising to critical borders.
The problems are also starting to be felt by Austria, the Netherlands, France, Belgium, etc...
Yields for Czech 10-year bonds are holding below 4%, even as the situation in the region is deteriorating.
There are voices from Germany that the ECB should be a lender of last resort.
The Czechs qualified for the EURO.
They won 1-0 in Montenegro and celebrate their 200 million promotion
The national football team has mastered the toughest task of the season!
In Montenegro, thanks to the great Czech and a beautiful goal, Petr Jiráček, she won 1-0.
Czech football, even with a large portion of luck in the second half, defended a luxurious lead from the home leg and will not miss the European Championship again.
IHNED.cz watched the postseason match in a detailed report.
Almost no excitement in the first half and a great deal of luck in the second.
The Czech national team, thanks to their home game in the end, the great Czech and hero Jiráček, won happily 1-0 in Montenegro and celebrate their progress to the European Championships.
The Montenegrin side, due to the precise defence of the Czech Republic, took the pressure in the second half.
The match's smofiers were Damyanovic and Vučinic, who scorched two big chances.
Thanks to the great Petr Cech, the Czech national team will not miss the European Championship next year, and a reward of around CZK 200 million will be added to the Czech football box office.
Ever since the opening minutes, there was a lot of fighting football.
Both teams found it difficult to get involved in the combination and were played mostly around the halfway line.
The pressure of the home footballers did not come in the first half either, as the Czech defence-seeked long pitches were a precision aloof.
Iranian students are prepared to die for their country's nuclear program.
Created a live shield
Several hundred undergraduates created a living shield around a nuclear object in Iran.
With their gesture, they want to express their country's support for their country's nuclear program ahead of a possible Israeli attack.
The students prayed in front of the premises at noon on Tuesday and then cheered the death of the US and Israel.
Several hundred students at universities in Isfahan, Iran, set up a living shield on Tuesday around Isfahan's Uranium nuclear technology center.
They are thus demonstrating that they are ready to defend their country's nuclear program with their lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) noted in its recent report that Iran did not appear to have stopped seeking a nuclear weapon.
A possible attack on Iran's nuclear facilities is being discussed in Israel.
Students prayed at the midday before entering the Ishahan nuclear facility and then cheering the death of America and Israel.
In the event of an attack designed to cripple Iran's nuclear program as much as possible, according to the Israeli press, the target, in addition to the Ishahanic center, the Natanz facility in which uranium is enriched would also be targeted.
The diets of the obese child: not eating and dinner sausages
More than a third of children aged 9 to 13 have overweight problems, with an oversized weight of 9 per cent of schoolchildren and 5 per cent of children obesent.
At the same time, the obese children tend to come from families with unhealthy lifestyles, as the current survey showed.
Once again, it is shown how important it is for the healthy development of a person to develop the environment in which he grows up and the patterns he is surrounded by.
For example, on tables at obese children, sausages appear up to half as often as they are in families of children with normal weight.
Fried fries had a dinner day before the research associated with an awareness-raising event called Obesity is no coincidence of more than 19 percent of the obese.
Fats are also not the habit of playing sports in families, but this applies to most families of today's schoolchildren - only 15 percent of children said that their parents would find time for active movement at least once a week.
Survey among 900 children
The survey was conducted at the end of last year's school year and was attended by nearly 900 primary school children from all over the Czech Republic.
It was the second year of the Obeze event is not a coincidence supported by the General Health Insurance Company and Unilever.
So far, more than 12,000 schoolchildren from 4th to 8th grades have joined the project.
Proper eating and getting enough exercise in the family is one of the determinants that is caused by the dramatically rising number of overweight or even obese children.
"Only half of those polled, for example, said that they had eaten five times a day in breakfast-svach-baby-lifour mode, which is one of the basic prerequisites for the right nutrition," reads one of the survey results.
No breakfast and sausage in the evening
Experts point out that relative details are also essential for healthy development, such as regular family breakfast time.
In the Czech Republic, only 23 percent of schoolchildren's families eat breakfast at the same time.
In most families, everyone eats breakfast alone.
And the worst was finding that a tenth of households did not eat breakfast at all.
Breakfast is the basis of a proper daily diet.
The questionnaire showed that unhealthy fries are much more likely to be consumed in the families of obese children.
Almost everyone - regardless of weight - drinks sugary lemonades every day (70 per cent).
While more than 40 per cent of surveyed children regularly play sports, the result was less than half - 15 per cent - for their parents.
Build your diet
Another part of the survey allowed selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to compile their own diet from the options on offer according to their own taste and self-awin opinion.
"The eating preferences of Czech children aged 12 to 15 are far from an ideal in terms of a healthy diet."
Among their favourite dishes are a lot of flour, meaty and sweet dishes.
"What is particularly alarming is the great popularity of sugary sodas," the final report on the survey reads.
For lunch as a main meal, pasta triumpkin prevailed just above the poultry.
But the children practically did not want the legumes at all, and the popularity of fish and midday vegetable dishes is also low.
A tendency to health
At the same time, the survey showed that children are willing to adjust their eating habits if they receive the right information.
"For the survey participants who completed the questionnaire after the end of the enlightening lecture Obesity, there has been a significant shift in preferences towards the principles of healthy nutrition in a number of cases," the results of the project read in the results of the project.
It was marvellous for fresh soda, for example, where more children would start to prefer plain water.
Children were also much more likely to tickle poultry and fish as the main meal of the day in the questionnaire, restricting sugary foods and dumplings.
Stylist must also be a good psychologist, pros say
In the opening article about how stylists learn, I complained a little bit that there was a lot in the opening hours.
I had no idea what was coming next.
Lectures in three pros in the field, dressing up problematic characters, and a seminar on how it goes on set.
And it gets worse.
The closer to the final exam, the more information and practical tasks await us.
And even though the course takes place every Saturday and Sunday, it is really "turned up."
This time, the director, Alice and I discussed (there's not a single boy in the course) to dress up a woman who doesn't have a perfectly-minded figure.
And the vast majority of them.
Someone has a short neck, someone has a boyish figure with no proper curves, and someone is overweight.
The stylist must know how to optically soften the broad shoulders, extend the neck or deliver the necessary curves.
We were given tips on how to make the Jennifer Lopez-type woman, the bigger breasts and hips and narrow waist, to give the character a nice and at the same time not to wear the woman too challengingly.
For example, if the difference between the waist and the hips is such that skirts or trousers really don't fit, then it's worth having at least one of those tailored pieces made.
You certainly won't regret it, because perfectly fitted clothing is priceless.
You will feel much better in a tailored skirt than in one that keeps moving, shining up, removing at the waist and the like.
The boy's character, in turn, can afford to wear laggers' clothing, apps, embroidery or pick-up.
Of course, there are many such information and character types, so I'm glad to have a whole week to sort out all the information in my head.
And I'm still worried that given the homework assignment, it's enough.
For each of the female attic had an assigned celebrity to invent two outfits: the day and evening.
We have to take into account the current look, the fashion style of the personality and the type of character.
I'll be "dressing" Mirand Kerr, you may know her from the Victoria's Secret campaigns.
In my mind's eye, for me I am certainly better than the kind of Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, who has gained perhaps a hundred pounds recently (take, please, into account hyperbole), or the young Selena Gomez.
We have to cut the clothes out of magazines or search the internet and print them out and then graphically process it.
The Moodboard, as the whole result is called, then expresses our personal style and relationship to the graphic representation.
Thinking about the graphic side of the styling is important as well.
The stylist not only nouns physically, but also creates, for example, so-called product pages in magazines (for specific entries, such as trendy handbags, coats, etc.).
This is what the stylist and designer Mario Kameník told us about.
But that's not until Sunday.
Stylist must have a general overview
Saturday's lecture packed with information about the types of characters was sparked by three industry guests.
Stylist Honza Pokorný, fashion designer Jakub Polanka and fashion photographer Ben Renč.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is illusion and a stylist should be able to take advantage of it.
And a skilled stylist can work with one piece of clothing in different ways.
Variability is crucial in this case.
For example, such a trench coat (or if you want originally trenchcoat) can be worn classically over jeans and a T-shirt like a cloak, but you can also dress it on the bare body, put on pumps and take pictures of it as a dress.
Or just roll up the sleeves or collars and the whole look looks different.
"Play with it," he emphasized.
But I most appreciated the following advice: "You need to know the rules perfectly for your work."
"Then you can start breaking them," Jakub said.
Finally, it is clear to me why we are crushing all the lessons, what to combine with, what to do with what, why, when, in fashion magazines, we sometimes see something else in fashion magazines.
Not to mention the shows.
Thanks to photographer Ben, I know that the stylist must have many more clothing options ready than they can take pictures.
So with the fashion story, which will be ten pages long, which will be ten pages long, I have to be ready to "grow around" at least fifteen.
And also that the clothing looks and works in the photo in a different way in combination with other pieces than in reality.
That is what we have to expect when creating the outfit.
That image and style sometimes do up to half the success was confirmed by Honza Pokorný.
Just look at Madonna, who is not exactly a miraculous singer, but her image and marketing have made her a world-class star.
In the Czech Republic, so far, access to the use of stylists' services is rather cold.
Even the familiar faces sometimes find it useless (it is enough that I can do something, the way I look at it is secondary).
And if someone has already created a styling from us, then we are to expect to be highly dictated to by a completely different (smaller) size than they really have.
Then we have to google and see if the tabloids were writing about the fact that the celebrity had grown/did shea and the like.
Both Honza and Mario were telling us on Sunday that it is not enough for the stylist to navigate fashion and be able to put together an outfit.
In his work, he primarily communicates with the people he dresses, and so it is important to be a good psychologist.
Being able to judge people, not to get in, to stand up for your opinion.
"When a manager orders you to sort her wardrobe and add nice pieces to her, you can't throw her out the whole closet and say, for God's sake, it's a nightmare."
"Find at least a few things that you praise and recommend what they can be worn for," says Mario.
He also specifically showed us what the so-called "placovka" or set bag must contain.
It's the one you turn around the waist and you have all the necessary propriety.
In addition to clear things such as scissors, a roller for hairs or closing pins, there is also a nylon thread (with which the stylist helps himself to take pictures of products such as handbags or hats), special clips to tap back of the outfit if it is larger (the pin or other clam is not allowed, they would damage the garment), or the sewing.
So we wouldn't just listen, but actually tried something practically, we learned how to get your shoe right.
Even when taking a photo shoot in a studio where the surface is flat, the sole could be damaged, let alone outdoors.
So we gobbled and glue.
We mustn't touch the shoes with scissors, so they don't accidentally get damaged.
So it takes really skill.
Mario was pleased when he complimented my creation without reservation.
The skill mentioned is really not my friend.
This is just a tiny fraction of what we listened to on the second year-long continuation of the course.
It's becoming clear to me that it's really not a cakewalk to styling at the professional level, no matter what anyone says what they want.
In Need for Speed: The Run, races are all over America.
Reviews
The initially carefree ride, due to a series of completely unnecessary lazy lazy errors, turns into a routine morning ride to the shift.
The ambition has been largely fulfilled, but it is no doing so that no one seems to want to do anything extra.
The new episode, subtitled The Run, attracted high expectations before it was released.
He promised that the years-long racing series Need for Speed would once again move a piece of the new direction, and from the playable previews he appeared to be a game that might not just be in the number of times in the genre of action racing.
We were also curious to see how the embedded passages would turn out, in which the main character gets out of the car and run his own way.
But, as is customary for the NFS series, much is a bit different in the end than we expected.
These are potentially decent arcade races, but the whole is drawn down by some unnecessary errors that have been appearing in the series for more or less several years.
So it's not really even mistakes, but rather a manifestation of some incomprehensible laziness of developers.
Adventure begins very well.
You are inducted into a story whose main character, Jack, has certain personal problems and is offered as a solution to participate in an illegal race across America.
Behind the wheel, you get on the West Coast in San Francisco, and your job is to arrive first in New York.
The idea entails several interesting elements.
The route is divided into ten stages, and then more than fifty races.
It follows that each race is run on a different track and the stages are set in different, sufficiently different and interesting environments.
It doesn't make you feel like the game would offer the same thing all the time.
In addition, some of the backgrounds are very pretty to look at, even though the technical level of the graphics is in line with the previous episodes of the series.
So it's not a big deal.
But driving across the desert, the autumn landscape or high in the snowy mountains feels visually very pleasant.
In addition, the races are made from time to time by some atypical element.
In the desert, for example, you get stuck in a sandstorm that reduces visibility considerably.
In the mountains, on the other hand, you have to be careful not to be swallowed by an avalanche.
Alongside this, the individual races are pretty well in a row.
There are only a few types of them, but that's enough.
For a while you try to overtake the required number of opponents (basically a classic race), then catch up again (a classic fight with stopwatch) and then there is a duel with a single opponent waiting for you.
The police will get involved from time to time, and the police, who make your whole effort even further unpleasant.
The new feature is the passages outside the car.
It's more just about the kind of interactive animation that Jack usually flees from someone and you have to help him do it by printing the right buttons in the right moments.
Nothing complicated.
But it is surprising that there are far fewer of these passages in the game than you would have expected (specifically, perhaps only three).
In the end, however, it is to the benefit of the cause, because this element has no chance of becoming annoying and, in the context of the above, thus ranks among the elements that make the game more interesting.
The driving model follows in the footsteps of previous episodes.
That means it's definitely not something these days, but you can't say it's a mess.
If you are looking for a realistic simulation, you will have to look elsewhere.
But the more acclaimed racing is still quite comfortable with the driving model here, even though we could find a better one with the competition.
So far, therefore, everything is in perfect order.
But problems are starting to emerge after a while.
Unlike the driving model, the model is not very well.
We don't expect a game of this type to calculate the complex deformities and collision, but when you have no idea before any crash into any object what your car will behave, then I guess it's not all right.
Typically, when overtaking or passing cars in normal traffic, you sometimes just lick each other easily, but at other times in an almost identical situation your car ends up in wild pirouettes.
Or even just fuck off.
Thanks to the reboots system, it doesn't particularly matter, but it will upset you reliably.
The reboggarts are designed so that if you smash up or go far out of the track, the game will throw you back to the last clue on the track.
But only five reboots are available in each race.
When you exhaust them, you have to start the race again from the beginning.
It is, therefore, more of an aid in case something goes wrong than to be able to rely on them in a downright way.
But sometimes even the reboots don't help, solving them only by having to learn the given section of the race from memory.
The big ailment of the game is that the same things often happen in the same places.
For example, some corners need to be driven in a specific way, otherwise you simply can't fit into them.
Other times, you will meet "civilian" cars at a given location in the same configuration whether you arrive there first, fifth, five seconds earlier or a minute later.
It will annoy especially in situations where you see the opponent in front of you easily driving between the two oncoming cars, while when you get there, the cars are already in such a position that you have to go around or slow them down.
It doesn't matter when you reach them, because it's "calculated" so that the situation always occurs just before your nose.
The rivals also have another advantage.
Throughout the play-off period, you will come across several places where, again, no matter what time, you are always overtaken by the same opponent in the same place.
The most it hits at the end of the game on a long bridge, where you're driving in the opposite direction.
The opponent must obviously get there in front of you at any price.
When he rides ahead of you, he makes you worse the overview of oncoming cars, so you probably get a nice little breakout there at first.
It is possible to understand the intention to make the game more exciting and adrenaline-fuelled, but the design is so obvious that it will quickly disgust you with it.
And it's a shame, because despite the simple driving model, the playing is fun and, in places, action so much that sometimes you literally can't keep track of where what flies.
And it doesn't really matter whether it's the credit of a concept with fifty unique tracks, gearing up races so that boredom doesn't have a chance or anything else.
An unconventional idea is to replace cars during the races.
You have to be careful of the gas stations by the roads, because that's where you can change the car, even though in the vast majority of cases you can make do with what you have right now.
The cars are divided into three categories.
Disputes are suitable for urban areas, heavy American highway-hillstick cars, and exotic supersports for technical riding, such as winding mountain roads.
With the main story mode goes hand in hand with the challenge mode, which are races in individual locations you know from the story.
Here you get not only medals, but also experience points in your profile, which is common to the challenges and the story.
For the driver's higher level, different items are unlocked: starting with the cars and ending with the background for the profile.
It is also again linked to the online feature Autolog, which, among other things, compares your achieved results with other players and provides additional community functions.
One of the other hard-to-understand kicks is the situation of the last race in the story.
With your car you will get to the metro tunnel (be) where you are in the dark to get to it on the tracks (be).
The speedometer is flashing the numbers between 150 and 200 km/h (let) and in this, the subway train comes in from behind and uncompromisingly scraps you.
In the newsroom, we'll probably still be able to hold discussions for a few more days about whether no one really thought at the game at the game or whether the authors think of us as really such a big jerks.
The technical side of the game is nothing extra, but at least the overall visual impression is very pleasant in most cases and in a few cases even great.
It freeze in some of the more tense imaging, in some cases, rather tragically.
But it mainly concerns demolitions with more participants, when smooth imaging would no longer be of any use to you.
The sound side is in order and the soundtrack is a matter of taste.
In an attempt to please the widest range of the younger audience, the soundtrack from the category "every dog a different village" was created, but it can be assumed that, in order to listen to music, the game will probably not be bought.
The overall impression of Need for Speed: The Run is thus highly embarrassed.
If the game were to avoid completely unnecessary errors, then we would not be afraid to say that The Run is the best part of the NFS in the last few years.
This is how the game feels unfinished.
Fun is certainly fine, but be prepared to be shattered to the eye by the power of the airport headlights.

Ambassador to the EU Vicen:
Czechs have a reputation for negativeists and Eurosceptics
"The Treaty of Lisbon has significantly upset the balance between the institutions."
"I didn't expect it to be such a tough war."
"It will take five, six years for the situation to stabilise a bit, calm down and before all the players get used to their new roles," Czech Ambassador to the European Union Ambassador to the European Union, Helena Vicen, began her lecture at the Faculty of Law.
In addition to the extent to which she takes her motto "Incliferably and understandably about Europe" was already pointed out in the first part of the lecture, when she managed to describe the various EU institutions and their relations in such a clear and comprehensible way that a number of lecturers from the Faculty of Law of Charles University could envide it.
Viceen also praised the work of the new European Council Permanent President Herman Van Rompuy:
"First there was criticism that it was bland, that he was a grey official, that he could not perform any role, and I have to say that everyone took the breath out of breath, that he had done well with the role."
"He is a man who can listen to the 27 or seven Member States, to communicate excellently with them, and have a clear vision of where the European Union should go."
The new post of High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy then explained in response to the question: 'Who is the European Union? Which phone number should I call?", that is, as a major step towards unification and more readability of the EU's policy towards states such as China or India.
No one wants to ban us from the whelks
Vice was also involved in the agenda that the European Council lived, lives and will live in the near future.
The previous year's Czech Presidency was described as a success.
The Czechs dealt with the incoming financial crisis, resolved the gas crisis or held a summit for the Eastern Partnership.
The fall of the government at this time was described as a major negative, which damaged the Czech Republic very badly.
The Czech representation in the EU is very busy at the moment.
In the words of the ambassador, "effectly a rush" was not only the Presidency, but also the ensuing financial crisis, which is still being addressed today.
In addition, the new seven-year Union budget has yet to be approved, which is being significantly complicated precisely because of the current economic situation.
Whether the budget will be slender and economical, which sectors will be preferred, which countries will be supported more and which are less likely to be on the agenda for future negotiations.
The ambassador also recalled her main slogans with which she came to Brussels: 'About Europe in plain English'.
"I really don't like ugly shortcuts, foreign words, lancers that no one understands.
How is a citizen to understand that there really are no curved or round cucumbers in Brussels, bananas of varying size, or that we really have to be banned from the whelks."
It also wants to make better use of the EU environment and to bring more Czechs to the European institutions.
We are in for a multi-speed Europe
According to the ambassador, the Czechs have a reputation for being Europeans and people who notice the negative rather than the positive aspects of the matter.
Moreover, it is annoyed by the low representation of Czechs in the European institutions.
A lot of factors are to blame, such as the modesty of our candidates, their inability to write motivational letters, but also low support from the Czech side.
In addition to the successful Czech Presidency, she highlighted the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Four.
"Believe me, when a Pole and a Hungarian come to me and a Slovak, the Frenchman next to me says, "Hey, what are you meeting there, what's your Visegrad Four again?" and they're not looking at it at all."
In the future, according to Vicen, the Union is mainly awaiting new tough rules on the budgetary policies of the Member States.
He sees the concept of a two-speed, if not multi-speed, Europe, rather than a new "European federation" more likely.
"We have eurozone countries and countries outside the eurozone."
"We have the space of Schengen, we already have an institute of enhanced cooperation."
"For the first time, it was said that only the countries they wanted and the ones they didn't want to work together to be standing by."
"There will be more of these institutes and it will be a strongly two-speed Europe," Vicenová expects.
In this respect, it also praised the role of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuy in the promotion of the principle that all the issues affecting the whole of the Union are to be discussed between all the Member States, not only between the euro area countries.
Brand story:
The IBM Inovator begins the second century of its existence
If someone were looking for a word that would most accurately express IBM's strategy, the closest thing to would probably be a "long-term nature."
For the general public, IBM is a symbol of the technological revolution, it is a company perceived as very contemporary, yet a century has passed since its inception.
The basis of this long-term nature was laid by the company's first chief executive, the visionary Thomas J. Watson Sr.
He's already coined the slogan that many of the world's problems can be easily solved if people are willing to think.
His slogan "Think!" was thus a print, around which the life of the future giant (as well as the name of the internal magazine, which began to be published at IBM in 1935).
It was also the basis of Watson's carefully constructed corporate culture.
"For us from IBM, long-term thinking means a continuous movement towards the future.
IBM survived and prospered for a century because it remained true to its basic values, not afraid to change everything else around it.
This allowed us to transform technology, business and society during our first century.
We hope to be able to achieve even more in the second hundred," the company's current director, Samuel J. Palmisano.
A sophisticated system
Watson approached the care of his employees in the 1930s in the same way as entrepreneur Bata in the Czech Republic - the people of IBM were one of the first U.S. employees with paid leave, insurance from the employer, plus an elegant employee uniform, and a sophisticated system to reward the best inventors and merchants alike.
The same elaborate long-term IBM has had a relationship with the customer.
The company was a genius at talent mining from the start - as one of the world's first companies, it eliminated any discrimination, so it could choose.
In line with the anti-discrimination strategy, the current plan is to be replaced by a woman - Virginia Rometty - at the head of IBM next year.
It has been with IBM for 30 years, and has so far held the position of Chief Sales, Marketing and Strategy.
In recent years, IBM has been doing so-called jams, online brainstorming, which arouse many future strategies and innovations.
No wonder there are enough ideas - there are nearly half a million people working at the company.
Institution with a good name
The firm's firm position in the business is provided by its strong internal and external image.
"From the beginning, IBM had the concept of the institution rather than just a technology company," Harvard Business School and author of the book, told the Economist, an IBM book by the author, Rosabeth Moss Kanter.
"IBM is not a technology company, but a company that helps solve business problems using the technology," added George Colony of the consulting firm Forrester Research.
As the company itself says, it is a difference between entering the market and thus creating the market outright.
IBM - or "The Great Blue," as it has famously dubbed it for its logo in the United States - has grown into one of the world's largest companies in a century.
It is perhaps the most versatile technology company - developing hardware and software, infra-purstructure, hosting and consulting services in the range of products from media outlets to nanotechnology.
It holds the most patents of any U.S. technology company, and five of its employees won the Nobel Prize.
Her invention includes an ATM, a debit card, a financial swap, a barcode or a floppy.
IBM, with some $220 billion, became the second-largest technology company by market capitalization (the first is Apple) this year, having overtaken Microsoft for the first time since 1996.
View forwards
Not all products and innovations hit the taste of customers and times - for example, IBM failed to bet on its own OS/2, Prodigy's online services or the IBM PCjr computers.
"If your business is built on moving forward, you can't attach yourself emotionally to the past," says Samuel J. Palmisano.
That's why IBM has no problem building its foundations on many platforms - and if they don't work, leave them.
Unlike, say, a rival Microsoft, which basically stands and falls on the Windows operating system.
Perspective technology
Services accounted for the largest share of IBM's sales, with software and hardware accounting for about a fifth of them.
As recently as 1990, he was the strongest representative of the hardware with more than half a share.
Since 2000, IBM has sold $15 billion worth of low-yielding assets, investing $58 billion over the same period to buy prospective technologies.
Investment has continued since 2008, when the modern financial crisis swept the world for the first time.
IBM is acting according to the legacy of its first chief, Thomas J. Watson, who also increased investment during the Great Depression.
So far, IBM seems to be going through the current crisis intact.
IBM's share price has risen by a rocketrum of 120 percent since the beginning of 2008, while the company's net profit is steadily increasing.
IBM's corporate password is to change everything, just your values.
It can therefore be expected that even if there is another crisis, this flexible giant can handle it.
IBM history: From cheese slices to space flights
IBM (International Business Machines) was founded in New York a century ago, originally called Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
It did not take over the name IBM until 1924 - originally a brand used for the company's branches in Canada and South America.
The basis for the later IBM was given by the merger of four firms whose history dates back to the eighties of the nineteenth century.
They owned technology such as the famous "sticks," the clock recording the staff's arrival and departure.
The architect of the new firm was businessman Charles Ranlett Flint, who also chaired the company's supervisory board until 1930.
Flint hired the head of rival firm, Thomas J. Watson to help him run the company.
The leader then overshadowed IBM's founder - Watson's ideas are still built on the unbeatable corporate culture and identity.
Watson ran the company until 1952.
IBM, as its name suggests, began with the production and sale of all sorts of machines for business - from meat and cheese slices to cash registers.
In the first four years that Watson headed the company, turnover doubled to $9 million and the company's widespread expansion into all continents began.
Watson was so indispensable for the company that after nearly forty years in the chief executive chair, he was succeeded by his son, Thomas Watson Jr.
Under his leadership, IBM began work on the development of artificial intelligence, developing the first programming language.
In the 1960s, people and computers from IBM helped NASA manage space flights to Merkur, Saturn, and, in 1969, the famous human flight to the moon.
Meanwhile, in 1964, IBM developed the first computer family - the IBM System/360, series.
The classic "Pécé," which established the computer standard of the time, called the IBM 5150 came on the market in 1981.
Twenty years later, IBM sold computer production to the Chinese company Lenovo, on the contrary, it bought the consultant part of PricewaterhouseCoopers and began to devote itself to high-valen value-added consultancy and services.
The strategy that has paid off for the past three years by IBM is the Smarter Planet concept, the "smarter planets."
It aims to make smart use of technology in hitherto or not planned areas and to improve the situation in, for example, transport or urban management.
For the trade sector, IBM recently introduced the "Smarter Commerce" platform, which helps traders manage the entire commercial cycle.
IBM also has a strong history in the Czech Republic.
She founded her branch in what was then Czechoslovakia in 1932 as the first country in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, in addition to IBM, the Czech Republic also operates a strategic outsourcing centre in Brno.
The Central and Eastern Europe Centre is based in Prague and there is also a world-class research team dedicated to voice recognition.
Rychtářová on the unfaithful husband:
Iveta, you don't want the donkey, I don't want it!
Darina Rychtářová (53) said the end!
After her husband Josef Rychtář (53) became not only the protector of Iveta Bartošová (45), but also the lover, Darina still hoped that Joseph would wake up from the pink dream and come home.
But now he has no intention of waiting, and she has laid clear rules for the next life.
"Pepa can come home, but not as my partner," Rychtářová explained.
When Darina Rychtářová granted asylum to Bartošová in her home in the summer, she did not seem to dream how her marriage would end in the end.
Despite the fact that Iveta moved out of Říčany at her insistence after 30 days, Pepa did not leave the singer.
He even publicly admitted that he loved her.
Over time, Darina resigned, had taken a forging from her husband's relationship, and now even said goodbye to him forever.
Quickly doesn't care who his wife sleeps with
If the speedster and Bartošová had broken up once, his wife's open arms would not be waiting for him at home.
"He is the biological father of my sons, and if he wants to live to see his life in our shared house, no one will expel him."
"However, he will live through it not like my beloved, stray old donkey, but as a person with whom I have certain ties," Rychtářová said, noting that she has already disengaged her husband and insists only on mutual decency.
Josef doesn't mind the fact that Darina had closed his back door.
"I respect the wife's decision."
"I will be with Iveta, and I will not change it."
"My wife set up a paper marriage, and I respect that."
"The company goes on, I take care of the repairs, the garden, the property, I buy."
'Daina and I talk perfectly normally, only we don't share a bed,' said the Quickwalker.
If the speedster also found a new love, she said, she would not stop her.
"We don't sleep together, and I don't care where he's going, who he's going with, and if he has a friend.
I know it's my fault, I fell in love with Iveta and I take all the responsibility," Josef concluded.
Worst female bad habits: Do they concern you?
If you ask men if they could list any typical female habits, as a rule, they all get them out of their sleeve very promptly.
Dear women, do you know each other in the following lines, where are listed by several female bad habits who can completely pump up men's blood in their veins?
Shopping
Does your other half blame you for being addicted to shopping?
Do you have to buy at least one cloth a week?
Do you like to shop and collectively at discounts?
Then, in your case, you can talk about shopping as a bad habit.
Some women are aware that they should restrain their buying passion at least a little.
But tell me, which would resist just taking it in the clothes shops, looking for well-fitting tops, and then try them all (ideally in different colours) in the stalk?
While shopping is a hobby for most women, it can literally become a hell of a man.
Just remember how many times you've told yours to wait for you in front of the entrance...
Constant dissatisfaction
"I'm not too fat?"
"I need to lose at least five kilos - should I start exercising?"
"Do you like me at all?"
Don't these sentences remind you of anything?
Isn't it?
Then you're one of those women who's obsessed with the way they look.
Not that you should stop taking care of yourself, but a lot of men are downright allergic to the way their partners complain about their appearance all the time.
The stronger sex also agrees that the more the frequency of this complamic is, the more annoying women become.
Order and cleanliness first
It's like an endless carousel.
Window grease, vacuuming, mopping the paving, dust wiping, scrubbing the tub - at least twice a week.
Do you blame your partner for stepping on the clean paving, the children, for getting the scrubbed sink dirty and curing the glassing living room with which you've been polishing?
In case you suffer from this "distraction," try to realize that nothing should be exaggerated, and order and cleanliness should definitely not become the first place within the family.
This harmless desire for purity may jeopardize your relationship with each other and your family well-being.
The sifting
"Get the used shorts in the trash."
"Are you going to wear those old socks tomorrow, too?"
"Why, wet towel doesn't belong on the ground."
If you dig into your partner like this several times a day, know that you can so reliably piss him off.
Of course you don't mean any harm, you want to make sure everything is in order.
Maybe if the men knew, the women wouldn't have had to dig that much...
The slandering, the gossip
For some women, gossip, gossip, as well as insulting and associating against someone are also their own.
Women are focused on relationships, so they like to discuss with each other things like who, where, with whom, how and why.
Perhaps each of us will release a little harmless gossip or a gossip here and there.
Hand on heart, it's inherent in perhaps all women.
But the opposite is the gossip of the grossest grain, which they like to gossip and often gossip, perhaps despis each, and are particularly dangerous to their surroundings - especially within the female working team.
Jagr and Voracek helped with assists to win Philadelphia
Hockey forward Jaromir Jagr was instrumental in Monday's NHL game with two assists in Philadelphia's 5-3 win at Carolina and is again at the forefront of the Czech players' productivity in the competition.
The 39-year-old star's review was mined both times by Claude Giroux, who added one more pass and was named the game's best player.
Two assists in the match were also recorded by Jágrův's teammate Jakub Voracek.
After the match, Jagr told overseas journalists that he had predicted Giroux a big night.
"I told him before the game that he'd score a hat-trick."
"I felt it."
'Sometimes that feeling comes over,' said Jagr, after whose action Giroux scored a goal from the Flyers' first shot.
Moments later, the team's second hit also had a Czech footprint.
Voracek fought the puck behind the Hurricanes' goal and presented it between the rings to the scoring Maxim Talbot.
A second before the first break, home player Patrick Dwyer dropped the break, but the start of the second part was again the Flyers.
Specifically to the Giroux.
After working with Jagr, he scored the third goal, then his shot was converted by a runner-up in the fourth goal by Wayne Simmonds.
"I love to play with him."
"I don't want to say he's the best player in the league, but he's definitely one of the top three," said Jagr of his center.
"I never thought I'd play with a hockey player like him at the end of my career."
"I'm happy about that."
"I want to play him."
"All those years in the NHL, my teammates were trying to play me, now it's turning to it," added Jagr.
Carolina made the game a drama, with a goal from Tuom Ruutu, and again Dwyer, who broke through on the penalty spot, came within one goal.
But another complication was not made by Matt Read, who finished outnumbering two to one.
"He did well to intervene in our Pronger zone."
"He punched the puck, and I got speed and (Read) drove to the far more distant pole."
"I tried to hit him and I'm glad it worked out," Voracek said, describing the last goal of the game from his point of view.
Philadelphia was in the top of the Eastern Conference with a victory.
Czech Montreal defender Jaroslav Špaček missed the game against Buffalo, withdrew in the second period due to an upper-body injury.
Candiens lost a two-goal lead in addition to the experienced back and lost after a penalty shootout 2-3.
One of their raids was not converted by Tomas Plekanec.
The home coach was more aggrieved than by the missed points, with only five defenders finishing the game.
"It's bad."
"We only played the game with one experienced player, the rest were youngsters."
"But there's just nothing we can do about it, we have to deal with it," Jacques Martin said.
"The rotation alternation was on us and we couldn't resist."
"We should have simplified the game more, moving the puck out of our zone."
We had gaps in that," added one of the defensemen P. K. Subban.
Czech goaltender Ondřej Pavelec scored 30 saves for Winnipeg in a 5-2 win over Tampa Bay.
The Jets' goals, which broke a five-game losing streak, were shared by five different scorers.
How tour prices have evolved since 1989
Until 1989, only five state travel agencies were allowed in Czechoslovakia at the time: Čedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist.
Travel agencies at the time were overwhelmingly selling only trips to the socialist bloc countries, as travel to the west was very restricted.
Czech tourists thus travelled on holiday to the sea to the GDR (German Democratic Republic), the Soviet Union (Sochi in Crimea off the Black Sea), Bulgaria, Romania (both to the Black Sea) and Hungary (the Balinathon).
The bright exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, when there was a chance to travel to Yugoslavia, but then the Yugoslav regime went to the West and the trips of Czech tourists to Yugoslavia were subsequently very limited.
The great paradox of the time of socialism was that the citizens of the socialist bloc (i.e. also the Czechoslovaks) were not allowed to travel individually freely even within socialist countries.
In case a citizen of Czechoslovakia wanted to travel individually to, for example, Poland or the Soviet Union, he needed an invitation letter from this country, otherwise an individual path was not possible.
Travel agents at the time also offered tours to the West, but it was necessary to queue up overnight with a sleeping bag or have "good acquaintances" in the travel agency.
Even so, it was not won.
The so-called foreign exchange pledge, which was a condition for travel to the West, was not given to "politically unreliable people" who thus could not travel at all.
The Czechoslovak currency was not a freely convertible currency, so without a foreign exchange promise it was not possible to raise funds (the Western currency) to travel to the West.
However, the most often Czechs vacationed in the Czech Republic, resulting in a large number of cottages that Czechs acquired and this custom is still alive today.
Travel by the Czechs has thus experienced a real revolution since 1989.
While until 1989 holidays in the GDR or Bulgaria were our maximum, last year the Czechs spent 4.5 million holidays abroad in the countries around the world.
The huge paradox, which we are no longer aware of today, is that it was not possible to travel freely to us in the most popular Croatia for us at the moment, as it was part of what was then Yugoslavia.
Early in the 1990s, the visa requirement was lifted to neighbouring Western European countries, triggering a huge wave of short-term visits to Vienna and Germany, in particular.
For a long time the Czechoslovaks could not get enough trips to the West, everyone wanted to at least take a look for a while.
In Paris, for example, tours of Czechs in parks in tents slept, as our income at the time did not allow us to pay for a hotel or a guesthouse.
A typical feature of Czechs' travel at this time was to drive their own food, canned, salami, etc. to save money.
Another important moment was the introduction of a freely convertible Czech crown, which our tourists were finally able to buy the Western currency freely after many weeks of flight.
However, our standard of living, and with it, average salaries have risen, resulting in another important moment around 1997.
Thanks to the increased demand for travel, travel agents have regularly started to prepare tours with charter air links since 1997, making air tours incredibly cheaper to contract volume discounts compared to the past.
By the end of the 1990s, the Czechs already had visa-free travel to virtually all developed countries of the world, except the US, which continued to make our travel easier.
Another interesting moment in the history of post-revolutionary travel came as soon as 2000, when thanks to considerable demand, the first direct charter flight to exotica was dispatched from the Czech Republic, it was to Thailand.
From this year onwards, direct charters fly out with Czech tourists to warm far-off countries, this winter will be flown directly from the Czech Republic to twelve exotic destinations.
Exotic countries are currently visited by around 100,000 Czechs a year!
Another interesting moment in this period, which symbolizes our post-revolutionary development, came in 2008.
On November 17, 2008, the US revoked visas for Czech tourists, and thus our country was finally among the most advanced countries in the world.
In 2008, for the first time in history, Czechs also spent more than half of their holidays abroad (50.3%) and spent more than 15,000 on one foreign holiday for the first time in their history, including the cost of the whereabouts. CZK per person.
The general meeting is to find the chairman, but again the stalemate is imminent
Czech football is without a chairman for almost five months and there is a risk that the successor to Ivan Hašek at the head of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FACR) will not be known even after another extraordinary general meeting that will take place on Thursday in Nymburk.
There is still no agreement on which the electoral code will be followed.
Without it, there will be no vote on which of the three candidates will be elected.
The interest of leading Czech football is to Jindřich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Paclík.
Hasek resigned in June and, as he left, urging colleagues to unite and find a strong figure to lead football in the future.
But in the post-Hass era, football slipped back to the fight between the two Solarian chambers, which could not agree on a common candidate.
This was fully demonstrated on 16 September, when the new chairman was to be chosen.
Delegates to the general meeting to the National House in Prague in Smíchov in Smíchov were swapped in vain, as the negotiations remained blocked and it was not just a matter of choice.
There was also no consensus on who has the right to actually vote for the pile - whether only statutory representatives or even officials credentials.
There has been a partial consensus on this one point since then, helped by a recommendation from the Constitution for the State and the law according to which representation on the basis of a power of attorney is not possible.
But there are still controversies over the Electoral Code.
It has not been very clear about the situation that has not been brought to the situation by the Executive Committee, which is already dealing with virtually nothing else at its meetings, whether regular or extraordinary.
The view of the choice has changed several times, but the neuralgic point is still the same.
The question is: how to proceed in the 3rd round to eliminate the possibility of a heel?
"The dispute is whether to proceed in accordance with the statutes or to find another model," said one of the three vice-presidents of the FACR, Dušan Svoboda, who represents professional football in the association's leadership.
According to the statutes of the proposed model in the third round, the candidate who will have more percentage support in the chamber for which he is running will win.
Moravia is reportedly willing to take a concession to win a candidate who receives a higher total of the votes from both chambers.
And the Czech side advocates the condition that the winner must get at least a two-thirds advantage in this percentage count.
"But then it would make sense of the two previous rounds, that would completely negate the bicameral concept," the Freedom Party of Moravian understands, according to which it would be best to disown the order and to vote according to the current statutes.
Tomáš Paclík agrees with this, somewhat surprisingly, even though it is estimated that the statutes set by the electoral code suits Pelt the most of all the candidates.
"I wish to be chosen at most according to the statutes."
"So that some proxy nonsense doesn't come up as at the last general meeting," said the owner of Viktoria Plzen, who is running for the first time and in his comments he defined himself primarily against Pelt.
Pelta remains optimistic.
In Nymburk, he said, the new chairman will be known and believes the candidates will work constructively together in the future.
"All passions will be reassured by the national team's eventual progression at the European Championships today."
"Football will be on a happy streak again, there will be more willingness to cooperate," says the Jablonec official, who has the most experience in managing football at both professional and regional level in the three.
Rajhl is more restrained.
"I hope for a deal, but unfortunately the situation is very ambivalent."
"This is not between people from Bohemia and Moravia, but there are efforts to purposefully adapt the regulations."
"This may cause the blocking of the general meeting to happen again."
"I hope, however, that common sense will prevail," said Rajchl.
There is little time left for the agreement of all parties.
Some of the negotiations were supposedly to take place directly in Montenegro, but who knows whether the football generalism will be complete by the match.
The aerial special, in which the vice-presidents Dalibor Kučera and Rajchl, among others, were to travel to Podgorica, did not leave Prague in the morning due to a technical malfunction and a replacement option was sought for part of the Executive Committee to the venue of the barrage retaliation.
In the end, a ministerial-level meeting that may be reportedly on Wednesday will be crucial.
The Minister of Education, Youth and Sports, Josef Dobeš, would like to get the ambivalent parties within the country's strongest sports association to agree.
There is a lot in play: state subsidies, the credibility of football, as well as the forthcoming general meeting of ČSTV, which will address the new direction of Czech sport after Sazka's financial problems.
Paclík goes to battle for the chairman because he doesn't see a suitable candidate
Had the head of Pilsen, Tomáš Paclík, the head of the football team, had seen a strong candidate before the extraordinary general meeting who would have fulfilled all his ideas about the new chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FACR), he would not have entered into the fight for the top job.
"If there is a quality adept, I'm fighting for him and I'm not going to the poll."
"But in the current situation, no one like this has been found," Paclík told the Czech Press Agency.
In the fight with Miroslav Pelta and Jindřich Rajchl, Paclík is driven by motivation for Pelt, the alleged favourite to the election, to try to stop him from going to the head of the FACR.
Paclík also stresses that if he were to win, he would only last until 2013, when a full general meeting is on the agenda.
In the position, he would like to see, in the long run, he would like to see an experienced and top-notch manager who is not very attached to football events.
"I have spoken to some of the people who would be considered."
"It was crazy for me when some said that at the moment they didn't even want to identify with Czech football."
"I would like to change that view," he said.
Paclík is said to be most bothered by Pelt's association with the chairman of the Pilsen Regional Football Association, Roman Berbre, a man with a controversial reputation behind the scenes, who is known at the backstage as a powerful lobbyist with the ability to influence the delegate's vote at the general meeting.
It is so unacceptable for Paclík to stand in the chairmanship position.
"If he won, the status quo will be mothballed and nothing would move forward in football."
"In combination with the support of Berbro, who is a skilled businessman, it would not benefit football even more," Paclík said.
He also alludes to the fact that Pelt's name was mentioned years ago in the wiretaps in the investigation of the corruption affair, but from which Pelta went unpunished.
"I don't know the prestige of football's victory for Pelt."
"And as we would look in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA," said Paclík, who is also taking in his former statement with perspective that he would "sell the Pilsen club if Pelta became chairman."
But if Paclík triumphed in Thursday's election, he could imagine future cooperation with Pelta.
So is another candidate, Rajchl, whom Paclík supported before the September general meeting, which ended in a fiasco.
"He (Pelta) would be the first person I'd go to."
"He has great abilities."
"I could imagine him as head of the national team."
"But he couldn't manage the association managerially."
"I also don't stick my nose where I can't do it," said Paclík, who drew a lot of attention in September by the fact that he was behind the dismissal of the referees' committee headed by Ludek Macela, who was replaced by Dagmar Damk.
Paclík says he would dare to run the association.
He refers to his skills from managing private companies, and since last summer he has also headed Pilsen, which celebrated its premier league triumph with its support in May.
"I have the strength to make a difference in the football environment, to contribute to a certain cultivation of it."
"To limit the influences of some interest groups, which need to be influenced by the Disciplinary and Appeal Board, which goes all the way to disgusting situations," said Paclík, who makes no secret of his antipathy to Spartan boss Daniel Křetínský, for example.
He would also consider one of the priorities to be the strengthening of the relations between the FACR and the Czech Olympic Committee, with which he would lobby for political leaders to receive more money from the lottery tax in the sport.
"It's one of the key things the new chairman should be addressing."
"If gambling is taxed, as the political parties declare, then I understand their arguments, but they have to be honest where the money will go," he noted.
As a burden, Paclík now takes no connection to the Pilsen club, although he claims that the chairman of the FACR should be "partisan" "parties".
Pelta is again connected with Jablonec, Rajchl with Prague's Dukla.
"It's not ideal."
"But I do not see the point of translating to someone hypocritically transferring their shares in the Pilsen club and returning there in a year and a half," said Paclík.
Pelta promised new FACR statutes to rule out electoral stalemate
Two days before the Football Association's general meeting, one of the candidates for chairman, Miroslav Pelta, promised to work in the event of election to give the FACR new statutes that would ultimately rule out disputes over the electoral code in the future.
Jablonec's official is an optimist before Thursday's meeting in Nymburk and believes that the election battle will significantly dampen the potential success of the football team today.
Pelta had already promised before the September non-reduced election that he intended to concentrate on the representation and fundraising in the event of election.
He decided to go to the election before the previous general meeting at the last minute, so a two-month delay could be useful for him to defend his ideas about the football management and present him in a broader context.
"People at all levels have been doing football for a long time and expect the chairman to be known on Thursday."
"It feels it is high time for someone to lead the association," says the man, who is mainly associated with the Jablonec club, but who served for many years in Sparta and the executive committee of the union.
That is also why he believes he has enough experience to manage Czech football.
He believes that behind the current problems with the election is the euphoria that prevailed during the reign of Ivan Hasek.
"Unfortunately, at the June General Assembly, the statutes were approved that were not as perfect as everyone thought."
"If they didn't allow different interpretations, we'd had the chairman since September," Pelta pointed out.
It was the reworking of the most important document of the civic association that he conceived as a decoy to the delegates.
"If I become chairman, I will take it as a personal task, and I am willing to take personal responsibility if I fail."
"It's a principled thing without which we can't be," says Pelta.
He says he's trying not to define himself against his rivals.
He had previously announced that he could envisage working with Jindřich Rajch, whom he recognizes because of his legal training, and he knows well that his opponent would be his first vice-president.
He did not attack Tomas Paclík for a long time, who, on the other hand, did not leave the thread dry on Pelt.
"He's been in football for a little over a year, he's had some successes."
"But his attacks were undignified, and he caught a lot of people off guard by the election campaign."
"That is why many of them now doubt his true character," he said in the opposition's address Pelt, who is said to remain true to the proclamations he announced in September.
His strongest weapon, he says, is knowledge of football from the lowest competitions to the national team.
This should be a showcase for football.
"And I would also try to end all affairs starting with the Bohemians case or the repercussions of last year's corruption scandal."
"Far on the moment, I would have gone to a meeting with the private and state sectors to secure enough money for the whole of football," the 46-year-old candidate told the Czech News Agency two months ago.
He also promised at the time that his arrival at the top of football would not mean any personnel purges.
"I would first have to familiarize myself with the duties of individual employees," he said to Strahov, where there is an understandable nervousness from the long limp.
Despite the current catastrophic scenarios surrounding the forthcoming general meeting, he believes that delegates will not go to Nymburk for nothing on Thursday.
"If the only point of contention is how you vote in the third round, we can get over it."
"Frenchball needs credibility, and he will gain that only by finally having his leader again," Pelta remains optimistic two days before the perhaps decisive day of his functionary career.
Rajchl promises that under him, FAČR would start working hard
If the current vice-chairman, Jindřich Rajchl, had been elected the new chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic at the general meeting on Thursday, many people in the association would not be pleased.
In fact, Rajchl promises that work will start to work hard in the event of his election.
It wants to push for systemic changes and make the executive committee members responsible for the various football areas.
He also promised to solve the Bohemians case, improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, bring more money to football and continue the work started by the previous chairman, Ivan Hašek.
"As chairman, I would like to devote myself to football as a whole."
"From international contacts with UEFA and FIFA to national team, professional football, performance football to youth."
"But I am not saying that I did everything myself," Rajchl said in an interview with the Czech News Agency.
"I am a team player and I want to distribute the competencies on the executive committee so that each member will devote to a certain area."
"And I'll be giving away hardwork to make football a mile ahead in each of this segments."
"I don't think it would make people happy because work would start to work really hard and not just criticize the work of others," he added.
Because of the critical atmosphere in the football movement, he said he had considered not running for office again.
"I'm known to do 20 hours a day."
"But I need to know that it will make sense and that I won't have people behind me who will constantly throw sticks in my way and question my every move," he said, explaining why he hesitated.
"But many people told me I couldn't give up, because then others would give up."
"This is a trust that I cannot just throw away," he said.
He is also motivated by the continuation of the work he began with Hasek.
"A great deal of work has been done over the past two years, and I don't want to throw it away now."
"There are trials that will have a reverberation for a few years, and I would not like to be stopped by someone," he said with fear that if another candidate, Miroslav Pelta, if the election of another candidate, Miroslav Pelta, the situation on the union could return to a time before Hashk.
"I believe in systematicity, and that's the kind of thing I don't think Mirek Pelt can do."
"First of all, there are people who would do football in a way that would only be for the elect."
"A lot of things can be blamed for me, but certainly not that I sideline someone."
"I'm trying to be objective."
"I want to do football for everyone, because then everyone will be fine and not just the chosen ones," Rajchl said.
He also refutes the claim that he would only be the Czech chairman.
"Although some people are trying to say otherwise, I plan to do my best for Moravia."
"For example, it is time to consider that the second league would be divided into the Czech and Moravian parts, the winners of which would go to the first league."
"It would not be such a current situation where there are only three Moravian units in the league, which is a problem towards the young players in Moravia," said Rajchl.
As the head of the Pilsen club, Tomáš Paclík, joined the fight for the chairman, he does not dare to estimate his chances of being elected.
"But I still feel strong support in the Czech Chamber, which elected me as its vice-chairman and sees that there are clear successes behind me," said Rajchl, who considers saving tens of millions of crowns for unfavourable contracts, the negotiation of televised contracts and negotiations on the lottery law for his achievements.
On the contrary, he takes for complicity that the union does not pull together.
While he claims to be "discredited from returning the trust to Czech football," the second of his opponents, Paclík, considers him a strong candidate who has much to offer football.
"No one can dispute that he did a great job in Pilsen that year."
"If he'd been elected, he'd be going ahead with the things that Ivan Hasek started, and he wouldn't have changed the staffing in the commissions."
"He wouldn't want to twist it to his advantage," Rajchl says.
Europe's most beautiful swimming pools
Jump to the blue
Julia Stanek
The paddling from the point of view of Ufono, a sumptuous swimming pool in Budapest: Whoever travels through Europe can experience his blue miracle - and after exploring the cities or travelling to let his tired legs rest in the thermal spa.
The book will show where the wellness is the most beautiful by the water.
As Iris Meder set out for the voyage of discovery in the past one and a half years, her luggage was not to be missed: her swimsuit.
Lying on the water, she looked up at the artistically formed dome, swam across from the marble putti (I'm building a little naked boy, a child (with wings)) waiting for her at the edge of the pool and admiring the carefully restored Art Nouveau swimming pools.
If she liked the swimming pool, she carried it into her notebook in an instant - even with the remarkable details of the building's way of building and history.
More than 200 swimming pools were explored in this way by the architecture historian Meder and now present them in her just-released book "Badefreuden (Junkage: People's swimming pools in Munich, the historic palace of swimming pools in the Schwarzwald,"Thevrd Corest Culture of Concrete Construction" in Taunus.
13 countries ran it with its "Tourney to the most extraordinary spa in Central Europe": Alongside Germany, Austria and Switzerland, it visited locations in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland - and one city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
The 46-year-old German is a true enthusiast of swimming culture.
It doesn't go too far with the sport, says Meder - it's only different in the water.
The only thing to say about anger is that swimming fans have to settle for blue tiles and the smell of chlorine, while runners can inhale the intoxicating scent of spruce forests or listen to the hilarious chatter of the birds in the park.
"One day I asked why the swimming pools must always be so ugly," says the living Mrs. Meder, in Vienna.
"So I started collecting nice swimming pools."
Water level doubles architecture
The splash in the jumper pool and the essential oil for the sauna - the well-being factor is therefore so great that it affects all the senses, so much Mrs. Meder.
And when the founders tried, the swimming pools can be a real eye-pasting: "You have a water surface in the spa instead of the floor."
"It's both transparent, but on the other hand it reflects the beauty of the entire building."
Everything is visually doubled: a tall vault, a colourful tiara, a diving boards.
The Maloformat Picture Volume "Badefreuden (Badefreuden's Bathness)" provides in 190 pages with everything to be known about the architectural and cultural history of historical wellnes - but above all, it inspires the desire to jump into the blue.
The remarkable specimens were discovered by the collector of the swimming pool, Ms. Meder, in her search in Hungary.
In addition to the beautiful healing spa, like the 100-year-old Széchenyi spa in Budapest, it found nitrate-containing water in the original karst cave (the jeskyna spa in Miskolc-Tapolca) as well as the thermal baths, whose pools are filled with alkaline water and are placed in the shape of a bottle in the shape of a bottle (Városi Termálfürdö in Jászberény).
A beautiful spectacle, on the other hand, is offered by many heated open-air swimming pools in Switzerland and Austria. While you can see the whole city from the Zurich's Prestery swimming pool, you can take the outdoor swimming pool of the spa in St. Anton look at the snow-covered Arlberg - and: There is a window in the steam baths from which to watch the traffic on the ski slope.
Perhaps the most remarkable swimming pool design is expected for spa guests in Längenfeld: Aqua Park Ötztal looks like a ufo that has just landed in the Alps.
From the three uped open pans in winter, the steam rises as it rises to the sky in the background of Mount Ötztal.
Alhambra in Schwarzwald
Not in every swimming pool, the pool collector, was climbing the smell of chlorine into her nostrils.
Many of the thermal baths are felt after the sulphur, in the Arpad Spa in Békescsab, Hungary, it smells of fuel oil to the point where one hardly believes that you have made it to the healing spa.
The smell comes from healing water containing alkaline hydrodenubes, which is almost black and whose sediment clings to the skin as soon as one slips into the pool - a rather special wellness experience.
However, one place was also disappointed by Iris Meder in her search for a nice spa: When she wanted to visit the Czech solar and climate spa Luhačovice, she came across the enclosed terrain.
In 1902, the architect Dušan Jurkovič's designed spa was closed in the meantime.
When Mrs. Meder looked at the crumbling windows of the red-and-yellow Art Nouveau building, she saw the weeds between the tiles grow massively.
The pauses, on the other hand, were set up in the magic swimming pool at the Schwarzwald: the Palais Thermal in Bad Wildbad.
These spas have already had three phases of construction; one can discover not only the Neo-Romanesque elements that come from their creation in 1844, but also the Moorish Alhambra-style hall, which was connected around r. 1900.
Since the meticulous modernisation of 1995, Palais Thermal has been a popular spa place for the swimming pool connoisseur Ms. Iris Meder, and not only because he comes from the Schwarzwald.
"It's already a feat, combining such a variety of building styles in such a beautiful complex," says Ms Meder.
At such a palace, immersion in a thermal pool is apparently a fringe issue.
Agricultural speculation
Deutsche Bank to be vetted by commodity deal
Christian Teevs
Is Deutsche Bank leaving its trade in agricultural raw materials?
According to SPIEGEL-ONLINE, Josef Ackermann commissioned a working group to investigate the consequences of speculation for the poor world.
Then, in January, the chief executive of the concern wants to draw the consequences.
Hamburg -
For federal citizens, the issue is clear: 84% of Germans consider it unacceptable, according to one study, for banks to speculate with agricultural raw materials such as wheat or corn.
Indeed, two-thirds of those surveyed demand that Deutsche Bank and other credit institutions pull out of the deal because it exacerbates the problems of the poorest world.
This is the result of the Forsa poll under the authority of the consumer organisation Foodwatch.
The study relies on a report presented by Foodwatch in mid-October.
In it, the author, Harald Schumann, shows that betting on global commodity exchanges is driving prices up high and banks are therefore complicit in the world's problem of hunger.
The Consumer Defenders' Campaign is specifically directed at Deutsche Bank chief executive Josef Ackermann, although large bans such as Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley are also acting similarly.
Initially, commodity betting was intended to insure traders against price fluctuations.
But in the meantime, most experts agree that capital market participants with an interest in high-risk deals have detained themselves from supply and demand - and made profits in the poorest's account.
Other than competitors in the United States, he responded to the criticism of Ackermann: He promised to test the reprimands and said that no deal was "would be worth betting on Deutsche Bank's reputation."
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, the international working group controls the complaints from Foodwatch-Report.
The check is due to be closed by the end of the year, then the results will be presented to the board of Deutsche Bank - along with a recommendation on how to be handled.
Then, at the end of January, the bank's leaders want to say what consequences they will draw.
At the end, there could be a reduction in the commodity trade or even a complete rejection.
Ackermann is working on his own image.
Foodwatch's chief executive Thilo Bode welcomed the report, but he also intensified his criticism of the financial sector: "Lowing on rising food prices shows particularly drastically how, ruthlessly, banks are now harming the common good."
Let Ackermann, as the top banking lobbyist, be honoured with the obligations.
"Deutsche Bank must cut all items from its portfolio that is used for food pricing money," Bode said.
"It doesn't matter whether Mr. Ackermann is after hunger-suffering people or the reputation of Deutsche Bank."
Ackermann's view seems surprising at first glance, but it is clear that the Concern chief would like to leave the office a perfect picture a few months before he left office.
On Monday, Deutsche Bank announced that the chief executive officer of the board of directors otherwise than planned would not go to the supervisory board.
By revocating disputed agrarian speculation, he could improve his image.
And he doesn't have to worry about the potential losses - his successor should be able to cope with that in the end.
One in two would testify to investment in raw materials
Foodwatch is trying to maintain a high pressure on the manager.
So far, more than 30,000 internet users have already participated in the organization's campaign.
On Tuesday, Bode released a poll in which 1001 people were interviewed by the Forsa Institute on 7 and 8 November.
Just eleven per cent, according to this, considers it legitimate that Deutsche Bank offers investments that are linked to bets on food prices.
Many bank customers would also draw personal consequences if they learned that their bank was involved in such deals: Every second would testify to all the investments that the money flows into raw materials speculation as a result of the poll.
43 percent would warn acquaintances of such a bank, 49 percent said they would think about quitting their account and moving on to another institution.
21st century house in Vienna
Moved Pavilion
Ingeborg Wiensowski
The story of architecture with peaks, downs and happy endemic: The Austrian Pavilion of the World Exhibition in Brussels in 1958 won prizes, became a muse in Vienna, remained empty and ravaged.
It is now being reopened as a showcase house.
When it rages for modern post-war architecture, for bright forms, glass halls, bold boomes and new building materials that are typical for faith in technological advances, then the Austrian pavilion of architect Karel Schwanzer is an apt and famous example for the World's Fair 1958.
The Schwanzer Pavilion received the Grand Prix d'Architecture for its lightweight and lofty-looking steel and glass structure.
The building is still seen as a milestone in contemporary architecture.
He became famous for the architect to build the pavilion of Austria for the next world exhibition.
With his legendary four-cylinder BMW-palác, plus a key performed by a secondary building in Munich, he was finally famous for himself in 1973.
His as a temporary exhibition building, the projected pavilion after the world exhibition was placed in the Schweizer Garten near Vienna's Südbahnhof (Sitsky Station), and in it they opened the Museum of the 20th Century in 1962 - it was named "Dencoura of the 20th Century."
But the building was not suitable for the museum, either in space or technically - there were no walls for hanging art exhibits, no suitable climate.
Yet it was used until contemporary art received a new booth in Vienna.
Since 2001 the building was empty and dredged more and more.
Now the architect Adolf Krischanitz has renovated the pavilion, is now called "Down of the 21st Century" and will be used as a Museum of Contemporary Art in the future.
On Tuesday evening, the Museum Belvedere, to which the palace belongs, will open its first exhibition - a happy intention in every respect.
A new start by Agnes Husslein-Arco, who became the new director of the Austrian Gallery Belvedere, became the new director of the Austrian Gallery.
Husslein-Arco, a graduate art historian with a prominent career, a figure skater in her youth, later at Sotheby's, the Guggenheim Museum and the founding director of the Museum of Modern Salzburg, pushed for a major renovation from politicians and preservationists, procured public funds and private sponsorship money and determined the use.
In addition to contemporary art, the works of sculptor Fritz Wotruba should be exhibited with a foundation of the same name, a café and a bookshop should be created, and an office building had to be built to do so.
Strict supervision, low budget.
To be performed, Krischanitz was then the ideal cast.
Not only did he sensitively reconstruct and expand Joseph Olbrich's Art Nouveau buildings in Vienna and win the competition, but because he studied at the Technical University of Vienna at Schwanzer, and the pavilion was an "extremely important place" for him to view exhibitions "almost every weekend."
He knew the original project and also knew the problems of the building, which had already lost its generosity and lightness in its relocation to Vienna and the change of use.
The current reconstruction was much more of a problem: The building was a "catapult for energy," says Krischanitz.
The glass facade window profiles were replaced, with a reinforced insulating glass and a glass roof replaced with a special safety glass.
Refrigerator bridges-steel girders were amplified or replaced, and asbestos-filled ceilings were sanitised.
The two underground floors provided a place for new use, a recessed illumination canal between the building and the street provided lighting, with a bridge leading to the entrance - a near-new building, but still a lofty Schwanzer Pavilion.
The original entrance door has been preserved, the building is painted in an old anti-corrosion reddish-brown colour tone.
And the cinema hall is even exactly the same as it used to be.
All under the strict supervision of the Heritage Office and the low budget.
"Often material had to be found that is good and inexpensive and also liked the monument office," says Krischanitz, pointing to the broken basement floor.
Despite all the pressures, problems and reconstruction, the building remained flexible and airy.
Difficult, he said, was with the pavilion "that came here from Brussels," Krischanitz, a typical "Drop-in-the-City-Honor" recently.
Such architecture is said to stand "always in the wrong place" and still wants to "favour proper self-confidence."
In this case, however, the 21st Century House is not in an undesirable place, as an urban happy coincidence has occurred: In the Schweizer Garten circuit, a completely projected "City Quarter at the Central Station" is being created with office and residential houses.
And perhaps there will be another happy coincidence: the 21st-century house could receive support from another Krischanitz building, as the collector Francesca von Habsburg bought the Berliner Temporäre Kunsthalle and, as you can hear, is already in talks with the city of the neighbourhood at the post at the Schweizer Garten post.
The runway plans a package for the winter crisis at a million-dollar rate
The runway has pined out an emergency plan to prevent train outages in the winter.
The number of employees is to be doubled.
That'll cost millions.
In the fight against the winter caused by train outages and delays, Deutsche Bahn is issuing more than 70 million euros this year, according to a newspaper report.
The "Bild" newspaper reported tentatively, citing an internal group's plan, saying it was expected to be expected to be expected to invest around 300 million euros by 2015.
It is said to provide a better use of trains and the rail network also under extreme weather conditions.
Among other things, it is planned to double the number of internal and external staff to 16,000 people to remove snow on railway facilities and platforms.
The aim is to get rid of the platform until the start of service and 90 percent for the operation of the necessary switches during the four to five hours of snow and ice.
Two months ago, the head of railways, Rüdiger Grube, warned after a top-level meeting with government and industry leaders against train failures and delays during this winter.
In the previous winter, the passenger car trajectory had considerable problems, as it had a shortage of reserves, among other things, under difficult weather conditions.
Thus, numerous new regional trains have been waiting for years to be approved by the Federal Railway Authority.
This is also the delay in the dispatch of ICE trains
The runway has also not been able to cope for years that the axles of ICE trains appear to have more often checked for the workshop when one of the ICE trains at Köln's main train took place to destruct the axle.
Deutsche Bank pays $1 million fine in US
After the uproar over Chief Josef Ackermann, new trampings are taking place in the US: Deutsche Bank must pay millions of dollars in damages there.
As if Deutsche Bank no longer had enough of the problems at home, the industry giant still caught up with his US past: Frankfurt's institution pays $145 million (€106 million) in a single countervailing process to settle disputes over the bankruptcy of five major cooperative banks in the course of the financial crisis.
This is the sale of the mortgage lists.
The financial market regulator NCUA reproaches a number of major banks for bringing in cooperative banks with bogus promises to buy financial products; that they may have reduced the risks.
Such papers have lost considerable value in the course of the crisis, and have taken the banks with them into the abyss.
"We are satisfied that we were able to resolve the issue without the need to drag the parties to court," said a Deutsche Bank spokesman in New York.
The settlement does not plead guilty.
This is also true for Citigroup, which has pledged to pay out $20.5 million.
NCUA President Debbie Matz welcomed the friendliness of the two financial institutions.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is competent for cooperative banks in the US and helps with bankruptcies to protect customer claims.
NCUA is attempting to recover the billion-dollar damages.
Compensation now completed are the first of their kind.
The regulator also clung to other Grand Bobsons and sued JPMorgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs in the summer.
For dubious mortgage lists, these are the so-called Mortgage-backed Securities.
These are based on bank loans.
When the American bubble around the properties in the morning. 2007 deflated, it became fatal to a number of financial firms.
In September 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, the US-Investmentbank Lehman Brothers changed its mind.
Although the events took place a few years ago, a sharp wind is now blowing in the banks' mouths.
Investors and supervisory authorities have filed numerous lawsuits to reach a remedy or to suffer misconduct.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has launched the biggest wave of lawsuits.
He accuses 18 international grandbanks of the fact that two state-owned US real estate financiers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac had put about $200 billion at a disadvantage in mortgage deals.
Deutsche Bank is also facing a lawsuit against FHFA, with more deals totalling about $14.2 billion from 2005 to 2007.
By gimmelling, the Frankfurt Institute is demanding that the Frankfurt Institute be responsible for "substantial losses" without, however, giving any exact amount.
Deutsche Bank rejected the demands as unfounded and said it wanted to defend itself.
Warren Buffett enters IBM with 10 billion
Financial guru Buffett invests heavily in the IBM IT-undakeest.
Since March, he has bought more than $10 billion worth of shares.
The hitherto major US investor, Warren Buffett, has always claimed not to invest in IT and computers, because he will be given difficult to predict by the long-term development of the companies.
But now he read IBM's business reports and changed his opinion about investment in the business.
He has had to understand much earlier that IBM offers primarily services and acquires computer systems for IT-uniting other businesses.
Warren Buffett's investment is seen as knighthoods in the financial world.
As a result, it is allowed to call the motherly rock of the IT IBM now "Sir IBM."
For Buffett revealed on CNBC's American economic radio station that he had bought $10.7 billion worth of IBM shares since March.
His Investmentholding Berkshire Hathaway became one of IBM's largest shareholders with a 5.5 percent stake.
Buffett sagte that even IBM didn't know anything about his engagement so far.
He praised management, which tried to even make regular returns during the economic crisis.
"You've done a great job," Buffett said of the strategy.
IBM has been betting for a long time on lucrative IT-services such as the operation of computing centers.
The more than 100-year-old computer pioneer also offers software and consultancy as well as powerful computers for companies.
Buffett has been rather dodging technology firms to date.
It claims to be invested only in undertakings whose activities he also understands.
Instead, Buffett reached for the freight rail, for the manufacturer of the lubricant or the machine's manufacturers.
In addition to about 80 of its own subsidiaries, his Holding Berkshire Hathaway also owns stakes in a wide range of Grand Hallcensors such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, the former Münchener Rück.
The 81-year-old gentleman took over the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway in the 1960s and built it with wise investments one of the most valuable businesses in the world.
Yet his way of life is modest.
It is therefore a cult figure for many investors around the world.
His almost infallible sense of making money brought him the nickname "Orakel of Omaha (The Miracle of Omaha."
When Buffett's investment became known, IBM's shares rose by one percent before the stock market began.
"Big Blue," as IBM is also called, has a total price of more than $220 billion on the stock market and is considered to be the world's most valuable technology companies, along with Apple and Microsoft.
But at Microsoft, Buffett so much, he wouldn't want to start.
Founder Bill Gates is said to be a trusted friend.
Threatening is palpable
After the discovery of the "Bunachonka in Zwickau" the Turkish media doubt the German rule of law.
The newspaper even talks about the "bloody ideology" that is now coming to life again.
The murders of eight small-time entrepreneurs of Turkish origin and one Greek one between 2000 and 2006 had a right-leaning extremist background.
This report was responded to with fear and concern in Turkey and within the German-Turkish population in Germany.
For for many German Turks, this brings back the spectre that has long been seen as dead: There has been no comparable violence with the right-wing extremist background since the arson attacks in Mölln in November 1992 and Solingen in May 1993.
That there is a xenophobia in Germany, yet, was never in doubt.
But the right-wing extremist network discovered reveals a magnitude that can long ago be overseen.
"Does he revive the bloody ideologies again?" were the headlines in the online edition of the Turkish newspaper "Haberturk."
The "Sabah" newspaper, on the other hand, emphasizes that one of the perpetrators was to be a secret police officer to the constitution protection department and fear that the German authorities could also be embroiled in the right-wing radical swamp.
The Turkish community of Germany responded deliberately: She recalled the demonstration over the weekend by silence in front of the Brandeburg Gate of victims of racist violence.
Only two weeks ago, the Turkish community in Berlin, together with German and Turkish politicians, recalled the ceremonial act of the fiftieth anniversary of the German-Turkish recruitment agreement.
In cheerful colours, a life together was staged - as a history of success.
As a slap, the coverage of several Turkish media: "Germany's pennib outlook" is the title of an article in the Turkish online platform "Haber X" that reports on the background of the murder series.
Also, the issue of the "Hürriyet" paper for Germany will not be taken away from making this mind-set.
"It's starting to smell," is the headline of a post by Ahmet Külahci.
It stresses that people who paid taxes were murdered and made an important contribution to Germany's reconstruction with their work.
Most criticically, the police's actions and their late success in the search are discussed in the German-Turkish online forums.
Why it had not occurred to the German authorities much earlier to search for the suspects in right-wing extremist circles, the authors wonder.
Thus, many are shown at least rhetorically ready to use drastic means: "If the activity is carried out so superficially here, the immigrants will have no choice but to defend and armed themselves."
"That's perhaps the best self-defense."
"The quality of the clarification and proportionality of the punishment of the entire network is very strongly dependent on internal peace in Germany ", writes "Selen."
What does it mean if internal peace in Germany is threatened is made clear by the assassinations in Mölln and Solingen in the 1990s.
The photo of the burnt room in Solingen is deeply engraved in the memory of the Germans and the Turks.
For no other event has shown the Turks living here more clearly that there is a tangible threat here and the Germans that mistrust and distance can result in right-wing violence
However, the assassinations made the Turks a more evident sense of reciprocity.
Do not repeat the mistakes of the past
At the time, the Turkish press was primarily criticised for the failure of German policy following the assassinations: Helmut Kohl refused to visit those in Mölln who survived.
After the arson attack in Solingen, he sent his condolences to the Turkish State's president, but allowed himself to be represented by his foreign minister, Klaus Kinkel, at his speech, in his speech, the Turks here.
Quite as if a person's value is measured by the height of his taxes.
The current coverage of the Turkish media shows once again how deep the mistrust of many German Turks in the local state-lawed arrangement is.
In addition to efforts to make extensive clarification and a new evaluation of right-wing extreme terrorism in Germany, this time requires open words.
Scandalous bank at Lake Zurich
Europe's most adventurous bank is not established in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
UBS suffered almost bankruptcy in the financial crisis and has since slipped from one crisis to another.
Now a German is to compare it.
I'm sure Axel Weber didn't think that.
After his noisy departure from the leadership of the Federal Bank's leadership, he became known in July to take up an almost equally spectacular new job in 2013: the president of the board of directors of the Swiss Grand Brigade UBS - an unexpected and lucrative step in his career.
Axel Weber was looking forward to it publicly, praising Switzerland, whether for its beauty and UBS for its newly acquired solidity, and called friendly remarks to future colleagues.
"Die UBS has achieved a turnaround."
"I am looking forward to working with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel."
But it was clear in September that everything would turn out very differently.
A dealer from UBS in London bypassed all the bank's security systems and lost around 1.7 billion euros.
UBS Chief Executive Oswald Grübel, not only a respected banker in Switzerland, had to leave.
The president of the board of directors of UBS has also been a scalded ever since - and everyone is asking: When is Axel Weber finally coming?
It has already become known that Weber has been allowed to advise the bank since February 2012.
And it will take over the chairmanship of the board in May - not until 2013, as the Bank said on Tuesday.
It's going to be tough for Axel Weber.
He is not a banker, rather a professor of economics and a petitioner, and he would certainly need a time to work.
It will then take responsibility for the bank's strategy, which has just once again proved that it deserves the title of "Banka of the Greatest Scandals in Europe"
For UBS is both huge - until recently it was the world's largest property manager - and has been gliding for years from one scandal to the next.
Items nothing, will be left to be spared the proud Swiss bank.
It started in the financial crisis.
By 2007, UBS enjoyed excellent reputation.
The image of the taciturn and solid but also shrewd asset manager is combined with ambitious goals: She also wanted to mean something in investment banking.
So UBS 2007 managed, on the one hand, with $1.6 trillion, more money from wealthy clients than any other bank in the world.
And on the other hand, she advanced as an investment bank to the league of the world's biggest banks
That gave the impression.
Former banker and later longtime banking professor at Zurich, Hans Geiger, tells us: "I have always cited UBS as a model for a good bank at the time."
"From today's point of view, one asks: How could I be so wrong?"
He was wrong.
In 2007, it was first apparent that something had gone wrong in UBS.
In the middle of the year, the director of the board of directors, Peter Wuffli, resigned, and has so far been seen as a highly intelligent and also a brilliant banker.
A few months later, he knew why he had left.
The bank's investment division wasted the Subprime-papinters and had to write off billions.
To stand it, UBS announced a capital increase of really 13 billion francs.
But it did find investors, but one that it would have been sniffing at the nose recently: the opaque Asian State Fund from Singapore and an Arab state fund that was so discreet that one did not even learn its name.
But that was just the first bump.
In April 2008, it was harder to develop.
The bank had to admit new billion-dollar losses, the chairman of the board, Marcel Ospel, the second highest-paid board of directors of Switzerland, resigned.
A disaster ensued in October 2008: UBS, given its flawed investment in the financial crisis, faced a breakdown and had to be rescued by the state.
Nationalbank bought up problematic securities from UBS for tens of billions of dollars, the Swiss Confederation gave six billion francs on mandatory convertible bonds, for which it could become co-owner of the bank.
The whole of Switzerland was shaken - noticing how dramatic it was for a small country to have such large banks on its territory.
After all, the UBS 2007 balance sheet was more than five times the performance of the Swiss economy (see picture).
"We could not save UBS one day," says banking expert Geiger.
The first disaster is followed by a second.
For months, UBS had capitulated to this in a tax dispute with America, showing a willingness to release data from wealthy customers who, if possible, with the help of banks, had been cutting taxes.
In addition, she agreed to pay out $780 million - as a return of unauthorized profits from those deals, including a penalty surcharge.
This undertook UBS more or less openly to aiding tax cuts.
At the same time, she lost something that had always been her capital in a competition for wealthy clients: a halo of discretion.
After this scandal, the Swiss banking secrecy was no longer what it had done before.
This was followed by the resignation of the Chief of the Board of Directors and the President of the Board of Directors.
And the exodus of the customers' money.
Thus, the Bank lost its credibility in both central commercial areas over the course of several months: In investment banking, due to poor speculation and asset management to aiding and to cut tax.
And just when it calmed down a bit again, just as it was thought that UBS had recovered again, this unfortunate trade anabase is coming: A single dealer wasted 1.7 billion euros before the bank noticed something was wrong.
And it's clear: with risk management in investment banking, it's probably still not working out.
"The Adoboli case has probably found that risk control has changed too little," says Martin Janssen, economist and Finance professor at the Zürich University's Banking Institute.
The finance director of the big German bank is also sure: "The Problem of UBS is that it is failing to control the risks."
Yet it was exactly the idea of being cautious, with which the Swiss bankers had set out a long time ago to become watchdogs of the world's great fortunes: no too much risk, but security for money - the Alpine Republic's world collapsed again on this side.
The Swiss banks' vaults have become a symbol for unshakable reliability such as Lindt and Sprüngli for particularly high-quality chocolate.
UBS's headquarters in Zurich are still suited to the cliché of a good Swiss private bank - it's just a little bigger.
The position is already classic.
The bank has its headquarters in Zurich's Bahnhofstraße, which leads directly to Zurich Lake, which is framed by the snow-covered peaks of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are beautiful, with shop rentals among the highest in Europe.
Jewels like Tiffany's are among the Swiss traditional shops as Sprüngli confectionery.
It has been home to Swiss banks for centuries: from Nationalbank to Palast der Credit Suisse to elite private banks like Julius Bär.
The UBS receptionist is entered through heavy revolving doors.
Inside are the marble-lined walls, with massive leather chairs in front of them, a large rudder to the "sejaf" alongside the bank's logo.
UBS knows what the customer is looking for here: safety.
This idea of the Swiss Bank of both Swiss grand and grandtlanes, UBS and Credit Suisse, but sometimes - was suppressed or betrayed, as the head of a small Swiss private bank finds.
He would rather not want to read his name in the newspapers, he concludes, like all Swiss bankers, with the two grandbanks also with the two grandbanks.
UBS has probably grown too much, it is surveying - especially in investment banking, where the Anglo-Saxons have also expanded.
The Swiss probably have nothing more to say about it.
"And if they had adapted to the Anglo-Saxon ways, after all."
Indeed, it was Anglo-Saxon investment banking that changed UBS, brought in at first high profits, and then a disaster: No European financial institute lost as much money in the jungle around Subprime as the Schweizer Großbank.
15. October 2008 the disaster was obvious.
"At that centre, the ruling coalition of a small 7 million country decided to attend the largest rescue effort in the history of its nation," writes author Lukas Hässig in his book "Der UBS-Crash."
Up to 68 billion francs or around €45 billion was approved by politicians to bail out a grand bunk bank from bankruptcy.
How could this have happened?
If they talk to Swiss bankers, they see the problem especially in the size of UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three Swiss Grand Banks merged into a massive concern.
A bank was created that was already too big for a small Switzerland during the merger - and continued to grow.
In doing so, it helped that the two different banking predecessors of UBS were complemented: One rich but sleepy bank in Zurich with a focus centre of wealth management and poorer but more internationally more heavily involved.
Suddenly, internationalized investment bankers came up profitably with a lot of money with which they could spin a big roulette wheel.
Two names are associated with this UBS rise: Peter Wuffli, UBS chief executive and Marcel Ospel, then chairman of the board.
"I have always thought that Wuffli and Ospel were the team of the future," says banking expert Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the highly intelligent, modest one who knows much about the models and the statistics, and the Ospel, the man guided by the feelings around his stomach that has developed completely up from the banking science."
But Ospel was said to be relying on Wuffli at the end.
And Wuffli probably made a decisive mistake at the end: "I guess he thought his models were a reality," Geiger says.
"This is a tragic case."
Tragic, perhaps.
What is clear is: Pride preceded the fall.
UBS staff clearly remembers the senior executive meetings at which Wuffli's group boss repeated the same slogan again: Cutting Goldman Sachs off the throne.
The US bank was the world's most powerful investment bank.
She cited "League Tables," a waiting list that documents the success of the banks of that time.
In it, UBS was trying to get the placement at the very top.
A few steps had already gone her way.
In the trade in foreign exchange and with shares, she participated in the game at the very top.
But the business advisers charged with stressing one weakness: In the international interest-rate trade, in the language of the "Fixed Income" bankers, there is probably a big distance behind the biggest banks.
UBS probably has gaps in American mortgage products.
To close the gap, UBS committed to an adventure that had almost cost it its existence.
The hunger striking for growth, both the bank itself and its based fund have invested to safeguard risk risks to Subprime's investments.
It developed into a massive machine that repacked the securities to US mortgage loans and passed it on - but retained the risks of it as well.
Also, when other banks were long looking for a way out.
"As late as the summer of 2007, when the real estate market was on fire, UBS was buying there," says banking expert Geiger.
How big is the euphemum, the deep fall.
One manager after another had to leave when the attempts to clean up were more difficult than thought.
The UBS positions have become a catapult seat and are swinging until today.
Whoever runs the Grand BBank now has an almost unmanaged job.
They need to find a strategy for the bank that all the nearby business models have disappeared.
Banking expert Geiger already has the idea: The end of investment banking, the concentration on asset management, a return to the Swiss roots.
The bank doesn't want to go that far (still).
But investment banking is to be severely derailed, so much is now clear.
Next Thursday, the bank's new chief executive, Sergio Ermotti, wants to present his future strategy to the world.
In fact, the 51-year-old Swiss Italian was only seen as a transitional solution when the bank surprisingly broke up with its predecessor, Grübel.
In the meantime, he has asserted himself: He is to run UBS's business for a long time, the Zurich Bank told the Zurich Bank on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to put the investment bank back on the count in the mid-1990s.
3,500 seats will be cut.
That won't be enough.
UBS needs a vision.
Who is she?
How does he want to make money?
These are the questions Axel Weber is already asking himself.
But he is still saying publicly only that he and his wife will first find an apartment in Zurich.
Next year.

This has given investors in the US skeptical. "We're not an island, we're addicted," said Goldman, a Wallodeck.
Europe will probably not recover from the recession so quickly, and there are other signs of bank weakness.
The economics of investing Warren Buffett only confirmed this outlook: He said in a CNBC-Interview that it would not yet be clear whether Europe was strong enough to do everything to end the crisis.
That is why, from his point of view, it is probably too early to invest in European state loans or banks.
Instead, Buffett left the decades-old principle and entered the American tech industry.
His investment of more than $10 billion at IBM boosted the traditional group's stock price, letting it rise nearly one percent higher against the trend during trading.

Intelligent crows expand in cities
In many places, field ravens are considered "problem birds": But these highly intelligent animals can no longer be expel from cities, experts say.
Some like them, others would like to get rid of them quite quickly: The crows have been in the city's image for centuries, yet in some municipalities the people's complaints are accumulating to the impurity and noise caused by the animals.
At the same time, there is no means of viewing the "problem birds" yet.
Ravennaces of field may not be removed from the cities anymore, experts at the first sympathies said of the churches in East-Wer.
There, experts from all over the federal territory discussed possible starting points.
Looking for alternatives in cities
Meanwhile, conservationists have also derived the problems of the cities from the exodus of specially protected field ravens: The use of chemistry in agriculture is about a growing destruction of traditional areas for life.
The pursuit, the growing development and the felling of the typical trees to nest for the birds make life difficult.
Crows are protected.
Large colonies with more than 600 nesting pairs are among others in the Westphalia Soest, in the northwest, including in Jever, Diepholz and Achim at Bremen and in Leer.
There, the 2005 disputed project of mass killing of crows in the country district sparked negative headlines.
Critics called the capture of animals in bird traps and the killing of the sticks to be particularly brutal.
"Normal expulsion, scares, brings nothing," the urban planner and landscape designer Werner Klöver of Leer found so much.
Removing nests by spraying water or cutting down trees often has undesirable consequences, environmental expert Manfred Kaiser from Lahr, Baden-Württemberg, also said.
"The animals retreat, the large colonies are split and divided into other places."
Scouting is conceivable only as an exception to hospitals, nursing homes or schools.
"We have to live with them, we can't get them gone."
Without the surrounding territory, the problem of the cities cannot be solved, was the opinion of Mayor Wolfgang Kellner of Leer.
The sculpture is a combination of expelling animals from sensitive residential areas and their attraction to settle in other places.
"Information board instead of chain saw saws" was promoted by psychologist and ethnologist Uta Maria Jürgens for a completely different treatment of animals: "One need for the face can finally be best at ease with confidence."
Ms Jürgens co-founded the Ascherberg educational trail in Schleswig-Holstein, on which they provide information boards with lessons on the life of a highly intelligent field raven.
The project is said to have been already admitted to tourists.
Ms Jürgens also had her own opinion on the criticism of the noise caused by the birds: "This is about every volume of communication, they have much to say."
The intelligence and skill of the animals are legendary: Field Ravens use not only the aids to reach a treat, but even make their instrument as an aid.
Researchers at the University of Cambridge have recently tested the behavior of four field ravens as to how far the intelligence of birds reaches.
In one experiment, the birds quickly learned that they had to bring the stones to collapse the structure to reach the cattle of the pier.
Without much training, they could tell the size and shape the stone had to take to cause the platform to collapse.
In the second attempt, the cunning crows then had to solve a more precarious problem.
In a vertically built cylinder, the researchers placed a tiny container of the catwalk larvae.
The beak could not be reached by the birds on their loot.
But the researchers put bits of wire in there.
From them, she shaped the hook of four animals, using as a forge to hunt the container for a handle.
Three of the four field ravens managed to do so even with a cut.
Cristiano Ronaldo shoots Portugal to the 2012 European Championships
The hopes of the Bosnians and the Turks for the Cup did not work out.
The favourites Portugal, Croatia, the Czech Republic and Ireland are in the 2012 European Championship.

Sena Lulic received a yellow-red card (54th).
Bosnia have already failed to play in the 2010 World Cup play-off matches with Portugal in South Africa.
Estadio da Luz in Lisbon made a tailor-made start.
Ronaldo soon reached the lead by hanging a free kick from about 30 yards into the net.
A good quarter of an hour later, Nani made his long-range shot home qualities and made it 2-0 with a 25-yard shot.
The Bosnians, who did not perform in the first half of an hour, had their first clear chance in goalkeeper Edin Dzek.
The former Wolfsburu player from England at the top of the table standing at the top of the table for the club Manchester City sat a header at the bottom of the crossbar, but the ball did not cross the goal line (33rd).
Jiracek scores for the Czech Republic
Finally, referee Wolfgang Stark from Ergolding was in the centre.
After a tackle against Helder Postig in Bosnian penalty, Stark decided for Schwalbe and gave the Portuguese a yellow card. (36.).
On the opposing party, Stark made a disputed penalty kick after the action of Fabio Coentraa, which Misimovic was confident to convert.
But after the break, the European vice-captain from the r. 2004 with four shots.
For the Czech Republic, Petr Jiracek also ended his last doubts in the 81st minute.
With that, the European Champion is leaving the r r. 1976 for the fifth time in a row at the European Championships.
Team coach Michal Bok with Bundesliga legionnaire Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomáš Pekhart (1. FC Nuremberg) was also lucky and had to overcome a terrible second in the early stages.
Goalkeeper Petr Cech protested in reflex for Tomáš Sivok's possible own goal at the last moment (9.).
Montenegro had its best options when the duo of Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damyanovic were in action.
Damjanovic fired in the 40th minute from the rev from the edge of the penalty area only just past Chekhov's goal.
After the break, the crossbar had to save the place of the already hit-and-run goalkeeper of the Czechs of the world class, again being reduced by the striker FC Soul (50th).
The goala finally cleared everything up shortly before the conclusion.
Turkey missed a football miracle from Zagreb at that moment.
Four days after 0-3 in Istanbul, the Turks did not go 0-0 in Zagreb.
While national coach Guus Hiddink must almost securely clear his seat on the bench of the third time at the 2002 World Cup, the Croatians are allowed to rejoice in their fourth appearance in the final round of the European Championship.
In front of the 31,000 spectators at the Maksimira Stadium, the Turks should experience an almost fairytale start.
Selcuk Inan hit only the post with a shot from distance in the seventh minute, the striker Kazim also could not drop the bounced ball in the goal.
After this terrible second, Croatia took over but increasingly control.
Also after the interruption, the Croats did not get the goal.
Alongside Mario Mandzukice of VfL Wolfsburg, who was releasing Dortmund's Ivan Perisic from the 62nd minute, the legionnaires from the Federal League of the Danijel Pranjic (Bayern Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht Frankfurt) were still in action.
Trapattoni goes to the European Championships
In Dublin, the Irish celebrated their first appearance at the European Championships since 1988 in Germany.
Stephen Ward brought the team to coach Giovanni Trapattoni, who took a 4-0 success in the first game to take a preliminary decision, in the 32nd minute to take the lead.
Konstantin Vassiljev (57.) equalised for the visitors.
Ireland set the pace from the start, but had to wait until the 23rd minute before Robbie Keane of the Los Angeles Galaxy had his first good chance.
Only at the last moment prevented the Estonian defence from a possible leading goal.
In the 32nd minute, however, it was quite a long way.
After a failed defence by goalkeeper Pavel Londak, Ward was in place and pushed the ball over the line at 1-0.

SAP wants to double its workforce in China.
The largest software manufacturer in Europe, SAP, is investing billions in China in the coming years and wants to nearly double the number of its employees in the country.
Do r. 2015 is said to be around $2 billion (approximately €1.5 billion), Dax told the group on Tuesday.
"We will create more research and development facilities and employ the relevant staff," said acting chief executive Bill McDermott at the Beijing Customer Fair.
The staff is now set to rise from the current 2,500 employees to 4,500.
The number of branches of the world's number one in business software will double from five to ten or eleven.
SAP is still present in Beijing, Shanghai, Guanzhou, Chengdu and Dalian.
About 4,000 of the world's more than 176,000 SAP customers are booming in the country.

Massacre on a personal level
Peter Englund's empowering new book, Beauty and Sorrow: The Beauty and theorrow of World War II, The Intimate History of the First World War, begins with a long list of performant characters.
One piece of advice on how to act at that moment: Cauterise, rip this page out of it and make a bookmark of it.
For in Mr. Englund's novel's narrative, you will be very familiar with all persons, and this list will serve as a navigation - as a kind of beacon - at times when, like the men and women in the story, you will feel confused and lost in various situations.
Mr. Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new deputy at the Swedish Academy, which awards the Nobel Prize in Literature.
The book we're talking about here is very unusual - the author himself describes it, quite aptly, as an "anti-historical work."
It contains several very well-known names, important treaties or famous battles, on the contrary, it is almost missing ambassadors, energetic journalists, and debates on tactics and equipment.
It's not so much a book about what happened, the author explains, as "a book about what it was like." It is mainly about "feeling, impressions, experiences and moods."
"Beauty and grief" combine the war experiences of 20 more or less ordinary men and women, on both sides of the barricade, from female students and botanists to climbers, doctors, ambulance drivers and officials.
Some of these people will become heroes.
Others become prisoners of war, lose their limbs, go mad or die.
Their lives are shimmered like the flames of candles lit in the church - new ones are added to the intrigues of the fates while others are extinguished.
Mr. Englund's book is different from the classic historical novels.
It corrects the notion that the First World War was only about the horrific trench fighting on the Western Front.
"Beauty and grief" skillfully explores other places where war dramas took place: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
Soldiers in this book solve the problems with the bee's nests falling on them, have to spend Christmas in the shade of the pyramids, or they are faced with the presence of the tse-tse.
Almost from the beginning it is a very moving read.
The war will devise people's lives like some kind of natural disaster, like Hurricane Katrina, smelling of gunpowder.
When gunfire starts to come forward in the distance and you are the woman who is at home with her children, run away or do you stay?
Who's coming?
Almost no one understands what's going on, or even why the whole war was started.
"The vacuum arose from a lack of facts," observed Mr. Englund, "concerns, conjectures, hopes, fears, prejudices, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumors were filled with."
"Beauty and grief" follows the stories of individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young sailor serving in the German fleet.
Their stories are mostly taken from biographies, letters and other already published materials.
Descriptions of their lives may sound both terrifying and engaging, but by incorporating small moments and details, they are utterly lively and believable.
Many of them are about hardship and dealing with it.
In the story of a German student, the author says: "Surprises, all substitutes everywhere."
"Coffee surrogate, a mock-up of aluminum, imitations of rubber, paper bandages, wooden buttons."
He goes further and describes food substitutes in Germany.
It mentions "a gase made from pressed rice cooked in mutton fat (and supplemented with a false wood bone), dried-cream tobacco and dried potato skathers, wooden-soled shoes.
It mentions that there were "837 registered meat substitutes for the production of sausages and 511 registered coffee substitutes."
Some stories are about honor and bravery.
One American finds the inner perception of savagery and brutality, then declares the war: "Finally, you will understand that this is human nature. Not to sit in comfortable chairs with a cigarette and whisky, an evening paper or a good book, and to pretend that this mask of yours is a civilization, and that there is no barbarian behind the starchy me inside."
The British soldier, on the other hand, realizes that he will most likely die soon and no one will even notice, let alone mourn.
"When one finally accepts the fact that one is sacrificing oneself, one would at least expect that to happen in front of a grateful audience," he writes.
Instead, however, he feels like a "doublewl he secretly hangs."
Other remarks relate to the departure of old Europe and the emergence of new horrors.
"The conflict became increasingly an economic competition and a competitive fight," writes Mr Englund, "a war between factories."
He picked up what he calls "a new kind of beast of the coming century: an eloquent and ideologically swollen serial killer in a tailor-made dress that makes his bloodshed without getting up from the table."
People behave completely unexpectedly, the meanness alternates with heroics.
Mr. Englund also describes the soldiers who deliberately tried to catch some venereal disease from the prostitutes in order to avoid duty at the front.
"The most eruroescine example of this behavior was the goncoccal pus trafficking, which the soldiers bought and cooed with their genitals with it in the hope of ending up in the hospital," he writes.
"The most desperate ones intramourved him into their eyes, which often blinded them for the rest of their lives."
In this Swedish translation by Peter Graves, Mr. Englund's prose is brisk but not spectacular, which is well suited to his human subject.
In dozens of small outings, it captures the way the war has "thrown out of utterly unmanageable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred."
People are beginning to ask why their leaders are making them fight.
The best books on World War I mostly, rather than a comprehensive narrative, worked with hints, such as "First World War and Modern Memories" by Paul Fussell, or novels such as "On the Western Front of Calm of Calm" by Erich Maria Remarque.
Mr. Englund prefers an unconventional concept.
His book has the most devastating ending unparalleled in popular educational literature.
But I will not reveal it to you.
But you will feel as if suddenly the author jumped out of the book, snatched the page from the list of heroes out of your hand and set it on fire.
After a previous mistake this time for a minute, a spearheaded for a minute
Hundreds of police officers participated, some in the helmets used in the street riots.
The night from Monday to Tuesday was chosen because the Zuccottti Park should be almost empty by then.
No one knew about the action except a few senior officers. The others were first told that this was an exercise.
The event was headed by Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly, whose presence emphasized how many problems the police department had to face in the operation.
There were no relics of the cases in recent weeks of, for example, the use of pepper spray against protesters, thus violating the department's rules and, moreover, a wave of public sympathy spilled over to squatter.
That is why the police operation, aimed at clearing the Zuccotti park from the demonstrators, was launched only after two weeks of careful planning and exercise.
The leaders were inspired by the operations conducted in other cities.
Massive behavioral exercise in crisis situations took place in a section of Randalls Island, which was a preparation for an event in Zuccotti Park.
Leaders have stepped up so-called riot-out-custa training - counterterrorism measures involving the rapid transfer of large numbers of police officers - with a focus on the city district of Lower Manhattan.
The last part of the training took place on Monday night, on the Manhattan side of the East River.
The orders to move to the park came literally "at the last minute" was stated by someone to whom the action was originally explained only as "exercise."
"I know a few police officers who were also called up for this event, and they were certainly not told that they were going to Zuccotti Park," said the person, who spoke only on the condition that he remains anonymous.
"The highest-ranking members of the department knew about going to Zuccottti Park."
One reason for the secrecy was a lesson the city had already received once.
14. In October, city officials planned to clean the park, but then withdrew from the plan, because as soon as the demonstrators heard about it, they flocked to the park for hundreds of them before the operation began.
Tuesday's event was attended by police officers from various units, including intervention groups from all over the area - dozens of police officers who are commonly used to reinforce neighborhoods with higher levels of crime.
Mr. Kelly explained that during the day a large number of people came and went to the park, so one o'clock at night was the perfect time to start the event.
"It was appropriate to do this at a time when as few people as possible would be in the park," he said.
Before the troops set out, they lined up on the border of Pike Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near the Manhattan Bridge, emergency trucks with arc lamps and amplifiers.
The lights and recorded news roaring from the amplions terroit frightened many of the demonstrators.
When members of the riot squad entered the park in their blue windbreakers, many demonstrators packed their belongings and left.
Police say she didn't touch a single tent until 1:45 a.m., asking the demonstrators to give the demonstrators time to pack up their belongings.
Other teams of police officers were spotted gathering on the edge of the park to enter if there were any arrests to be made.
Reporters were forced to leave the park.
Police Department chief spokesman Paul J. Browne claimed that this was for their safety.
However, many journalists are of the opinion that the police wanted to prevent them from seeing their troops in action, and in addition to some police officers being rude to them.
Mr. Browne claimed that the television cars on Church Street, running along the western border of the park, could easily film.
Police moved in a westerly direction, weaving their way through the dense jumble of the protesters' personal belongings, including luggage and plastic bags full of clothing. Behind them came the teams from the sanitation department, which immediately raked in everything that was left in the park.
Some of the demonstrators who refused to move were dragged out of the park. Documenting pictorial material appeared on the internet moments later.
The most darshest group of demonstrators took refuge in the vicinity of the kitchen in their campus, which lay near the center of the park.
Some set up a roadblock and police began their methodical arrests.
About ten people in the center of the campground were tied to each other.
And two people tied up to a tree, Mr. Kelly said.
Members of the emergency services were called in to cut the locks.
There were no arrests at the park until 3:30 a.m. on the morning of the park, Mr. Kelly announced.
The entire operation was completed about 75 minutes later, the police's statement.
Mr. Brown said some 142 people had been detained in the park.
Most of the arrests were made because of "an organisation of riots and opposition to the arrest," he clarified.
The highest-ranking police officer at the scene of the event was Joseph J. Esposito, the chief of police, the highest-ranking uniformed officer in the department.
The operation was also personally involved in the Phil T. Pulaski, the detective's chief of staff.
Mr. Kelly was present, but "he was not involved in driving the operation," Mr. Browne said.
A second group of police officers waited along the east side of Broadway, between Liberty Street and Cedar Street, in case it needed to be called in.
On Cortlandt Street, a block north of the park, and on Pine Street Street, a block south of the park, barricades were erected.
From these places, the police then developed a protective belt even further from Zuccotti Park.
Police officers were spotted at one site, many of whom were equipped with shields, pushing people even further beyond that border.
There were about 28 people on the northern border.
The wildest events of the night took place south of the park.
Around 5 a.m., a demonstrator was spotted south of Pine Street as he jumped onto the hood of the police car and several others who were blowing air out of the tires of the police van.
At one point, a piece of plywood flew out of the crowd.
At the end of the operation, one police officer and one protester were hospitalized.
Trade union of auxiliary workers to sue city for dismissal
The union, representing hundreds of school support workers who lost their jobs last month, plan to sue the city on Wednesday. They argue that the redundancies were not necessary and, moreover, it was discrimination, because of the disproportionate impact on schools attended by poor students.
The lawsuit is probably the last resort left by the departments in District Council 37 in their efforts to overturn the redundancy decision.
On October 7th, six hundred and seventy-seven-two school assistants, parental coordinators, and other staff who were among the city's worst-paid staffers lost their jobs. Their release was described by union leaders as retaliation for the city's retribution for not allowing him access to a health care fund managed by work crews last spring, using which the city wanted to put a hole in the budget.
City officials categorically rejected the accusation.
At a city council meeting held last month, Education Minister Dennis M. Walcott, that the redundancies were part of the budget approved in June.
One of the council members immediately countered that the budget was not specifically mentioned in the budget for the dismissal of auxiliary workers.
District Council officials announced that they had already filled out the necessary documents and warned the Education Ministry that they would sue him. On Wednesday, they will call a press conference where they will formally announce the lawsuit at the Supreme State Court in Manhattan.
The defendants in the trial will be Mr. Walcott and the Department of Education, while the plaintiff will be the plaintiff's eight redundant workers, all of whom are African-American or Hispanic, as are most of the other assistants who have lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokeswoman for the city's legal department, said the city had not yet seen the lawsuit, so she would not comment on the individual charges.
According to a draft of the complaint obtained by the New York Times, the unions focused on the number of redundancies in the poor parts of the city, thus seeking to support their claims of unfair conduct. They take the view that poor schools have lost more assistants because they have been denied sufficient funds in the long term.
They point out that while schools in the Staten Island section of the Staten Island section were not released at all, and in the Upper East Side, in Brooklyn, in the District 23 in Brownsville, 17 school assistants were dropped out, and even 46 assistants were discharged in parts of District 8 and 9 in the South Bronx.
He recalls that at the Public School 36 in Harlem, five of the eight assistants lost their jobs, even though it is a school where 68 percent of students live in poverty. The lawsuit says: 'This is not a neighbourhood of full affluent parents who can procure funds to balance the deficit in the budget.'
The budget of the Public School 36 school was down 3.26 percent this year, and the school also lost money when the city changed the way the city was to calculate bonus funding for each of the poor students enrolled.
The unions argue, among other things, that the high school administrators may have been confused in the manner in which the document approving the dismissal of the parental coordinators was written.
The word "excess" was used to describe the action in describing the action, i.e. to cancel the position, even though the word is much more commonly used to describe the transfer of the teacher from the school's payroll to the database of available personnel whose remuneration is paid by the central authority.
"Sixty-six parental coordinators have been released," reads the complaint's draft complaint, "and not merely moved to the database for the position of available staff."
Mission is over, Congress ready to accept deal on the situation in Libya
Finally, the Republicans and the Democrats in Congress seem to agree on something about the uprising in Libya.
Before that happened, however, the revolution had to succeed, for a long time the reigning dictator Muammar Gaddafi had to be captured and killed and the participation of the United States troops ended.
On Tuesday, the Senate International Relations Committee will decide on the comments supported by President John Kerry (Mass.) together with Senators John McCain (Ariz.) and Joseph I. To Lieberman (Conn.), in which she should congratulate the Libyans on their successful uprising and thanking the American troops for their "bravery."
"With this statement, we want to applaud the courage of the people of Libya who started to rebuild their country," Kerry said.
"Both sides of the political spectrum would like to express their support for their democratic efforts."
The sentences in question may look innocent, but no debate involving Libya has been an easy one so far.
During the summer, lawmakers from both sides kept arguing with each other and with the White House about the wording of a series of statements for approval or, conversely, rejecting the United States' military role in the NATO mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain presented a resolution authorising the limited use of the US armed forces in Libya.
The motion was rejected in the House because of the different views of the two political parties, so it was never even voted on in the Senate.
But on the same day that the motion was rejected in the House, the chamber also rejected a measure that would stop funding for US operations in Libya.
This found the US mission in Libya literally in legislative purges - Congress criticized the way President Obama ran the mission, but it clearly did not irritate his members to stop supporting him in his actions.
The hesitancy of the congress was eventually overtaken by other events.
The rebels captured Tripoli and 20 in August. On October, Gaddafi was killed.
The Nato mission officially ended on 31. October.
Now the Senate may be ready to act.
In its statement, the International Relations Committee "claims the people of Libya for their immeasurably courage and admirable tenacity they have made in an attempt to free their people" and "chewen the men and women of the United States' armed forces, as well as their allies, who have engaged in the operation to protect the Libyan population, for their extraordinary bravery and professionalism."
The statement also "confirms the United States' national interest in the successful and irreversible transition to democracy in Libya."
Will the new proposal receive the full support of the Commission for International Relations, or will the legislators be divided into two halves again, as was the case with the June proposal?
The latest version was opposed by Senator Richard G. Lugar (Ind.), the Republican Party's chief representative on the commission.
Lugar's spokesman said Monday that he had not yet seen the final version of the new proposal.
There will be a vote in the House this week on an amendment to the Constitution that would require a balanced budget, which should be the highest legislative priority of almost all Republicans and Democrats in Congress.
This measure, advocated by Bob Goodlatt (Va.), will be the first amendment to the Constitution on the budget or other subject to be voted on by the entire House or the Senate.
For the time being, other lawmakers, despite considerable efforts, have not yet succeeded in pushing their proposals through to the vote itself.
The Goodlatt proposal is just one of the 68 amendments to the Constitution, which were presented in the Congress and touched on a wide range of different topics.
Some of them were the same - the same motion to the House and Senate - and others were just minor variations by others.
In the House alone, you can find at least 15 versions of the balanced budget amendment and another handful that would like to "regulate federal spending."
While some of the proposals are identical, their advocates - especially novice Republicans who want to improve their reputation - boast their "authorism."
The revenue for budget regulation, which was approved in August, required both the House and the Senate to vote on the balance budget amendment.
In March, 58 senators voted in favour of a non-binding declaration in support of the creation of such an amendment.
In addition to the budget, several members also want to discuss the limitations on the number of periods in which congress members could serve, while Jose E. Serrano (N.Y.) wants to increase the number of periods that may be president.
Deputy Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Ill.) has offered a variety of amendments that would, among other things, guarantee the right to quality education and medical care.
A persistent proposal remains an amendment banning same-sex marriage marriage as well as an amendment banning the burning of the national flag.
Some lawmakers also want to allow the annulment of federal laws in the event that two-thirds of the states oppose them.
Although members of Congress appear to be very active in proposing various additions, they do not significantly defer to the average compared to previous years.
111. Congress offered 77 additions, while at 100. Congress was 66.
Their activity even pales in comparison to the early 1990s, when, according to Senate library statistics, members offered more than 150 additions every two years.
But they were not much more successful than current politicians.
The last amendment, which was added - 27th Amendment - was ratified in 1992, but was in fact proposed by Congress in 1789.
"Funned, but not defeated," Gifford says in her first television interview since the shooting
Ten months after she was injured at point-blank near close by a gunman in a public meeting with voters in Tucson, Gabrielle Gifffords (Ariz) appeared on national television on Monday night, sang along with a tune of the Broadcasting show "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" and said that she wanted more than a return to Congress to recover.
Giffords appeared on "20/20" on ABC News with Diane Sawyer. You could see that the making of sentences still had trouble her, and she needed help as she walked.
The entire show was documented by her difficult convalescence, which was necessary due to a bullet-induced bullet wounding through her skull, penetrating her left half of her brain, and out of her head at the back.
Surprisingly, she returned to the House three months ago to triumphantly take part in the debt ceiling vote.
In her first television interview since the January shooting, during which six people were killed and another 13 were injured, Giffords smiled, laughed and sang - describing her recovery as "difficult."
When Sawyer asked her how she felt, the 41-year-old Giffords, replied, "Pretty well."
The interview with Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of the one-hour special of the "20/20" episode, which aired on the eve of the couple's new book, entitled "Gabby: A Story of Courage and Hope."
The special watched the entire convalescence of Gifford since the January 8 shooting.
In the videos shot by Kelly during her first week, you can see Giffords in a hospital bed with a shaved head and a long scar across the forehead.
While her husband cheers her, she can't do more than lift one or two fingers at the time.
A few months later, Giffords is captured sitting in a wheelchair and therapists teaching her how to perform simple activities.
The nod of the head.
Pissing lips.
And then, her first word: "What."
Within a few days, Giffords had uttered another word - "toast" as she demanded a change in her breakfast.
Videos aired by ABC show that music played a pivotal role for Giffords' recuperation: The congresswoman sings on them along with the therapist for the melodies of "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" by Cyndi Lauper and "Free Fallin" by Tom Petty.
During the interview, Gifford, who devotes two hours a day to therapy, told Sawyer that she could not remember anything from the day of the shooting.
Her husband said he didn't read newspaper articles to Gifford for the shooting until March 12, when she first asked him who the six who was killed in the incident were.
The shooting is suspected of the shooting by Jared Lee Loughner, who is being held at the Missoury prison, where he is awaiting trial under the influence of forensit drugs.
"A lot of people died," Giffords told Sawyer.
"Terrible, horrible, horrible."
Kelly told Sawyer that at one point his wife said during her recovery, "I lost."
"So I said to her at once, "Gabby, you've not lost," Kelly described.
"You just got beat up.
But you make it, pull yourself together, come back even stronger than ever."
Military units encounter compassion rather than respect
The event was a gala on Wall Street that raised millions of dollars for war veterans in New York who have no roof over their heads.
Kid Rock sang a ballad of powerlessness, frustration and loss.
Hundreds of soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines, and marines ran around him.
The solemnly dressed crowd rose and applauded enthusiastically.
"Men and women serving in the military were considered heroes," said David Saltzman, who hosted the spring fundraiser.
The gala evening was attended by the then chairman of the committee of the chiefs of staff. In addition to him, Admiral Mike Mullen was on the scene, but he saw the role of the military units somewhat differently.
"They were all introduced as orphans," the officer wrote in an e-mail.
I'm sure the organizers meant well.
I know you do.
But what I saw was not respect. It was pity.
So the opposite impressions only illustrate the plight of the military's daunting relationship, and the often aloft, sometimes celebrated by the American public.
The military is boundless token in the praise for its victims.
But this praise comes at a cost, the soldiers say.
The public is increasingly acting as if they regret the individual in uniform.
"We're not the victims at all," Brigadier General Sean B. MacFarland, who commanded troops in Iraq and will soon leave Afghanistan.
"But the only way some can support us seem to be to put us in the role of unhappy souls."
This theme is very sensitive for army commanders who do not want to appear ungrateful or to spoil the public relations he serves.
They also realize that the anger that the troops returning from Vietnam had to face was far worse.
As a result, most of the words about remorse are uttered in silence and in private among war veterans.
As the two sons of retired Colonel Mark Cancian returned from combat actions to serve as Marine Corps members, their father warned them that their service would be viewed from two angles by people outside the military.
From the point of view of some, he will feel respect and astonished because they defeated the enemy rebels and visited exotic places.
But others will be wondering if "a bad, violent veteran is hiding under the surface," said Cancian, who participated in the fighting in Iraq and took his place in Washington in government on his return.
He claimed that when he was looking for a job, some of the people interviewed him subtly hinted at whether, so soon after returning to the fight, he could withstand the stress involved in work in Washington.
"If you talk about your service, you have to reckon with negative reactions," Cancian instructed his sons.
The military's concern stems in part from America's indifference to wars.
Successes on the battlefield rarely draws recognition in a country with little awareness of its own army and finds little of its own benefit to its own.
"As a nation, we no longer value army heroism as it used to be common in World War II," said Lieutenant General David Barno, who commanded U.S. troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the recognition from politicians and the public is focused mainly on the suffering of the men in arms.
The soldiers are honoured for the number of actions they endured, the number of friends they have lost, or for the extent of their injuries.
The military faces growing pressure to crack down on rape
This week, a decision will be made to see if the 28 women's and men's trial against the military for allegedly inaction in the event of rape will be launched.
If not, hundreds of other claimants are prepared to sue.
The first-class female Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old on the night of she was allegedly raped by an army colleague and was at 11 weeks pregnant.
It happened in October 2008, and she was heading to the barracks at the Miramar Air Force Base, north of San Diego. After dinner with a friend, she came across her male colleague carrying a box of 12 beers.
He asked her if she could join her, that they might have a little drink in her room.
"My headlight came on," Lyman said.
But the native Texan completely ignored her objections.
I thought: No, he's 19.
"He's from Texas," she said.
"I wish I'd listen to my instincts."
She claims that just minutes after they entered her room, the man walked over to her, threw her onto the bed and raped her.
This week, on 18 November, Lyman and 27 other existing or former members of the military will await the verdict of a hearing that could have a historic impact. This will take place in Arlington, Virginia, and it will be about whether the charges against former Defense Secretary Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will go to trial.
The charges state that Gates and Rumsfeld failed to fight against the spread of rape in the military, which is in violation of the constitutional rights of the soldiers.
The charges were filed in February by Washington lawyer Susan Burke, and the plaintiff party had 17 members at the time. Over the coming months, however, their numbers grew to 28-25 women and three men, all of whom claim to have been raped or otherwise sexually assaulted by their colleagues in the military, and that the military, after announcing these sphrases, failed to investigate, punish, and any pursuit of justice.
Burke says she's at the neck of the Army's top-ranking commanders, because the problem starts with them.
"The army is a directive system," he says.
"Who are the people who are in the position to stop efforts to implement measures against such acts? High Command."
Burke also claims to have contacted at least 400 other survivors since February, many of whom could become part of other lawsuits filed in the future.
Her strategy: Rather than grouping all the charges into this case - stacking all the eggs in one basket, as she says - she will file lawsuits in multiple different cases if the pressure is needed.
The team defending the Ministry of Defence is led by U.S. Attorney General Neil MacBride, who, together with his associates, has filed a motion to dismiss the case.
The court documents obtained by Newsweek detail the defense strategy - essentially the point of filing the military's failure to sue the military for the injuries they have suffered as members of the armed forces.
Under a Supreme Court order in 1950 called the Feres Doctrine, the federal government is not responsible for the injuries suffered by active-duty soldiers.
"The alleged injuries relate to the plaintiff's military service," the document reads.
The Ministry of Defence declined to comment on the matter.
But things have changed since the 1950s.
Although women are still officially allowed to serve in the fight, it is just a quibble: in modern wars, it is difficult to find a clearly given front line.
In the wars in both Iraq and Afghanistan, teams of female soldiers played an increasingly prominent role, especially in the area of communication with the civilian women in the war zone.
The result: 150 female soldiers were killed between these wars - two-thirds of them in the fight.
The time has come for upgrades to be modernized in the military, Burke explains.
She is not alone in her fight. In addition to her, the case is being handled by three other attorneys.
At the Yale Law School, visitors to the veteran's legal services seminar are preparing a lawsuit against four major military academies for the allegedly developing an atmosphere that promotes hatred of women.
Independently of this, the nonprofit organization of the American Vietnamese veterans is gathering the groundwork for its lawsuit targeting the military. This lawsuit focuses on the diagnosis of the "personal personality disorder" allegedly found in rape victims in order for the military to have an excuse to release them - according to activists such as Anu Bhagwati, a group of human rights activists Service's Action Network, it is a perfectly normal practice.
Its group had already filed a motion for a lawsuit against the State Veterans' Organisation in December, accusing it of discriminatory practices that were to be carried out in the processing of requests for assistance by those who claimed to have been sexually assaulted in the service.
Nine separate proposals were presented in Congress, made by a group of senators and members from both political parties, proposing a number of corrective measures.
According to the Office for Prevent and Address Sexual Violence of the Ministry of Defence, 3,158 sexual assaults were reported in 2010.
However, this type of attacks remains unannounced in most cases, and according to Pentagon's own estimates, the figure is equivalent to about 13.5 percent of the estimated 19,000 incidents that occurred in that year.
The report issued in March also dismantled the prosecution of suspects: In 2010, 20 percent of the cases reported in the military - half of the civil justice system - were taken to court.
Prosecutors, in the Burke representative's case, describe the attacks only as the first of a number of trauma.
First-class Private Lyman, for example, reported the alleged rape to the military police less than an hour after it was to take place.
During the night, she says, she was asked to repeat the details of her rape 11 times to various police, doctors and commanders.
She underwent all the examinations necessary to determine the rape, and the blood of her attacker was found in her bed - the wound she had given him on his arm.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman attended a court hearing, during which questions were asked about whether she had been in love with her boyfriend on the day of the attack.
Six people were summoned as witnesses to the reputation in favor of the alleged perpetrator, who was eventually acquitted.
"I remember the day the verdict was handed down," says Lyman.
"I felt like I'd give birth right there on the spot - I ran out of the courtroom screaming.'
"I was placed in a psychiatric unit, and when I got out, I remember saying to my commanding officer: It was not his trial. It was mine."
The Lymans were ordered to see a military psychiatrist who eventually diagnosed her with a personality disorder, calling her ineligible service.
In January 2010, she was dismissed from the army without honour and therefore without the right to the pension.
Whether the case of Lyman and the other prosecutors will move to the next stage or not, it's a long shot, says John Turley, Law Professor at George Washington's Law.
Of course, he notes, "From my point of view, they should be able to advance to the next stages of the deliberations."
Between them and the verdict, however, stands the doctrine in question, which has been criticised since the first time she saw the light of day.
I myself am a lifelong critic of the Feres Doctrine doctrine.
The military has been behind for several decades because their obligations do not give the same level of motivation stimuli and deterrent deternities.
He adds, "The chances are hard against them... but it's important for them to try."
Change will only happen if the good people are willing to fight.
If the hearing is not decided in their favour, Burkevo, the plaintiff's lawyer, will collect hundreds of other people who are ready to sue and begin working on other cases concerning the subject.
"We will not continue to fight the military on this issue for the reason for the reform from," he says.
Or until we die, whirry, from what comes first.
Walls have eyes: How scientists examine you on Facebook
Before Anders Behring Breivik became the new face of right-wing extremism in Europe, he was just another young man to present his anti-immigrant views online.
On Monday, Braivik, who confessed to the murderous rage in July, left for 77 people in Norway, attended his first public court hearing.
Although Breivik could act alone, he was certainly not lonely in cyberspace: he spent a lot of time at the computer during the preparation of the attack, chatting with some of the millions of nationalists supporting right-wing groups on the social networking site.
After this summer's tragedy, scientists want to learn more about these people.
But how to find them?
Easily - just go to Facebook.
"We realized that getting them is not really that hard at all," says Jamie Bartlett, the lead author of the British research team's recently published report on European digital populism.
The stock of personal information on Facebook is so comprehensive, says Bartlett, saying that it was enough for scientists to simply use the ad on the site to simply use the ad on the site to determine with complete precision the wanted demographic group - something that marketing workers have been doing for years.
Bartlett's team across Europe found half a million fans of right-wing groups, then focused their attention and sent out adverts. However, instead of inviting them through them to the newly formed group or offered them some dietary products, they called on them to fill in a questionnaire in which questions about the level of their education, their relationship to violence and optimism were raised, given their own future.
Through Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues managed to get results from more than 10,000 fans of 14 different right-wing groups in 11 European countries - without even having to leave the office.
"This is a whole new way of conducting research," Bartlett notes.
Some of the results are not so surprising: online supporters of right-wing groups are all young men who are irritated by the rising immigration rate.
But on the other hand, "those who combine their online activism with off-line activism are more sensible, more democratic, and less violent than those who remain hidden behind the computer screen all the time."
The work of the DEMOS team is just one example of how Facebook is becoming a new tool in the hands of scientists.
Research teams, health scientists and political researchers use these sites to study everything, from health problems to social trends hiding in status updates, contributions on the walls, and the "I like" buttons.
Facebook reports more than 800 million active users. Each of them provides three different data a day on average, which makes this social network a literal "information supernova" that is behind the development of many new research. The number of academic papers in whose name is the word Facebook rose to nearly 800% compared to five years ago.
For some scientists, the magic of Facebook is that it gives them the opportunity to study people without having to harass them on the street.
"It used to be that when you wanted to do a survey of the people of the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them."
"You'd have to get to a party where you'd never be let in," Bartlett says.
"All of this is what's breaking down Facebook - you're just going straight to them."
Others argue that the site can offer a way to identify and avoid a socio-health problem.
In a recent study by Dr. Megan Moren of the University of Wisconsin, a research team found that university students who discussed their drunkenik outings on Facebook were much more at risk of the problem of alcoholism than the students who kept quiet about the subject.
Moreno suggests that students' peers should monitor the site and come forward with an offer to help a student who publishes too many drunken statuses.
"The problem can't be solved unless you can diagnose it," Dimitri Christakis, co-author of Dr. Moreno and director of the Center for the Health, Conduct, Conduct and Development of Children at the Seattle Children's Research Institute, told the Washington Post.
"We have found a way to identify at-risk children who we would not otherwise have a chance to discover."
Facebook itself is constantly probing the data of its users.
The site's information team has produced statistics on the context of the relationship statuses and the day of St. Valentine's Day, 2010 voter turnout and the nation's satisfaction coefficient (mainly using the information they had access to - Internet freedom advocates have long argued that the site should make its information treasure available to others for research).
But Facebook users know that the site is watching them, whether they like it or not - in exchange for the chance to play Scrabble with a friend who is thousands of miles away, you need to give the page your personal information.
But what if Facebook users become part of a research they don't even know about?
Scientists have clearly defined rules on how to collect off-line data. However, online data is accessible to everyone.
"I don't think most of the users thought scientists could look into their profiles," says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at London Knowledge Lab, on a 2006 study he conducted using the public Facebook walls of his students.
"As far as they were concerned, they took it to mean that the information was between them and their friends."
It is then also to consider the question of the methodology.
Even in offline research, there is no guarantee that the subject is completely honest.
There is no way to verify on Facebook how much of the information on the profile and the posts on the wall are true.
"What you say on Facebook and what you do outside of Facebook are two completely different things," Selwyn explains.
That is why Selwin, who spent years researching new technologies, thinks that the pencil and notebook remain the best possible tool to be used in the research.
"When you go out into the real world and talk to real people, it's something that can't be replaced," he says.
"Social research should be about society and social activities - and a hell of a lot of social activities is still taking place off-line."
"Cold and Inhuman": Anders Behring Breivik attends his first public trial
Anders Behring Breivik, a man who has confessed to ploting two attacks in which 77 people were killed in Norway this summer, described himself as a "deliberate" fighter during his first public judicial hearing in Oslo.
"I am the military commander in the Norwegian Resistance Movement and among the Knights Templar," he said in court, where 500 people gathered.
"I object to the Court of Justice because you were given a mandate by the organizations supporting the ideology of hatred and because it promotes multiculturalism."
"I confess to my actions, but I do not plead guilty for them."
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during this monologue because "he did not want to give Breivik the opportunity to use this hearing as a stage from which he could espouse his views."
For the same reason, he refused to allow Breivik, who brought a prepared speech, to address relatives of his victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered the police to keep Breivik in custody for another 12 weeks, banned him from contacting the media for a period of 4 teens, and announced that the final authorities would have complete control over all his visits and all correspondence for eight weeks.
The hearing was attended by about 30 relatives of the victims and survivors.
Some came in the hope of being able to look the Breivik in the eye, others to make sure he was held firmly locked up.
They all took part in order to move the case to an early conclusion.
"It seemed cold and inhuman to me," one of the survivors of the attack told NRK.
"It wasn't pleasant, but for all I can say that after I saw and heard the suspect, I moved back a little bit further mentally."
In a dark suit and a blue tie, Breivik remained calm and professional throughout the hearing. Upon arriving and going into the building, without difficulty, viewed by the journalists present and the survivors.
Despite Breivik's bizarre notion that he was part of a larger "resistance" movement, the judge found that he was not insane, and noted that there was no evidence that he had an accomplice.
For some, it may be a comfort to have been that the attacks of 22. June seems to be the work of a single extremist and not a group of radicals.
But this does not automatically diminish the grief and confusion that are still in the minds and hearts of the nation.
"I wish she'd fall out like a monster, but it's not," a relative of one of the victims said.
"If I did, things would be a lot easier."
7 lessons learned from a lost interview with Steve Jobs in a movie heading to cinemas this week
As soon as Steve Jobs 5. He died in October, the opinions of people who compared him with Henry Ford - and elected him as his genius The greatest modern inventor.
At the recently rediscovered Jobs interview, which was brushed aside for a special film heading to cinemas this week, it will be the fact that its creative mind perfectly understood the business processes and the workflows behind its products.
He was an amazing designer, a dreamer and self-appointed member of the hippie movement, but also a pedantic organizer and a man who matches each detail to the smallest detail - he believed that many entrepreneurs suffer from "the idea that a truly great idea is 90 per cent of their work... [but] there is still a long journey of mourning work between the excellent idea and the excellent resulting product."
In 1995, Bob Cringely worked on the TV show Triumf of Computer Fools, which dealt with the dawn of personal computers. During filming, a unique, more than one-hour interview took place.
By this time it had been ten years since Jobs had been forced to leave Apple, and he was busy with his new computer company, NeXT, and was eager to see how the general public would receive the Internet.
In the end, only a short part of Cringely's entire interview was used on the TV show, and the original copies of the interview were told that they had been lost in the transfer.
Shortly after Jobs's death, however, the VHS copies were found in the director's garage.
It is this material, slightly edited, that is based on the 68-minute Steve Jobs: Lost Interview, which is heading to selected cinemas this Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone who is notorious for his reluctance to provide longer interviews, Jobs is surprisingly thrilled to be able to talk about his technological philosophy and business strategies.
And he also turns out to be a very thoughtful person.
Four times during the interview, there is a longer pause between the question and the answer - 10 to 15 seconds of thinking about when you can see how Jobs thinks through the answer perfectly to make it as both apt and accurate and accurate.
There are also moments when Jobs' perfectionism surfaces, with Cringely's questions impatiently and propelling him to get more important issues and themes faster.
The interview was filmed before the Pixar, iPod or iPhone era, and there are terrifyingly prophetic ideas when Jobs assesses what other companies do well and badly, offering their own vision of the future in the field of computer technology.
It's one thing to read through the posthumous reviews of Jobs's career, but there's something raw and inspirational about Jobs, whom we see here as an eager dreamer in the flourish of his genius.
He has here her own vision of what a thing could and should look like.
It wasn't long before he spoke his thoughts, he also began putting them into practice.
A quick summary of the seven scenes from the Lost interview, which is definitely worth noting:
How he learned to run the business:
"During the years of the business, I always asked: Why do you do this? and the answer was always the same: Well, that's how it's just done."
No one knows why he does what he does, never thinks about business-related matters in the dark.
I found out.
Jobs continues to describe his efforts to simplify the accounting at Apple.
He was completely confused about the way the cost was recorded - they often started with the inscription "standard cost," he could only surmise with the amount. At that point, he decided to set off on his own path - he developed an automatic tool that guaranteed that they could determine the business costs in a moment.
How he made the rascal on the Pope:
Jobs recalls the "Bod of Box" he had built with Steve Wozniak - a device that allowed people to hack effectively into the phone company and call anywhere in the world free of charge.
A number of the devices have been written about the device in the past, but it is literally infectious for the Blue Box to describe the Blue Box as a tool of power.
He tells how he and Wozniak tested the device using a paid phone and were switched from one AT&T network to another during the call, while using as many satellites as possible.
"We've traveled around the world at least half a dozen times like this, so when we yelled something into a paid phone, it came in from the second phone at the door a minute later," laughs Jobs.
"We were young, and we found that we could build a thing on our own that was capable of managing infrastructure worth billions of dollars worldwide."
Two of us made a tiny thing that could control a much bigger giant - it was an incredible experience and I don't think Apple would have been created without it.
Jobs continues with a description of the prank he and Wozniak almost made to the end. They called the Vatican to the Vatican through the Blue Box in the middle of the night and asked if they could speak to the Pope, posing as best they were as they were for Henry Kissinger.
Gradually, the rising-level members of the Catholic Church were called in to speak to the American diplomat in the middle of the night, and it was only before they woke up the Pope himself to the phone that the pair laughed and put the earpiece down.
How he fell in love with technology (and phoned Bill Hewlett):
When he was 12 and he was looking for spare parts to build a vibrator, he found the number for Bill Hewlett in the phone book and called him.
Not long after their 20-minute interview, Jobs already had a secure summer job at Hewlett-Packard.
"She influenced me unbelievably. It was the only company I met at the time, and it was shaping my view of what such a company was and how to treat its employees."
Jobs later became one of HP's employees who visited the company's research labs in Palo Alto, where he saw "the first desktop computer ever made."
It was the size of a suitcase, he had a CRT monitor, and I immediately fell in love with it.
As a teenager, I went higher and higher at HP, hanging around that computer and starting to write programs for him.
How to devise innovation:
In several places, Jobs talks during the interview about how he devises new products while on the fly.
In the early days of his career, when he set out to sell a few straight-line boards, a customer asked him to assemble a whole computer for him.
He had only 30 paid days at his disposal, during which time he had to devise, assemble, and deliver the finished equipment.
When he was later at Apple, he recalls the problems they faced in developing computer mice:
"I remember arguing quite wildly . . . they yelled at me that it would take five years [to build a mouse that would cost $300 to get tired of it, and I got out of the way I got it out and found a designer."
Ninety days later, we were able to produce a perfectly reliable mouse for $15.
How big companies are running out of breath:
A long time ago, before he led the resurrection of Apple, Jobs foresawly predicted that many industrial leaders would falter in their vision and lose their market share.
"Let's say you work at IBM or Xerox, so you make better copiers or printers, and then what?"
You have a monopoly on the market, so the company could no longer be more successful.
At that point, sales and marketing are in the system, so the companies are run by the people in charge of this, while the people in charge of their own products are out of the decision-making process.
The technology genius who has led the company to its unshakable position is now replaced by people who have no idea of good or bad products - skill and technical knowledge are essential.
That's what happened at Xerox...
Xerox could have owned literally the entire computer industry.
It could have been ten times the size of it, could have been Microsoft's nineties...
Instead of winning, however, they set up a loss.
How he sees innovation as a form of art:
"There's still a long way to go and a lot of work between the excellent idea and the excellent result of the idea... and as the great idea develops, it changes and grows."
During that time, you learn a lot about him.
You have to accept a whole series of compromises - certain things you just can't make electrons, glass, robots or factories do.
You have to keep in mind the 5,000 things in mind - different concepts - and put them together...
In the end, it depends on taste - you try to think of the best things that mankind has ever created, and in a way, you try to project them into what you do.
Picasso said that good artists copy, but the best artists steal.
I was never ashamed of the best ideas being stolen.
The Macintosh Society was so amazing and successful because the people who worked in it were excellent musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians and, coincidentally, also the best computer experts in the world.
If it weren't for computers and new technologies, they'd do amazing things in completely different industries.
Scalia and Thomas dined with opponents of the Health Care Act at the time of their case being handled by the court
The day the Supreme Court sat behind closed doors to discuss the politically controversial question of whether it would accept an objection to the President Obama Health Care Act, two of his judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, attended a gala dinner sponsored by a law firm that will take part in the trial.
The event took place last Thursday, when all nine judges met to discuss the submitted submissions.
One of the cases discussed was a lawsuit brought by 26 states challenging the radical overhaul of health care passed by Congress last year - a law that mobilized conservative activists around the world.
The judges agreed to hear the suit. But a 5.5-hour meeting is expected in March, with an earlier call for the presidential election to be further stirred up, which is scheduled for 2012 and will be in full swing at the time of the decision.
The lawyer who will face the court and tries to reach the law's rejection will most likely be Paul Clement, who served as the United States Attorney General under George W. Bush. Bush.
Clement's law firm, Bancroft PLLC, was one of nearly two dozen companies that helped sponsor the annual Federalist Society Group's annual dinner, which has been involved in advocating conservative legal principles for years.
Another company that sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, is represented by one of the trade associations challenging the law, the so-called National Independent Business Federation.
Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc, for which huge funds are at stake in the process.
Dinner was held at a Washington hotel hours after a court discussion on the subject of the case.
It was attended, among others, by Mitch McConnell, the Senate Republican's top official and a confirmed opponent of the Health Care Act.
And the guest launch? Scalia and Thomas.
This is nothing new: These pair of judges have been attending the Federalist Society's actions for years.
Nor is it anything that is in conflict with the rules of ethics.
In fact, these judges are exempt from the obligation to comply with the principles of conduct to which the lower federal judges are subject.
However, if this were not the case, their behaviour would certainly fall under the C4 principle, which states that "the judge may participate in the events that are currently related and other organisations are organising to obtain funds, but the judge may not be a speaker, a guest of honour, or be placed on the agenda of the event."
Still, Scalia and Thomas's relationship with the two law firms performing in the case, as well as companies with a huge financial interest in the case, were more than enough to alert activists calling for ethics in the government.
"This shocking violation of ethics and indifference to the code of conduct is contradicting the claims of several judges that the Supreme Court behaves under the same rules that apply to all other federal judges," said Bob Edgar, president of Common Cause.
"The judges drank and dined for a social benefit together with the legal representatives awaiting the case before the court."
Their presence and assistance in raising funds through this action undermine the legs with all claims of unbiased, which is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas showed little sympathy to their critics, telling them that they also easily combined their judicial duties with actions by groups such as the Federalist Society.
Thomas's wife, Ginni, is a high-ranking conservative activist.
Moreover, the Conservatives argue that the ethical problem lies mainly with Judge Elena Kagan and not Scalia with Thomas.
Kagan worked as Prosecutor General under President Obama when the first objections to the law emerged in court.
Kagan's critics are pressuring her to renounce her involvement in the case, claiming that she had fought so much for the law at the time than she could be unbiased now.
Kagan gave no indication that she was about to resign.
Boeing wins record-breaking $18 billion for jet aircraft
The Emirates airline orders 50 two-wheeler Boeing 777 jet aircraft with the option to buy 20 more.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliner aircraft to Aman Air, for which it collects more than $1 billion.
When a company gets an order for 50 pieces of its products, it's usually no cause for celebration.
But if the aircraft manufacturer Boeing Co. and the price of these 50 aircraft is a combined record $18 billion, it is a different matter.
Equally important news is where Boeing won the contract: the Middle East, a growing gold mine for future aircraft orders.
According to a forecast released Monday, the Chicago-based company estimates that the airline in the Middle East will need 2,520 $450 billion worth of aircraft over the next 20 years.
Over the weekend, Boeing announced its biggest order in history in terms of dollar value for commercial aircraft - 50 two-cylinder jet Boeing 777.
The sensational contract came from the airline Emirates, based in Dubai.
Boeing told the 2011 Dubai Air Show that the airline had the option to purchase an additional 20 aircraft, which would allow the total value of the contract to rise to $26 billion.
On Monday, Boeing announced that Oman Air had ordered six Boeing 787-8s, sometimes also called a Dreamliner, which boasted significantly better fuel consumption and passenger equipment.
The total price of these six aircraft exceeds USD 1 billion.
"This is an excellent report for Boeing as a whole," said Neal Dihora, an analyst for Morningstar.
"The quality of these specific customers is very high."
Many airlines in the Middle East belong to the country's oil-producing nations.
This means that they not only have the money to pay for the planes, but the rise in the price of fuel - mostly damaging to the airline, because it is one of its biggest costs - is not so decisive, because the country makes money on higher oil prices alone.
This is important because they are not as likely as in other airlines that they could cancel or postpone aircraft orders because of the increase in fuel prices, Dihora says.
"They have such natural protection," he says.
The contract from Emirates is consolidating Boeaing's leading position in the broad-flagged aircraft market and is driving into the narrows of Airbus SAS, which wanted to try to erode Boeing's dominance with its transport model A350.
Boeing's victory comes four months after Airbus officials announced that the first flight of their largest A350, a direct competitor to the 777-300ER, would be postponed.
The postponement was made because customers demanded a greater utilitarian load and hath range, so the manufacturer took the time to give the machine more engine power.
The cost of Boeing Co's actions rose 1.5% to $67.94.
The Mexican president's sister appears to have been defeated in the Michani elections
Luisa Maria Calderon claims that her opponent, Fausto's PRI, was helped in the hunt for the governor's chair by drug traffickers.
Felipe Calderon's sister seems to have lost the governor's post in Michoacán in the violent state election. On Monday, she subsequently said that one of her opponents had been helped to win by drug traffickers.
Preliminary results were attributed to the leadership in the Western State's governor's election to Faust Vallej by the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI.
"The involvement of the members of organized crime in the whole election process and especially into yesterday's election process is alarming not only for Michoacán, but for our entire country," Luisa Maria Calderon said in an interview with the radio the day after the election on Sunday.
"They threatened our candidates, members of the polling group... They confiscated the ballot boxes, built roadblocks... and let people vote to order for the PRI.
The PRI ruled Mexico for seven decades until it lost the presidency in 2000.
But he plans to return to power soon, and winning the election in Michoacán is an important step in this effort.
The PRI Party hopes to win the presidential election in July.
Vallejo seems to have beaten Calderon, who was still leading the day before the election, very narrowly.
Calderon, the Conservative candidate for her brother National Action Party, or PAN, refused to recognize Vallejon as the winner.
Third was Silvano Aureolis, the candidate for the left-wing Democratic Revolution Party, or PRD, which until now controlled the governor's office. For the fractious and unlucky party, it is a very unfortunate loss ahead of the 2012 presidential election.
Aureoles also refused to recognise the preliminary results as valid.
Vallejo, the former mayor of the capital of the state on behalf of Morelia, rejects any relationship with drug traffickers and encourages other candidates to recognize the results.
For a long time, Michoacán was controlled by drug cartels specializing in marijuana, heroin and methamphetamics.
This is President Calderon's native state of birth, and it was in Michoacán that he launched a military fight against traffickers in December 2006.
But the violence persisted.
The mayor of the PAN party, a supporter of Luisa Maria Calderon, was assassinated just a week before the election, and many of the election candidates withdrew from the election out of fear.
However the results of the elections in Michoacán look like for the PRI, the victory will help the party gain a new boost.
The expected PRI representative in the presidential election, Enrique Pena Nieto, from Wahington, congratulated Vallejo and said: "I think this victory could be very encouraging, given the coming year."
ADB calls on Asia to help save Eurozone
Asian Development Bank has called on India and China to be ready to help save the Eurozone from its severe debt crisis, or there could be an overall downturn in the world economy, which would also have a negative impact on the growth of the economies in Asia.
Rajat Nag, the CEO of ADB, a company-based company based in Manila, said that the world's two fastest-growing economies must "do everything in their power" to help help the monetary bloc's rapid recovery through the International Monetary Fund, or direct bilateral agreements.
He warned that the states of the Bric group [Brazil, Russia, India, China] were following all European difficulties "too dispassionately" and said that Asian financial assistance, combined with European leadership and the funds, would help to spark the long-term collapse of the global economy.
"We're all in this together."
"So anyone who can help Europe out of the crisis is useful," he told the Financial Times during an interview at the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
"Asia may be protected to some extent, but it's certainly not immune."
"So if China and India can help, they should definitely do it."
The European Monetary Association has been in a hard time being tested for months by the severe debt crisis.
In recent days, Italy's borrowing costs have risen dangerously, with the prime ministers of both Italy and Greece resigning.
The growing debt crisis in Europe has raised concerns about the fact that it could once again drag the global economy into recession, and calls began to emerge to bring new booming leading economies together and help the Eurozone find a solution.
Mr Nag had predicted that all Asian support would be channelled through the IMF, but noted that two-sided assistance - such as the purchase of the European Union's financial assistance fund, the institution for European financial stability, the European financial stability institution - would give the Asian partners European countries more negotiating options.
Anand Sharma, India's Minister of Commerce, said that "India will do what it can to do" to help the Eurozone, as its own economy is now suffering from a decline in exports and a drying up of foreign capital inflows.
"No one wants the Eurozone to remain unstable and restless," he said.
"We stand before a tough task and we must maintain a high rate of growth."
"This is not an alternative, it is a bare fact, because how else could we find employment for tens of millions of our young men and women."
Others argue that emerging economies such as India's emerging economies have nothing to do to help European economies when they are forced to face their own serious economic problems.
Ashutosh Varshney, a professor at Brown University in the US said it would be very difficult to explain the aid for Europe to the 1.2 billion people of India, with 800 million of which live on USD 2 or less per day.
"Someday they might find out that the Greeks retire at 50 and enjoy the beaches on holiday, which would be difficult to explain to them," he noted.
Similarly, Lee Howell, the Director General of the World Economic Forum, questioned why Indian stocks should be used to keep well-paid jobs to many Greek citizens in poorly managed and loss-making sectors such as rail transport.
Mr Nag stressed that the crisis of the Eurozone was threatening a 'hazardous domino effect'.
The bank's forecast that there will be 7.5% economic growth in Asia between 2011/2012 is now facing a "risk of decline" because of the European threat.
He said that vulnerable emerging markets must create "unpredictable spending plans" to be protected from decline and significant capital outflows from their economies.
A Pentagon warning about possible defense cuts
In Congress, on Monday, Defense Secretary Leon Panetta duly placed a good foot under the cauldron warning that looming, budget cuts could threaten national security and trigger a financial chain reaction beginning with the Pentagon and continuing through the battlefield in Afghanistan to civilian assembly lines.
The Pentagon will already have to spend a $450 billion cut in the budget over the next ten years, but it is now worried about a reduction of an additional $600 billion if Congress fails to reach an spending deal.
"The effects of these cuts would be devastating for the entire resort," Panetta wrote in a letter to Senators John McCain, Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, South Carolina.
He said that Congress's inability to reach a budget agreement and the resulting so-called attachment would cause a 23% flat-rate decline and a halt to many new projects.
"Because of such a huge reduction, used in this reckless way, it will not be possible to carry out most of our construction or shipbuilding projects - you can't just buy three-quarters of a building or a ship. In addition, there could be a serious damage to further modernization efforts," Panetta wrote to the senators.
"We will also be forced to separate many of our civilian staff, and as the reduction is to take place so quickly, we will also almost certainly have to send civilians on forced leave in order to be able to meet the target requirements."
"These changes can shake with the faith of those who cared for our army and seriously damage its readiness."
Eventually, the cuts will also affect the combat units, Panetta announced.
"Although the accounts for financing possible war operations overseas will not be directly affected by this subshugging, the operations there will be negatively affected by serious changes in other budgets," Panetta warned.
"There will be cuts to the contract staff, which will result in delays in the agreed contracts supporting the war efforts of our people."
"The stocks of paid employees will be reduced, which will also result in late payments to suppliers and subsequent breaches of legal and political support."
Both Senators had written off the Panetts ten days earlier, asking for details regarding the potential effects on the Department of Defense's automatic cuts.
"The consequences of the Ministry of Defense's ascendancy could cause a rapid degradation of the view of the United States as a world military power."
"We are strictly against this harsh measure," the senators announced in a joint statement Monday afternoon when they released the letter of Panetta.
"It's not a conclusion we can live with, and we certainly don't want to sign off on it."
"The cutbacks planned are a threat to the national security of the United States, which we should not allow."
"It remains to be seen whether Panetto's letter and fresh warnings will increase the pressure on Congress to the approval of the budget and intensify the votes calling to omit the Pentagon from the list of cut-down areas.
The Panetta had been increasingly open in interviews about possible cuts recently, even as he himself had moved to his senior position at the Pentagon with long years of experience in approving budgets in Congress and the White House, so he knew he was in a tough fight.
At a press conference held in the week of the week, the Defence Minister hinted at a brief picture of what his resort might be waiting for - the army's shell, but inside it would be missing the core.
"He'll be like a ship without sailors."
"He'll be like an ammo-free brigade."
"He'll be like an air force without trained pilots."
"It will be like a paper tiger, like an army of barracks, buildings and bombs without a sufficient number of trained soldiers to complete the mission," Panetta said at the start of the Pentagon's speech.
"She'll be like a forceless unit with no morality, unprepared and unable to cope with a possible enemy."
"As a result, he will welcome aggression..."
In the annex, supplied with the letter to McCain and Graham, the Panetta specifies how the reduction will result in "significant operational risks: late response to crises, conflicts and disasters; a significant reduction in the possibility of drops and deployments around the world; the anticipated unacceptable risk in future combat operations."
In addition, the Panetta added that some of the largest defense projects could face an end, including those already being tested, as well as those that are only in the early stages of planning.
The list included the F35 project, a planned new bomber, a new-generation ballistic submarine, a new coastal combat ship, and a new ground combat vehicle to replace the Army and the Marine Corps.
By halting further development and testing of the F35, $80 billion would be saved over the next decade, but its proponents say it is a necessary next step in improving the military, which needs to be dealt with possible threats from China and other rivals.
How to recognize a lie
A glimpse of recent newspaper headlines suggests how serious and pervasive lies and deceitings are in everyday life.
Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain is busy accusing him of sexually harassing several women - both parties claiming to be lying to the other.
Administrators at Penn State University were accused of perjury when they tried to hide records of a retired football coach sexually assaulting the boys.
Last week, French President Nicolas Sarkozy was caught calling US President Barrack Obama with a microphone that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is a liar.
The lie has been able to destroy the entire career and undermine the stability of many countries.
New York congressman and internet exhibitionist Anthony Weiner made a fool of himself by releasing information that was immediately refuted by indisputable evidence.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards has been accused of using the funds of his campaign to try to conceal his illegitimate affair.
And no one ever forgets the media circus that came around Bill Clinton when he lied during his second term about his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
It's crawling with stories of cheating at school and university.
There are cases where teachers themselves give their students test answers just to make their own thoughts look good.
Mentors who should be teaching otherwise send a message that a lie and a hoax are acceptable.
How many scams do we encounter?
Studies show that on a single day, you lie somewhere between 10 and 200 cases.
Let's assume that many of them are merciful lies.
Another study showed that strangers had lied three times in the first minutes of their first meeting in their lives.
Determining lies, or "recognizing lies," is a necessary skill that should be adopted by everyone, whether for personal or professional reasons.
But it is no social game that is similar to, shall we say, Sharad, when one shouts, "I have you". Recognition of deception is a serious science sector working with scientific data collected over the past six decades at prestigious universities during detailed research projects, especially in the field of psychology and philosophy.
One of the research results is that most of the old myths about the lie have been debunked.
The liars are looking into your eyes.
It's not like they're stumbling, stuttering, blushing or fidgeting.
But don't infer from the fact that it is somehow difficult to spot and detect liars.
A trained lie identifier can detect the truth from a sentence structure, small facial expressions, the way questions are made and their timing.
I have spent several years gathering scientific knowledge from a large and evolving industry on the recognition of lies, and it is clear that the detection of deception is a modern skill that can be easily learned and can be very helpful in today's complex world - especially if your work duties include hiring, holding interviews, negotiating or leading people.
Good liars can read well in others, let them relax in alertness, directing their emotions, and intuitively aware of how the other side accepts them.
We know from research that extroverts lie more often than introverts, that men uttering more "besty" lies, while women call more lies "focused on others" - mostly to protect someone's feelings - that married people lie less often to their partners than single people (but the lies they say tend to be "outrageous").
We also know that if you are seen as a sinner, others feel less guilty when they lie to you.
How do you know if someone's lying?
First observe the subject's normal behaviour.
It's called "initial observation."
Thanks to him, he will have a later finding out what to compare with.
Notice the subject's posture, his laughter, his voice work.
You should know if someone is normally tapping your legs constantly, lest you improperly accuse of lying just because they start tapping with their foot in the middle of a meeting.
Then try to identify clusters of false verbal and non-verbal behavior.
But think of this only as warning signals, not as evidence of a lie.
People who utter the lie can stop moving the upper half of their body when they try to remember their made-up story, they can turn their toes to the door, romp to the exit, significantly change their posture, or show "release after the interview" - an exaggerated relieved sigh and a change of position when the confession is difficult to confine.
The interviewers' interviewers often give a false signal that the interview is over, just to see what the relief will look like after it is over.
Also feel the subject's language.
Famous is the story of Scott Peterson once misleading and using the previous time when he claimed that his murdered woman was alive, which ran a nationwide search for her body.
Plainty individuals can also express themselves aloofly: "I had no sexual relationship with that lady... Miss Lewinsky" or repeat the difficult question in the whole case.
The most common verbal characters are very slight.
Some people can use a lot of "extending language" when they answer the difficult question: "Well... to tell you the truth... from what I know... to the best of my knowledge."
We don't learn much of the facts in that answer, and it's often another warning signal.
There is no spell to reveal any lie, but it is possible to master the skills by which the lie can be viewed.
Using these skills, one will have a better chance of not flying a liar and a con man in his personal and work.
The controversial plan to build the oil pipeline will be redirected after the threat of a delay in U.S. government approval emerged
A few days after the Obama administration threatened to postpone approval of a planned oil pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico - setting unions against each other, but reassuring the environmentalists - a company to build a pipeline that said it was willing to redirect the project to set things in motion again.
TransCanada announced Monday evening that it will move the planned pipeline route from the environmentally sensitive Sandhills area in Nebraska and is confident that the project will be approved anyway.
The company announced the decision at a press conference at the headquarters of the non-Arab government.
TransCanada's Alex Pourbax insigning alleges that the company is confident that the construction of the pipeline will eventually be approved, even though it will take a different route.
That announcement came after the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced last week that it was postponing a decision on the federal permit of the project, from which it would not carry out studies of possible alternate routes by which it would be possible to interfere in the Sandhills region of Nebraska and the waterproofing layer of Ogallala, the vast underground water supply pool.
"This is really a move forward," Republican Representative Lee Terry of Nebraska told Fox News.
A new environmental report commissioned by the State Department would likely postpone any decision until 2013, a year after next year's election, but the authorities refuse to play any role in the decision with politics.
In a written statement last week, Obama described the decision as a request from the State Department and expressed his support for it.
The 1,700-mile-long pipes will be connected by Canada and the Gulf of Mexico.
From the province of Alberta to the Refinery in Texas, 700,000 barrels of oil flow through me every day.
This pathway will need to be intersected by six states.
This project is utterly hated by environmentalists, but loved by the work crews, who estimate that 20,000 new jobs will appear when working on the pipeline.
But the Nebraska lawmakers opposed the plan, considering introducing laws that would force the company not to interfere with the Sand Hills region and the waterproof Ogallal layer, the main source of drinking water and irrigation.
An existing study on the environmental impact commissioned by the State Department found that the project would only have a minor negative environmental impact, but a source in the energy industry said that the inspector general from the Ministry had commissioned a new review of the entire process of the original study, focusing mainly on two issues.
It was once that the lobbyist hired to TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was a Plary Clinton adviser in 2008, was not in the program of a conflict of interest.
Next, whether the firm that was hired for the original study was not chosen inappropriately because it had ties to TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle is accused of vomiting in fear
The New York family claims that singer Patti LaBelle raided the lobby of their Manhattan house furiously and scared their daughter so much that she threw up in fear.
The singer's "Lady Marmalade" climb scares eighteen-month-old Genevieve Monk so much that she suffered "angry changes, sleep disorder," and "an increased fear of strangers," her family says in a lawsuit filed with the Manhattan Supreme Court.
On November 10 of last year, stage technician Kevin Monk, his wife, Roseanna, a kindergarten teacher, and Genevieve were planning a family trip.
When Kevin Monk brought the car, Roseanna Monk and her luggage went down to the vestibule of their home in the Riverside Boulevard section, carrying Genevieve with her.
Roseanna Monk said she had stopped at the door for a moment and put the child down for a moment.
"Someone showed up behind my back and said, "Do you know what your daughter is doing?" I said "yes" and I went to get her to pick her up."
LaBelle reprimanded the pregnant woman in an exasperated manner.
"In an aggressive tone, she said to me, "You shouldn't put your daughter at the door,"" said Roseanna Monk.
"I told her, "I don't care about your opinion.""
She became enraged and began to speak dirty - shouting loudly with the gimmicks...
She was carrying a bottle of water and began splashing water at me.
She claims Genevieve had a hysterical fit.
"I said to the woman, "Look at what you did to my daughter.""" said the child's mother.
LaBelle threw herself at her mother - who was still in Genevieve's arms - and had to be stopped by her escort, who subsequently dragged her into the waiting car, Roseanna Monk testified.
The daughter, meanwhile, was screaming so much that she threw up, she added.
Later, the family sent a letter demanding an apology from LaBelle, but received no reply.
Lawyer and spokesperson for the singer LaBelle are not responding to our phone calls to comment on the entire case.
The lawsuit is seeking unspecified damages, but the family attorney's attorney, Sam Davis, said he took the case up to the case free of charge and that the family plans to donate all the extracted money to a charity dedicated to children with cancer.
"The purpose is to force Patti LaBelle to take responsibility for her actions," Davis said.
"This behavior is completely unacceptable, especially if it is directed at the school teacher holding an 18-month-old baby in her arms."
The climate's incursion to hinder the economy
During the first year of Mario López Valdez's government, unemployment and unreliability rose in Sinaloa, with foreign investment declining, and with them the economy
2011 will be written in the economic history of Sinaloo. This is the first year of the government of Mario López Valdez, which itself calls itself a government of change. This government has brought with it high expectations for economic progress, however, due to adverse climatic conditions at the beginning of the year, no growth was observed and even a decline in the main indicators of economic development.
Low February temperatures caused millions of losses in agriculture, curtailed the growth opportunities for the state economy, responsible for a 3.6% reduction in economic activity in the first semester of this year. In the area of agriculture, there was a historic decline of 31.16%, which disrupted the dynamism of other economic sectors as well.
According to the damage report issued by the Mexican Sustainable Rural Development Council, the damage was recorded on 582,835 hectares of cultivated land, of which 78.03% were completely destroyed and partial damage was found for the remaining 21.07%. The main crops destroyed include vegetables, corn and peas.
The decline in economic activity until November was caused by a constant rise in unemployment in the state. According to the National Institute for Statistical and Geography, the unemployment rate in the state recorded an increase in the first three quarters. Between January and March, the city of Sinaloa's 555,053 people were unemployed, representing an unemployment rate of 4.53% of the economically active population. In the second quarter, unemployment rose to 5.28%, and between July and August, average unemployment continued to rise to a figure of 6.19%, representing around 74,000 unemployed. Compared to the first quarter, the number of unemployed people increased by 18,969 people.
Less liquidity
Unemployment during the year in the state of Sinaloa is due to multiple factors. According to Gerard López Cervantes, director of the Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences of the UAS, the rise in unemployment can be explained indirectly, based on steps taken at the level of public policy.
"We are witnessing an increasing unemployment rate related to various factors. These include, among other things, the loss of liquidity in the market due to resource constraints on the basis of legislation passed by the Congress in connection with the fight against money laundering. It is not easy for people who illegally seize up with dollars to make money, invest them or use them for something," he pointed out.
Stopping migration
López Cervantes said the demographic factor was also involved in the rise in unemployment.
"The number of people going abroad to work abroad, to the United States, has been reduced, both for reasons of difficult entry and then also because, even if these people cross the country, it is difficult for them to get a job. So people remain and demand work from our state, and so unemployment is rising," he said.
Unreliability
The analysis of the labour market in Sinaloa is also deteriorating due to the increasing unreliability that prevails in the area of working conditions. According to the National Institute for Statistical and Democracy, 60.38% of the employed population in the state works without paying benefits to the social security administration.
Adding to unemployment and unreliability are other features of the labour market, such as low pay. In this administrative territory, the lowest salaries are paid in the country, as reported by the registers of the Mexican Institute of Social Security and the Labor Secretariat and Social Planning.
The average monthly income of the Sinaloa working state was 5,352 pesetas by September, well below the national average, which is at 7,375 pesetas.
Shortening foreign direct investment
Along with a decline in economic activity and an increase in unemployment, the sharpest decline in foreign direct investment in the last 10 years was also recorded in 2011. According to the Ministry of Finance, between January and June, foreign direct investment amounted to $630,697 in the period from January to June, a decrease of 87.74% compared to the amount of $5,143,312 for the same period the previous year.
On the other hand, the Ministry of Economic Development of the State Government lists investments of the amount of 17,280 million pesetas per year. These investments were mainly directed at services businesses.
Dollo
In the context of the scenario of the downturn in the economy, the government of that state asked a state congress in July to approve a loan of 3 billion peso. This would be designed to invest in infrastructure projects in 18 urban areas to revive the economy. The local congress approved a loan of 2,600 million peso. By November, no debt gains were recorded, in any sector of the state economy.
Reactions
According to business sector representatives, the first year of the government of Mario López Valdés pointed to the lack of management of the government's management capabilities.
Miguel Loredo López, president of the National Chamber of the Transforming Industry, said that in 2011 there was a lack of aligning the will of individual sectors, including the government of the state itself.
"The development of the economy in Sinaloa was really tiny during this year. We need to work intensively to get back the land we lost this year. We need to redouble our efforts in 2012, lacking harmonisation of the efforts of all of us and, in particular, the correct and synchronised functioning of this new government. Hopefully next year will be much better," he said.
Grease of the Economy
Loredo López said that the events of the frost at the beginning of the year halted the state economy and curtailed its development and growth.
"Forthering economic movement was caused by a number of events, including frost. One of the main consequences was the slowdown in the economy, which did not recover quickly enough to restore dynamism to re-establish a tolerable level of movement for processes, products and services. That is why, at the end of the year, we were well below the expected forecasts," he said.
Redefining the mission
According to Teodor Salazar Uriarte, president of the Employee Confederation of the Republic of Mexico in Sinaloa, the state should be pushed to more dynamic productive activities.
"Generally speaking, we observe that it is being done. We believe that a long-term plan needs to be prepared in which the objectives and economic direction of the state are redefined, because it is important that the full potential of the material and human resources that Sinaloa has has" is needed to be redefined, he said.
The work ahead of us
President Coparmex stressed the importance of establishing a vision of the future to better guide the government's efforts.
"In general, I would say that the government has tried to achieve good results in different areas, there have been some progress in the area of economic development, but it is important to create a long-term plan," he said.
He said the current administration had shown progress in public policy leadership.
"There are elements that make it possible to claim that the government is trying to be welcoming. I can say that the work done is to see here and I believe that the Government is aware that there is also a lot of work ahead of us," he said.
Convicted for 8 kg of marijuana
The resident of Navolato was sentenced to five years in prison and 100 days of fines for possession of eight kilos of marijuana.
The Attorney's Office of the Republic informed the convicted dealer was Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval. He was convicted of the offence of endangering health, specifically for possession of marijuana for commercial purposes.
According to AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I, Valenzuela's assurances were detained by the Mexican Army's 7th services. June 2010 on an errand in Cipriano Valdez Street, opposite Station 8 in the El Castillo district, Navolato.
The dealer was in a pick up white van. In his car in the shelf he had a black bag and a small backpack in the passenger seat. Soldiers found 8 kilograms of 23 grams of marijuana.
For these reasons, the secured man remained at the disposal of the Judge of the Second Unit and the proceedings remain internal within the Centre for the Implementation of the Legal Impact of Crimes.
Gives contributions to projects
Social projects, which are part of programmes such as Hárabat, Rescue of Public Places and 3x1 for Migrants, face the risk of being brought forward to the end or of being in a major delay due to the lack of economic resources, said Miguel Ángel López Miranda.
The director of urban social development said that if construction work has moved forward until now, the state government is now in danger of failing to secure appropriate supplies that require funds of more than 11 million peso for three programmes.
He said the total investment in these three programmes was almost 50 million peso. The state accounts for 25%. Until now, only the Federation and the city have supplied the resources for the work, so it is possible that the projects will be delayed.
"They're supposed to be securing almost 12 million, and although the year is coming to an end, we've got nothing at all. This is despite the fact that we were supposed to get part in July," he said. "To keep us wasting no time, we have started the projects and are progressing very successfully, but we lack the money'.
He said that last year, under the administration of Jesús Aguilar, Padilla, the state did not meet the respective deliveries, so at the beginning of the new period the city had to apply for a loan in order to be able to pay for more than 7 million not given to them by the state administration.
"The same thing happened to us in the previous six-year term because the state did not have the economic capacity to participate and the programs went on. To get to the programs in question this year, we had to raise funds to cover what the state did not finish," he explained.
Despite the fact that there was a promise from state officials regarding the transfer of these sources, he said that a request from Armandu Villarreal, the secretary for administration and finance had been sent to expedite the proceedings and to arrive as soon as possible.
"They were to provide us with 12 million and although the year is coming to an end, we have not even received a peso yet."
The Court of Justice approves 'end of analogue broadcasting' in Mexico in 2015
Replacing the analogical signals with digital is one of the most important changes the world has seen in recent years.
The Supreme State Court (SCJN) dismissed the constitutional action brought by the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies against the Presidential Decree, which wants to expedite the so-called "sending out of analogous signals" and implement it in 2015 instead of 2021. He noted that there had been no necessary eight votes to invalidate him.
A minority of four ministers, including the president of the court, Juan Silva Meza, believed that President Felipe Calderón had not exceeded his authority by issuing a decree setting out the steps that would lead to the transition to terrestrial digital television.
With this result, the action brought by the Senate was dismissed because the qualified majority of the eight votes required to enable the court to take a position to rule on the constitutionality or unconstitutionality of the decree, which thus remains valid, was not reached.
The draft judgment drafted by Minister Olgou Sánchez Cordero puts forward the possibility of declaring the decree unconstitutional, because the regulation of all issues relating to radio and television is a matter that is legally reserved for the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cofetel). This violates the principles of hierarchical subordination and exceptions to the law.
Only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero herself voted for the project.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies supported a constitutional dispute in an attempt to combat the decree. Minister Sánchez Cordero has accepted the requirements and suspended the application of the decree and all the actions described in it leading to the transition to digitisation.
The ministerial meeting also decided to reject the lawsuit filed by the Chamber of Deputies without entering into a discussion on the proposal also in charge of Minister Sánchez Cordero.
In his speech, the Prime Minister stated that he did not endorse the arguments of the proposal to the effect that the federal executive could not structure measures through the general standards of the measures to be prepared by public administration.
"I don't think that even if it did, it would affect the autonomy of the regulator," and recalled that the planning of public policies in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector is the responsibility of the federal executive, which has a constitutional mandate to determine the direction of the state.
The digital analogue signal substitution is one of the biggest changes experienced by the world in recent years. It is related to better use of the radioelectric spectrum, better signal quality and multiple channels.
He believes that delaying the change would be to delay the benefits of digitisation, which requires decisions on the public interest. Digitisation has not only a technical dimension, but "it also applies to economic, social, political and national security issues."
As he pointed out, these questions "require to operate the entire established system, in accordance with the principle of the economic direction of the state. It includes a number of competences that the Constitution entrusts to the Government of the State."
He recalled that a number of countries around the world had already completed the transition to the digital system and did so through their respective governments, even though they had at their disposal the highly specialised technical bodies.
He said that it was not possible for the government, by issuing a dissenting decree that to some extent interfere with the congress's powers, to introduce in the area of administration to comply with the laws prepared by the legislative power.
In Michoacán, they analyze the possibility of "voice-on-the-vote" census
According to the PREP published, the difference between first and second place in the governor's election is less than 27 percent. So far, the votes of 879 of the 6074 electoral districts have not been counted.
The "voice after vote" census appeared in this year's elections in Michoacán, where, in line with the data published by the Preliminary Election Results Programme (PREP), the difference between the first and second place in the governor's election is less than 27 percent, and this has not yet been included by the votes of 879 of the total 6074 electoral districts.
In this context, the chairwoman of the General Council of the Vetissional Institute of the Benes (IEM), María de los Ángeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that a few days ago, on 9 November, the electoral body had approved a series of measures to harmonise local standards with federal electoral reform.
As will be recalled, Michoacán has not officially confirmed his political constitution or his State Electoral Code or the Electoral Justice Act. Indeed, the State Congress approved the reforms shortly before the legal deadline for their entry into force was to expire in that parliamentary term, and Governor Leonel Godoy, neglected to be published within the deadline for the Official State Gazette, with him having any objections to them.
On November 9, the Supreme State Court (SCJN) resolved a constitutional dispute initiated by local legislative power and declared the head of state's vote in the constitutional reform "invalid and illegal" because it has no right to "neither to approve or veto them."
Asked by the possibility of a "voice" vote-written vote, María de los Ángeles Llanderal said that the approval of the relevant measures by the IEM General Council would make it possible for both the local electoral body to take part and overall census.
In this way, a partial census of votes, one or more electoral parcels, will be possible to make under the following conditions: the election results do not agree; there is no minutes of the counting and calculation in the relevant box or not available to the President; or if errors have been made and obvious violations of the election results.
In addition, the total recount of the votes in all ballot boxes will be possible if there is evidence suggesting that the difference between the potential winner of the election and the second-place candidate is less than or equal to one percentage point; whenever the explicit request of a representative of the party and/or coalition that proposed the candidate in second place appears at the start of the session.
A total recount will also be made when, after a proper addition, it is found that the difference between the likely winner and the candidate in the second is equal to or less than one percentage point and also whenever there is an explicit request from a political party whose candidate has come second. In this case, the electoral packages for which a partial census has been made will be decommissioned.
It should be noted that in such a situation there is an election in Morelia, where according to the PREP the difference between the first and second place is less than 0.16%, although 129 of the total 923 electoral districts have not yet been counted.
His will
His ashes will be scattered in the Nurasom Mountains, the family confirmed.
The remains of pilot Felipe Bacio Cortés were transported to Saltillo, his hometown, on Sunday night. During Monday, there will be a ceremony and a memorial service.
According to the family, the lieutenant colonel's last wish that his ashes be scattered in the mountains of the Zapalinamé.
After receiving the highest honours, along with the other persons who died in the accident, the family, Bacio Cortése, returned to the capital, Coahuila, aboard a flight of the Mexican Air Force. The family and closest friends attended the ceremony at Campo Marte.
At noon the lieutenant colonel's ashes arrived in the chapel located on Nazario Ortiz Garza, where family and friends also came.
At 5:30 p.m. the farewell was held at the Saltillo Institute of Technology, organized by his former high school classmates and members of the American Football team, of which Felipe Bacio was also a member at the time of his graduation.
"He wanted to return to Saltilla, and his wish was to be scattered in the Nuras Mountains. This is how he always told his family and his friends," said Sandra Bacio Cortés, the pilot's sister.
According to her, the lieutenant colonel fulfilled all his wishes, he was at the height of his life, "he was a wonderful man, an extraordinary father, a son, a loving brother living for his family."
Felipe Bacio Cortés left the town of Saltillo very young and joined the Colegio del Aire flight school in Zapopán, Jalisco.
Some didn't believe it because they said he even drove a truck, however, he always went to his dream to become a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Dávila Bacio remembers him as a very good person, "as a soonerly he came to Saltillo, the whole family wanted to see him, as he did when he brought Martha Sahagun to Saltillo."
The young man even remembers that when he was seven years old, he went to Zapopán for his uncle's graduation, so he is convinced that he died doing what he liked best in his life: the driving of the plane.
They said goodbye to him the last
With Felipe Bacio Cortés, the lieutenant colonel in the Mexican Air Force, we said goodbye to all the honors that Governor Jorge Torres López, the citizens and the government of the state, the Mexican military through the sixth military zone, the Mexican Air Force itself, the leaders and students of the Technology High School in Saltillo, where he studied in 1985 and excelled in both his studies and in sports.
Bacio Cortés died in the past few days after the helicopter he was driving fell. Also on board was the secretary of the government, José Francisco Blake Mora, and six other people, all officials of this state.
At 18:05, the remains of the Solford native Bacio Cortés (fallen) arrived to be handed over to the Mexican Air Force, led by Major Jaime Martinez, through a funeral service, to the area, where his family, his daughter Amanda, and wife Cristina, the mother, siblings and other relatives, students and teachers had gathered.
Three abandoned dead bodies found on Cadereyta NL farm
A few hours before the discovery, military officials presented to the media 11 people who were detained in this area for crimes related to organised crime.
The bodies of the three men murdered by gunfire in various parts of the body and head were found at the abandoned farmhouse of the village of Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo León.
The discovery occurred on the 1.5-kilometre road from Cadereyta to Santiago, at the level of the area known as El Castillo.
People who moved in these places noticed that the hut with the beige-cock fence had an open door from time to time.
When they looked in, from a distance of approximately three meters away, they noticed the corpses of three people, so they immediately alerted the relevant authorities.
One of the people wore a yellow-colored sports T-shirt and dark cotton trousers and was not dressed. Beside him, you also lay in a white-strike sports T-shirt.
A few yards away, the body was the body of another person dressed in a red sports T-shirt and blue cotton trousers.
The three of them lay facing the ground.
According to the data obtained at the sites, all three people were probably murdered in a different place because the bullets were not found.
On the fence of the cottage were found messages addressed to one group of organized crime of the other, as well as a series of traces of bullets, both on the building and on the doors.
Cadereyt arrested 11 suspects
The secretary of the National Defense introduced 11 people, including juveniles who were members of a criminal group that operated mainly in the Cadereyta area and who are associated with kidnapping, murder, persecution and illegal burial.
According to the information released during the first attempt on 11 November in the colony of Los Alveros, 8 people were detained and one detained person was freed.
Three properties and a mobile phone were secured. They confirmed that they were members of a criminal group called "Los Zetas."
The next raid took place on 12 November at 6pm. Military personnel were on the rounds in the Rancho Viejo area of Cadereyta when he noticed a car without a license plateau and two people.
After stopping the car, they inspected and discovered one rifle, a shell casing and 18 rounds of ammunition.
Then, on the basis of these statements, one of the accomplices in the La Frauda area was detained at about 14:00 on 13 November. When he saw the soldiers, he tried to escape.
They were charged with illegal burial in the municipalities of General Terán, China and Cadereyta.
A new Italian government to be appointed on Wednesday
Appointed Prime Minister Mario Monti will meet with the Italian president tomorrow to present him with a new government to face the crisis that holds the country's gust of economic catastrophe.
Appointed Prime Minister Mario Monti will meet with the Italian president tomorrow to present to him a new government that will face a crisis that holds the country's gulf of economic disasters and which has put the eurozone in danger.
The Presidential Palace issued a report announcing that Monti, appointed on Sunday, would meet with President Giorgio Napolitano on Wednesday to confirm that he could form a government.
It is expected to present a government composed mostly of technocrats, though it is not yet clear when the new government will take power.
Monti said he would present to the president the results of his talks he conducted with the political parties in an attempt to form a government.
"I want to confirm that I have absolute confidence in our country's ability to overcome this difficult phase," the former European Commissioner told reporters.
Monti did not explicitly say that he would be able to form a government, but the tone of his comments suggested that the obstacles were overcome.
"The door is now well marked," he added.
Monti has completed the process of forming a government in less than three days, a much shorter time than usual. Meanwhile, Italy is trying to fight the political and financial crisis, which has pushed the debt levels to an unsustainable level.
The new administration, led by former European Commissioner, M.M.M. must approve a harsh austerity package demanded by European leaders. Only then will it be possible to restore Italy's wrecked credibility.
There's a lot of pressure on Monti to hurry up. Due to the volatility of the markets, the interest on the Italian BTP bonds with a 10-year maturity of the 7 percentage point, the level where Greece and Ireland had to apply for rescue.
Emma Marcegaglia, chairwoman of the Italian employers' organisation Confindustria, told reporters after the meeting with Mids: 'We said we would support this government very much'.
We believe that this government is a last resort to get Italy out of this burning situation.
Monti's hopes for success were significantly multiplied by support from PDL Silvio Berlusconi, who was forced to resign by the crisis on Saturday.
"We believe that Professor Monti's efforts are destined for good results," Angelina Alfano, secretary of the centre-right party, told reporters.
The PDL's largest party's support is significant because, until now, many of its members have opposed the technocratic-mortending government, which is being formed by Monti.
Support for the Parliament
The new Monti government must have strong support for the parliament to promote unpopular austerity reforms.
Any obstacle or delay in the effort could trigger a new and devastating attack on the financial markets.
The Italian Association of Foreign Banks has joined the pressure and warns that Monti's failure could be a disaster.
Monti opened negotiations with the political parties, trade unions and business groups, youth and women's organisations on Monday.
The round of negotiations will close on Tuesday night.
Monti was appointed Sunday by President Napolitano, who made it possible to advance very swiftly in response to the crisis.
After a brief drop at the end of last week, when it was already clear that Berlusconi would resign, Italian bond interest rates have returned to a critical threshold, responding to uncertainty about whether the new Prime Minister will reap success.
Saving Italy, whose public debt is at €1.8 trillion, would be beyond the capabilities of the euro area's current financial reserves.
Monti said that his government should last until the next election, scheduled for 2013, despite general forecasts that say politicians would only give him time to implement reforms and then call an early election.
Monti said that he would like to integrate politicians into his cabinet, but the major parties insist that this government must be made up of only experts to draw Italy out of the difficulties the country has come to because of the financial pressure.
Political sources said that mutual distrust and disapproval between the parties were complicated by an attempt to integrate political figures into the government as well.
Spaniards take part in international matches more often than Costa Ricans
Of the 22 Spanish footballers, ten will exceed the threshold of 50 international matches.
On the Costa Rica side, only one of the 22 players called up to the number of 50 matches.
Huge contrast on the side of Costa Rica if we compare the 22 players from the two countries who met today for a 3:05 amico match at the National Stadium in San José.
While the world and European champions, FIFA's one monthly rating, have a wide range of intermingling A-class A-class intermingling matches, Costa Rica has only defender Michael Uman, who is the only one to play 50 international matches.
He reached that number at last Friday's match against Panama (0-2) at Rommel Fernández Stadium.
The Spanish footballers, who play in the Stars and the powerful clubs in the English First League, have maintained their intense activity at the league championships and domestic cups and high-level matches in the European Cups as the Champions League for over a year.
We must also add to the previous one the experience of the national Spanish team in the complicated knockout matches at the European and World Championships.
Costa Rican players, on the other hand, have very limited opportunities for foreign matches in the area. For example, there is the Concacaf, which is considered to be the lowest level in FIFA.
We see that the largest number of foreign matches from the Spanish national team is to be scored by goalkeeper Íker Casillas, who drew on former goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarret with 126 international matches last Saturday before England (a 0-1 loss).
Casillas will also take on Costa Rica today and will earn a new record for Spain - 127 international matches.
Xavi Hernández, Barcelona's key player, has 106 games to his name.
Casillas and Xavi were even officially announced last week to UEFA, along with other Spanish players with a hundred matches to their name. Among them, the aforementioned Zubizarreta with 126 and midfielder Schalke, Raúl González, with 102.
Carles Puyol also came close to the 100 with 97 games.
Followed by Xabi Alonso with 91; Fernando Torres with 90; David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81; Andrés Iniesta with 62; Cesc Fábregas with 61; and David Silva with 53.
On the side of Costa Rica and close to Michael Uman, left winger Júnior Díaz moves with 48 games and goalkeeper Bryan Ruiz with the 45.
There were also 5 surpassing the 30-game mark: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
The smallest number of matches.
With fewer than 30 matches in Spain, there are Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Álvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
On the national side with less than 30 games, it's Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest was not exceeded by 20.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba has two, in Costa Rica, Víctor Bolívar, has only one, and Ólman Vargas and Edder Nelson are still waiting for their first game.
Spain's top scorer is David Villa with 50 goals, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
On the Costa Rican side, Bryan Ruiz, nine, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
The quintet has included the country in its tour to celebrate 20 years of existence
"The Road to Costa Rica is a dream that becomes reality"
In an exclusive interview with Viva, bassist Jeff Ament of Pearl Jam said the band was ready to offer one of the best concerts at the National Stadium next Sunday.
We have waited more than 20 years, but the group itself assures that the opportunity to play in Costa Rica is a dream come true.
This is what bassist and founding member Jeff Ament, who spoke exclusively to Viva from Brazil last week, said.
The group is set to be on the South American continent as part of a tour to celebrate 20 years of existence and will be at a unique stop in Central America on Sunday 20th.
He will perform this day at the National Stadium from 7:30 p.m. with the angel band The X and the national musicians from Las Robertas.
This is a sample from the interview, the full transcript of which can be found on the La Nación website on the internet.
For your Costa Rican supporters, it's a dream come true. Pearl Jam will play in Costa Rica. Do you realize what your fans are experiencing?
The journey to Costa Rica is also our dream, which is becoming a reality.
We have barely been in South and Central America for the second time and the experience to date has been great.
I've only been to Costa Rica once, on holiday. It's a beautiful country, and I believe we'll be able to stay here for a few days.
So we're so happy to bring you our music.
I ask because they literally adore the group here, the fans are experiencing these days of preparation very intensively.
What do you say to your most ghastly supporters?
Thank you for standing by us for so many years.
It took us almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica. Thank you for waiting so long and we're sorry it took us so long.
Some people already refer to the concert as the biggest show of the year.
Does it give you more pressure?
Some of the biggest shows we've put on in 21 years have been made in a matter of weeks.
We have put on some great shows in Sao Paulo and we hope to get into shape for a concert in Costa Rica.
In fact, we're really looking forward to the concert.
We love this country, we like to surf, we like to enjoy the jungle. For both activities, Costa Rica is the best country in the world.
How did you get to know Costa Rica and its waves to surf?
We have a lot of surfing friends, and I have a good friend who lives in Tamarindo. The waves here are incredible.
My friends go surfing at Costa Rica or Nicaragua, or Mexico. These are the best surfing spots. And so we found out about Costa Rica, through people who love to surf.
If you look at your tour, you've prepared a huge show with many songs.
What did you plan to present in Costa Rica?
Since we've never played here, we have no limitations on what we can't do.
We will try to put on the best show with a variety of tracks. We will try to play a few songs from each album and present to our fans a good and diverse repertoire.
You never repeat the repertoire.
Why?
I think in part it's because we have nine albums and we can play more than 120 songs and everyone likes different songs, so it's hard to choose which songs we'll play every night.
When we have two or three songs in our repertoire that we haven't played for a long time, we focus on them and we're also surprised because we remember why we liked them so much and that maybe we've forgotten about it.
So the show is more interesting for us, which is why I think it is more interesting for the people.
This tour celebrates 20 years of artistic orbit.
When you look back, is it hard to believe everything you've accomplished?
Yes, I'm sure.
First, I think that none of us could have imagined that we would be in one big rock band and that we would stay in it for more than 20 years. That sounds like a dream.
We realise how much we have been given and it touches us to continue to play together.
We love each other and like making music.
We are lucky to be able to look at the places we have always wanted.
We couldn't have done better.
What did it mean to you that you were an important part of the grunge genre?
It has always been an honour for us to be a part of this group in which the great greats are represented.
The people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains are our friends.
It's surprising when a movement emerges from a group of friends, it doesn't happen very often.
A group emerges from time to time, but it is far less common for five to ten groups to emerge from one city at once.
We are proud of this and we are honoured to be part of the Seattle group.
Sometimes we still play with some of them.
Last year we went to the Alice in Chains festival and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden on tour. We are fortunate to be all of our friends and we are honoured to be a part of this movement that was formed in Seattle.
It's also very unusual for a group like yours to keep together and still have the same members after all these years.
Yes, the four of us have been together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, which in itself is a much longer time than the usual duration of the group.
I think, first of all, we are all fortunate that we are still in this world and, secondly, the fact that we are constantly interested in each other plays a part of the role.
We are all close friends and, as a result, we have managed to open up musical paths that leave everyone with sufficient freedom to experiment on their own.
We trust each other, we appreciate each other's music, and I don't think it could be better.
Your relationship to the word fame was not easy. However, thanks to your success, you can do what you like.
How do you find the balance?
The way we grew, it was gradually getting easier to find a balance.
We try not to go on tour too much, because it's very easy to fall into this trap of the crowds and people who love our music.
When you realize that people came for music, you remind yourself that you have to respect the music and what you've given it. You mustn't get carried away by being famous, rock stars. This has never really been of interest to either of us.
How do you remember the next Mother Love Bone project?
I think we were writing great songs and at the beginning it was something spectacular.
We've been around as a band for three years and we've never released an album until after Andy (Andrew Woods) died.
It was very frustrating because it took so long. Most importantly, even today we are friends with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore), who started in the band with us. When I listen to a song or look at the pictures, I remember Andy how incredible he was, how I laughed at him. It was always a joy to work with him, to laugh, to talk about music or football and much more.
He was an incredible person and we miss him so much.
The national band Las Robertas will be commissioned to launch a show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know their work, especially Eddie Vedder, and that's why you chose them as the opening actuators?
Yes, the production sent us videos with several designs, and we liked this group the most. That's why we're curious to see what Las Robertas will offer live and have to be very entertaining.
Why do you always change the words Yellow Ledbetter live?
That's a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), so I don't know.
He sings it, and I think he adds the first thing he can think of.
Who is influencing you as a bassist?
Lots of people.
First up, I think of Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramon, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There's so many of them, I could talk all night about the bassists I like.
How did Pearl Jam manage to keep grunge, even though it is no longer in vogue?
I think we've all always felt a little separated from the word grunge.
When you say grunge, I imagine the groups I mentioned as Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all the others that were created at the same time. And if music is still this valid today, it's something great because it's the music that's worth listening to and the likes of Mudhoney players are playing better music today than ever before.
At the beginning, your music had a slightly gloomy character and is now more positive.
What is behind this change?
That's interesting because I feel like there are a few songs in the new album that are lighter, but there are also songs like The End or Juste Breathe, which are considered very gloomy, although they may come off as positive.
By both of them, when Ed played them for me, I cried, and they're songs deeply dark.
I think when you grow up and have some trauma in your life, you lose someone in a family or a friend, these things start to affect your art and music, and these two songs represent this to me.
I also think you can be a happy person and still make gloomy music.
Peru:
Fujimori hospitalized again for medical tests
Former President Alberto Fujimori was hospitalized on Tuesday at a public hospital to test him for the muscle loss he has suffered in the lower extremities, his attending physician reported.
The 72-year-old Fujimori, who is serving a 25-year prison sentence for human rights violations committed by his government (1990 to 2000), suffers from several diseases, including tongue cancer, for which he has been operated on four times and is already under control by doctors.
MP Alejandro Aguinaga, who is his personal physician, told the TV station Canal N that Fujimori would undergo tests at the National Institute of Discral Diseases in three days, where they should find out why he was in pain and why he was losing strength in his lower limbs.
Aguinaga said that in his view Fujimori might be pardoned for humanitarian reasons, but the former president himself does not want a pardon because he feels innocent.
He was operated on four times for tongue cancer, lost 18 kilograms, and these problems were added by other ailments such as severe erosive gastritis, a pancreatic cyst, kidney stones, high blood pressure and circulatory problems in the legs, the doctor listed.
Fujimori has been serving his sentence since September 2007 at the National Headquarters of Special Police Operations.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the deaths of 25 people who were killed by a murdering squadron of troops operating illegally in the early years of his reign.
Mujica on a visit to Mexico to strengthen political ties
The official delegation, led by the President of Uruguay, José Mujica, accompanied by several ministers and business executions, will begin a visit to Mexico on Tuesday. It aims to achieve an expansion of trade between the two nations and to touch on the political issues of the region.
Mujica will meet with his Mexican counterpart, Felipe Calderón, on Wednesday. These are the most important meeting of extensive meetings full-time meetings with policy leaders, commerce and representatives of the Uruguyas community living in Mexico. The program was released by the Uruguay Presidential Office.
The meeting of the two presidents in the city of Guadalajara will be used to exchange information on political matters between the two countries," the Uruguayan Presidential Office posted on its website.
According to local media outlet, Mujica will seek to get Calderón to support Uruguay in a dispute with France when French President Nicolas Sarkozy placed the South American country on the list of tax havens at the G20 meeting in the French city of Cannes.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened to remove countries that would continue to remain in the position of tax havens to be removed from the international community. This statement drew a negative opinion from Uruguay and a consultation with the ambassador to the European country.
Mexico has been chairing the G20 since November. The G20 is a group made up of the world's most powerful emerging and developed countries. With the Latin American country, an agreement has been reached in place for the exchange of information to prevent double taxation from January this year.
In recent years, the Uruguayan government has sought to concretise the fiscal exchange agreements to come off the "blacklist" of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), to which countries that have not established all the required international standards of cooperation in tax terms, are being taken up.
From a commercial point of view, Mexico and Uruguay have concluded the Free Trade Agreement (FTA) since 2004, which has made the exchange of goods between the two countries strengthened.
Bearded plumber runs in 3D thanks to "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario has been relentlessly fighting for more than 25 years to save Princess Peach from the clutches of the villain Bowser, but he has never appeared in 3D: in "Super Mario 3D Land" he will fight for the love of a girl with stereoscopic technology.
The title, which comes to all stores around the world this month, was made up of the start to take advantage of all the characteristics offered by the portable Nintendo 3DS console, which allows you to play three-dimensional games without having to use your glasses.
"Mario is a character who has to say how stereoscopy without glasses is supposed to work," said a press official specialized in Nintendo, Spain, Omar Álvarez, during a video game presentation in Madrid.
Álvarez said that "Super Mario 3D Land" is the "Nintendo's first video game created specifically for this carrier" because until now, successful images such as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of the time 3D" have been adapted to existing titles.
A Nintendo spokesman said that in addition to the fact that the picture is 3D, "Super Mario 3D Land" is an "accessible" video game that allows you to enjoy a fast and smooth game.
Álvarez confirmed that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part is "simple" to attract less skilled users.
Once you have surpassed this level, you can tackle the "second round" at the game's levels, which are more challenging this time around.
In addition, users can choose the real time between the "aggressive D" or one that affects only the depth of the action. But it will be necessary to play in 3D in order to overcome all sorts of challenges and "not underwrite the optical illusions."
This new emergence of Super Maria in 3D is also expected to return the character to the portable console, which has not happened since 2005.
In this video game, Nintendo plays to the notes to those who follow the saga and repeat the successful formula from previous episodes. It is that the bearded man's plumber will have to go through dangerous minced platforms to free Princess Peach.
Although the player finds the news in the movements, in the surrounding area, in disguises and also among the enemies, there will also be a "playful" Luigi.
Colom approves extradition of Portal to the United States
President Álvaro Colom announced Tuesday that he has ceded steps to the extradition of former President Alfonso Portillo, who is to answer for a $70 million multi-packing conspiracy in the United States.
This is the end of the process aimed at ensuring that Guatemala responds to a request from the northern country requesting the extradition of Portillo to be able to try him.
At a press conference, Colom confirmed that his decision was in line with the independence of the judiciary and the executive branch, and that he was bearing in mind that the criminal court had already ordered extradition.
He assured that during his mandate he "did not go into court decisions and allowed all extraditions that have reached his desk.
In addition to Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroquin for murder and grievous bodily harm, and Edgar Estrada Morales and Víctor Estrada Paredes, both for drug trafficking, will be extradited.
Colom's move marks a step in the execution after all judicial and constitutional instances were exhausted to lead the trial against the former president, who ruled from 2000 to 2004.
In accordance with the decisions of the Fifth Criminal Tribunal and the Constitutional Court (CC), Portillo will be extradited after his legal situation in Guatemala has been resolved and human rights are guaranteed.
Portillo was found not guilty in the matter of embezzling 120 million at the Ministry of Defence during his presidency. This trial was preceded by extradition, but the Public Ministry appealed, bringing the case back into play.
Trinijove helped 6,000 young people in state of emergency
The organization was created to help children without education, to avoid being on the margins of society.
The balance of the first 25 years of the Trinijove social support organisation is very important: the 6,000 young people at risk of social exclusion have been helped. For 25 years, the organization has been helping them overcome difficult situations.
To this must be added the long hundred jobs obtained for this social group.
Yesterday's anniversary also served to present a record as part of a ceremonial act that took place in the former manufacturing premises of both the Fabra i Coats factory, and attended by more than 300 people.
Trinijove was formed in the Trinitat Vella district in 1986 to help young people with low education, job-free, dealing with drug addiction or in a situation where they might fall into social exclusion.
Yesterday's meeting in Santa Andrea was attended by a large number of representatives of the organisations and institutions that have worked with the association over the past 25 years.
The diverse political representation, in the run-up to the election, has shown the unified nature of the work carried out by Trinijove.
He and the president of the Generalitat, Arturo Mas, and his predecessor, Jordi Pujol, attended the ceremony with a former Socialist Education Adviser, Ernest Maragall, and former deputy mayors and current environmental-socialist councillor, Ricard Goma.
The Fabra and Coats' current advisor for Social well-being and family, Josep Lluís Cleries, and the Social Works General in La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa, also attended the great hall.
Mas said that Trinijove originated at a very difficult time and that today also offers a whole series of obstacles, but added that the work the association has brought to this day "is a good foundation."
The president cited Trinijove as an example of how it is possible to combat adverse circumstances and how to encourage people in difficult situations.
"The crisis is nothing new for this organisation and for the work he does," he said.
There was the eviction of a busy house hosting gigantic parties
The intruders appropriated 11 of the 13 flats in the building in Balmes, 51
12 occupiers left the house at noon yesterday without resisting
All indications are that the nightmare experienced by the neighbors from Number 51 on Balmes Street is finally over.
Twelve people left the building they illegally inhabited illegally at noon yesterday and organizing gigantic parties that attracted neighbors. They left the building by court order and without the police having to intervene.
After the operation, the lock on the door was replaced to prevent the situation from recurring.
"From now on, entry will be guarded," the caretaker said.
The occupiers, who took 11 of the 13 apartments in the building - the rest are inhabited - took all the electric and partly the water equipment, in addition to painting the walls and leaving the trash of all kinds, especially the cans of alcoholic beverages.
There were huge parties in the first three apartments that lasted up to two days and woke up the other tenants.
Next to the building is a disco, the Balmes 51, which was also damaged.
Its owner, Maria Pantinat, explained to Europa Press that sales had fallen by 80% while the building was occupied.
The owner of the disco stresses that the occupiers of the building made it unfair competition because they sold drinks for 3 euros, whereas it costs 10 at the disco.
In addition, the owner of the entertainment company had to respond to the neighbors' lawsuits for noise. But the problems were caused not by the disco's visitors, but by the residents of the seized house and especially those who attended the parties held here, the frequency and intensity of which had increased in recent weeks, according to the exasperated residents of the surrounding area.
The owner of the disco explained that the problems were so great that they even agreed with the owner of the building and have been forgiven her rent for nine months.
The municipal police also confirmed that they had received more complaints from neighbors in recent weeks about the situation.
Last week, the chairman of the city's public-ambling PP Group, the town hall, demanded that "the building be evicted immediately and end the civil cohabitation problems suffered by the neighbours and the destruction of the area."
The president of the Peoples explained that only one floor had been taken before the summer, but in recent months the occupiers had reached all the floors of the building and into almost all the apartments, and in one of them there were even thefts.
In this respect, he added that "it is necessary to put an end to impunity and to be consistent when it comes to acts against the civil liability that took place in the building."
Yesterday, the city's police department also cleared the building in Nou Barris.
At 3:30 a.m., police reached Building 35 on Mont-ral Street after being summoned by neighbors who saw four people entering the building.
All four were immediately detained.
Park or mountains?
The architects met on the occasion of the announcement of the proceedings, which entails more than the controversy over the royalties
The city's 16-gate ballot box office is once again opening up a debate about the role of the Collserola Park in Barcelona.
In the mid-1980s, at the heyday of the already defunct Metatropolitana de Barcelona (CMB), the municipality printed several pamphlets to support the Collserola Park.
The leaflet defined the mountain as the large park of metropolitan Barcelona.
What's more, it was accompanied by a numerical comparison with New York's Central Park.
After the CMB was lost in 1987, the park returned to the minds of many as the upper border of Barcelona. The Catalan capital is one of the few that do not focus on the north-facing axis - the south, but up (down top).
Collserola's qualification as a natural park goes this way.
The reference was no longer Central Park, but Yellowstone with the wild boar instead of the Yogi bear.
Such a position until September, when the town hall announced a mega competition consisting of 16 auditions for the same number of entry gates to Collserola.
The gate, of course, plays more into the idea of a park.
Either this or someone's trying to place the gate in the field.
So there is only one question: Collserola, a park or a mountain?
During the competition, both in terms of purely organizational and reflection on the city, this issue becomes the central theme of all Barcelona's architects.
It is already a subject as wiped out as when the two members of this old cast of the chosen ones shake hands at the rendezvous in the elevator.
And it was this feat that triggered one of the rare coincidences between what three Barcelona architects and the coming university professors think.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: the selection process has its merit.
According to Roldán, after the issue of the Gulf side has been asked, "it is necessary" to discuss the "Mountain Party" so that Ildeonons Cerdo's speech about the green apples was not brought to an end.
"We have to start from the principle that the most extensive park in Barcelona is the beach.
Among other things, its great accessibility.
Collserola is more complex," said the architect, for whom the name "gate to Collserolo" bears a "lexicological trap": we must not imagine them "as entrances to the park, but rather as a delimitation of the zones where it is possible to operate."
Modol, like Roldán and Bayon, with experience in the world of urbanism, qualifies the proposal as an "intellectual challenge" offering "some dangers."
Dangers stemming from the 'uncertainty posed by the public place project today' after the experience of the 1980s, which had a "its swan singing" in the field of the Forum.
The first concern is the very demarcation of the boundaries where it should be built.
"Same something is to take the next step," that is, in principle, to move a step further.
"It is necessary to keep in mind in mind the new urban and planning tools, because the current ones (with reference to the General Metropolitan Plan (PGM)) can cause a real disaster."
If we focus on the question in more detail, Modol believes that the valley slope of the Collserol can be considered "a park" but not the Barcelona section, for reasons of purely topographic.
Modol also recalled that there is already a work done by the Patronat de Collserola, which "shall not end up in the dustbin," although he welcomes the fact that the town hall offers his board to intervene in the project from the "first moment."
Moreover, he understands that the proximity to the mountain and the city is a kind of pass that allows architects to engage in the debate, but "pretends" that it should be this very technical profile that will lead multidisciplinary teams ("it's all about the skills"), which need to be created: "Architeks should only be tools."
Bayona suggests that the answer to the question that gave the name of this game is complicated because the Collserola global vision lacks the documentation for the selection process: "A 16 tenders have been launched to deal with all the axis of the mountain - the sea - but there is no longitudinal study looking at the area and to see it as a whole."
This causes him to sign up for all 16 competitions.
Otherwise, the one-gate project may run into the concept and definition of the architect of the neighbouring gate.
In his view, the City Hall should guarantee that the zone immediately located above Ronda de Dalt should be secured for the full length of the equipment zone to ensure a smooth transition between the city and the greenery.
Casino pardons Jonas Larrazábal, who will be released
After 72 days of imprisonment, the legal commissioner, Cadino Red, pardoned Mayor Monterrey's brother in a trial in which he was prosecuted for alleged blackmail.
Manuel Jonas Larrazáab has spent 72 days in prison and will now be released after the legal commissioner Casino Red p p p p p pileered him before the Second Criminal Court in that district hearing an extortion case in which the mayor of Monterrey's brother was indicted.
After the Casino Royale assassination, Casina Red's owner, Sergio Gil García, released a series of photographs and videos in which Manuel Jonás was asked to pay for an economic quota to allow the Monterrey City Council to make it possible to operate an illegal betting home.
Following a public indictment, the State Prosecutor's Office launched a criminal prosecution against the brother of the pan-team mayor. On 2 September he was detained and imprisoned for 30 days.
Then, after 4 hours in front of the Public Ministry's Agent 3 for property offences, he was transferred to Prison 1, located in Barrio Antiguo in the capital of the state.
He remained at this post for the following 49 days after a second imprisonment order was issued and the Public Ministry agent refuted the possibility of complicity or organised crime.
On 19. He was taken to the Criminal Court in Cadereyt on suspicion of blackmailing Casino Red's owners with one and a half million pesos. However, he remained only a few hours in a moderate-sighted prison because he was threatened with death.
Leaders allowed him to stay in the city's cells in San Nicolás de los Garza during the trial.
25. In October, he was presented with an arrest warrant issued by the secretary of the Second Criminal Court, Jorge Yánez, who said that after almost two months of investigation, sufficient evidence had been gathered to prove Jonas's guilt. The evidence includes, for example, the payment of the 1.5 million peso to the casino's representatives in exchange for the promise that the operation would be allowed.
This Monday, the legal commissioner Casina Red, Víctor Aldo García Gómez, approached Judge José Luis Pecin and asked for a pardon for the region's mayor's brother. As a result, he will soon be able to return to freedom.
During the legal hearing, the representative of the Public Ministry assigned to that court, Ramiro Arias, asked García Gómez whether the damage had been repaired and which of the associates had decided to pardon. But the lawyer made it clear that the name would remain classified.
On the basis of the Official File 197/2011, the legal pardon is granted to Jonas Larrazábal. In the trial against him, it will not be possible to lodge any complaint. It is also not possible to claim damages or punishment.
After a trial with the legal commissioner at about 3:50 p.m., the court ordered the immediate release of Larrazabl Breton.
The court secretary, Jorge Yanéz, appeared in a prison in the city of San Nicolás de los Garza to tell Jonas that he had been given an official pardon and his case was dropped in the archives.
He also told him that the judge had issued an immediate ordinance for his release.
The secretary, Dionisio Pérez Jábě, presented details of the air accident that killed the secretary of the governor, Francisco Blake, and the other seven people.
The Communications and Transport Secretariat (SCT) reported that the results of the accident investigation, which killed government secretary Francisco Blake Mora and seven other people, show that the helicopter landed directly on the terrain with full force, without the pilot having a chance to attempt a forced landing.
At a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jácome, Secretary for Communications and Transport, said that before the plane took off, the pilot had noted that the climatic conditions allowed the flight.
"The parts that appear suggest that the unit came into contact with the terrain several times, the wings became entangled in tree branches 25 metres from where the unit lost its hull."
He also informed that the unit was designed for 19 people, therefore it met all the requirements for transporting staff.
In addition, he stated that no components were found on the ground based on the investigation carried out in the impact area.
"In the search, it was discovered that parts of the aircraft were not in another place, so the plane hit the mainland as a complete one.
"The helicopter was intended for 19 people, meeting all the requirements for the transport of people.
The terrain shows a slope with a slope of seven to thirty degrees.
The secretary assured that the most important thing at the moment is to get the results as quickly as possible. However, the investigation could take several months or up to one year.
Gilberto López Meyer, the director general of the airport and ancillary services, said that at the moment of the impact, the Presidential General Staff helicopter was moving at cruise speed and the accident occurred on the soft ascending terrain.
"This information supports the hypothesis that it was a routine overflight operation at the time of the accident," he said.
At a press conference, a representative of the SCT Pérez Jába listed the six basic points of the investigation:
Visual flight:
In accordance with aviation standards, the flight was conducted according to the rules of the visual flight, which means that the crew must see the terrain during the flight.
Meteorological conditions:
The AICM reports indicate adequate conditions at take-off, in accordance with this the aircraft is moving towards the border, between the DF and the state of Mexico were noticeable layers of clouds at low altitudes.
Selected routes:
It is probably that because of the clouds, the crew was looking for a lower area and more visibility to the Cuernavaca Valley.
Position of impact.
The crash coordinates and the helicopter's last radio record are in agreement, it is likely that there was no loss of control or disruption of the ferry of flight before the crash.
Distracting the remains of the aircraft in a restricted area:
The information we currently have at our disposal allows us to assume that the impact occurred on a straight trajectory and from the side.
The drawing of the dispersal of the remains of the aircraft indicates that the helicopter was complete at the time of the crash on land.
There was no fire or explosion.
No evidence was recorded at the crash site indicating that there had been an explosion or fire.
The latest investigation results show that there may have been several contacts with the mainland.
During the field work, the remains of the aircraft were found at an altitude of up to 9200 feet above sea level, the terrain slopes, the pitch levels go from seven to 30 degrees.
The photographs show footage in which it probably disintegrated along the route.
The information provides elements that appear to suggest that the helicopter may have come into contact with the ground in several places.
After a careful search around the accident, in a territory that is more extensive than the area of the set-asccupation, the remains of the helicopter were not found, reinforcing the assumption that the impact occurred in a state when the helicopter was still complete.
Mexico's health insurance institute launches research into the gene that causes obesity
The Institute of Health Insurance is conducting research to discover the gene responsible for obesity of children and adolescents. Research is being carried out with the support of experts from the IPN Institute
The Mexican Institute of Health Insurance (IMSS) has announced that it is conducting research to detect the gene that causes obesity in children and the young. Research called "Abre Obesity Genetics in Children and Teenagers" will make it possible to obtain overweight results.
In a report by the head of the Biochemistry Research Unit in Biochemistry from the Specialized Hospital of the 21st Century National Health Center, Miguel Cruz López, he explained that a multidisciplinary team of doctors, nurses, nutritionists and social workers had been set up.
This team relies on the support of specialists and students of postgraduate studies from the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) and from the Centre for Research and Advanced Studies (Cinvestav) of the National Polytechnic Institute (IPN).
The focus of the research can also involve the general public, having or not authorized. People can come to the participating IMSS sports centres in Valle de México, where every Saturday will be carried out by juveniles from 8 o'clock.
He stressed that the research began at the Cuauhatémoc Sports Centre (Mexican State) and from 8. October, this activity was also carried out at the Unesupcóyolt Sports Centre (East of the Mexican State).
Once data from 500 to 600 children have been obtained, the study will continue at the Independencia Sports Center (south of the Federal District) and finally at the Morelos Sports Centre (north of the Federal Center).
He explained that the aim of this research was to identify the ingredients and importance of genetics in terms of the development of obesity and to trace to Mexican children and young people the risk factors and thus prevent the emergence of chronic degenerative diseases.
On the occasion of the International Diabetes Day, which is celebrated on 14 November, he recalled that the aim was to collect data from 3,000 children and young people between the age of 3,000 and 14, with the consent and supervised of parents, to apply specific nutrition questionnaires.
The questionnaire will also ask about the physical activity and family history of hereditary diseases in order to avoid risk factors that could cause diseases such as diabetes or renal insufficiency.
He specified that every Saturday, all participants are being given anthropometric measurements (weight, height, waist circumference), blood pressure is measured, glucose, triglicernides, cholesterol, insulin are determined and genes are studied (they are trying to identify the genes involved in childhood obesity).
Cruz López said this research reflected the concern of health professionals over the alarming increase in child's weight.
'Health polls conducted between 1999 and 2006 showed that in just six years, there was an increase in obesity in the boys by 77% and for girls by 47%. There was also a dramatic increase in the case of overweight', said the IMSS expert.
He said that one of the reasons for the search for indicators was the assumption that the country's population was different from that of other populations in its genetic history.
He reported that the average Mexican has 65% of Indian-American genetic make-up, 30% European and 5% African. This is reflected in the genes responsible for the emergence of diabetes and overweight.
He explained that, in general, the genetics of obesity are commonly explained as an inability to burn the excess energy we consume (calorie) and stored in the form of fats.
The researcher explained that the direct benefits of the participants were to receive an overall assessment of the condition of the children, thus determining whether they show any known overweight or obesity.
He said that even the presence of dark-coloured wrinkles (acantosis) on the neck and forearms indicated the likelihood that the individual would suffer from metabolic problems and pre-curklar conditions.
The information is still confidential, with doctors passing it in writing to their parents and explaining to them all the measurements and lifestyle changes they have to make to avoid the disease.
Cruz López explained that there are three major ingredients that cause overweight, obesity and other chronic diseases: a sedentary lifestyle that means a lack of daily physical activity, a day's sitting in front of the TV, and the use of means of transport instead of walking short distances.
Overweight is also due to a large caloric intake, i.e. greater consumption of sweetened beverages, carbohydrates (tamales, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) with high fat and protein content, and the genetic burden that is the subject of this research.
In Asphalt from UNAM there will be no potholes
Rafael Herrera, a scientist at the Chemical Faculty of UNAM, creates modified asphalts with polymers to create a mixture with better functionality, independent of climatic conditions and temperature
If the cobbles were properly cared for, there would be no need to repair nearly 200,000 potholes after each rainy season in the Metropolitan area of Valle de México, Rafael Herrera hijacker, a scientist at the Chemical Faculty (FQ) at the UNAM, who also added that if the design and maintenance of asphalt paving were adequate, there would be a significant reduction in potholes, or even be able to be removed altogether.
In his lecture, the Technology Cue of Colour, he delivered in the International Year of Chemistry, announced that the laboratory under his direction was developing modified polymer asphalt asphalt, creating a mixture with similar characteristics to the asphalt, but at the same time greater mechanical resistance, both at low and high temperatures.
Herrera Nájer believes that this type of modified asphalt could be used in places with extremely warm climates, such as in some cities in the north of the country. This would improve functionality and reduce the creation of potholes.
He explained that asphalt, the heaviest part of the crude oil, is a cluster of hydrocarbon molecules, moocclescopic molecules called asphaltes, and other low molecular weights called mortars. Together, they give the asphalt a typical viscoelastic character.
The viscole-easterty nature of asphalt is that at high temperatures, around 180 degrees, it behaves like a liquid, has a high viscosity at 120 degrees and is almost in firm state at 50 degrees, while at low temperatures, asphalt tends to break, he added.
This means that the resistance of asphalt in the streets is not uniform, but changes during the day according to meteorological conditions and temperatures, the chemical engineering expert pointed out.
A scientist at the Chemistry School observed that most of the streets in Ciudad de México are covered with flexible paving, which consists of six layers of materials, the last three of which are mixed with asphalt.
Among the top layers are asphalt insert, made up of small stones, then compressed in the asphalt.
He stressed that every stone that forms the liner is topped with asphalt.
When passing cars or when pressuring, it is thus possible to disinherit the forces in the pavement well.
If it was modified asphalt, they would break up even better, the chemical engineer believes.
He added that the asphalt insert would be the last layer called the cloak, made up of fine rock, i.e. sand also encased in asphalts.
As this layer will come into contact with the vehicle rims, it must have more mechanical strength than the asphalt insert and must ensure the friction of the road.
As part of the cobbles, it will be subjected to heavy loads, the casing must be of sufficient thickness and care about the material from which it is made.
The climate, especially the humidity and the temperature changes, are also a very important factor to be remembered. Water in particular has a major impact on the functionality of the asphalt insert.
Once the terrain is damp, the water travels inwards and it is difficult to get out, this causes all layers of pavement to be softened and thus the formation of potholes.
He explained that the film of the cladding was the first to be damaged during the potholes' creation, and only then did the asphalt insert be damaged. However, the damage does not occur at one point, but it is a gradual process that should be stopped at the first stamps using appropriate maintenance programmes.
As a member of the National Researchers System, he also explained that the load on vehicles is another important factor in creating potholes, and therefore the thickness of each individual layer of paving must be commensurate with the load of vehicles and it must be guaranteed that this burden will not be exceeded. Only in this way can we prevent the frequent emergence of potholes.
Rafael Herrera pointed out that there is still a lot of work to do when it comes to asphalt, and the research is at the beginning. It is worth mentioning, for example, asphalt emulsions, which are already available on the market in other countries and make it easy to repair potholes without having to use high temperatures.
What was missing from the Valla ticket to become the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that contributed to Melina Ramírez Serna's failure to win the crown of Miss Colombia.
Valle thus wins the 14th title of the first multi-Niss.
Valle del Cauca again failed to reach the Miss Colombia crown.
Melina Ramírez Serna had to be content to find herself on the podium of the winner, winning a silver crown and a sash, on the basis of which she became Colombia's new first multipack.
Based on the results of yesterday's final in Cartagena, in which she won and the sceptre took over Miss Atlántico, the department in question won the 14th title of the first multi-Piss. Melina thus joined the crowds of women from the Valle del Cauca, who came within reach of the winning crown, but were eventually named the first multipissian. These include Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Mónica Evers (1989), María Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero3), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008).
The question many ask. What was missing?
The result is the defeat of the big favorite, who in all previous rounds showed that she has the ups and downs to become the new Miss Colombia, and not for nothing has become the Queen of the Police and the prettiest face of Joile de Volgue. These titles were achieved by Taliana Vargas and Natalia Navarro, who subsequently took home the title of Miss Colombia.
One of the key factors that decided that the jury decided to appoint only the First Multiss is that it did not convince with its answer to the question: "Which book did you like best and why?", which was written by Martín Murillo Gómez from the Literary Editor's Leamos.
When asked by the candidate, she replied:
"I'm in a lot. I believe very much in the role of literature, I think it is one form of cultivation. The book that influenced me most in my childhood was the "Little Prince," a very deep book.
I am currently reading "Crime and Punishment." It is a book that is part of the global literature that we should all know. And today I have a book with me by Irene Nemirovski, a Russian author. It is a wonderful book called "El ardor de la sangre".
This answer did not sit well with the term "culturalisation" and, secondly, because the candidate did not explain what the various books were marked by the various books.
After the ceremony was over, Melina said she was at peace and pleased with the result: "The world is wise to do what is to happen, it will happen.
And you people, read, if you can. The Little Prince is a beautiful book."
One of the other hypotheses is that Valle has destroyed the position of the favourite.
The Bogota journalist suggested that the candidate had been the most popular, most celebrated from the start, and the one who had won all the previous awards (Oster's Gastronomic Challenge, the Public title for Best Artistic Dress and the Queen Mother), aroused the envy of other contenders, stressed out the Queen, who then failed on the scene.
This was evident during the first presentation of the swimsuit on Hilton beach and during the two shows before the final to the final tolling.
Although she was glowing on both of them, she was aware that she lacked the strength and fervour shown by the representatives from Magdalena and Atlántico.
Ariel Osorio, a journalist for the "Lam Home" program at the Canal RCN, believes that Melinda's first multi-dog title is confirmed by the fact that the candidate who will win the most titles in the end does not leave with the Queen's crown during the competition."
Moreover, Valle has held a rather unfriendly attitude toward the media in recent days, and that hasn't paid off.
Another hypothesis is that Valle failed to convince the jury of his interest in social work, which is the basis of the National Beauty Competition.
Just on the sidelines, two days before the election, international jurywoman Lucy Doughty said they were looking for a woman who would be aware of her country's social needs.
"In the Miss Colombia beauty competition alone is not enough, you need to see even more than just physical beauty. The focus must be on social feeling. It is important that the candidates are involved in such projects before they enter the competition," she explained.
There is also speculation that the candidate Valle has lost points due to shortcomings in her background and fibrosis, which was visible on the bottom. But this is completely at odds with the jury's verdict, which chose miss "natural beauty" for the healthiest body, the right nutrition and responsible physical activity.
Jorge Hernán Orozco, who prepares the queens, acknowledges that Melina did not have the best body, that there were better girls, "but the fibrosis problems on the bottom, which I don't think were too noticeable, took her points off until the last day."
Meanwhile, journalist Guido Hoyos of Cromos magazine believes the Walla native made a mistake in undergoing several surgical procedures.
'The surgical interventions are fine, but they didn't work out in the Valla.
The body was never her forte, and here she took her toll'.
Because of this award, which was first given by the National Assembly of Beauty, after the swimsuit show, there was a cruel prediction that came to fruition. It was claimed that this was the satisfaction that Raymundo had given Melina not to end up awarding the highest crown to her.
Whether it's true or not, what is certain is that Melina has now started her year of reign, not as a queen, but as a princess, from a position that gives her the opportunity to represent Colombia at various international competitions, where she will be named the National Competition herself.
However, he will go down in history as one of the queens who, despite the stirring success in Cartagena, did not reach the highest crown.
Such was the work of the Cali resident who identified the corpse of Alfonso Cano
The Cali fingerprinting expert went down in history as a man who confirmed the death of "Alfonsa Cana."
The work of these officials is crucial.
On November 4 of last year, the CTI fingerprints expert in Cali made history as the man who confirmed the identity of the Supreme Leader Farc: "Alfonles Cana," by comparing fingerprints.
Of the seven fingerprints experts working in the CTI department, this week's turn was for Eliazar González, a man from Puert Tejad who has worked in forensic research for 21 years.
Early in his career, González worked at the town hall in Chocó, where he often had to make his way through the forest for more than five days to get to the place where the corpses had to be identified.
He moved to the capital, Valle, in 2000, and after completing the respective courses, began to specialize in fingerprints. This science deals with the study of skin friction, i.e. the hands and feet of the hands.
In the week of the operation against the aforementioned Alfonso Can, Eliazar was told to take his clothes with him for at least three days.
Something big was expected.
On Friday night he set off for Cauco in a helicopter from Palmiro.
He knew he would have to identify two corpses and that he suspected that one of them was the man who ran the world's oldest guerrillas. So they asked him to take a card with the fingerprints of Guillermo León Sáenze (his real name).
However, when he arrived with the investigating team at the scene where the corpse was, he did not recognize him because of his physical appearance. He looked quite different from the media.
He had no beard, he was dressed as a villager in the area, without his glasses, much slimmer.
But the prints don't lie.
Along with the galton magnifying glass, ink and the transporter and light, Eliazar began comparing the dactyl recordings of the corpse with the card entries.
The eye did not disappoint him: it was "Alfonso Cano."
The same night, the man originally from Puerto Tejad was charged with confirming to the Minister of Defence, Juan Carlos Pinzón, whether he was indeed the commander-in-chief Farc.
Finding tracks
For the dactyloscophocope of the Sijín de Cali, the recognition that President Juan Manuel Santos has shown to Eliazar González at a press conference of the operative service against "Can" is very significant.
A lot of people don't know our jobs.
Dactyloscopy is an exact science, without the possibility of error, which can play a key role in the decision-making of offences.
In addition to identifying corpses, these people help in researching crimes such as theft or murder and corrupt the identity of the people caught.
When they are caught, a lot of offenders present fake documents or do not have papers at all.
We take their fingerprints and look for them in the database.
The investigator told us that in the event of an injury, he had to remove a piece of the house's wall in the house, because in this place the thief was leaning on to pull out a safe full of jewelry and money.
The walls are difficult because they are not designed to collect prints, but in this case we could get the imprint of the whole hand and identify the perpetrator involved in several thefts," he recalled.
Fingerprints can also confirm or disprove suspicions in the case of murder.
Not long ago, they found a dead man with bottles of alcohol around him.
Based on the investigation, it was discovered that one of the family members could be responsible for the murder and the bottle print actually confirmed it.
Although it is not 100% to be confirmed that he was indeed the killer, it is clear that he appeared on the scene of the crime.
The CTI fingerprints expert explained that the items were "shaped with chemical or physical reactive substances."
When they appear, a transplant or tape is used for their collection.
The prints are then sent to Asif, a database of offenders, or to the Registration.
"The problem is that there are still many Colombians whose data are not recorded anywhere," the CTI expert said.
He explained that not everything is as shown in the CSI television programme.
Like everything that glitters, there's no gold, not everything you touch, there are clues.
However, if it can be used, the appropriate comparison must be made.
"Interplanation" protests in New York
Hundreds of manifestoers crowded into Zuccotti Square, where they wanted to camp.
A large part of them waited for the order to clear the area and moved to a nearby park.
Members of the movement's obscure Wall Street movement provoked a New York official on Tuesday as they tried to reap the Manhattan Square in Manhattan, from where they were escorted out in the morning. Afterwards, they tried to take on another New York park.
Hundreds of manifestants crowded into Zuccotti Square, where they wanted to get through a court order that allows "rare-increasing" to return to the site. The second part of the movement responded to the eviction by taking over a park in the north of the city, where further detentions took place.
"If the court does not allow us to return to the square, we will settle in a different place and continue a legal battle to return to Zuccottti, both through rallies and peaceful rallies," said one of the spokesmen of the "Set Wall Street" movement, Mark Bray.
Bray clarified that the "extraged" response to the evictment of the camp, ordered by the mayor of New York, Michael Bloomberg, had reached the court where, where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order prohibiting the forcible evicting the site and allowing the manifesto to continue to be set up there.
In addition, the "eatenery" took over another park located at the intersection of Central Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, near the entrance to the Holland tunnel that connects New York and New Jersey, and the rectory grounds at Trinity Church.
They managed to take the place for at least an hour, but then the police came and detained some of the manifestants. Bray didn't know the exact number, but said he saw that they had also handcuffed some journalists.
The organization assures that several hundred people have taken up residence at the scene. A delegation of religious officials also came to express their support and also try to negotiate with the police.
Meanwhile, Zuccotti Square, which is a private property, remains closed. A court hearing is expected to take place on Tuesday, during which the legality of the morning evacuation should be analysed.
Some of the relocated manifestants even distributed and handed out copies of the court order and even gave them to members who guarded the square, which sparked "some small clashes," said Bray, who condemned the fact that some officers beat the manifesto.
A court order prohibits authorities from evicting members of the "Ocupa Wall Street" movement or use " laws that were published after the claim began, or to ban the manifestos from the park with shops or other places they used to use."
The mayor of Bloomberg told the press that due to this court order, the city suspended the reopening of public space and warned the manifestants that local laws did not allow them to return to the tents and sleeping bags.
The city's top official personally defended the morning eviction of Zuccotti Square, an operation in which 200 people were detained and who were acceded to because the manifestos were "breaking the law."
Bloomberg explained that he had ordered the evacuation of the square because it was becoming "a place where people did not go to protest, but to break the law and in some cases to hurt others," because "some shops received threatening letters" and "neighbors feared for the quality of their lives."
"The morning eviction was appalling and shows that Bloomberg is trying to maintain financial interests at the expense of the American working people," added the spokesman of the movement, accusing the mayor of "did not weigh freedom of expression."
Representatives of the "Ocupa Wall Street" movement also said they planned to organize "big events" for Thursday in cooperation with community and trade unions to commemorate the two months after which the protests were ongoing. These began on September 17.
Pamela Anderson will present the Virgin Mary in a special Christmas TV show
Together with Michael Bublé and other major Canadians, she will appear in the television programme "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" on 1 December
Canadian Pamela Anderson was Tim Allen's assistant at "Home Improvement," a lifeguard at "Baywatch," bunny in "Playboy," wife of the rock musician Tommy Lee, and now the actress and model will be Panna Maria on a special Christmas show for Canadian television.
Private TV's CTV reported today that Anderson, along with the singer of sentimental songs, Michael Bublé, and other major Canadians, will appear on the TV programme "It's a. and Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1 and will embody the Virgin Mary.
CTV today showed footage from a television program in which Anderson, also known for online domestic pornographic images, will appear with her ex-husband, the "Mötley Crüe" engine, Tommy Leo, as the Virgin holding a doll presenting Santa Claus in the manger.
As Joseph, Peters, a well-known Canadian comedian of Indian descent who recently served as a presenter on the "My Violent Torpedo of Truth" tour, appears on the scene.
For the name of both Anderson and Peters, a special Christmas broadcast by CTV, a Canadian singer Bublé, who married Argentine model Luisana Lopilato in Buenos Aires at the end of March, will appear on a special Christmas broadcast of CTV, and who is close to controversy.
Recently, Bublé called the American Kim Kardashian a "fisherman" at one of her concerts in New York.
Japan returns to life after devastating earthquake
GDP grows 1.5% thanks to household consumption, ending the period of falls that began in March
Since March of last year, Japan's economy has been paralysed, now recovering from a devastating earthquake that has grown into a nuclear crisis, the worst disaster the country has faced since World War II.
The first estimates of the Tokyo government put material losses at $300,000 million, a blow that heals well despite the difficult global situation.
After three quarters of falls, the value of GDP between July and September came to such a position that it was possible to turn the page to definitively: GDP grew by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and by 6% a year.
Moreover, the results of the second quarter - for the Japanese, the tax year starts in March 2012 - predict the highest growth rate compared to the period January to March 2010.
The recovery can be partly explained by the purchase of the machines that are necessary to rebuild the earthquake-damaged areas and the subsequent tsunami.
Businesses have increased their investment by 1.1%, spending will fall by 0.9% from the January-March period. This is the first decline in six months of continuous growth.
However, the real awakening of the Japanese economy is based solely on the impetus that forces the crisis to emerge from strengthening or rebuilding infrastructures. It is about using the shortage to start from scratch.
Japan woke up. In particular, thanks to the development of domestic consumption, which currently represents 60% of Japan's GDP.
This variable increased by 1%, thanks to an increase in expenditure on vehicles, travel and leisure activities.
Stigma yen
The streams were put in the hands of the internal market when yen - the Japanese currency - became one of the "rescue values" for investors fleeing the eurozone's debt crisis and the worrying US projections. It is a privilege, but it is also a heavy burden on export companies.
With a stronger currency, products are more expensive abroad, which is negative for a country whose economy is determined by the financial health of the major technology groups.
Toyota or Sony, for example, attributed their weak results in July to the yen course in September.
While markets continue to besiege the EU's peripheral countries, Yoshihiko Noda's government is cautious.
"We must be careful about the risks that persist, such as the destruction of some foreign economies, the impact of flooding in Thailand and the rapid increase in yen," said State Secretary for Economic Policy Motohisa Furukawa yesterday.
Indeed, the perspectives are not encouraging.
The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) clarified that most member countries showed clear signs of an economic slowdown in September.
The indicator, which anticipates inflexibility in the world economy, has shown that the economy of the major powers is slowing.
It dropped four-tenths to 100.4 points, compared to 100.8 in August.
The euro area has even come below the average at 100. It reached the level of 99.13 points.
Athens spreads uncertainty again
Papadimos says austerity measures will be approved, but the Conservatives will not sign any written commitment
With the rapid and risky marginal guarantees and the uncertainty that has reigned again, Greece is increasingly entranced to the labyrinth that leads to the exit from the great debt crisis in Europe.
The assumption that the "conciliation" of the new transitional Greek government is given by the demands of Brussels rather than by the true conviction of the political forces is being confirmed.
While the new prime minister, Lukas Papadimos, admitted yesterday that there is no alternative for structural reforms and that the 100-day period he received when he appointed is likely to be short for their application, the leader of the conservative New Democracy party, Antonis Samaras, said he would not support the new austerity measures in any case and reiterated his demand for new elections for the expected date of 19. February.
"The main task of this government is to apply the decision of the summit of 26. October," Papadimos said yesterday during a parliamentary debate that will culminate tomorrow with a vote of confidence in the government.
The package with 24 programmes to boost employment, the reform of the disciplinary code of officials and the new measures against tax evasion will be among the first initiatives.
However, the message to Samaras does not clear any doubts about his position: 'We have made a commitment to help the transitional government, but we have not committed to anything further'.
The Conservative President went a little far in his speech to the EU and the IMF. These organisations are supposed to unblock the 8 billion that Athens urgently needs. But he also said he would not support and sign any commitment to the implementation of austerity measures.
Yesterday, the European Commission, enraged by the impact of the impact caused by the talk of the referendum, stressed that its demands were insurmountable: it would not unblock any assistance if the new government and the leaders of the main parties did not sign a "script commitment with ambiguity and as soon as possible."
A spokesman for Economic Affairs, Amadeu Altafaj, explained that the inspectors from the Three will return to Athens "very soon" to negotiate with the new government about "what it needs to pay for the sixth part" of 8 billion. But the final date does not exist.
The Greek spinner has a moment longer to knit.
Queen Sofia: 'There are tools for progress and hope'
The Queen highlights the privileged position of Spain in relation to this kind of finance
Spain has "reached a significant position at global level in terms of microfinance."
Queen Sofia yesterday recalled that the country has become the second donor of the planet in the last two decades in terms of this instrument of cooperation, the essence of which is "that it is an instrument of social progress, justice and a hope for a better future for all of humanity. It's a tool based on trust in man."
Yesterday, the Queen launched the 5th Global Microwas Summit in Valladolid with the belief that there is no doubt" that this type of operation is "concerned" in order to reach the Millennium Goals set by the UN by 2015. "In particular, it is about achieving goals to achieve a reduction of half the number of people who live with less than one dollar per day, the amount that sets the poverty threshold."
Spain will "multiary to continue to work" and expand a network of volunteers "in all the corners of the planet and take this task responsibly," stressed Queen Sofia, who hopes that the Summre's initiatives and benefits, which will last until Thursday, "ensure to create better capacities and opportunities for the poorest and especially for women" to whom these loans are intended primarily.
"We have reached out to much now" and "many challenges are still ahead of us."
The Micro-Lentisation Summit is intended not only to be a discussion forum, but also a platform to support "basic objectives."
Her Majesty explained that the aim was for 175 million poor families to have access to these financial services by the end of 2015 and for 100 million families to be above the poverty threshold they are currently living under.
The concept of micro-loans spread to Spain and other nations of the world after "the pioneer of the idea of Muhammad Yunus embarked on this journey," the Queen said, adding that this was "an act of justice and the necessary recognition."
She described the instrument's father as "an admirable idealist who embarked on a path to fight poverty." She met his work 15 years ago when she went to Bangladesh to meet his lending policy on the spot.
This experience was followed by others. The first global summit in Washington and another meeting, such as in Côte d'Ivoire in 1999, Canada in 2006. "In all these meetings, I was able to establish a constant development, explained the Queen, who, thanks to her support for this project, earned the title of "head of the family" yesterday, which was awarded to her in Valladolid by the "movement of the poor."
The Queen Sofia concluded her performance by urging the participants to engage in discussions and the search for solutions to allow them to continue the fight against poverty.
"Ethical imperative"
Minister for Foreign Affairs, Trinidad Jiménez, said solidarity "is an ethical imperative" that must be governed by all democratic states.
In this sense, she said it would be a mistake to link cooperation with developing countries only with the balobyt period, because this cooperation is a "permanent duty."
Jiménez believes that microloans represent a "serious and honest policy to eliminate poverty" and now, more than ever, the governments of developed countries must work in accordance with the solidarity criteria and not allow solidarity to be the victims of cuts.
For Spain, micro-loan is one of the main lines of development cooperation.
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodriguez, welcomed the success that celebrates the concept of giving confidence to the people who are being closed by the door to all the others. Mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva welcomed the participants to the city, which "opens its gates with a spirit of solidarity that is infectious."
CDU proposes to vote for European president on the basis of universal suffrage
Without serious trouble for the chancellor and Christian Democratic Party leader Angela Merkel, the first day of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) congress took place in Leipzig on Monday, November 14.
The question of the future of Europe was not originally on the agenda, but it did not happen until the autumn, in particular to be satisfied by party members who see the government's policy towards the Greeks today and perhaps tomorrow for the Italians as lax.
The proposal for the President of the European Commission under leadership was adopted almost unanimously.
Only nine of the 1001 delegates were against and 10 abstentions.
A few minutes of standing up at the end of Angela Merkel's performance, and then a few hours later, Wolfgang Schäubl, a very pro-European finance minister, left no room for doubt.
The chancellor's main idea and the proposal can be summarised in the slogan: the response to the crisis is "not less Europe, but more Europe."
Not only because Europe means peace, but because "nine million jobs depend directly on the euro."
According to the chancellor, in Europe, "the time for change has come."
This could be reflected in the amendments to the Lisbon Treaty that make it possible to strengthen the European Union's control over the budgetary policies of the euro area members, but it could also result in the election of the President of the European Commission on the basis of universal suffrage 'with the aim of giving Europe one face'.
Such is in any case one of the ideas of the draft adopted by the congress, the inspiration of which is clearly Wolfgang Schäuble.
It is certainly unlikely that all twenty-seven countries will quickly agree on this revolutionary step: the United Kingdom is opposed, and CDU leaders think Nicolas Sarkozy will also take the same position.
But the direction is being set.
Likewise, the delegates rejected by a large majority the proposal to value each country's weight on the board of directors of the European Central Bank, depending on the weight of its economy, which will evidently result in Germany's weight enhancement.
Leadership to calm the climate within her party, the chancellor made several references to Conrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl. But it did not seek to win congress through talk of "little" European states or states in trouble, willing to criticize an arrogant Germany.
Though the proposal on Europe is devoted to one paragraph of the importance of the "Franco-German friendship," Angela Merkel did not quote France.
Only indirectly.
When she recalled that just two hundred years ago there was a bloody battle at Leipzig.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleonic army.
What constitutes disability fraud?
After the aids, the UMP and the government are launching an offensive against work-incomposits.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be in Bordeaux on Tuesday 15 December and will visit the Social Support Office, where he will give a speech on the subject of a recurring debate since 2007 on combating social fraud and redistributing redistribution.
As an escalation of this offensive, which is based on the will to make savings in the context of increased rigour, but is no less clear from the perspective of the right-wing presidential campaign, the right-wing majority wants to focus on disability.
First, because of budget savings, the government intends to impose on private sector employees the fourth day of incapacity for work before they start taking sick leave.
Clearly speaking, without the approval of a business, an employee who gets sick would lose four days' wages, or at least 15% of his monthly income.
A measure that risks causing much evil blood, but which, according to Les Echos, could bring in €280 million.
And a measure that would be accompanied by another measure of symbolic reach: to give civil servants one day of unpaid disability (until yet they have no incapacity to defaults compared to three days in the private sector).
While these issues are under discussion, the right-wing majority also launch a fraud theme focused this time on abuses tied to work incompetence.
"The inspections will be much more extensive and, moreover: if you are caught, you will return," Xavier Bertrand pointed out during an interview given to RTL on Sunday, November 13.
As in other cases, the effects of the notification appear somewhat disproportionate to the truth of injustices in sick leave.
These have in fact been the subject of constant surveillance since 2002 and of the political onslaught that bore fruit.
The French are no more sick than elsewhere in Europe.
Let's stop at a few official numbers first.
According to the Caisse nationale d'assurance maladie (CNAM - state health insurance company), more than 237 million euro euro daily allowances were paid out in 2006.
According to the French Institute for Research and Documentation in Health, daily compensation in 2008 with its 11.3 billion euros was 5% of health-care expenditure.
Of this amount, 46% related to maternity and accidents at work and 54% related to incapacity for work, i.e. 6.2 billion euros.
That is, only 2.5% of the cost of health care.
According to a study by the Alma Consulting group, the French had an average of 14.5 days of sick leave in 2010, compared to 17.8 days in 2009.
Average that hides certain variations: another poll published in r. In 2007, Monster.com's job opportunities site showed that 75% of the 40,000 French employees surveyed said they had not chosen any sick leave day.
Another study, this time carried out by the institutions of sickness insurance, specifies that in the morning. 2010 37.8% of the incapacity for work was shorter than 8 days, 22% from 8 to 14 days, 15% from 15 days to 1 month, 15% from 1 to three months and 11% took longer.
When we compare them with their European neighbours, French workers are no longer prone to work-incapacity.
One long study conducted in 2010 by two CNRS (National Research Center) researchers showed that between 1994 and 2001, the overall absence (for health or reasons) oscillated in France between 10% and 11.8% against 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the UK and 18% in the Netherlands.
Cheating on work incapacitated accounts for only a small part of it compared to undercover work.
As far as fraud is concerned, these are only small in scale.
Strengthening legislation from r. 2002 has caused systematic checks to be held on incapacity for work for more than 45 days.
In 2008, CNAM noted that with 1.5 million inspections, 13.8% of the 285,000 were carried out due to short-term incompetences of "unjust or over-hyped," i.e. 37 050 cases.
In the case of systematically controlled incompetencies of more than 45 days, 11% of "unaccapitated or unauthorised" cases were counted at 1.2 million inspections, i.e. 132 000.
A total of 169,000 "unjustly" cases for several million employees who were incapacitated.
A figure that represents far less than a number expressing black work.
According to UMP MP Dominique Tian, the author of the June report on the issue, this figure would be 9 to 15 billion euros missing in tax collection per year, i.e. more than the total amount of daily allowances and thus infinitely more than the fraud associated with the latter.
Papademos: Greece will have to apply new rescue plan
Greece will need a new bailout program to re-establish its economy.
On Monday 14 December, Prime Minister Lucas Papademos made the words before the parliament, adding that the hundred days given to his unity government would not be enough to fulfill this task.
"To get our economy back on its feet, we need the support of our European partners and a new bailout plan," the head of the government said as he made his first public speech on Wednesday opening a debate to vote of confidence in parliament.
Application of the decisions taken 27. October at the eurozone summit will be the 'mainst task' of the new government, as our country's participation in the euro area is in play, he added.
As a result, Mr. Papademos assumed that the country's public deficit would be "quarter in the neighborhood 9%" of gross domestic product from now until the end of the year after it was 10.6% in the year. 2010 and 15.7% in R. 2009.
The Right Rejects New Average Apringse
The leader of the right, Antonis Samaras, made his support for an already-approved measure on Monday to try to escape the debt crisis, but cautioned that his party is not taking any additional austerity measures.
"We will not raise our hand for any new measures," Samaras stressed at a meeting with his New Democracy MPs.
We have agreed to targets to reduce the deficit and debt and fight against waste, but we are against any policy that would hinder economic recovery.
Mr Olli Rehn, the European Commissioner for the Economy and the Curd, who warned that the IMF and the EU would not unblock the necessary €8 billion loan without a written guarantee from all the parties to support the envisaged measures, Antonis Samaras replied that his word was enough and that he would not sign anything under external pressure.
Euthanasia and assisted suicide need to be legalized, says expert commission
According to a report by the Royal Canadian Society, the Canadians are being denied death.
In the matter of the Palliative Care, the Commission urgently requires governments, health care institutions and doctors to work together to provide the best pliative care, even in cancer cases.
Canadian society lives with the idea of denying death.
Only 9% of Canadians do accept the ability to talk to the doctor about the conditions in which they want to die and take the decision to that effect.
This is one of the conclusions of the Royal Canadian Society's extensive report, involving six experts working in various fields, which included ethics, law and medicine.
This commission recommends that the government change the criminal right to allow assisted suicide and euthanasia if that choice appears to be necessary for a patient deemed competent to take such a decision.
In the beginning, experts cite a recent poll by the independent Economist Intelligence Unit, which compared the quality of death in the 40 countries of the planet.
Although Canada ranked 10th, the study notes that "the medikalization of death in Canada has given rise to a culture in which people are afraid to talk about death."
Medicatization yes or no, 77% of Canadians do not have access to the Palliative Care, experts with the mandate of the Royal Canadian Society tell us.
And despite the desire to die at home, which most Canadians have, 68.6% of them die in the hospital.
This average is true for the whole of Canada, while in the province of Quebec this figure is the highest with 86% of those who died in hospital.
As for the delicate issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the report's authors come to conclusions that go against the position of the federal government, which has already said that she does not want to change anything about criminal justice regarding euthanasia and assisted suicide.
According to the experts, who have also inspected all countries where these approaches are legalised or not considered a criminal case, there is no evidence that this criminalisation causes any abuse in the application, i.e. practicing euthanasia or assisted suicide to non-competitors or non-compliant persons.
On the contrary, p. Jocelyn Downie, the report's co-author, confirmed more than numerous cases of these missteps in teleconference yesterday in countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are not legalized.
"Euthanasia is also carried out in Canada, where it is clearly illegal."
"Assuitized suicide is also carried out in Canada, where it is clearly illegal," explains Jocelyn Downie.
Canadians are in favor of euthanasia
Recall that, according to an inquiry conducted by the Angus Reid Forum in 2010, 85% of Canadians have already spoken in favour of euthanasia because they believe it will allow those at the end of their lives to ease their suffering.
And 66% believe that legalizing euthanasia will not mean that we are sending out a message about the fact that the life of old or handicapped people is worth less.
As for those who practice assisted suicide, 41% of people surveyed think they should not be prosecuted.
The situation is less clear in the matter of maintaining or interrupting patient care, the authors of the report say.
They also propose in the list of their recommendations that it should be stated in criminal law that the withdrawal from the treatment for which there is a legally confirmed refusal is not criminal.
The Commission of Experts also requires specialist doctors to be trained to the obligation to respect the refusal of treatment at the end of their lives without fearing a prosecution.
In the matter of the Palliative Care, the Commission urgently requires governments, health care institutions and doctors to work together to provide the best pliative care, even in cancer cases.
Finally, in the matter of the paliant or final detention of the already widely used in the Canadian health care facilities, the commission requires that it be considered euthanasia when it is no longer used to reduce physical pain and to be subject to the same procedures.
Reservations of other experts
Some medical law experts have already voiced their reservations about the findings of the Royal Canadian Society's experts' report.
Mr. Pierre Deschamps, a specialist in medical law, qualified the position of expert-signator of the report as "extreme" among other things because it does not restrict the practice of euthanasia to the sufferers in the final stages.
"This opens the door to a situation where anyone who is tired of life and who is more than 18 years old could request to help him commit suicide," says Pierre Deschamps, who studied the résumé news yesterday.
P. Deschamps also underlines that it looks as if the authors of the report are putting the autonomy of the person above all the other values that shape the social fabric of society.
For "in society, he says, there are warning signs and restrictions."
Medical law specialist Margaret Somerville also expressed strong objections to the conclusions of the report, which she qualified as a ""manifesto for euthanasia."
Margaret Somerville, who is herself a member of the Royal Canadian Society, particularly doubts the reports on the absence of misconduct in some countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legalized, i.e. in the Netherlands and the US state of Oregon.
King of Jordan calls on President Assad to resign
Damascus talks about "complote"
Syria is increasingly isolated
Bashar al-Assad's supporters rallied in front of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs yesterday.
Yesterday, diplomatic pressures on Syria intensified by President Bashar al-Assad, who, with the support of Russia, resists them and talks about "command" against his country.
Two days after the suspension of Syria's membership of the Arab League, the European Union intensified its sanctions against Damascus, while Turkey and Jordan, countries bordering Syria, took a stand in favour of President Assad's departure.
King Abdallah II of Jordan yesterday was the first ruler of the Arab state to call on President Bashar al-Assad to be killed in Syria, where about forty civilians and members of the regime's military forces were killed," he said.
"If Bashar had the interests of his country at heart, he would have to resign, but he would also have to create the conditions necessary for the new phase of Syrian political life," the king of Jordan, a country bordering Syria, said in an interview with the BBC.
For his party, the head of Turkish diplomacy, Ahmet Davutoglu, regretted that the efforts made by the Turkish mediation with the Syrian regime to the company had not been crowned with success since the beginning of the year.
"Those who do not live in peace with their people in the Middle East and cannot satisfy them will leave," he said, alluding to neighboring Syria, to which Turkey is applying an increasingly harsher line.
The United States rejoiced in the "manthemum of the consensus against Assad and the dishonest negotiations of the Syrian regime" after the decisions of the League of Arab States and the European Union.
"International Community, the United States, the European Union, the League of Arab States, countries such as Turkey are applying an increasingly harsher tone" against the repression in Syria, noted Mark Toner, spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
As reported by the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, 16 civilians and 19 members of the pro-regime forces died in the city of Deraa in the south of Syria during this time.
According to this NGO, two other civilian persons"won were killed as shootings and a concentrated shooting of heavy machine guns in the city of Jobar" in the Homs area.
After all, however, at a press conference, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Mouallem estimated that the country was "left out of the crisis."
Indeed, he also responded vividly to the Arab League's decision to suspend Damascus' membership, which he said was a dangerous move."
Syria"he will not bow down",he added with the assurance that "Complotings swaped against Syria will not succeed."
Following his decision to suspend Syria, the Arab State's League of Civil Protection is currently under consideration by the League of Arab States" and plans to send 500 human rights defenders, journalists and military observers to the country.
French Foreign Minister Alain Juppé is also favourably in favor of the idea of sending UN observers to help protect civilians from the repression of the regime, which he believes is "paranoidid" who he believes is being "paranoid."
A new special meeting of the League is being convened for tomorrow in Rabat to take a position on the plan to resolve the crisis, which was decided on 2 December, in particular envisaging the withdrawal of armies from cities plagued by dispensements and the liberation of imprisoned manifestants.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov considered the League's decision to be "wrong" yesterday, while China urged Syria to adopt a plan to resolve the crisis, but in doing so, to avoid fully promoting possible sanctions against Damascus.
Italy
Monti demands time and sacrifice after Italians
The next head of the Italian government, Mario Monti, has asked the markets for a little time to form his team and start implementing a program that will include"victs" in order to regain credibility lost in Berlusconi's government in recent months.
The former European Commissioner discussed with the political parties yesterday before meeting with trade union representatives and employers today.
He should form a relatively slender cabinet made up of technocrats not affiliated with parliamentary parties.
"Monti spoke of an important programme with many victims," said Francesco Nucara, a member of the numerous parliamentary groups in the talks, after meeting with the Prime Minister's designated minister.
Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies Gianfranco Fini expects Mario Monti to ask the parliament for a vote of confidence by Friday to make sure that the new government has sufficient support.
The consultation will end with Mario Monti's small team of twelve ministers, to be introduced to President Giorgio Napolitano.
Mario Monti yesterday commented on the jitters in the financial markets and asked them for time.
In the "democracy, the exact deadlines" apply in terms of the preparation of the government and its agenda, he stressed, adding that he is"confident that the markets will be patient and understand."
His appointment as president was favourably received at the start of the markets favorably, but the concern reiterated after the eurozone's unexpected industrial production slump in September.
The appointed Prime Minister should form a team involving mainly technocrats, although he stressed that he would like to accept"politicians."
He expressed confidence that the new government would last until 2013, i.e. the date of the next election.
According to the Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, the new government will receive the confidence of the parliament until Friday.
After taking office, Mario Monti promised to act with particular urgency and with the aim of making Italy a strong link in" Europe'
A spokesman for European Commissioner Olli Rehn stressed that "i with the new government, our diagnosis of the Italian economy is not changing."
The European Union is convinced that, despite the austerity plans adopted in recent months, Rome will not achieve its goal of a balanced budget in the morning. 2013, and it calls for new harsh measures.
The head of the Confindustria business union, Emma Marcegagli, who will meet with Montim on Tuesday, has focused on the need to revitalise the economy"s, as a country that shows no growth, cannot adhere to deficit parameters."
Mario Monti, former European Commissioner (1994-2004), recognized for his expertise and independence,"profesor" symbolizing, according to the authors of the editorials, a call to the seriousness of" and "jina Italy," represents for Italy "epochal change" after 17 years of "berlusconism."
The great unknown will be the time of his team's life.
President Napolitano would like to avoid an early election, as Italy must place 200 billion euro in government bonds by April 2012.
Soviet scientist helped Iran's nuclear program
Soviet scientist Vyacheslav Danilenko helped Iran develop a detonator usable for an atomic weapon, an American NGO specialized in atomic risk announced on Tuesday.
The Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS) relies on the recent report of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and other documents leaked from the UN agency to identify the scientist.
Last week, the IAEA gave its "serious concern" about the "possible military dimension" of Iran's nuclear program.
According to the ISIS Institute, a broad-based draw from IAEA documents by V. Danilenko (b. 1934) was to work for three decades since the 1960s at the Soviet military research centre in Chelyabinsk (Ural), where he was to be involved in the production of synthetic diamonds by the method of explosion.
In the r. 1989 or 1991 were to leave the resort to set up a business producing "nano-diamonds" in Kiev.
His company's economic difficulties were to lead him to contact him in the morning. 1995 of the Iranian Embassy in Ukraine.
Prior to his return to Russia, he was then to work together from 1996 to 2002 on the Iranian programme.
In its latest IAEA report, it recalls the "clear data that the development of the detonation system carried out by Iran" was based on the work of a foreign specialist who not only knew this method well, but who - as one member state informed the agency about it - worked during a substantial part of his working career on this technology within the military nuclear program of the country where he comes from."
Anti-Muslim criminal acts and offences up by 50%
According to FBI statistics released Monday, the number of criminal acts and offenses targeting Muslims has risen since the r. 2009 to r. 2010 by almost 50%, while at the same time other racial and religious violence fell slightly or risen poorly.
According to these figures, the total number of violence committed against Muslims increased from 107 a.m. 2009 in 160 in the morning. 2010, i.e. A 49% increase from the procedure of 13% for violence against Catholics, a decrease of 4% for offences against Jews and an overall increase of 14% for anti-religious criminal offences and offenses.
The total number of "hateless criminal acts" has risen very slightly to 6.628 cases, of which 47.3% were motivated by racial differences and 20% by religious differences, according to the FBI.
"After the decline in the r. 2009 it is disturbing to see these criminal acts and the offenses to rise again", stressed the Human First rights organization dedicated to human rights," the growth of anti-Muslim violence is particularly significant," the organization added in its communiqué.
"Human Rights First has long emphasized that the violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crime, must be considered a serious violation of man's rights," adds one of the organization's leaders, Paul Legendre.
"The US government can and must do more to deal with these abuses," he adds, estimating that this could be done by improving the police reports of "hateful criminal acts."
The "hate criminal act" in American federal law is a legacy of the age of the fight for civil rights.
This legal order was adopted after the death of Martin Luther King, to punish violence associated with race, skin color, religion, origin and now sexual orientation.
Twitter changes and resembles more Facebook
The Twitter microblogging service site introduced changes to design on Monday to enable its users to observe the activity of the successors, which is somewhat likened to its Facebook services.
The new "action" and"name" offer better and directly to know the activities of other people who are following you or the people whose answers ("tweets") are being watched by you.
This allows you to know if it allows you to track posts, whether they are logging in to new accounts, whether they have favorite posts, etc.
This new face of Twitter was tested"in August on a small percentage of users" before it was expanded to the entire network on Monday, a Twitter spokeswoman, Carolyn Penner, told AFP.
Twitter, which was known for its under-intlisted work, with the rather incomprehensible terms (RT for the repeated dissemination of someone else's post, followfriday pour recommander de suivre un autre utilisateur) faisant le bonheur des naiti, s'ouvre ainsi ainsi ahne publici and un public plus avec un maniement plus a comparable celui des réseaux grand public Facebook et Google+.
On the network, users immediately in their "tweets" judge the importance of this innovation differently.
"It's pointless, it takes up a lot of space and it looks too much like Facebook," writes @jemb123.
"Function Action will help me to follow some of the elements of my Twitter," he sent @dannykronstrom.
Austria
the inclusion of a golden rule on a balanced budget in the constitution
The government of the grand coalition of the Social Democrats and the Christian Democrats, which is in power in Austria, decided on Tuesday to write a "golden rule" of budget policy in the constitution to reduce the public deficit and thus avoid a possible reduction in Austrian ratings by credit rating agencies (AAA).
It was the social-democratic Chancellor Werner Faymann who announced this decision at the end of the ministerial meeting in a situation where the Austrian public debt, with its 74.6%, is well above the criterion of the maximum 60% laid down by the Maastricht Agreement but much lower than the debts of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
"If Austria's solvency were reduced by just one degree from AAA to AA+, we would have to pay three billion more euros in interest each year," argued the Vice-Chancellor and Foreign Minister, the baptismal democrat Michael Spindelegger.
Austria is thus following a request for a summit of the euro area countries held in Brussels on 26. October 2011, where the heads of state and government strongly asked to see the end of the r. 2012 the reduction of the public deficit and the balance of public accounts was entered into the constitution or in the law of the same value.
The instrument adopted by the Austrian government is approaching the "German model," Germany was the first European country to accept such a "rule."
By 2017, the public structural deficit will have to fall by 0.75% of gross domestic product (GDP) each year, and from 2017 onwards the public structural deficit of the federal state will not be allowed to exceed 0.35% of GDP each year, while the Lands, as well as municipalities, will have to report a balanced budget.
The aim is to bring public debt below the 60% criterion set by the Maastricht Treaty in the horizon of 2020/11.
Strong only
Noda threatens to intervene in foreign exchange markets
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshhiko Nod warned Tuesday that Japanese institutions would have to intervene again in the foreign exchange markets if he were to just keep up the workings.
"We will intervene, as we did last time, if we find out too much volatility" in the yen's exchange rate, he explained to the Senate Y. Noda.
On Tuesday, it only rose again to the historical values of 31. October, the Japanese authorities forced the intervention.
That day, Tokyo was selling yen for dollars to reduce the value of the Japanese currency, which had only recently broken the record against the dollar in force since 1945.
But only since then has he regularly risen supported by purchases by investors who see him as a "safe harbour" in the uncertain times of the world economic slowdown and the European crisis caused by debt.
The dollar was below 77 yen again on Tuesday, and the euro fell below the symbolic bar of 105 yen to the levels that triggered the latest intervention.
Before the financial crisis of 2008-2009, the dollar was worth about 120 yen and the euro was worth more than 160 yen.
This outburst of the Japanese currency is detrimental to island exports, making the price of Made in Japan's products more expensive and reducing the value of the proceeds generated by Japanese firms from abroad when they are transferred to the domestic currency.
"Japan is recovering" from the destruction caused by the March earthquake and the tsunami that devastated the Tohoku region in the northeast of the country, Y stressed. Noda, who fears that this hike to the yen, will not yet be killed by a fragile revival in the egg.
The world's third economic power resumed growth in the third quarter (1.5% in the previous quarter) for the first time in one year thanks to a survey of disaster-stressed household export growth and consumption.
But the Prime Minister concluded that the high value of the yen did not reflect the "National Economy of Japan."
Japanese Finance Minister Jun Azumi called on the Bank of Japan's Central Bank (BoJ), which launched a two-day meeting of its political and monetary council on Tuesday to take all possible measures to weaken the yen.
But the institution's multi-governor, Hirohide Yamaguchi, pointed out that the BoJ had previously taken "subsidical measures" suggesting that no additional monetary weakening could be expected on Wednesday.
At its last meeting at the end of October, the Securities Emissions Institute increased by 5,000 billion yoray (€47 billion) of its purchases of Treasury bills and raised to 55,000 billion yen (519 billion euro) the ceiling of the amounts he devotes to purchases of various securities to flood with liquidation.
Eurozone:
rates rise, stock exchanges fail
The risk of contagion of the debt crisis is still being undermined by European indicators.
Despite the appointment of new heads of government in Greece and Italy and better growth figures in France and Germany, rates of weakened countries continue to grow.
European stock markets still concerned about the stability of the euro area are falling to negative expectations on Tuesday 15 November today.
In Paris, at 10 a.m., the CAC 40 is down 1.4% at 3,064 points.
The Dax index in Frankfurt is down 0.4% and London 0.1%.
"With new tensions around the revenues from eurozone countries in difficulty, stock markets around the world continue to yield only a portion of recent gains."
"Nervous investors are only too aware of the risk of infection," explains Terry Pratt, a broker of IG Markets, quoted by Reuters.
The Tokyo exchange rate was closing with a decline of 0.7%, which it suffered because of concerns from market participants about Europe's ability to deal with the debt crisis.
"Japan, like the rest of the world, has eyes on Europe and the shift will only continue in a narrow corridor of variations until investors have evidence that the situation is stabilised," estimates Mitsushige Akino, the fund manager at Ichiyochi Investment Management.
This relaunch of uncertainties over the future of the euro area is hurting the currency itself, which continues to decline on Tuesday.
The euro is reaching its lowest level since a month and a half ago.
At 10 a.m., the European currency is worth $1.3570 as it goes 0.4% in a 0.4% drop.
According to the brokers, the currency backtracked after Chancellor Angela Merkel's CDU party adopted at its congress on Monday a proposal prescribing the possibility of leaving the euro area for countries in trouble, without therefore having to leave the European Union.
Italian and Spanish rates far beyond 6%
Interest rates on loans in Italy and Spain remain at a very worrying level.
This morning, on Tuesday, the Italian 10-year bond yields is 6.85%, and the Spanish 10-year bond yield is 6.2%.
These tensions at the interest rates of southern European countries, but also in France, continue to reinforce the concerns of market participants.
The head of the future Italian government, Mario Monti, strongly demanded time in the markets to remedy the situation in Italy threatened by the poisoning caused by its debt.
Greece's new Prime Minister, Lucas Papademos, confirmed that the implementation of the decisions taken in 27. October at the eurozone summit will be the "main task" of his government.
Spain is once again in a deliberate line of markets when the country's elections to the House of Commons are held on Sunday.
The “spread) rate gap between the 10-year bonds of Germany and Spain has reached a new historic high.
In anticipation of euro area growth numbers
The statistical figures say that France recorded economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter mainly due to household consumption, a little better than the expected 0.3% growth.
Nevertheless, the French National Institute for Statistics and Economic Studies INSEE revised downward figures for the second quarter to a 0.1% GDP decline instead of stagnation.
And, in fact, it's the fourth quarter that's most of all about economists.
On its own basis, Germany registered growth of 0.5% during the same period.
The first estimates for the entire eurozone are expected at 11am, while the European Commission has just highlighted the risk of a new recession.
Energy policy:
the facts must conquer dogma
If there is a theme that cannot be grasped on the basis of short-term balance sheets or under the emotions, it is energy policy.
Dispention and the price of electricity have a direct impact on the purchasing power and competitiveness of businesses.
It is only natural for the meeting at the election to be an opportunity to think about such deposits and the place that the core energy occupies.
The debate will only be successful when all the economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options are explored.
The French must base their position on objective facts and rational data.
So far, there are 7 billion human beings on the planet, but demographic developments will spark a duplication of electricity demand from now until 2050 if we do not want to rid a significant part of the world's population of life.
At the same time, a lack of fossil resources will need to be faced to continue to be generated, while not forgetting the necessary need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to combat climate change, a subject that is currently disappearing from environmental debates.
The Fukushima accident affects any of these parameters.
And that is why Germany remains alone in its decision to reject nuclear power.
But this is not the case for Belgium, which makes its decision to find some other source capable of replacing itself, nor by Switzerland, which considers it right to build only the last-generation power plants.
By contrast, the United Kingdom, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil to quote at least some countries, continue with determination in their projects.
The United States decided to expand its park with one unit after Fukushima by resuming the construction of one power plant interrupted after the Three Mile Island accident.
If a German model based on renewable energies is sometimes presented as an example, reality contradicts this.
The choice of Berlin will be reflected in the price of electricity rises, increased energy dependence on gas imported especially from Russia, the sharp rise in CO2 emissions generated by the construction of natural gas and coal power plants.
We will feel all these unpleasant effects in a matter of months.
The case of Denmark deserves to be considered.
The European champion of wind farms, from which it takes 30% of its electricity, is also one of the largest consumers of coal and gas because of the irregularity of the wind, which makes CO2 emissions and Danish electricity prices higher by 65%, respectively. 50% before the European average.
Conversely, thanks to the immutability of our energy policy, our neighbours will pay an electricity invoice 40% higher than the payment of French households.
While in a globalised economy the cost of energy is a key factor in competitiveness and a guarantee of keeping industry in the national territory, French companies enjoy the benefits of the cheapest electricity in Europe.
For this reason, any significant reduction in the share of nuclear energy would trigger a strong increase in the price of electricity, which would make illusory beautiful declarations of re-industrialisation of our country and the defence of purchasing power.
The price that a large majority of French people refuses to pay, just as it is fundamentally opposed to this energy, as the opinion polls show.
Recall that our country's energy policy has allowed the sector to be built with 125,000 direct jobs and 410,000 consecutive jobs.
The highly exporting sector is dragging a large number of small and medium-sized, specialist-in-strucking, jobs that cannot be transferred abroad, to international markets.
If France decided to leave the core, it would sacrifice a small number of these small and medium-sized enterprises and would lose the 6 billion euros a year the country receives for the export of nuclear facilities and services.
Which plant owner would order a nuclear reactor designed to operate for 60 years while the bankruptcy of its manufacturer was planned?
In addressing the energy equation, it must be accepted that there is no magical source for energy production, or even that there is no diabolical one.
The development of low-CO2 CO2 emissions installations, the renewable energy installations and renewable energy installations carried out by the French industrial group AREVA is indicative of the complementarity of the energy sources.
In the case of nuclear energy, maintaining the highest level of safety is essential.
In France, we have the State Office for Nuclear Safety, which conducts uncompromising and transparent oversight of existing nuclear power plants as well as the construction of a new Flamanville power plant.
Our teams, whose professionalism is recognized, have the idea of safety in their blood.
Fifty years, the nuclear industry has seen three serious accidents.
The only one in Three Mile Island occurred under normal operation conditions and was left without human casualties and environmental consequences.
In Chernobyl, the drama was caused by the design of the reactor and inexcusable human errors.
In the case of Fukushima, some seem to forget that the crash was the result of two natural disasters of unprecedented scale that caused the deaths of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will learn the lessons of this crash just as they did with the two previous ones.
The fruit of this step and the cooperation between the French and German nuclear safety authorities, the operators and the designers is that the EPR-type reactor is a concept capable of resisting such phenomena.
While all those interested in purchasing a nuclear power plant consider it to be, stopping its construction in Flamanville would be an excellent gift offered to competitors of AREVA and EDF's competitors and a way to seize a leading position in nuclear development.
It is essential and legitimate to look for the best energy solution for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let the emotions, dogmas and machinations dominate the debate crucial to the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Is immigration a burden or a chance for the economy?
The immigration policy conducted under Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticised from various angles - the overloading of the police, the courts and the administration subjected to the calculus policy, the compatibility of this policy with the status of "human rights" that France boasts about.
Recently, it was administrative harassment, the subject of which was foreign students, which became topical when the Minister of the Interior (see the newspaper Libération on May 23) said that France "doesn't need foreign talents, bricklayers and waitresses."
But so far it has rarely been discussed at an angle of the economy.
It must be said that there is a rather broad consensus between the left and the right in this area.
To the right tone in 1976, Jacques Chirac set out with his statement that the "900000 unemployed should not be a problem in a country where there are 2 million immigrant workers" and on the left Michel Rocard when he said in 1990 that France "cannot accept all the misery of the world."
The only difference is the degree of generosity
In 2005, the fear of the invasion of hordes by Polish plumbers to French territory was shared on the right and the left.
In both camps, immigrants are seen as a burden on the economy and French society.
The only difference lies in the degree of generosity we deign to immigrants.
In his programme, François Hollande confines himself to banality when he states that a joint development will make it possible to solve our "migration" problem."
This idea of immigration as a burden and a problem is perhaps in effect in elections, but it is economically very expensive.
As economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron recall in their recently published work synthesizing the latest knowledge of immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 p.m.: among specialists there is a broad consensus on the positive impact of migration movements on economic growth, wages and employment in the countries that receive immigrants.
Restricting immigration cripples growth and hurts employment.
Fears of the effects of migrants are based on the idea that these people can replace French workers, especially the less skilled, and put upward pressure to lower their wages.
But the experience shows that, in fact, immigrants are much more complemented by adding than female replacements for French employees by doing work in sectors with a lack of staff.
Low-skilled immigrants in sectors that do not attract French staff, and the most skilled in dynamic sectors in which education is not enough to offer places.
Positive effect on wages
Like a surgeon, he will have difficulty working in a country where there is a shortage of anesthesiologists, these additions between the French and the migrants are making immigrant arrivals a positive impact on the wages and employment of French workers.
Giovanni Peri thus calculated that the 1% increase in migration movements would trigger a long-term increase in real wages between between 0.6 and 0.9%.
And yet he does not take into account the fact that the diversity of immigrants brought about contributes to the creation of ideas and economic growth (a high proportion of naturalized immigrants among US Nobel laureates; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay, and Yahoo have been set up by immigrants).
Migrants are also net contributors to social systems in European countries at an average of 1% of the total budget.
For example, the World Labour Organisation estimates that in Germany, one immigrant arriving at the age of 30 will bring a net contribution to public budgets (income minus expenditure) to public budgets over the rest of the year.
At the start of his mandate, Nicolas Sarkozy made a wish to go for the lack of growth percentage with bared teeth."
The teeth in question to deter immigrants had the opposite effect.
Europe invents democracy, it remains to think about European democracy
Democracy is a rare and very fragile commodity.
The European continent should remember this, for despite having invented it in Athens two thousand years ago, it experienced during the XXth century the tragedies of world wars, totalitarian regimes, the Holocaust, the gulags, but also Franca in Spain, Salazar in Portugal and colonels in Greece.
Some could believe that in order for democracy to finally triumph over its enemies, it would be enough to make choices and carry out it in the most direct way possible.
But it has been known since Napoleon that it was an ease of thought.
General suffrage, though a necessary condition for democracy, is not a sufficient condition and can become a "something of oppression" as the Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot once said.
No, democracy requires much more: public space, public spirit, values, organization of department and control of power, education, enlightenment, social and economic solidarity, justice.
The crisis of Europe we are experiencing is an economic crisis, but it has been just as it has been since the start of the crises of politics and democracy.
The admission of a mistake by a Greek referendum of yes-ne will have the value of a double revelation in this regard: revelations in the need for a great return to political power, but also to revelate the disturbing sense of its impossibility, its inappropriateness.
This ambivalence must be thought through in order to be overcome.
The truth is that the frontline of the democratic struggle has been relocated today, and that many of the Republican fighters are no longer shooting in the right direction.
We cannot gain anything if we demand a series of national referendums held according to necessity and disorganised.
Bianko on display to the European absolutist monarch or jump with his feet tied to the emptiness of the nationalist depth: what choice for the citizen!
No, we do not want knives of guillotine, but a common, full-four, peaceful and continuous performance of selection and democracy, this time at European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal - we would not even know where to stop the list - for the crisis is in Europe.
It is the whole of Europe bending down to the dictates of markets and credit rating agencies that suffer from their inability and their lack of solidarity.
It is the whole of Europe that is being humiliated on the international stage.
We are alarmed in the transfer of sovereignty to Europe - but it is the whole of Europe that is slowly losing its sovereignty and with it each of its peoples.
Urgently, the governance of the European project of democratic sovereignty needs to be returned.
For only together will Europeans be able to reduce the burden of their debts, to get rid of the rule of markets and to prepare the future by investing.
The east of the crisis will envisage decisions at European level that cannot be taken without full democratic legitimacy, or it would lead us to disaster.
Having long fought against this proposal by the Socialists and Jacques Delors, everyone is now strongly demanding a European economic government.
So be it.
But to think that without stronger political and democratic integration, and experienced as such by the citizens, would be a new folly and a new impasse.
We must take on a new phase of European building.
To form a republic in France, it was necessary to "be" a Republican.
A revolution in interests could not be enough to do so.
This lesson remains valid.
We must build a Europe that is more economically integrated.
This will only be done by building a Europe of more politically democratic and genuine European democratic sovereignty.
Let us become Europeans to build a Europe.
"Contactless" chip card is spreading
In an optimistic atmosphere, the World Chips Card Fair will open on Tuesday in Villepinte, near Paris.
According to the Eurosmart cabinet, 2011 should end with an increase in world sales of microprocessor (bank cards, SIM card phones) by 11% to more than 6 billion units.
The most supporting feature is the contactless technology segment, which allows you to pay for mass transit or to handle purchases by simply approaching the card to the reader.
This year should be sold 460 million chip cards worldwide against the 320 million sold a year earlier!
Their share is expected to rise even further in 2012 (a expected 580 million units) and reach around 10% of the total chip card market (6.925 million cards).
Having long been in the grip of APEC countries, Europe is gaining ground in contactless payment.
Approximately 26 million Visa bank cards are already equipped with this feature and 75,000 payment terminals are receiving them.
In France, the beginnings are more modest: 400,000 Visa contactless contact cards have been issued.
But the big supermarket chains are working for two.
Carrefour issued 2.5 million contactless passenger MasterCard cards this year.
To line up the higher gear, banks need to equip their clients with them from now on.
"Two major French businesses have pledged to distribute their clients' wire-free bank cards systematically in the future," announces Gérard Nébouy, CEO of Visa Europe France.
Banks test paying by mobile
But this is only the first stage to the future's means of payment: a mobile phone.
The NFC (Near Field Communication) technology required to carry out transactions today is only a small number of devices.
"They delayed."
"But their real boom should take place next year."
"For 2012, we estimate their sale worldwide at 80 to 120 million units," explains Marc Bertin, president of Eurosmart.
But the banks are already preparing ahead.
Yesterday, Crédit agricole announced the launch of a test conducted in the city of Caen, which will run from December to June next year.
iPhone devices of approximately 200 clients and co-workers will be equipped with a case that allows contactless payments.
BPCE Bank has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
Also, Société générale announced yesterday that it is preparing to introduce an offer to allow its clients to pay with a mobile phone without a touch.
Terrorist front extends from the Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is concerned about the ties between Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
Long-term suspicions that there are alloys of the Al-Qaida terrorist group in the Islamic Maghreb (AQMI) and the Niger sect Boko Haram are being confirmed.
On Sunday, Algerian Deputy Foreign Minister Abdelkader Messahel even admitted that Algiers had now "safe" made sure of it."
"The way the two organizations operate and the intelligence reports show that there is a great deal of cooperation between them," he explained without elaborating.
Paris seems to have similar analyses.
Investigating the kidnapping of two French people in Niger in January 2010 could help illuminate the connecting bridges.
After being abducted by members of AQMI from a restaurant in Niamey, Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory were to be killed the following day at the same time as several of their hijackers in an operation conducted by special French troops.
In the rubble after the intervention, French and Nigerian investigators were to find several phones with chips belonging to the terrorists.
Terrorist axis
The analysis of the calls carried out leads to several people in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), the interrogators are particularly interested in two figures: one leads to a Nigerian who has been in a long time in Maiduguri, a city in the north of Nigeria, which is the cradle of Boko Haram, and the other to a man who is said to be close to AQI and the sect.
"This is progress, but it is no doubt necessary to wait for more convincing evidence before we start talking about the operational co-operation between AQMI and Boko Haram."
"But it's possible."
"We have seen for years that the sect enjoys external financial and intellectual support and that it is manifesting itself more and more actively," tempers the statements of Nigerian investigator Kunle Amuwo.
In recent months, this "support" has been more and more evident in Boko Haram's development and manifestations, or in its operational procedures, which from now on include human casualties or increasingly complex explosive devices of the same design as those used by the AQMI.
The international community, led by Washington, has since put pressure on Nigeria to take into account the challenges posed by Boko Haram.
In fact, the Nigerian authorities have long regarded the group as a community of enlightened mystics little worthy of interest.
Quick Success
The Boko Haram sect was founded in the r. 2002 in Maiduguri around the mosque, school and fundamentalist Mohammed Yusuf. Boko Haram, which in the language of haoussa means "Western education is a sin" approves the founding of the Islamic emirate in the Muslim north of Nigeria.
In this poor region, such a merger has been a quick success.
The sect is politicizing and requiring strict adherence to Islamic sharia law, while its followers begin the fight against the central government.
These people first target churches, bars and offices.
In the r. In 2009, Boko Haram's supporters are becoming extremely active and multiply their attacks against police stations.
Government response as usual is still the same.
The army will encircle the city and the result is 800 dead.
The sect's founder, Mohammed Yusuf, is caught and killed in prison.
From that moment on, the group is radicalizing and leaving its location in the north.
At Christmas 2010, the assassination in the city of Jos will be killed in the city of Jos, then another one in the capital, Abuja.
In June, it is again in Abuja, where Boko Haram will attack the police headquarters in their first suicide attack.
And in August, the UN Local Bureau will be the first international target.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa to run from Mauritania via Nigeria to Somalia is now worrying all security specialists.
Now that Al-Qaeda of the Islamic Maghreb has been surrounded by Mali and the ighers and Al-Shabaab militants are operating in Kenya, Boko Haram is emerging as a new danger to the continent.
In Nigeria last week, in an interview with President Goodluck Jonathan, Alain Juppé, said that France was on alert and ready to "take all the information" forward."
The world according to the presidential candidates
In questions about China, Iran, or aid to Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, and Rick Perry all are all in a race to simplify and unknowledge.
Can a crisis-weakened America manage the world with simple or even simplistic ideas?
Listening to the presidential candidates, voters might think that.
For days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and others have been repeating loud statements and brief foreign policy tutorials, which has traditionally been a strong point for Republicans.
Often unsubstantiated slogans about China, Iran, or the aid to Israel merge with each other.
Mitt Romney, the best-placing candidate in the race to nominate the Republican "Grand Old Party," threatened to be a Chinese calling before the World Trade Organization and their accusations for manipulating their currency," a theme in America sharpened by the migration of entire parts of its industry to Asia.
The worse if this must include the launch of a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, the former Obama ambassador to China and the only candidate with some sophisticated vision of foreign policy, was almost stuck in the attitude that "remoles" emotions.
He called for a tough but constructive dialogue with Beijing (President Obama's current stance).
But Huntsman, who is in the last seats on the electoral estimates, remains in-use.
The image of President Reagan
Romney also promised military strikes on Iran if sanctions fail to stop his nuclear program.
"If I am elected, I will imprison Iran," he said in a fanfarmonian.
"If Obama re-elected, they'll have a bomb."
He also promised to increase military assistance to Israel, accusing Obama of disappointing in his duties to this partner.
Businessman Herman Cain, the second best-placed candidate, shows an embarrassing ignorance of the documents.
He recently called for a sharp stance against China's military threat, because Beijing will try to develop nuclear capabilities" - evidently ignorant of the fact that China has owned an atomic weapon since 1964!
Texas Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants strikes against Iran, says he is ready to send the U.S. military to Mexico to fight drug cartels.
The use of torture against the presumed terrorists banned by Obama in the morning. 2009 is also recommended by Cain, Perry and another candidate, Michele Bachmann.
They're all far away from him in the morning. 2008 Republican nominee John McCain, heavyweight in foreign policy.
The current president's opponents say Reagan had simple ideas, too, and still won the Cold War.
They recall that Obama himself was an amateur and that he added water to his wine in the fight against terrorism.
They highlight the failure of his naive dialogue with Iran, the rash departure"boys" from Iraq, his excuses about Libya and thus give him the label of the weak
But the attack is not easy.
The population is judging President Obama's national security policy, which removed Ben Laden, rather positively.
He has no confidence in the military interventions from Iraq that lead to a bogus.
And with the argument that it is necessary to reconstruct America economically in order to resuscitate its leadership, Obama is knocking to a more correct spot.
Nord Stream, the new entry port of Russian gas to Europe
The Nord Stream long-distance pipeline connecting directly to Eastern Europe to Russia and conducted along the bottom of the Baltic Sea has started to work.
It must deliver gas equivalent to 30 million households.
Gazprom, the Russian gas giant, wanted to celebrate the event properly.
More than 500 guests, among them 4 heads of state and government, took part in the inauguration of Nord Stream last Tuesday, a new pipeline that will be joined directly by Russia and Germany under the sea.
Symbolically, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fillon and his Dutch colleague Mark Rutte turned together around the control valve to the control of Russian gas's control entry into the Western European network.
With this new pipeline, 27.5 billion additional cubic metres of Russian gas will begin to flow into Western Europe every year with the first pipeline of 1,224 km in length of 1,224 km connecting the St. Petersburg-Pomerany region.
The second pipe, which must be completed at the end of the r. 2012, will make it possible to supply a total of 55 billion cubic metres of gas, which is the amount that equals the entire French consumption.
And it is already recalled to be able to build a third pipeline pipeline on the same route.
For Gazprom, the timely completion of this huge structure has the character of a victory.
Poland and the Baltic countries strongly protested against the project.
In fact, Nord Stream will make it possible to supply gas directly to Germany without being run around the country by a third country by a third state (Poland or Ukraine).
At the same time, these two countries are losing some power: the possibility of pushing Russia with threats to close its access to Western European markets is becoming more difficult for them.
This was most strongly expressed by Warsaw when it did not hesitate to compare Nord Stream to the "new German-Soviet Pact," citing the alliance between Hitler and Stalin in the occupation of Poland in the r. 1939.
It means to say that this is a politically sensitive subject.
Western Europe's support for this Russian project has gained greater assurance of its purchases.
But it is at the cost of weakening Europe of energy, as the project has created cracks between Europeans from the east and the west.
Russia managed to establish its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the wealthy, high-deployment-based gas-intensive Western nations, the deposits of which are nearing their completion, with its deposits coming to an end.
"This pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, a new artery that organically connects us," confirmed François Fillon at the opening ceremony of this pipeline and demonstrated at what point the big gas contracts of affairs are both political and economic.
All of this is explained by the wide smiles of Gazprom's leaders present in large numbers in Lubmin, the gas supply point.
The construction of this pipeline is also an important technical act.
The undersea pipe is made of steel fitted with a concrete casing to protect it from the moorings of naval vessels.
It consists of a minimum of 200 m at the bottom of the sea.
In its construction, it was necessary to avoid the minefields from the Second World War.
"For security reasons, nearly a hundred had to be removed or destroyed," says Jens Müller, a spokesman for Nord Stream.
It was also necessary to increase the measures to protect the fauna and flora.
The pipeline itself is a long metal snake weighing like the 242 Eiffelels, which is not interrupted anywhere by the valves or maintenance stations on its entire length.
One control platform was to be built near Sweden, but the project leaders rejected it when the Swedes were little greedily seen by the Russian state-owned company as it permanently settled off their coasts.
"In the event of a defect, we stop the gas passage in less than 1 minute," Jens Müller says.
In the case of leaks, the gas contained in the pipeline escapes into the air.
But this case is considered unlikely by the builder, after all, the welds were designed to create a leak once every 100,000 years.
The state of the pipeline is checked from the outside by the ship-clad undersea robot, while the inside of the pipeline is controlled by a device circulating inside.
This canine-shaped device of 1 metre in diameter is inserted into the inside of the pipe and is being pushed by the gas.
At the finish line after the whole three days of the journey, it will provide accurate information about possible deformations of the metal parts.
The long-distance pipeline was designed to operate for fifty years without the need for the slightest repair.
Gas circulation is simply ensured by pressure.
The value of this pressure is the 200 bar at the start and the 100 bar at the finish.
To implement this project, five companies joined forces.
The leading position remains Gazprom, which holds a 51% stake.
It was joined by the German companies E.ON and BASF (15.5% each) as well as the Dutch company Gasunie and the French group GDF Suez (9% each).
The five companies set up a joint venture called Nord Stream in charge of building and running the pipeline.
The business is based in the city of Zoug, Switzerland, where taxation is extremely advantageous.
Gazprom subsequently leased the company with a five-year contract that could be renewed for all its gas transport capacity.
"Gazprom will have a profit from the total capacity, whatever the amount of realistically transported gas," specifies Jens Müller.
Funding for the construction of the pipeline was provided by 30% by the shareholder and 70% by bank loans.
The total cost of the work should reach €7.4 billion for both pipelines.
For the GDF Suez group, the investment costs rose to 240 million.
But minority shareholders are certain that their costs will be refunded, because only Gazprom takes the risk.
The pipeline rises from the Baltic Sea in Lubmin on the sandy coastline with pine forests.
The 4.5-metre valves form the output gateway of gas.
The sensors measure the pressure, temperature and other characteristics of the incoming gas before being transported to the German gas pipelines.
As of last Tuesday, this terminal receives one million cubic meters of Russian gas every hour.
At full capacity, it will be 3 million an hour and in the r. 2012 6 million.
Moleskine - a sign notebook
The Italian firm Moleskine, which was founded fifty years ago, wants to reiterate the joy of writing.
It brings the scent of adventure, hours spent writing by candlelight.
The Moleskine noteer is easily discernible to its black rectangular plates and its tarnished white-coloured leaves as if aged over time.
After all, the Moleskine notebook, as we know it today, was born back in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, based in Milan, decides at that time to launch a new design but distinguished notebook.
Maria Sebregondi, then a consultant working for the business, takes over the launch of the new product.
The notebook is inspired by the old "moleskin" (shareiming), which is used for cleaning the surface of the benches.
This type of notebook was greatly appreciated by the writer and travelers.
"Mogleskine returned to popularity an old and forgotten subject that was an icon of avant-garde artists until the 20th century," says Maria Sebregondi, who has since become a leading person at the brand at Modo Modo Modo.
Success is here.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales rose by 26% to settle in 12.7 million units last year.
The situation is remote undercover production from the first years, when only 3,000 notebooks were made.
Moleskine crosses Italian borders and exports to 70 countries from France to the United States.
It is difficult to assemble some artificial portrait of the buyer, as the notebook captures the businessman as well as the student or the professionals.
The image of the Moleskine notebook is that its owners are people cosmopolitan, cultured and open-led spirit.
The small Italian business, which had 12 employees in its early days, has nearly a hundred today and has had two offices since 2008, one of which is in Milan and the other in New York.
He sends his notebooks to the bookstore and, through the FNAC store chain, to small boutiques in the middle of cities, where he was able to assert his identity.
"We have pursued the spirit of the times and this need for new writing, through the turbulent development of e-mails," explains Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural signature accompanies the development of the Moleskine notebook: recently, the brand opened the exhibition" The "Scurtain" where architects or artists exhibit their notebook.
In August, on the occasion of the Locarno Film Festival, she also released new records of the leopard-like notebook.
Moleskine benefits from his success and this cultural aura and diversify his products: bags, diaries, pencils, notebook cases ... The brand extends to a variety of carriers.
Success that aroused envy: in the fall of 2006, Modo Modo Modo was bought by investment funds SG Capital, today Syntegra Capital, writing a new site in the history of Moleskine.
Why is the high proportion of unemployed handicapped workers?
Around 19% of handicapped people are looking for work.
Today it opens on 15. A week for employing the handicapped.
Through the voluntaristic public policy established in the morning. 2005 the percentage of unemployed people is twice as much as the average, i.e. 19% versus 9% for the entire population.
Is it disheartening?
"No, underlined by Éric Blanchet, the director general of the Adapt Association, which organizes the Week for the Employment of the Handicap.
"The advancements made in 15 years are remarkable."
"At the time, the percentage of unemployed people was not two, but three times higher."
"However, there is much left to do."
It should be said that for the unemployed handicapped people, numerous obstacles to take up work remain.
These are the elderly: 37% are over 50 years old (17% on average).
They have low qualifications: 80% of them don't have a high school diploma, and of the 2,3 million university students, only 10,000 are handicapped.
Finally - long-term unemployment is widespread: 53% for the handicapped versus 38% on average.
In short, there are criteria that particularly complicate the return to work and which represent the "core of the problem"," according to Christian Grapamin, the director-general of the Tremplin Association, which was founded in 1992, to help businesses recruit disabilities.
So much for objective brakes.
What remains is the unsolved, the ways of thinking that are surely evolving, but too slowly.
A study conducted in April by the IMS-Entreprendre pour la Cité association found that interviewed executives have a weak level of knowledge about handicapped people" with an exaggerated notion of persons in a mobile chair and mental or mental shortcomings."
As a result, private businesses with more than 20 employees are still a long way from reaching the target of employing 6% of the handicapped workers provided for in the 1987 Act.
The last known numbers that come from a r. 2008, they give a flat 2.6% straight.
"We are now around 3%," says Pierre Blanc, director-general of Agefiph, the organisation charged with collecting fees from businesses that do not comply with the law.
The evidence is in the number of "funded" enterprises, as well as the amounts paid, which fell from the 59,000 off-cera businesses between 2007 and 2011 to 46,000 (and from 606 to 480 million euro).
"The law of the r. In 2005, which increased the contributions, put in strong pressure on businesses, Pierre Blanc explains."
"But this improvement is also demonstrated by real awareness, especially in large businesses."
According to the Labor Ministry, only 59% of businesses with 20 to 49 employees employ handicapped workers, compared with 82% of businesses with 100 to 199 employees.
Gambling: "What a Happiness"
Before the French representatives (Bleus) were challenged on Tuesday evening (20h45), Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens did not hide the pleasure of this friendly match.
We don't go so far as to write that there was an association between them, but the picture is symbolic.
Sitting side by side in the stands of the Stade de France, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard reconciled.
Five months after his striker's angry gesture in the match against Turkey, the Belgian coach was uttering words of praise for his player.
"I am very satisfied with Eden and his progress, even with the fact that he loves his country."
"I want to move forward," assures the French Lille player.
As for the difference between his performances in club matches and national team matches," it is one and the same, justifying himself."
"I've been in Lille for a year, which is not the case with Belgium."
"I need to clear my mark."
Hazard, spared against Romania on Thursday night for this match against France, arrives at the stadium in Saint-Denis to finally "shallar."
It is impossible to forget the concept of "radishment".
Play against Bleus, which he cheered from the age of 7 and in their victorious campaigns in 1998 and 2000.
"I've always been a fan," he claims.
This necessarily contributes even more to the "special" nature of this meeting.
All the more so because "it is Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami) ", it recalls.
"We crucicedled at once."
"To play against them, that's just a pleasure!"
A good-hearted Leekens recalled a "pride."
"Prps" to fight"game - a holiday".
"Prinkish" also to state with the quality of the "neighbors" that France became a team of very high standards a little more than a year after the trauma in the southern African city of Knysna."
"Laurent Blanc has done a tremendous job," he heaved.
Although Belgium will miss the next European Championship, the technical footballer would like to see himself in the 2014 plane with the French in the direction of... Brazil.
"Our little Belgians will become great," he underlined.
"We're building something right now, the players are ambitious, they're healthy hunger."
"You'll realize that for the next games." Including the one against France.
Portugal very confident
Portugal's Paulo Bento is opening the draw with great optimism against Bosnia Bosnie (22h00) this Wednesday in Lisbon.
On the way there, both teams lacked realism.
"At the end of those 90 minutes, we will be a happy team and, above all, a happy country."
Paulo Bento is already seen in Poland and Ukraine.
There is no shadow of doubt for him. The Portuguese national football team, whose helm has been to the helm since 2010, will qualify for the Euro 2012.
Portugal is actually 90 minutes away from luck.
One match and one opponent - Bosnia - remain to play.
Conscious of Friday's result (0-0) in the hell of Zenica, it seems clear that nothing is won.
Portugal certainly had the upper hand for more than an hour, but they were unable to score such a rare goal that would have relieved him.
"It's a good result, which nevertheless contains a risk, because we didn't score outside."
But at home at their stunning Stade de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced that they will advance in front of the audience, which should create a boiling cauldron there, although the match certainly appears to be" very even," says the optimist but the shrewdly-thinking Bento.
"We expect a very even game, but we are quite convinced that we can have the upper hand," said the 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
"We still have a 50% chance to be at Euro 2012," the successor to Carlos Queiroz nevertheless relativized.
Friday's match in Bosnia is forcing the Portuguese to score a goal and win.
An indiscalious match may be enough for the Bosnians, who also need to score a goal.
"It's a good result, which nevertheless contains a risk because we didn't score a goal out there," regrets Bento.
"We will play against a team that has great technical qualities and which has players with great individual qualities," he added.
As in the Zenica, the Portuguese will be interested in putting maximum pressure on the Bosnian team right from the start to" give them no time to think."
A good idea, on the condition that this time it turns out to be realistic.
