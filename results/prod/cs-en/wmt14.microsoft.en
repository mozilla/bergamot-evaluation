Economia and Centrum connect management.
For example, they will offer joint advertising
Economia's new integrated newsroom in Karlín, Prague.
Economia has taken the next step towards transforming Centrum holding into its media house.
Since Friday, economia and the Centre have joint top management.
"The unification of the organizational structure and the personnel union are essential for the integration of both publishing houses into the common media house," comments Economie Vice-Chairman and Authorized Ceo Kamil Čermák.
Čermák, who will head the unified management, will be joined by Andreas Demuth, Managing Director of Centrum Holdings.
Pavel Vopařil was appointed as the new Joint Director of The Store, to whom Zuzana Tylčerová, advertising director of both companies, is also subordinate.
Štěpán Burda became the new head of information technology.
The joint director of the editorials is Vladimír Piskáček, whose team also includes the Director of Transformation Jakub Unger.
Adele Pitts was appointed the newly established position of Marketing Director.
The independent corporate communication department is now managed by Věra Lhotská.
The Joint Financial Director is Karel Žalud, the human resources management for both publishing houses is led by Petra Slab.
"The new organizational structure will, among other things, allow us to come to the market with a common offer of advertising products, better connect the content creation of all published titles and, last but not least, significantly streamline the business management of the company," added Čermák.
Economia, owned by financier Zdeněk Bakala, concluded a contract to buy Centrum Holdings and its Czech subsidiaries at the end of April this year.
Centrum Holdings' portfolio consists of Aktuálně.cz, Žena.cz, web portals, an extensive email base under the Centrum.cz and Atlas.cz and SMB brands, and a portfolio of nearly two dozen smaller websites.
Economia is the publisher of The Economic Newspaper, the news IHNED.cz, the weekly respekt and Ekonom and a number of printed and internet B2B titles.
Among Czech publishers, it has long been the most successful in selling digital versions of its major titles.
In June this year, the publishing house moved to newly built modern premises in Prague's Karlín.
CNN: Israel bombed a military base in Syria.
The target was supposed to be Russian missiles for Hezbollah.
Israeli warplanes reportedly bombed a military base near the Syrian port of Latakia on Thursday.
Citing an unnamed U.S. government official, CNN reported.
The Israeli press reported widely on the explosion at the alleged missile depot, but the Israeli government has not confirmed the attack.
When asked by CNN, an Israeli military spokeswoman declined to comment on the airstrike.
"We do not comment on foreign media reports," she said.
According to a US government source, the target of the Israeli airstrike was missiles and related equipment that Israelis believe could be transported to the militant Lebanese movement Hezbollah.
The AP, citing another U.S. security official, reported that Russian SA-125 missiles were the target of an Israeli airstrike on a target on Syrian territory.
A second Israeli TELEVISION channel reported that the target of the attack was allegedly a highly modern Syrian air defense system.
Satellite images of the attack area, however, showed a battery of Russian S-125 Java missiles, according to DPA.
In addition, they reportedly had batteries of SA-3 missiles, including a command center with radar to track the missiles and their targets.
The missiles, according to a report by Israeli television, have a range of 35 kilometers and could carry warheads weighing 70 kilograms.
Israel has reportedly bombed missile deliveries inside Syria at least twice this year, CNN and AP reported.
The Israeli military has never responded to such reports, but has repeatedly claimed to hit any supply of weapons intended for Hezbollah or other groups designated as terrorists.
Tony Blair said he would take the chance to return as Prime Minister, but admitted that a return was unlikely.
In a late-night interview on the fifth anniversary of his departure from office, the 59-year-old politician expressed his views on various areas of domestic policy.
Since resigning in June 2007 after 10 years in the leadership, Mr Blair has mostly avoided talks on British politics, limiting his comments to foreign affairs and his role as an envoy to the Bezek-Eastern Peace Quartet.
When asked if he would return as Prime Minister, his response was quoted by the London Evening Standard newspaper as saying: "Yes, sure, but that's hardly going to happen, is it?"
Police evacuate part of Los Angeles airport due to shooting
There was a shooting at Los Angeles International Airport this morning.
Police evacuated part of the airport, reportedly terminal three.
Reuters, citing California media, claims that law enforcement shot an armed man with a rifle.
The Los Angeles Times, citing police, reported that there was a shootout in which two to three transportation security officials were injured.
How many people were injured in total and whether there are any victims is still unclear.
Firefighters are talking about an event with more injuries.
Berdych and Stepanek will be joined by Rosol and Hájek
Czech tennis captain Jaroslav Navrátil nominated Tomáš Berdych, Radek Štěpánek, Lukáš Rosol, Jan Hájek for the Davis Cup final against Serbia.
Czech representatives defend the trophy, but they go to play on the opponent's field in the Belgrade Arena, where the match will take place on a hard surface from 15 to 17 November.
The Czechs are in the finals for the third time in five years.
"We know we're going to hot ground, it's going to be wild, and we need to focus on our performances as always."
"We will go there with one goal - to get three points and sell the best," said Stepanek, the architect of the winning point in last year's final with Spain.
Brno Observatory takes visitors into space in new digital
At first glance, it is clear that the hall of the great planetarium has changed in the last six months.
There is a new stage, visitors can sink into new comfortable seats, and above their heads a projection area with a diameter of 17 meters in the shape of a dome from the American company Spitz has been added.
In the middle of the hall is the most important part of it, a new projector from Japan.
To make the picture perfect, other smaller projectors are scattered around the hall.
Another important part of the whole facility is hidden behind the hall's windows.
"These are twenty-one computers that generate images," said Jiří Dušek, director of the Brno Observatory.
Computers ensure that the image from multiple projectors does not overlap, but gives a complete impression.
"The performance of computers is 30 to 40 times higher than that of conventional personal computers," said Tomáš Hladík, a technician from the observatory.
Digitalarium can teud an extremely realistic and plastic model of the night sky, human body or ocean floor.
The audience will thus find themselves right in the middle of the universe or the brain of a person.
Another similar facility is closest in Warsaw or Hamburg.
The observatory management plans to show purchased shows and their own work in the hall.
There are two shows on the agenda from Saturday.
The first one's called Astronaut, and it's for adults.
In it, people learn about astronaut training, fly into space, spin on centrifuge, and then see, in illustrative examples, the challenging conditions astronauts face in space.
The second show is for children and is called Magic Reef - Kaluoka'hina.
It tells the story of a reef whose colourful inhabitants lived a peaceful life until the moment a nearby volcano erupted.
The entire digitalrium cost about fifty million crowns, which was paid mainly by the Ministry of Education.
The City of Brno and the Observatory contributed smaller amounts from their budget.
The design area cost ten million crowns, the projector twelve million.
"The rest was swallowed up by audiovisual technology and computers," Dušek explained.
The installation of the digital gallery followed the reconstruction of the entire building, which the observatory underwent two years ago.
According to Director Dušek, between 25,000 and 30,000 visitors could come by the end of the year.
Supreme Court upsteays Obama's health care law
The U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the health care law signed by Barack Obama complies with the Constitution, a major victory for the Obama administration.
By a 5-to-4 vote, the court ruled that the individual regulation of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act -- which insteers citizens to buy health insurance by 2014 or risk paying a fine -- does not contradict the Constitution under government tax authority.
Chief Justice John Roberts sided with four more liberal members of the court, while Justices Scalia, Thomas, Alito, and Kennedy opposed it.
The court also upshot the remaining parts of the 2,700-page law, and also ruled that the legal requirement for health care, which directs states to expand the ability to obtain sickness insurance, otherwise threatens to lose all federal funding for sickness insurance, is not coercive and violates the Constitution.
26 states and the National Federation of Independent Enterprises filed lawsuits to block the law.
During the 2012 primary, the law was strongly opposed by every major Republican candidate, including presumptive nominee Mitt Romney.
Nadia Konvalinková in the role of a landlord.
Does he have a new job?
Actress Nadia Konvalinková (62) appeared behind the bar in the role of a pub landlord and was very good at it.
That a popular Czech actress would plan to change professions and go into business in a pub?
Nadia Konvalinková showed up at the James Joyce Irish pub and made beer there.
I did it for the first time in my life, and I was good at it.
My boss even offered to hire me so I could make a living spinning beer.
But I refused, I prefer to stick to what I do to this day, to acting," said Konvalinková, who was a guest on the twentieth anniversary of the Irish pub operation, with a smile.
"I like Irish beer, and I'll have Irish whiskey now and then," the actress revealed her tastes.
Nadi's long-time friend and colleague Pavel Nový also appeared at the event.
I'm dead, and I'm not allowed to drink in my new life.
I'm allowed one beer or one drink a day, and that's what I'm trying to do," the actor added.
Egypt puts first freely elected president in office
Muhammad Morsi has been sworn in as an inaugural, but his triumphant day will hardly end egypt's political unrest.
ISLAMIST Mohamed Morsi promised a "new Egypt" when he was inaugurated as the country's first freely elected president, after Hosni Mubark, who was deposed 16 months earlier.
In his inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Morsi also became the first freely elected Islamic president in the Arab world and egypt's fifth head of state since the overthrow of the monarchy some 60 years ago.
He was sworn in in front of 18 judges dressed in black goons in a mansion built overlooking the Nile, which resembles an ancient Egyptian temple.
"We are striving for a better tomorrow, a new Egypt and a second republic," Morsi said at a ceremony broadcast live on state television.
"The Egyptian people today laid the foundation for a new life – absolute freedom, true democracy, and stability," said Morsi, a 60-year-old U.S.-trained engineer and member of the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group that has been the target of scathing attacks by individual governments for most of the 84 years since its inception as an illegal organization.
Hundreds of soldiers and police officers guarded the building when Morsi arrived in a small motor car motorloute shortly after 11 a.m. local time.
Only a few hundred supporters gathered outside the courthouse to celebrate the president, and unlike the presidential pomp of Mubarak's term, traffic was only briefly halted so that the motorcade could pass through the usually busy road connecting the city center with the suburbs to the south.
The personal prestige of Morsi, derisively referred to as the Muslim Brotherhood's uncharistic "reserve tire," has soared since his victory and his speech on Friday, which aimed to present him not only as a candidate for Islamists, but also for all those who want to end the rebellion against the authoritarian Mubark.
"Egypt is now a civil, national, constitutional and modern state," Morsi, dressed in a blue formal suit with a red tie, told judges in the wood-paneled chamber where he was sworn in.
Morsi later traveled to Cairo University to deliver his inaugural address.
While he stood at attention, he received an official welcome from a military band that played the national anthem.
Military Commander Field Marshal Hussein Tantanya was present.
His arrival was accompanied by chants of "army and people are one hand" from the mouths of hundreds of people gathered in the university's main lecture hall.
The University of Cairo was founded in 1908 as a center of secular education and later became a bastion of Islamic student movements in the 1970s.
Morsi took a symbolic oath on Friday in Tahrir Square, the birth of the revolution that ended Mubarak's authoritarian rule last year, and solemnly vowed to reassert the presidential powers taken from his office by the military council that took them from the ousted leader.
But by agreeing to take an official oath in court, rather than before parliament, as is customary, he acquiesced to the will of the military, suggesting that the power struggle would continue.
Morsi's speech in Tahrir Square was full of dramatic populist gestures.
If you really want to get to know a town, you should go to the cemetery.
His visit reveals more than a walk through a nascan centre with monuments, churches and galleries, more than a bedekr would reveal.
Many people "read from the graves".
Slowly, cemeteries wander and gain intimate insight into the local reality.
They find out what kind of people live here, what nationalities they are, what faiths they belong to, how big and co-ent coexian families they belong to, what age they die here, how rich they are, how important their titles and professions were to them.
How they express their social status, what their tastes are.
And from the state of the graves, they will also find out how the bereaved take care of their dead.
Halloween 2013: By the numbers
When I was a kid, Halloween was magical.
My sister and I could eat candy, stay up late and show off to the neighbors in disguise.
Today I feel like I've become a scrooge.
For two years, candy hasn't appeared in my apartment, and this year is probably not going to be any different.
However, statistics show that I am a black sheep when it comes to Halloween.
According to the State Retail Federation (NRF), most Americans -- 158 million of them, in fact -- will celebrate Halloween this year, spending a total of $6.9 billion on sweets, costumes, and ornaments.
But what I always look forward to on Halloween are the trends.
According to the NRF, of the $6.9 billion spent, $1.2 billion is expected to go to costumes.
This year, the latest fad in fashion is sexy inanimate objects.
It's not just women who need to be sexy anymore; dishes such as pizza, hamburger and carrots can also be sexy.
As for the men, I expect to see a lot of zombies thanks to the parade of the dead, and I bet the space men of Daft Punk will make it to our Instagram feeds this year.
According to Google, zombies, Batman, pirates and witches are the most wanted costumes.
I suppose there's nothing wrong with following tradition.
Last year we dressed our dogs in costumes and to my amazement we weren't the only ones.
In fact, according to the NRF, Americans will spend $330 million this year on animal-pet costumes.
So there's going to be a lot of funny dogs.
When it comes to sweets, we don't waste time.
According to Nielsen, Americans spend $1.9 billion.
That's roughly 300 million kg of Hershey tables, lollipops, Milk Duds and Twizzlers sweets and Clark sticks.
This is amazing news for the 41 million trick-or-beers who, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce, are about to invade our neighborhoods.
In fact, during Halloween, we're going to buy, believe it or not, 45 million kg of chocolate.
The only thing we don't want is corn candies, and yet, according to the National Confectionery Association, nearly 16,000 tons of them will be sold around Halloween.
That's about 9 billion individual corn candies.
That's a secret I've never cracked.
Nothing is more typical for Halloween than haunted houses.
They have the best names, like "Terror behind the walls" and "The House of Shock."
In fact, there are 1,200 officially dedicated haunted houses in the United States that, according to American Haunted Houses, make a profit of $500 million, and that includes these amazing photos of you peeing in fear and your friend on Facebook, and you can't delete them, and the person you like looks at the photo and captions it as "you're a pretty face."
And finally, a little something about pumpkins.
Ever since we were kids, Charlie Brown introduced us to a big pumpkin (Great Pumpkin) and carving a pumpkin lantern is like decorating a Christmas tree – we've been doing it since we were kids.
Luckily for us, the "baby in a pumpkin" trend only started last year with the Pinterest app, so most of us grew up carving gourd instead of sitting in it.
This year, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, Americans will spend about $106 million on pumpkins.
The pumpkin lantern with a swirly flame on your front porch probably comes from Illinois, where 245,000 tons of pumpkins grew this year.
If you're looking for something special, call Tim and Susan Mathisdon from Napa, California, and try to cut up their pumpkin weighing almost a ton.
How insects from Thailand boosted paris bar sales
You may be grinning at insects without knowing that you eat them voluntarily, roughly half a kilogram a year.
For example, ground in flour.
If you consume it consciously, then you are clearly trendy: it is ecological, nutritious and you also have a unique experience taken care of.
Elie Daviron, chef and owner of Le Festin Nu bar, was the first to list insects on his restaurant's menu in Paris in early October.
The bar, inspired by William Burroughs' book Naked Lunch, is in the trendy 18th arrondissement near Montmartre, widely visited by tourists.
With fresh avocado, roasted red peppers, ginger and quail eggs, guests can now enjoy not only various larvae, locusts or water beetles, but also scorpion bites.
Carefully and specially packed vans (so as not to damage the wings of insects, distort their legs or damage the eyes) send Daviron all the way from Thailand.
Europe is just learning to eat insects, elsewhere it is common.
The owner of a Parisian bar with a pioneering menu gives several reasons to consume insects.
The first is the ecological benefit, because insect production is much less costly for our planet (in terms of finances, space and water consumption) than for traditional meat.
"In addition, insects are an excellent source of protein and omega 3 fatty acids," Daviron told Reuters.
At the same time, the young chef does not deny his profession, he simply aims to offer his customers a unique culinary experience.
According to him, the right restaurant makes pleasure, a sense of sin and an atmosphere of ambience.
"I'm not saveing the world, I'm just conveying a new experience," he explained.
Not everyone would be surprised by the idea of eating a pesto-decorated beetle, but the reactions of parisian bar customers to the insects served are very positive, according to the owner.
Even skeptics are said to eventually taste it, even if they start with the smallest bits and eventually choose a scorpion.
The prices of these tasting plates range from five to nine euros.
Are you washing your hands?
Scientists have discovered that washing your hands will change your mood.
The experiment was attended by 98 people, divided into three groups.
The first two were tasked with solving an insoluble task.
Of course, they both failed.
But the group that washed their hands after the setback seemed much more optimistic than the one where its participants did not wash their hands.
The "washed hands" group also performed better than the other in the next test.
Still, those who washed their hands achieved worse results in other tests than those who didn't.
The results of the "washed" were at the level of the third group, whose participants had not seen any previous failure.
According to psychologists, the results of the test indicate that body purity removes really negative feelings after failure.
At the same time, however, motivation decreases, the testers need to concentrate much more in the next exams.
If we transferred the results of the research to the Czechs, we would probably be the most optimistic after returning from the toilet.
After using the toilet, not only one percent of Czechs and Czechs wash their hands, but it is already a fifth on the way by public transport.
They usually stick to hygiene after working in the garden or in the workshop, when 85 percent of people wash their hands.
Caressing a pet motivates 78.7 percent of people to wash their hands.
A recent survey revealed that there is a difference in the perception of Czechs and Slovaks as to how much it is necessary to wash your hands after shaking hands with a stranger.
In this situation, 28.8 percent of Czechs and 40.3 percent of Slovaks wash their hands.
Research has shown that both nations wash their hands about ten times a day.
"Although it would be appropriate, I am afraid that the reality is different and people are trying to do a little better," commented claudia komárková, a skin doctor.
A drug smuggling tunnel was found between the U.S. and Mexico with its own railroad.
One of the most induceent drug smuggling tunnels between the US and Mexico has been discovered, complete with its own lighting, ventilation and electric railway.
U.S. authorities described the tunnel, measuring roughly one by one meter, as one of the most inconscesent secret tunnels they had ever discovered.
The tunnel, which zigzagged to nearly six football fields, connects a warehouse near Tijuana, Mexico, and San Diego, USA.
The area is full of indeterminate warehouses where trucks can be easily hidden before being loaded with drugs.
Authorities said the tunnel was closed before drugs could be transported undetected.
Along with the discovery of the tunnel, authorities also seized eight and a half tons of marijuana and about 150 kilograms of cocaine, according to court records.
Three men who authorities say worked as drivers have been charged with possession of marijuana and cocaine with the aim of distributing them.
If convicted, he faces prison sentences 10 years to life in prison.
In Nogales, Arizona, smugglers infiltrate vast drainage channels.
The tunnel is the eighth largest corridor discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the largest tunnels were discovered in October after a marijuana harvest in central Mexico, which is putting drug cartels in the tack for getting their product to consumers as quickly as possible.
In 2010, authorities found a corridor of about 650 meters (2,650 feet) equipped with tracks that led from the kitchen of a house in Tijuana to two warehouses in San Diego.
Is europe's elite ready for trade with Britain?
The Business for Britain campaign was launched in April with the promise of combining businesses and defining what changes british entrepreneurs and job-creating companies want to see in their relationship with the EU.
To this end, we commissioned the largest and most comprehensive survey, in which we asked leading British entrepreneurs about their views on Britain, trade and the EU.
YouGov interviewed 1,000 business leaders representing British businesses of all sizes and from different sectors and regions.
The results of the survey will come as a surprise to many.
We found that the vast majority of businesses are now trying to export outside Europe, focusing on countries that are modernising and growing while EU countries stagnate.
They want to see the government prioritize new trade ties with countries like China, India, and Brazil rather than get bogged down in the long and erring process of reforming europe's mysterious institutions.
When asked about their views on specific policy areas – from monopoly regulations to product laws – most entrepreneurs expressed the view that control of these key competences should be returned to Westminster.
There was widespread dissatisfaction with the single market, and entrepreneurs said that the cost of Brussels regulations now outweighed the benefits of being part of Europe's business – even 40 percent of large enterprises, traditionally the most pro-European, agreed.
Finally, our survey of business leaders revealed the most ediceous recognition, namely that a clear majority wants Britain to seek to change the treaty and relationship with the EU, which should be based on trade, not politics.
The findings, identified by businesses of different sizes and core business groups, show that the business sector is pushing for a "meaningful change" that will bring influence back to Britain.
The stakes are high – achieving treaty change and a better deal for Britain can mean 16% of the vote in a referendum to remain in the EU.
The Prime Minister should not hesitate: this survey shows that British trade supports his plan to amend the terms of Britain's EU membership.
It also shows that the business sector expects this amendment to mark a significant shift from the current balance of power back towards Britain.
A better deal for Britain is possible, and increasingly necessary as the eurozone embarks on a path to closer economic and fiscal union.
Jobs and growth in Britain must be a priority, and as the results of our survey show, for business this means a refocusing on trade and a fundamental change in Brussels' regulatory approach.

The UK government has announced a study aimed at increasing the benefits of the HS2 rail project for Scotland.
HS2's work suggests that high-speed services for Scotland and northern England will begin when the first phase is launched in 2026.
Transport Minister Baroness Kramer said the project would "bring the UK together."
Scottish Transport Secretary Keith Brown said he was "thrilled" to be working with the UK government on the plan.
The first phase will consist of a new high-speed train line between London and the West Midlands.
After Phase Two is completed, the line will run from Manchester to Leeds.
In June, the government revised the estimated cost of building a high-speed line between London and northern England from GBP 32.7 billion to GBP 42.6 billion.
The UK government, which has held talks with transport scotland's national transport authority, has commissioned HS2 to look at additional rail capacity and the possibility of improving travel times for northern England and Scotland.
This includes the possibility of possible travel times from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London corresponding to three hours or less.
Baroness Kramer said: "Our goal for HS2 is really a national network that better connects the UK and its cities."
We gave SH2 the green light because the benefit it will bring is enormous.
Without this, we are facing a crisis in the capacity of our rail network.
But it is also about connectivity – 18 cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, will be better connected across the UK thanks to HS2.
Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael added: "Today's announcement is good news for Scotland."
On the Scottish Government, Keith Brown called on Mr Carmichael to "unequivocally" support Scottish integration into the HS2 network.
Mr Brown said: "The high-speed line has the potential to deliver immeasurable economic benefits to Scotland, but it also adds economic weight to Scotland's overall high-speed rail case across the UK."
So we are working with the UK Government to explore the possibilities of bringing high-speed rail to Scotland to bring benefits to everyone and to complement the Glasgow-Edinburgh line, which the Scottish Government plans to do anyway.
I look forward to reviewing the report on this study with British ministers over the next year and to making joint decisions on the next steps.
Frontier Airlines is going to charge for hand luggage
Frontier Airlines plans to charge up to $100 for carrying hand luggage on board on its flights.
Frontier Airlines plans to introduce a charge of up to $100 for hand luggage and $2 for coffee or soda, although in its announcement On Wednesday they said passengers would be able to keep the entire can.
The new hand luggage charge applies to luggage in the upper storage compartment, so small luggage under the seat will continue to be free.
Frontier says it will charge $25 if the fee is paid in advance and $100 if passengers wait until they arrive at the gate.
Frontier spokeswoman Kate O'Malley said the $100 fee is intended to encourage passengers to take care of payment in advance.
"We don't want to collect this fee," she said.
Airlines started charging for the first and second bags in 2008.
Passengers tried to avoid these charges and stuffed as much space as they could into hand luggage in the storage compartment, so there was often no space in that space.
Fees are one way to teach passengers to take fewer things on board.
O'Malley said the purpose of this new fee really isn't to raise more money.
The point is that Frontier's most loyal customers have made it very clear that finding a place in the upper storage space is becoming increasingly difficult.
Passengers who purchase tickets on the company's website will not pay.
This means that one passenger queuing at frontier gate can bring luggage for which they pay nothing, while the other passenger in the queue pays $100 for the same luggage.
O'Malley said the check-in website and procedures will be adjusted to ensure passengers learn about the charge before arriving at the gate.
Frontier's new hand luggage fee will not be in effect until the summer, but no date has yet been set.
Passengers often complain about baggage fees and other charges, but airlines love them.
They argue that baggage handling costs money, and passengers who request the service should pay for it.
Many on Wall Street see the additional baggage charge as a sign that airlines are trying to raise enough money to cover the cost of air travel after years of losses.
However, most did not touch the hand luggage charges.
Spirit Airlines was the first to charge for hand luggage three years ago, and another low-cost airline, Allegiant Air, later followed suit.
The only company that also has such fees is Hungary's Wizz Air, says aviation consultant Jay Sorensen, who closely monitors additional charges.
In his December 2011 report, he estimated that Spirit's hand luggage fee would bring in $50 million a year.
Sorensen, a former Midwest Airlines executive, recently flew with Spirit and wondered what he saw at the gate when passengers encountered Spirit's unusual hand luggage fee.
"Getting on a plane was the smoothest thing I've ever seen in my aviation career," he said.
I expected to see teeth grinding and fighting at the gate.
The plane was full, he said, "and boarding took place in no time."
Frontier will also apply fees for coffee, tea, soda and juice, following Spirit's example.
Frontier said passengers who receive lemonade or juice can keep the entire can and the coffee will be refilled free of charge.
Water will continue to be served free of charge.
US Airways briefly tried to introduce beverage charges in 2008, but backed away seven months later after complaints from passengers, and no other major airline imitated it.
Frontier's latest move to charge for hand luggage if passengers do not purchase a flight directly from the airline is its latest effort to direct customers directly to its website.
Airlines pay online travel agents like Orbitz from $10 to $25 for each ticket sold.
This has given all airlines an incentive to lead passengers to make purchases directly from them, instead of doing so through online travel agencies.
However, Frontier has gone the furthest in this area.
In September, it began giving customers who purchased through an online travel agency only half the miles as part of a loyalty program.
On Wednesday, she cut the reward for miles flown to 25 percent of the miles from the trip.
So a 1,000-mile journey with Frontier purchased through an internet travel agency means a reward of 250 miles.
The company also allows customers to choose their seat in advance only if they make a purchase directly through frontier's website.
Frontier has a loyal customer base in its hometown of Denver, but its business is starting to shrink and losing money.
Revenue fell 9 percent and transportation capacity shrank nearly 13 percent in the first quarter, according to financial results released Wednesday by business partner Republic Airways Holdings.
Republic is also trying to solve Frontier's financial problems by selling this airline.
We've reviewed 11,000 ADS!
We know where they want you to work!
In November last year, an analysis picked up over 11,000 job advertisements, 4,300 of which were published in the daily press and 6,800 ads (62 percent) online.
The Internet is therefore becoming the most important medium for publishing job offers.
As of 2005, when the survey was first conducted, its share was 26 percent.
In the last two surveys (2007, 2010), it stabilised at around 60 percent.
According to the analysis, the advertising of job opportunities largely reflects the current situation on the labour market.
An example is simply comparing the number of advertisements published during periods of economic prosperity and in times of economic crisis.
For example, in 2007, almost 25 900 advertisements were published in the same reference period, less than half in 2012.
The offer of jobs on the Internet is oriented towards a narrower, especially more qualified group of professions.
On the other hand, the offer of employment in the daily press covers a wider range of professions, including blue-collar ones, said pavlína Šťastnová, the author of the analysis.
The level of representation of selected professional groups varies between media.
Advertisements seeking managers and executives, sales representatives, programmers and financial experts have taken the top positions on the Internet.
The position of programmers or small business leaders was only on the Internet.
In the daily press, the share of these professional professions is significantly lower, on the contrary, a large representation belongs mainly to service and working-class professions.
Of course, education is one of the most frequently mentioned requirements expressed by employers through advertising.
Other areas of reference included knowledge of foreign languages, especially English.
In the daily press, the requirement to know a foreign language was reported in three percent of advertisements, and on the Internet in 37 percent.
Only 2% of advertisements required employers to have an active knowledge of two foreign languages.
Claims for 'computer literacy' appeared in 40 percent of advertisements (11 percent in the daily press, 57 percent online).
Experience in the field was required in 54 percent of advertisements.
Requirements for practice are generally associated with qualified professions.
These are mainly production managers and other executives.
For blue-collar professions, these are mainly mechanics and repairers or manufacturers and processors of food products or repairers of electrical appliances, added the study's author Jiří Tillner.
Employers also include requirements for the characteristics and skills of potential applicants in half of their advertisements.
Communication skills have long appeared in advertising in the most frequently requested skills.
Furthermore, employers demand flexibility, adaptability and dynamism, autonomy, responsibility, organisational skills and reliability.
A fifth of shopping centres face low traffic
This is based on data from real estate consultancy cushman &wakefield and jones lang lasalle.
The Krakow Shopping Centre opens to the public in Prague's Bohnice, and will be the 19th Prague shopping centre.
There are now a total of 90 large shopping centres in the Czech Republic.
Unsatisfactory performance affects about 20 percent of medium and large centers.
The main problems are the inadequately large center towards the location and poor layouts, i.e. too many floors or complicated and unmissable arrangement of passages, or dead places of centers," said Michal Soták from Cushman & Wakefield.
Also, about a fifth of retail centers are experiencing low traffic, according to Jones Lang LaSalle Head of Retail Real Estate Sylvia Samadi.
The main reasons include, among other things, poor transport accessibility, low income category of local residents or oversues of the market in a given place.
Some projects opened almost fully occupied, but their results were mainly unsatisfactory at first.
Nowadays, customers are somewhat conservative and do not like to change their shopping habits.
New shopping centres need to do more to 'attract' their customers to new brands in the market, entertainment, services and marketing events," Samadi added.
According to Soták, the occupancy of shopping centers is generally stable, even rising in some centers, because landlords were willing to cut rents and rent some units in a crisis.
"It is true, however, that some projects have recently opened that are not fully occupied and thus reduce the average occupancy (for example, Breda & Weinstein in Opava, Šantovka in Olomouc)," added Soták.
Shopping centres opened in the past two years are very slow to make their way into the market, according to Sylvia Samadi.
But there is a place on the market for new projects.
The number of places suitable for the construction of a successful project is very limited.
In Prague, for example, we see space for the construction of a project that would serve the inhabitants of Prague 6.
There is certainly room on the market for the construction of smaller local projects, so-called 'convinience centres', aimed at shopping and services of daily necessity for the population living in the immediate vicinity," samadi said.
Also according to Soták, there is room on the domestic market for other shopping malls.
Both for small 'service' centres and for large projects in Prague, or medium-sized projects, or extensions in regional cities.
"Cities like Kladno, České Budějovice, Brno or Pilsen have room for further growth," added Soták.
In Prague, they see space for the upcoming shopping center on Victory Square, and according to him they have the clear potential of Na Příkopě street and Wenceslas Square.
"The expansion of retail parks is intensively developing, allowing traders to cover and expand into ever smaller cities at favorable rents and operating costs, space is also still in some locations for smaller local or residential shopping centers, or their reconstruction, such as the reconstruction of Prior department stores, which benefit from a good location," added Dita Kubánková from DTZ.
There are currently 90 modern shopping centres in the Czech Republic with a total of more than 2.2 million square meters of gross rentable area.
A quarter of all these shopping centers are located in Prague.
Among the 20 largest shopping centres, according to the number of tenants, nine are in Prague, according to data from Incoma GfK.
In the number of shopping parks, the Czech Republic is below the EU average, compared to the values from Britain and France, the Czech Republic lags by about 50 square meters per thousand inhabitants.
Parents of Georgia underage boy who died in freak accident believe he was murdered
The parents of a Georgia teenager whose body was found inside a tangled wrestling ghost in his high school gymnasium believe their son was murdered, the family's lawyer said Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson, of Valdosta, Georgia, was found on January 11, 2011, in a straightened, ghostly behind the bleachers at the high school gymnasium where he attended.
Lowndes County sheriff's investigators concluded that Johnson died by accident, but the 17-year-old's family refuses.
"They clearly believe that their son was murdered," benjamin crump, FoxNews.com attorney representing Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, told the Court.
They never believed he died the way the sheriff said he did.
"They believe it goes against logic, the laws of physics, and common sense," Crump said.
They think it's a cover-up to cover up what really happened to protect the person responsible for their son's death.
"As usual, they sent their son to school, and he came back in a body bag," he said.
U.S. Attorney Michael Moore said Thursday that he is conducting a routine investigation into Johnson's death, noting that several key questions remain unanswered.
What was the cause of death?
Was his death the result of a crime?
Moore said at a news conference Thursday afternoon.
I'll keep an eye on the facts wherever they lead me.
My goal is to find out the truth.
"I am of the opinion that there is sufficient basis for a routine investigation," he said.
Moore told reporters that the original autopsy indicated that Johnson died as a result of "positional asphyxiation."
The second autopsy, however, stated a different cause of death, according to Moore.
"There are several question marks that need to be answered or confirmed," he said.
Moore added that if he uncovers enough evidence in johnson's death to warrant a criminal investigation or civil rights violation, he will ask the FBI to implement it.
A Lowndes County Sheriff's Office deputy was not immediately available for comment Thursday.
A South Georgia judge on Wednesday ordered authorities to make available all surveillance video that investigators have reviewed.
The teen's parents hope the videos will contain clues leading to the discovery of how their son died.
Report: Obama campaign considered replacing Biden with Hillary Clinton
According to the New York Times, President Barack Obama's closest adviser was secretly considering replacing Vice President Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton on the 2012 nominee.
The revelation is the most significant sensation in Mark Halperin and John Heilemann's eagerly awaited 2012 campaign book, "Double down: Game Change 2012."
The Times obtained a copy of the incoming book and reported Thursday night that the president's top aces held intense group meetings and polls in late 2011 to assess whether getting rid of Biden would help revive Obama's fading re-election hopes.
According to The Times' national political correspondent, Jonathan Martin, the book offers a thorough record of the efforts of campaign and White House officials, namely former White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley, to measure the effect former Secretary of State Clinton's move to the vice presidency would have on the election.
The potential change was a closely guarded secret within Chicago's campaign infrastructure and inside the Oval Office.
Only a few of the president's closest advisers -- including Daley, former Obama campaign chairman Jim Messina, and former senior White House advisers David Axelrod and David Plouffe -- knew that a change was being considered.
"Double down" claims that Daley was a representative of efforts to replace Biden, despite their close personal relationship, until they finally decided not to make the move, when data showed that adding Clinton to the nominee "would not significantly increase Obama's chances."
In an interview with Martin Daley, he confirmed that the administration was indeed considering replacing Biden with Clinton.
"I've been researching a lot of things, and this was one of them," Daley told the paper.
You mustn't forget that the president had terrible prospects at the time, so we thought, "Christ, what are we supposed to do?"
While Daley characterized the research as "due diligence," Martin told CNN's Anderson Cooper that the re-election campaign had made considerable investments to see if the move would pay off in the election.
"Campaigns don't spend that kind of money on elections and qualitative research unless something is really seriously considered," Martin said on AC360.
But it is unclear whether Obama knew his team was considering the exchange.
Martin told CNN that he asked Daley if his boss at the time knew about this potential card shuffle.
While Daley said he didn't think the president was "aware" of the potential change, the former office manager acknowledged that it was "possible" that Obama knew about it.
Martin added that "Double down" does not definitively answer the question of whether the political probe reached Obama's desk.
Cooper asked Martin if he really thought Obama was unaware of the research on cutting Biden from the race.
"Maybe," Martin replied.
No, Mr. Hasek.
We have a unique opportunity to tell politicians that we are not.
There is such pressure to put pressure on Martin Hašek to be relieved of all political functions and to leave his seat.
Any other solution will reduce the level of political culture that is already low.
Martin Hašek is backing himself with the promise he made, but everyone and politician in particular must be aware of the consequences of that promise and think very carefully about what can be promised.
Trust is the only capital a politician has (Mr Babiš also has a material one, but the question is whether he is a politician).
The best program promoted by a liar is untrustworthy.
He doesn't apologize in politics, he resigns in politics.
Mr Hasek, if you mean well with this country (and your frequent statements confirm me in this, unless you have been lying - here you can see how difficult it is to lie), you will leave politics alone, like a man.
People will then accept your apology as an expression of the man who made the mistake and is responsible for it.
Otherwise, you will be perceived as a spineless wiyman whose words and actions cannot be trusted.
You either want to be a proud, if flawed, person or a lifetime of schmoust.
It may seem unfair to you that I only address you, but you are the leader and they are just misguided sheep.
And you're a leader, and you've always wanted to be.
I understand you're trying to lower your ears for a moment, rearrange your strength, sit out the shame, and then attack again, but that's how partisans or backstabbers behave.
You are, I repeat, a leader in your eyes, an alpha male, so act like one.
Take responsibility and leave politics.
The black box in your car?
While American road planners struggle to find money to repair the crumbling highway network, many are beginning to see a solution in a small black box that easily fits in your car's dashboard.
Devices that track every kilometre a motorist travels and transmit this information to authorities are at the heart of a controversial effort by Washington and state planning authorities to renovate america's outdated major road funding system.
The usually tricky design of motorways suddenly sparked intense debate and the emergence of various associations.
Libertarians met with environmental groups and lobbied for the government to use these small boxes to record mileage and possibly where you're going -- and then use that information to compile a tax bill.
The tea party is horrified.
The American Civil Liberties Union is also deeply concerned and has raised a number of privacy issues.
And while Congress cannot agree on whether to proceed, some states are not waiting for anything.
They are looking at how they can move over the next decade to a system in which the driver pays per kilometre of the road he is driving on.
Thousands of motorists have already taken the black boxes, some of which have GPS tracking, for testing.
This is a real necessity for our nation.
"This is not a matter of choosing too much," said Hasan Ikhrata, executive director of the Southern California State Administration Association, which plans to start tracking mileage for every California motorist in 2025.
The way we pay these taxes will change.
This technology is used for this purpose.
The impetus is that the Road Trust Fund, funded by the taxes Americans pay at gas stations, is at rock bottom.
Americans don't buy as much gas as they used to.
Cars travel a lot more miles per gallon.
The federal tax alone, 18.4 cents a gallon, has not increased in the past 20 years.
Because of the current high price of gasoline, politicians are reluctant to raise the tax by even one cent.
"The gasoline tax is just not sustainable," said Lee Munnich, a transportation policy expert at the University of Minnesota.
His state recently placed a tracking device in 500 cars to test this mileage payment system.
"In the long run, this seems like the most logical alternative," he said.
Experts call it a user fee based on the number of kilometers driven.
Unsurprisingly, urban liberals like the idea, because taxes can be used to change driver behaviour patterns, which, for example, can help reduce traffic jams and greenhouse gas emissions.
California planners look to the system to plan strategies to meet the goals set out in ambitious global warming laws.
But Republican Bill Shuster (Pennsylvania Representative), chairman of the Transportation Committee, said he also sees it as the most effective long-term alternative.
Free market leaders from the Reason Foundation are also in favor of the idea of drivers paying for mileage.
"It's not a tax that disappears into a black hole," said Adrian Moore, vice president of strategy at Reason.
People pay directly for what they get.
The initiative is also supported by two former U.S. transportation ministers, who in 2011 urged Congress to move toward paying per kilometre.
Last year, the US Senate approved a $90 million pilot project that would include about 10,000 cars.
But the house leadership rejected the bill, doing so because of concerns from rural legislators representing constituents whose daily lives often mean traveling many miles to work outside the city.
Nevertheless, several states and cities are moving forward on their own.
The most ardent is Oregon, which included 5,000 drivers in the largest experiment in the country.
These drivers will soon start paying the state a mileage tax instead of a gasoline tax.
Nevada has already completed the pilot project.
New York is currently exploring the project.
Illinois is trying to do so to a limited extent for trucks.
And the I-95 coalition, which includes 17 state transportation ministries, along with coastal states in the East (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Florida), is studying how they can implement the change.
However, this concept is not only proponents.
In Nevada, where about 50 volunteer cars were recently equipped with the device, drivers were concerned that the government was able to track their every move.
"Concerns about Big Brother surveillance and things like that have been a big problem," said Alauddin Khan, who heads strategy and operations management at the Nevada Department of Transportation.
It wasn't something people wanted.
As the trial project continued, the American Civil Liberties Union of Nevada warned on its website, "It would be very easy to turn these devices into full-fledged surveillance devices."
There is no need to build a huge cumbersome technological infrastructure, which will inevitably extend to the record of daily departures and arrivals of individuals.
Nevada is among the few states trying to find affordable technology that would allow the state to track how many kilometers a car travels, but not exactly when and where.
If you can do that, Khan said, the public will be calmer.
The hunt for such technology has led some state agencies to a small company in California called True Mileage (the real distance traveled).
The company was not originally involved in the action to help the government tax drivers.
She wanted to break through in the emerging legal liability insurance market, where drivers would pay based on how much they traveled.
But this device that it tests attracts the attention of road network designers because it does not use GPS and supplies only a limited amount of information that is regularly recorded using a modem.
"People will be more willing to do this if you don't track their speed and location," says Ryan Morrison, ceo of True Mileage.
A number of major errors have appeared in some of these pilot programmes.
There are much cheaper and less intrusive ways to do this.
In Oregon, designers experiment with giving drivers a choice.
They can choose devices with or without GPS.
Or they don't have to take any equipment and instead decide to pay a flat fee based on the average mileage of all the inhabitants of the state.
Elsewhere, they hope that the cautious public will accept the concept if the device can do more, not less.
In New York City, transportation officials are trying to develop a tax facility that would be equipped to pay extra for parking hours, provide mileage insurance, and collect speed data for other drivers so motorists can avoid traffic jams.
"Motorists will be willing to get involved because of the value of the benefits offered to them," the city's design document states.
However, some transport planners would like to know whether all discussions about paying per kilometre are just a huge proxy problem.
Officials from the San Francisco Bay Area Metropolitan Transportation Committee say Congress could very easily solve the problem with the bankrupt Highway Trust Fund by raising the gasoline tax.
A one-off or annual tax could be imposed on drivers of hybrid or other cars that do not consume much fuel, so they will pay their fair share.
"There's no need for any radical surgery when you just need to take aspirin," said Randy Rentschler, director of the Committee on Legislation and Public Affairs.
If we do that, hundreds of millions of drivers will be concerned about their privacy and a lot of other things.
Which billionaire are you going to be on the phone with next year?
Kellner, owner of ppf group, wants to buy the operator O2.
Both companies have confirmed the negotiations, and according to various sources from agencies and behind the scenes, there is already a hand up their sleeve.
The announcement of the transaction should come as early as November, probably before the start of the frequency auction for LTE networks, i.e. before 11 November.
Kellner's competitor Karel Komárek owns the KKCG Group.
Under the brand name Sazka Telecommunications, it went to auction frequencies for LTE networks.
To everyone's surprise, until then, the company's appetite for telecommunications had not been talked about.
But Sazka is now led by a very experienced telecommunications player Robert Chvátal.
He started as marketing director of Radiomobil (now T-Mobile), later became director of T-Mobil in Slovakia and most recently was head of the Austrian branch of the same operator.
Sazka plays several cards at once.
She's put herself up for auction, and now she's admitted that she wants to run a virtuoso at Vodafone.
And it makes sense.
If it succeeds in the auction, it will be able to move existing customers from its own virtual operator to its network.
Normally Vodafone would not like this, but according to the Information of the Economic Newspaper, this may be part of a much closer cooperation between the two companies.
Vodafone is currently suffering from an agreement between rival operators O2 and T-Mobile, who will completely share their networks.
Vodafone needs a partner.
And that could be Sazka.
If it succeeds in the tender for LTE networks (as a novice it can auction a specially designed spectrum), Vodafone does not have to go to the auction at all, or it will not mind auctioning only a limited spectrum (there are not enough frequencies for everyone).
Vodafone can share the networks with Yazkou.
Vodafone will launch Sazka into its 2G/3G network (or the newly built LTE network at 900 MHz), allowing the company to start the network quickly.
In the mean future, Sazka will start building an expensive LTE network, which vodafone will also be able to use.
Both companies can be satisfied.
Vodafone could then spend the money saved on a fixed internet or cable provider.
And Kellner?
By buying the Czech and Slovak O2 (the Slovak branch is the daughter of the Czech one), he would immediately acquire a full-fledged operator with still decent profits and a wide range of services.
But on the other hand, it's a big moth that's going to be restructuring.
In the auction, Kellner would acquire LTE networks for O2 and very likely in cooperation with T-Mobile.
Both companies have already declared that they will share the networks.
The auction could finally end in success, but probably not with the large sums that the state budget is looking forward to.
And from next year, customers in the Czech Republic could choose between calling with Vodafone, T-Mobile, Kellner or Komárek.
Or two titans of Czech business against global giants.
Greenpeace activists detained in Russia transported to St. Petersburg
Environmental activists detained in Russia since September to protest against planned oil production in the Arctic have been transported from Murmansk to St. Petersburg.
AFP reported this today, citing the international environmental organization Greenpeace.
At the same time, it claims that the original accusations of piracy by its activists have not yet been dropped.
"Greenpeace International has learned from diplomatic sources that 30 men and women detained in Russia following a non-violent action against an oil rig in the Arctic have been transported from a correctional facility in Murmansk to a prison in St. Petersburg," the organization said in a statement.
The reasons for relocating the detained activists are unclear; according to DPA, this was a planned transfer.
Authorities initially charged the ecologists with piracy, for which they were facing up to 15 years in prison if convicted.
Last week, however, they announced that they would replace the charge with a more lenient disorderly conduct, which could face a reduced sentence of up to seven years in prison.
But Greenpeace pointed out in a statement today that the charges of piracy have not yet been dropped by the authorities as promised.
They say that means the detainees are now charged with two felonies.
The powerful Committee of Inquiry announced last week that it would replace the piracy charges with charges of disorderly conduct.
But when the 30 inmates 100 100-year-olds 100 years ago this week, the piracy charge was not dropped.
Instead, new charges were brought against everyone," AFP quoted Greenpeace as saying.
The Russians detained three dozen Greenpeace members from 18 countries near Gazprom's oil platform in mid-September.
The ecologists were on the Dutch flag arctic sunrise.
Since then, they have all been held in custody, against which they have appealed, but have been rejected by the court.
Environmentalists complain about the conditions of imprisonment.
According to AFP, Greenpeace Executive Director Kumi Naidoo said today that moving to St. Petersburg would make it easier for the detained to meet with families and consular staff.
However, there are no guarantees that the conditions in the new prison will be better than in Murmansk.
"In fact, they can be worse," he said.
One of the detained activists, Faiza Oulahsen, asked King Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands for help.
In a handwritten letter published today by Algemeen Dagblad, she called on the monarch to speak about their situation during a planned meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Cocaine-addicted lawyer who warned mobsters about police investigation is in jail
Basharat Ditta (42) was to pass on information to the king of the underworld, Neil Scarbrough.
The lawyer was afraid his drug addiction would come out.
Liverpool Crown Court sentenced him to three years in prison.
A top defense attorney who informed a drug lord of a major police investigation because he feared his drug addiction would come to light has been sentenced to three years in prison.
Basharat Ditta (42) was supposed to pass on sensitive information about the investigation into his drug smuggling activities to underworld boss Neil Scarbrough after he became suspected of cocaine use.
The barrister, whose nickname was "Bash" (party) and who was hailed by criminals as the best attorney, was arrested at his home in 2011 after police surveillance of Scarborough, whom he had represented in previous narcotics cases.
Officers spotted Sarborough (32) leaving three bags of cocaine at his lawyer's home in Blackburn, Lancashire, who had just had dinner with his colleagues at the Law Society.
Based on tests that found traces of cocaine in his hair, his wallet and his credit cards, the investigation showed that Ditta was a regular user of Class A drugs.
Over an eight-month period, from January to August 2011, he sought information about the arrest of two men on behalf of Scarborough and his associate.
All four suspects were being monitored at the time as part of a major investigation into heroin and cocaine trafficking in lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
After police seized heroin and cocaine worth around £1.5 million, along with £200,000 in cash, during a series of raids, another 32 people ended up in prison along with them.
Ditta (42) passed on information to criminals for fear of becoming addicted to cocaine.
Today, Ditta, who works for Blackburn-based law firm Forbes Solicitors, had a shameful moment at Liverpool Crown Court when he was found guilty of obstruction of justice on two counts after a three-week trial.
He pleaded guilty to possession of cocaine during an earlier hearing.
The lawyer's fall came after a police investigation into Scarborough found that he had been in regular phone contact with Ditta in February 2011.
Two detectives followed the suspect, recorded his arrival at Ditt's house and saw him place drugs 60 percent clean under the lawyer's basket in a black golf glove.
Scarborough was then in a regular telephone conversation with Ditta, who was having dinner at Blackburn Rovers Football Stadium in Ewood Park.
The lawyer returned home where he found the drugs, and there were nine conversations between the two.
The court heard that traces of the Class A drug were found in his hair, wallet and credit cards, and that Ditta was a "regular user" of cocaine.
Ditta was later arrested but denied using cocaine, saying he spoke to the suspected dealer because he was his client, arguing that their conversation was part of "confidential communication."
During his arrest, Ditta took his wallet and tried to remove several credit cards from it, but they were all seized and his hair samples were taken.
Under police questioning, he said that he ran an office at both his home address and his workplace, and that clients visited him at home for work matters.
However, the court heard that after key arrests, he contacted prominent players in the drug supply chain, some of whom he had previously represented, to tell them what detectives knew about them.
Prosecutor Anne Whyte said: "Who else is more aware that they must not be infringing the law than a criminal lawyer."
Mr. Ditta is accused of abusing his position as a solicitor and of being in too close contact with a particular client.
The relationship we're talking about here is not just about a drug dealer, it's about a drug dealer supplying his own lawyer with drugs.
Some of his conversations were undoubtedly legitimate because he was his lawyer.
But it went far beyond the normal lawyer-client relationship.
He obstructed the police investigation as much as he could to allow them to continue their criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta did not bring good reputation to his profession, but dishonored it.
He became too close to some of his clients, especially Scarborough, and allowed his independence to be undermined.
Ditta denied the offence, saying: "If I were a corrupt lawyer who I am not and I wanted to pass on information to Mr Scarborough, I would not wait 15 hours, but I would do it immediately."
But after the hearing, Lancashire Police Inspector Lee Halstead said: "Mr Ditta went from being a criminal solicitor himself when he started obtaining drugs from organised criminals."
His cocaine addiction made him hopelessly weakened and vulnerable to the intentions of leading leaders of organized crime groups, who tasked him with gathering valuable information about police investigations.
Solicitors must up to the highest principles of integrity and have a sense of trust and a sense of trust in the public that they can rely on them.
Mr. Ditta betrayed that trust and tried to hide behind the cloak of his profession.
Lancashire's Serious and Organised Crime Unit conducted an investigation against Mr Ditt, where he was also convicted of three counts of possession of cocaine and now obstruction of justice, demonstrating our commitment to bringing criminals to justice.
This case should serve as a warning to all criminals that no one is out of the reach of the law.
We will find you and bring you to justice.
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years in prison after being found guilty of conspiracy to supply heroin, cocaine and cannabis.
Thirty-five other people involved in trafficking were jailed for a total of 153 years for drug offences.
On his website, Ditta held an online interview in which he said his dream job would be to legally represent clients from the death row bloc in America, wish mohammed ali as a dinner guest, and cite inequality as motivation for work.
Obama backs away from health care
After a wave of criticism, President Obama yesterday backed away from his oft-repeated and ambitious promise that "if you like your health program, you can keep it."
Citing hundreds of thousands of notices of testimony from providers, Republicans in recent days have accused the president of misleading the American public.
Yesterday, Obama backed away from his original promise.
"The vast majority of people who have functioning health insurance can keep them," he said in a speech in Boston.
In light of what he called a "media uproar" about the statements, Obama called on Americans who received those announcements to look for new policies on the market.
Most people will be able to have a better, more comprehensive health care program at the same price or even cheaper than expected.
"You'll get a better offer," he said.
His administration argues that it should come as no surprise that 5 percent of the population who have purchased insurance on their own may be forced to change the program because their insurance does not meet the new requirements set by the Affordable Care Act.
"I'm telling these Americans straight: you deserve better," Sebelius said in a statement to the Energy and Commerce Committee in Washington.
Sebelius, who oversees the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, said the launch of the internet market has been "poor" since October.
"I'm as disappointed and angry as anyone," she said.
I'll try to regain your trust.
An irritated Sebelius made that line, caught on a microphone, yesterday in the direction of an adviser sitting behind her at yesterday's Committee meeting, which took place after a heated exchange with Rep. Billy Long, Republican of Missouri, about whether she, too, must participate in Obama's care program.
For more than three hours during the hearing, he repeatedly pressed Sebelius on why the "architect" of the Affordable Care Act had not voluntarily given up government-sponsored insurance, and had not purchased the HealthCare.gov program that he now is forcing on millions of Americans.
Travels through mud, river and jungle and provides free medical care
Dr. Georges Bwelle provides free medical care in villages in Cameroon.
Bwelle and his team treat hundreds of patients almost every weekend
There are not too many doctors in west African countries; only one per 5,000 inhabitants.
Vote here or via your mobile phone.
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the top 10 candidates for the 2013 CNN Heroes of the Year award.
In the 2013 CNN Heroes of the Year award, you can vote for him or any of the other 10 main candidates.
The winner will receive $250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years, Georges Bwelle watched his father fall unconscious again and again, going to hospitals that were not equipped to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car accident near Cameroon's capital, Yaounde, in 1981.
At first, he was treated only for a broken arm, but subsequently developed an infection that spread to the brain, creating a hematoma that caused him problems all his life.
"There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon," says Georges Bwelle.
We'd have to take him out of Cameroon if we had the money.
Instead, Bwelle spent years transporting his father to overcrowded clinics and hospitals, where he received treatment that was simply available.
"It's not easy," says Bwelle.
You can leave the house at 5:00 in the morning, rush to the hospital to be there first, but you're not the first.
There's a lot of patients.
Some people die just because they have to wait.
Things haven't changed much since Bwelle's father died in 2002.
According to the World Health Organization, there is only one doctor per 5,000 inhabitants in Cameroon.
By comparison, the ratio in the United States is one doctor per 413 inhabitants.
And even if cameroonians could visit the doctor, many would not be able to afford it.
Two out of five people in this country live below the poverty line, and nearly three-quarters of the country's health care spending is private.
"The only problem they have is poverty," says Bwelle.
They can't enjoy life because of poverty.
When Bwelle saw his father and many of his countrymen suffer, he decided to do something about it.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his team of volunteers performed 700 free surgeries last year.
He became a vascular surgeon himself at the Central Hospital in Yaounde.
And he founded ascovime, a nonprofit organization whose members visit rural areas on weekends to provide free medical care.
Since 2008, he has helped nearly 32,000 people with his group of volunteers.
Almost every Friday, he and up to 30 people are tedded into vans, attaching medical supplies to rooftops and traveling through rugged terrain to villages in need of help.
They're not always accompanied by happiness.
More than once, vehicles have to push through the river and mud.
But when they arrive, they get welcomed as real heroes: feast, singing and dancing, and the best accommodation the community has to offer.
In these villages, free medical care is a real reason to celebrate, and Bwelle – with his broad smile and unbridled energy – is very willing to engage in local merriment.
The next day, the team begins treating hundreds of patients.
"We have 500 patients on every expedition," says Bwelle.
They come to the village from a radius of 60 kilometers on foot.
During each of these weekends, doctors provide different medical assistance.
Many are treated with malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasitic diseases and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others can get crutches or donated glasses or a birth certificate for free – a document that the school requires, but that many poor families simply can't afford.
In the evening, the team performs simple operations under local anesthesia.
Operations are usually carried out in the school building, at city hall or at home; after surgery, the patient gets up and goes to the recovery site to make room for the next patient.
Using light from the generator, operating room and sanitation, Bwelle and his volunteers work until the early hours of the morning.
It's exhausting, but the vesic musicians usually help the team not to lose motivation.
"To stay awake and keep working, they play drums all night," says Bwelle.
On Sunday, the team heads back to town, tired but proud of their work.
This group – consisting of Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students – performed 700 free surgeries last year and realizes that helping them can mean a lot to locals.
One man said he'd be able to work again after hericules surgery.
"It will change the future for our family," the man said.
In addition to organizing these weekend clinics and working as a surgeon at Bwelle Hospital, he also works at night for private health clinics around Yaounde.
He says that this second work finances about 60% of his non-profit activities; the rest are covered by private contributions.
"I'm not sure when he's sleeping," says Katie O'Malley, who is a second-year medical student at Drexel University in Philadelphia and volunteers for Bwelle's group.
He's always either in the hospital or trying to raise money for the organization to do these campaigns.
For medical and nursing students like O'Malley, who came from the United States or Europe to join Bwelle on his mission, this is a great practice they wouldn't get at home.
"We washed Dr. Bwell's hands thoroughly and removed bloodstains or held his tools," O'Malley says.
As a second-year medical student in America, you'll never experience that.
Volunteer students usually pay for their own trip to Cameroon and often arrive with donated medical supplies.
But once they arrive in Yaounde, Bwelle provides food, transportation and study.
"No doubt he's a hero," O'Malley says.
He gives his life to this organization, and his desire to help the people of Cameroon is endless.
For Bwelle, constant struggle is not a burden.
Helping others live happier, fulfilling the promise he made to his father, is something that brings him great joy.
"I'm so happy doing this job," Bwelle says.
And I'm thinking about my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
Make people laugh, ease their pain – that's why I'm doing it.

Central banks will keep swap lines permanent
Temporary and bilateral agreements between the European Central Bank (ECB), the US Fed, the Bank of England, and the central banks of Canada, Switzerland, and Japan will become a permanent instrument to allow banks access to global currency whenever they need to.
The banks stated this in their joint statement.
"This is a very sensible move," said Julian Callow, chief international economist at Barclays bank in London.
"So far, all transitional instruments of this type have gradually become permanent, so I don't think it's a surprise," adds Vojtěch Benda, chief economist at BH Securities.
Central bankers are strengthening the bonds that began in 2007, when the international credit market first snackled.
Central bank agreements gave access to euros, dollars, and other currency to anyone who needed them.
The central bankers' decision comes at a time when the US Fed is preparing to end its program to support the US economy, which could push the price of money higher in the global market.
By default, a swap contract is used to overcome the liquidity shortage of one currency while convalesing on the liquidity surplus of another currency.
It can be understood as a storage of one currency and a borrowing of another currency.
The ECB is launching a third attempt to restore confidence in European banks.
The EU has agreed on banking supervision, the ECB will oversee 150 banks.
The number of HIV infected in Prague exceeded 1,000
In the Czech Republic, the number of infected is increasing every year.
For example, in 2002, tests confirmed infection in 50 people, five years later there were 121, and in 2010 there were already 180.
Last year, 212 were infected and this was a record number.
"I think there is no doubt that the total number of newly diagnosed cases will exceed 200 this year," said Miroslav Hlavatý, an AIDS expert who led prague's House of Light for Patients for years.
According to him, there were 165 HIV patients in the country last January to September, and this year there were 176 during the same period.
From the beginning of the follow-up to the end of September this year, tests confirmed HIV in 1710 men and 353 women, with the most infected being in Prague.
Their number reached 1005 in September.
In the Central Bohemian Region, 206 infected people resided.
156 people from the South Moravian Region, 130 from Moravia-Silesia and 116 from Usti region also heard the diagnosis.
The least infected came from the Highlands, there were 19.
A total of 88 percent of patients became infected during sex.
Fourteen people have a history of blood transfusion.
However, such a case has not appeared in the Czech Republic since the beginning of testing, i.e. in more than a quarter of a century.
Six children were also born with HIV, transmitted from the mother.
Children should learn myths and legends as "models for the way of life," says the author.
Stories about Thor may show that "brute force cannot equal clever guil,"while Arthurian legends reveal how important it is to have a dream.
Much of the myth would be "too wild for school teaching, too scandalous, and in some cases too obscene," said Crossley-Holland, who is insugged for careful selection of age-appropriate works.
"I think it's great that myths and folk art are already part of education," he said.
I've been defending this plan for 20 years.
He added that "openly lecturing" authors and teachers are like a "switch" to an engaging story with a "subliminal" message for children.
Crossley-Holland, who translated the epic Beowulf from Anglo-Saxon and who also writes The Norwegian Myths (Penguin Book) and British National Myths, says: "You may have good intentions, but you'd better keep them to yourself."
Perhaps the biggest difference between an adult author writing for adults and an adult author writing for children is the need for some sense of hope.
Not that everything has to be simplified or end in a happy ending, but there must be a natural sense of good and evil.
And he must be subconscious; revealed through a story, not an openly defined one.
The old truth is that it's better to show than describe.
Miloslava Cejpková: November Smile
It came from the outside, from 4 degrees Celsius, which we're not used to yet.
At first she put aside her smile, the one she was always displaying as a defense against the would-be friendly surroundings.
She was very relieved because it was a mask she chose not to put away in public.
He was honest at home only on the days when she grandmotherd and had her grandchildren Elinka or Adek around her.
And, of course, when her sons called her.
She remembered very well the lesson of endless courses in business skills.
Now they finally came in handy.
So she doesn't grieve those closest to her.
Then he flew into a corner.
Like a costume at a masquerade.
November or any other month can't do the miracle of smiling really, like when they were on a trip with one that's been out for almost three years.
Pierre Rainero: I'm trying to make Cartier style a living language

GM recalls some new light trucks in the U.S. to repair seat backs
General Motors is recalling nearly 19,000 of its new (2014) Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra light trucks to fix a manual back-tilting defect, according to a friday announcement from the U.S. Auto Safety Authority.
For some of these vehicles, the front seat tilt mechanism may have a malfunction.
As a result, seat backs do not comply with federal automotive safety standards for head restraints.
A notice posted on the Highway Safety Administration (NHTSA) website states that "if a car gets hit from behind, the headrest may not properly protect passengers, increasing the risk of injury."
The recalled models were manufactured between August 1 and September 10.
GM launched the delivery in June, and for this leading U.S. automaker, it is the most important vehicle launch since the restructuring after bankruptcy in 2009.
GM informed the owner of the shipment of the defect in the first half of October.
NHTSA was unable to review the owners' notice because of the government's 16-day dysfunction, which weakened car sales growth in October.
Sales of Silverado and Sierra deliveries, which have been redesigned for the 2014 models, rose about 20 percent in the first 10 months of this year, GM said Friday.
In October, GM sold 42,660 Silverado models and 16,503 Sierra models from its deliveries.
Shares on the New York Stock Exchange rose 1.4 percent friday afternoon to $37.47.
Too inquisitive newspaper to be investigated
A Chinese newspaper that asked for the release of a reporter accused of defamation will be thoroughly investigated, the press administrator said.
The Guangzhou-based New Express newspaper made a rare public request for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
However, Mr. Chen later admitted on television that he had taken bribes to fabricate stories about a company partly owned by the state.
The administrator said the New Express newspaper would now make a "full correction."
The "remedy" order came from the State Administration for Press and Publications, Radio, Film and Television in Guangdong Province.
A preliminary investigation revealed that between September 2012 and August 2013, the Yangcheng Evening News' New Express published several false reports about zoomlion.
"The editorial board of the New Express newspaper was disorderly," the administrator said in a statement.
He said he had to decide to "impose an administrative penalty on Chen Yongzhou in the form of the revocation of his journalistic license."
He also "ordered yangcheng's Evening News group to make a full correction to The New Express and recommended that they investigate those responsible on The New Express and immediately change the management of The New Express."
Mr. Chen wrote several articles for New Express about financial irregularities in a construction equipment company called Zoomlion.
After he was detained, his newspaper published two requests for his release on the front page, claiming that he was behind his journalistic work.
But Mr. Chen then appeared on state television and confessed to giving false stories for a fee.
"In this case, I have caused damage to Zoomlion and to the entire media industry and its ability to gain public trust," he told state news station CCTV.
I did it mainly because I wanted money and fame.
I realize I've done wrong.
After Mr. Chen's apology, The New Express issued a front-page apology, saying that he had failed to adequately review his reports.
Recently, several high-profile suspects have made confessions on television.
Experts say confessions are still regularly enforcement, despite a change in the law this year that prohibits authorities from forcing anyone to accuse themselves.
As middle-class misery grows, singapore pawnshops are booming
At a pawnshop in Bendemeer, Singapore, Janani Amirthalinga stops a gold bracelet, ring and earrings to pay her daughter's tuition.
"My husband and I just bought a house and put all my money into it," says Mrs Amirthalinga.
Although she receives $2,400 (SGD 3,000) each month as an administrator and her husband also works, the family's monthly income is insufficient, she says.
Indeed, demand across areas in Southeast Asia – where household debt is rising – is such that ValueMax, where the woman conducts her transaction, became the third pawn store on the Singapore Stock Exchange this week.
Stopping jewelry is not only a quick way to borrow cash – SGD1,300 in Mrs. Amirthalinga's case – but it is also almost as cheap as unsecured bank loans.
Pawnshops in Singapore routinely apply an annual percentage rate of 17 percent, just above the 15.4 percent rate offered by United Overseas Bank, a local bank with a branch in the same mall.
Pawnshops, however, have the advantage of not requiring a person's verification (payment history) or proof of income, and can grant a loan faster than banks.
And that's why, as families feel pressured by rising living costs and rising household debt and consumer debt, millions of people across the region are turning to pawnshops.
After five years of robust growth since the global financial crisis and cheap credit supported by loose monetary policy in advanced economies, low- and middle-income families are turning to pawnshops to deal with the deteriorating financial situation.
This week, ratings agency Standard & Poor's cited the increasing use of home loans primarily because of rising rents as a risk factor for asian banks' creditworthiness.
She said Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore have the highest household debt in Asia in view of gross domestic product.
Malaysia is at the top of the list with a ratio of 80 percent of GDP, up from 60 percent in 2008.
Economists also feared high levels of consumer debt in Thailand, which just got out of a technical recession this week.
On Thursday, data showed continued weak exports and a weakening of consumer demand.
"The bottom line is that as costs increase, people from middle to low [income range] will try to supplement their income wherever they can," said Song Seng Wun, an economist at CIMB, a Malaysian bank.
Historically high gold prices over the past two years have contributed to people hasting to stop their personal belongings and taking advantage of the opportunity to exchange their family jewels for cash.
About 70 percent of the items pledged at 200 city pawn parks are gold.
People say: the price of gold looks good, we stop grandma's gold necklace and get it back next month.
Thailand's largest pawnshop operator, EasyMoney, has seen a 20 percent increase in the number of customers using its pawnshops in recent months.
Growth in the pawn industry is so great that ValueMax, the operator of a branch in downtown Bendemeer and 15 similar in Singapore, plans to expand not only to neighboring Malaysia – where it has four locations – but also outside Asia, says ValueMax Ceo Yes Lee Ching.
The company will finance this by using 60 percent of the SGD 66 million it raised on the Singapore Stock Exchange this week.
While some discount lenders have come under fire for high interest rates, Ms. yes says the pledge not only offers lower rates than other lenders, but also does not directly increase debt.
"Customers stop items they already own, and monetizing personal property doesn't increase household debt," he says.
In the company, the pledge of assets is increasingly accepted as a means of securing short-term, secure financing.
Moreover, it is not just people in financial distress who use pawnshops.
Wealthy people from Singapore also use ValueMax branches to stop gold bars or Rolex watches, a way to get up to 60 percent of the cash purchase price.
Our customers are from all possible backgrounds.
"These include wealthy individuals who need to borrow in the short term because of their bold businesses or investments, or small businesses that need help solving problems in their cash flow," says Ms yes.
Sometimes they just need money as quickly as possible.
Nsa blames hackers for website crash, but "internal flaw"
The mysterious National Security Agency said last Friday that its website crashed for several hours last week due to an internal error, not a hacking attack, as some claimed online.
"The NSA.gov was not accessible for several hours this evening due to an internal error that occurred during a regular update," the spy agency said in an emailed statement.
The problem will be fixed later tonight.
The claim that the outage was caused by a DDoS (distributed denial of service) attack is not true.
Earlier in the evening, online server sensors noted that the NSA website had not been working for at least six hours, and the site is no longer available to some users.
Earlier, an NSA spokesman told ABC News that the agency's internal sensitive networks were "not at all" compromised.
A spokesman said no classified information is compromised.
At least one group of online hacking activists claimed to be responsible for dismeding NSA sites through a DDoS attack.
DDoS attacks are designed to flood target web pages with information until servers overload and the page falls down.
This cyber tactic is relatively simple, and the purpose of the attacks is not to penetrate the internal network of the target system.
The former NSA super-secret agency, once nicknamed No Such Agency, has become the center of public attention in recent months after a series of revelations about foreign and domestic surveillance programs and a snag of criticism for the theft of classified NSA files from the agency and their disclosure by disillusioned former employee Edward Snowden.
This growing controversy surrounding the agency has fueled earlier speculation that today's accident was the result of a targeted cyber operation.
The number of HIV infected in Prague exceeded 1,000
Doctors in Prague have registered more than 1,000 people with HIV.
From the beginning of monitoring in 1986 to the end of this year's third quarter, tests confirmed the infection in a total of 1005 people from the metropolis.
This is based on statistics from the National Aids Reference Laboratory of the National Institute of Health.
According to her, there have been 2,063 infected people in the Czech Republic so far.
In 396, the disease of immunity failure has already erupted.
198 people died.
The number of infected people in the Czech Republic has been increasing every year in the last decade.
In 2002, tests confirmed infection in 50 people, five years later there were already 121.
In 2009, the examination revealed 156 new diseases, and in 2010 180.
The number dropped to 153 a year ago, but last year was a record.
According to the lab, there were 212.
"I think there is no doubt that the total number of newly diagnosed cases will exceed 200 this year," says Miroslav Hlavatý, an AIDS expert who led prague's House of Light for Patients for years.
From October to the end of 2011, tests detected the disease in 39 people and last year in 47, Hlavatý said.
In September, doctors registered 21 new patients and three patients.
From baseline to late September, HIV tests confirmed in 1,710 men and 353 women.
161 men and 37 women developed AIDS.
Most of the infected were in Prague.
JAN JANDOUREK: The Curse of This Country: Presidents on the Brink of Power
It is almost a rule that, at key moments in the country, the head of state was not in the form to fulfil his state duties.
If T. Masaryk were physically and mentally five years younger, he would have lived to see the end of his presidency, and the events surrounding Munich would have happened a little differently.
We probably wouldn't have won the war, but after symbolic resistance, the air force could fly abroad, heavy weapons could be destroyed, and the government could flee to London now and not fight laboriously for its legitimacy.
And most importantly, the surrender would not make the nation hungover to this day.
Beneš was not a statesman and was still fit for Munich, but during the war he started to go downhill and in February 48 he acted accordingly.
If he had been any better, he could have gone into exile for a third time and undermined the legitimacy of the Communists and their coup.
It's a shame to talk about Hácha.
He was elected, saying that "the President will not be put in a position to make decisions."
But he had to, though it wasn't a big decision with a knife to Hitler's neck in the chancellery.
Until the last days of March 1939, František Moravec, the intelligence chief, said what should be done to ensure that the occupation, which he knew exactly about for the day, did not go so smoothly and with such profit to the Germans.
The senile president and the cowardly government did nothing, not believing him, and fearing him.
Gottwald, a human wreck, had his old comrades executed, as Moscow had ordered him to.
Ludvík Svoboda was definitively prevented from participated in normalization, and they had to unseat him, who was already senile.
That Husák was helpless and sick, the depressing old man made things easier in November 89, but that's the only positive.
Havel was lucky not to be in office in recent years, spared the worst.
Klaus may still be a fresh tennis retiree, but many of his achievements give the sense that thought processes are not what they used to be.
Well, now we have this.
The head of state and commander-in-chief of the armed forces looks like he does, and we don't know everything yet.
Fortunately, there is now no external threat to the Republic.
Or maybe it's threatening, it's just not visible.
Then the question is whether, exceptionally, it is (historically) not good that the president is not quite at his strength.
It's not a normal state.
Couldn't we elect someone acceptable-minded and acceptable healthy once again in this country?

Schwarzenberg: We have early elections in two years
Top 09 Chairman Karel Schwarzenberg expects another early election in a timely way.
A week after the last one, in an interview with Aktuálně.cz, he said there was no other way out, and every government that came out of the vote last Friday and Saturday was an impossible blind man.
"This cannot last long," said Karel Schwarzenberg, estiming the lifespan of the beginning of the parliamentary term within two years.
He disagrees, saying that voters will hardly choose quite differently next time: "I think it will be a little more balanced decision-making."
At the same time, the TOP 09 chairman does not admit that his party could lose voters in the next elections as it did this year (it lost about 300,000 votes compared to 2010).
Schwarzenberg estimates that if it is clear within two months that there will be early elections, it will strengthen Andrej Babiš's ANO 2011 movement.
Otherwise, according to Schwarzenberg, Babiš will lose.
Schwarzenberg comments on the turbulent situation in the ČSSD, where Chairman Bohuslav Sobotka, after a secret meeting of part of the party leadership, declared that either he or Michal Hašek would remain in charge of social democracy:
"Democratic Party leaders like little boys go to the head of state to allow them to revolutionize the party."
"I thought Mr. Hašek was smarter and more intelligent."
"Because I've never seen anything so eagerly done wrong in my life," added the top 09 chairman.
And in the direction of President Zeman (whom he faced in the race for the presidency), he said, "The role of the head of state is clear: He wants to seize the party."
The first laws have already been submitted by TOP 09.
What was the biggest surprise of the election for you personally?
TOP 09 has already formally tabled its first bills in the Chamber of Deputies, including the Farsi Register of Treaties, which was discussed by house committees before the elections, but fell under the table with early elections.
In an interview with the Aktuálně.cz, the top 09 chairman argues that such speed is due to the fact that "these laws are needed."
At the same time, TOP 09 clearly wants to overtly overtly overtly try from other sides.
For example, ano election leader Martin Komárek accused top 09 in the election fight of "robbing" the ANO program with the idea of introducing a register of contracts.
TOP 09 has now taken advantage of the lead - it has simply dusted off a proposal that was already on its way to its second House reading.
Coulson hacked into his phone to check the tip
Former News of the World (NotW) editor Andy Coulson allegedly used methods of "phone hacking, surveillance and confrontation" to confirm a fraudulent tip about a love affair involving the then Home Secretary Charles Clarke.
Prosecutor Andrew Edis told the Old Bailey that the News of the World newspaper had picked up false reports in May 2005 that Clarke had been seen with his "attractive special adviser" Hannah Pawlby.
The newspaper commissioned private investigator Glenn Mulcaire to hack into Pawlby's voicemail and infiltrate her privacy, but the court heard that Coulson also called her and left her voicemails.
"The D.A. is suggesting that Mr. Coulson, who is now editor of NotW, is not the person standing outside the house hoping to catch people outside, but a person who likes to give people stories to see what they have to say," Mr. Edis said.
He said the NotW newspaper used three ways to investigate stories: phone hacking, surveillance, and confrontation.
The editor is personally involved in the third method.
She obviously knows about the other one, surveillance, she needs to know about her.
What about the first one?
Does he know about phone hacking?
He says no, we say, "Of course he does."
Rumors of a love affair involving Clarke were first picked up by the NotW news division when a source who was sexually interested in Ms Pawlby was told: "You're wasting your time, she's with Charles."
The recording of voicemails taken from her phone on at least three occasions was obtained at Mulcair's home in August 2006.
Investigators also found records on a private investigator's computer, where Ms. Pawlby and her sister were referred to as "Projects."
While Ms Pawlby was being investigated, her grandparents received anonymous phone calls asking for information about Pawlby, Mr. Edis said.
Meanwhile, former chief correspondent Neville Thurlbeck and former correspondent James Weatherup oversaw the tracking of Mrs Pawlby's movements.
On June 18, 2005, Coulson left her a voicemail telling her, "I've been given a story that we're going to publish tomorrow that I'd love to talk to Charles about."
Mr Edis says Coulson's involvement in the story was modeled on other high-profile figures, including former Home Secretary David Blunkett.
The court heard on Thursday that Coulson confronted Mr Blunkett about a love affair with a married woman while he was seeing co-accused Rebekah Brooks, who was married at the time.
Coulson and Brooks denied conspiring with others to hack into phones between October 3, 2000 and August 9, 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup confessed to hacking into the phone.
Ben Greenman: The Tenth Anniversary of the New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker
It could be argued that the city of New York is where solo comic performances were born in America: almost a century ago, variety artist Frank Fray, who worked as chairman of ceremonies at the Palace Theatre on Broadway, began telling jokes to the assembled people using the interview method.
Faye's innovation has expanded over the years, most recently through the New York Comedy Festival.
Founded and managed by Caroline Hirsch, founder of the carolines solo comedy institution, the festival celebrates its tenth anniversary this year – along with more than 60 performances in small clubs and major theatres.
"Most of these titles have appeared in Carolines and become successful to the point where they're too big to play in a club," Hirsch said.
We created this festival as an opportunity to continue working with them.
This year's event includes performances by Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher, as well as "Stand Up for Heroes," an annual musical comedy benefit show at Madison Square Garden that features Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby, among others.
Just as this festival expanded, so did the world of comedy.
Several comedians attending this year's festival have emerged from unconventional channels, such as shows in smaller radio and television companies such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll rocked his sitcom (the hilariously racy "League" on the fantastic-football theme on FXX) and now has his own comedy show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate was a member of both "Saturday night live" and "Parks and recreation," but she is best known for the fast-moving series of "Marcel the shell with shoes on" videos.
Both Kroll and Slate, like other young comedians with clearly recognizable voices (the surreally pessimistic Anthony Jeselnik, the snide, racially minded W. Kamau Bell), are the product of the decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the biggest draws of the festival will be an interview: David Steinberg will be talking to Larry David.
Steinberg began as a solo comedian, but became a successful television and film director, as well as an unofficial comedy historian.
From 2005 to 2007, he hosted a show on TV Land called "Sit down comedy with David Steinberg".
The meeting is being held at Town Hall in midtown Manhattan.
"This town is definitely in the comedy DNA of larry's entire work," Steinberg said.
He told me that when he's here, he sometimes walks down the aisle between two buildings and thinks, man, if I lose all my money, maybe I'll live here.
A lot of things have moved on, and it's different.
For example, the commentator Pečinka spoke in such a way that one could agree with it, while Chairman Štěch insu fazed discord.
Hetman Chovanec was suspicious to me as soon as he was elected to the presidency, and he confirmed it.
President Sobotka has always been, and continues to be, a symbol of the cssd's misery.
The other gentlemen showed their weaknesses.
Senator Dienstbier is principled and readable and useless, Vice-President Zaorálek has made it impossible to talk the most on television.
On this basis, I do not see a better option than for the ČSSD to nominate Vice-President of the Senate Gajdůšková as Prime Minister, the only one would not have an initial handicap and I think it would perform standardly.
That's such a good solution, hardly anyone in the leadership will support him.
I would add that this solution is the only way to forget what has been done and continue without tearing the party up.
Alena Gajdůšková could safely form a minority government with only the blessing of President Babiš and without the People's Party, but with the People's Minister of Health Hovorka, who is actually a religious Social Democrat.
This mini-government would have great stability because it would enforce a proper referendum law, and so did Dawn President Okamura.
In the end, President Babiš would accept the progress of taxes, because he is bright and will see that it is impossible without it.
The People's Party would not bring problems, because Hovorka is the bearer of the best they have, and they would not be in government otherwise.
The same is true of YES, there would be a valuable minister here too, but if they reasonably do not want to enter into risky government participation, but provide support, also well.
Let's give alena gajdůšková courage!
Bárta's detention is related to Janoušk and Bém: Is he behind the wiretap leak?
The Chairman of public affairs, Vít Bárta, was arrested by the police on Thursday.
Jan Petržílek, head of the Department of Analytics and Informatics of the Anti-Corruption Police, was arrested along with him.
The arrests relate to wiretaps of lobbyist Roman Janoušek and former Mayor Pavel Bém (ODS).
The information about the wiretaps that the server came up with Novinky.cz confirmed to the Czech Press Office by a trusted source.
The intercepted phone calls of Janoušek and Bém, published last March by the daily Mladá fronta Dnes, in which the two men call each other "Mazánka" and "Hummingbird", show Janoušek's influence on the actions of the city under Bém's leadership.
The newspaper reported at the time that they were acquired in 2007 by the Security Information Service (BIS), from which they escaped to the ABL security agency two years later.
It was owned by Bart at the time.
The Novinky.cz that the detained criminologist Petržílek worked for bis before joining the anti-corruption police.
Petržílek joined the anti-corruption unit, which subsequently dealt with the wiretaps, at the same time as they were published.
"With regard to the Act on the Protection of Classified Information, I cannot confirm or say anything at all," said prosecutor Michal Muravský from the Municipal Prosecutor's Office in Prague.
He also refused to confirm that he was overseeing the case.
The inspection does not want to comment on the case for the same reason.
He and Vi vite Bárta also detained an anti-corruption police officer
Bart's lawyer, Oldřich Chudoba, who also represented him in the case of alleged corruption of VV members, also did not want to comment too much on the case, but said: "Yes, I represent the client in this matter as well, but due to the protection of classified information, I cannot comment further."
According to Law's information, the case is handled by the General Inspectorate of Security Forces (GIBS).
The tn.cz said Barta may have bought classified information from the police.
According to prvnizpravy.cz, the case may have been related to the case of former police president Peter Lessy, whom Bárta allegedly sought to be appointed.
However, the latest information from Law shows that the detention of Vít Bárta is unrelated to Petr Lessy.
Eva Kropáčová, a spokeswoman for the Police Presidium, declined to comment, saying that the case is being handled by the Prague City Prosecutor's Office.
"We will not comment on this question with regard to the protection of classified information," Štěpánka Zenklová, spokeswoman for the Municipal Public Prosecutor's Office in Prague, told Pravo on Friday.
It is the prosecutor who oversees Bart's case, and it is therefore indirectly apparent from her words that the file or criminal proceedings are kept secret.
A reporter from Novinek managed to reach Vitus Bárta's wife Kateřina Klasnová in the morning before their residence in Prague's Klárov.
She was just loading suitcases into the car and leaving.
She declined to comment on the incident.
On Friday morning, Dawn leader Tomio Okamura commented on Bart's detention.
He says he has no idea what the case is about.
"Vít Bárta was one of the many candidates of many parties on our list, and as I said repeatedly before the elections, he was not or is not a member of The Dawn of Direct Democracy by Tomio Okamura," he added.
Vít Bárta, who ran unsuccessfully for Tomio Okamura's Dawn of Direct Democracy movement in the last early elections to the Chamber of Deputies in the Pilsen Region, is known for his corruption case of bribery of Members of Public Affairs.
In April 2012, he was wrongfully sentenced to 18 months, suspended for 30 months.
Eventually, the sentence was overturned and Bart was acquitted.
Security concerns in Mozambique intensify over conflict of strong figures
Under a statue of Samora Machela, Mozambique's founding president, thousands of people gathered in downtown Maputo to proclaim peace slogans in a rare public demonstration.
"We want peace back; we want stability," said Vanessa de Sousa, managing director of the investment company.
Fearing for her country's future, she swapped corporate attire for a T-shirt embellished with "we demand safety" in Portuguese and joined the crowd at Independence Square in the capital on Thursday.
For two weeks, there have been almost daily reports of conflicts between government forces and the Renamo party, one of the worst skirmishes since the peace agreement more than 20 years ago.
Renamo was once a notorious insurgent movement, originally supported by the white government in Rhodesia and then by the apartheid government in South Africa as part of efforts to destabilize the country's independent government.
After a peace agreement in 1992, it became an opposition party.
Analysts believe it is unlikely that open conflict will re-erupt in the country, but recent events have alarmed foreign investors and locals.
A fast-growing economy is at stake, as the discovery of large offshore reserves of oil and coal deposits in the northwest may bring more than $50 billion in investments over the next few years from companies such as Rio Tinto and Vale in Brazil, Eni in Italy, and Anadarko, Usa.
The ruling Frelimo party, the dominant political force since 1975, and Renamo accuse each other of tensions.
Renamo claims that the government has provoked the latest conflicts by launching an attack on their members in Sofala province, a traditional stronghold of the Renamo Party, on September 17.
The violent assault of the former rebels subsequently culminated when government forces attacked the Renamo party base and tried to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the group's leader, Renamo spokesman Fernando Mazanga told the Financial Times.
The government blames Renamo for starting the conflicts because it allegedly attacked soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza sought to alleviate fears of instability.
Mr Guebuza told the French news agency AFP on Wednesday that Mr Dhlakama saw himself as a "loser" who wanted to use "whatever is left of his power to try to prove that he can order the government to make his own decisions."
Both Frelimo and Renamo say they want to avoid war.
But concerns grew when Mr Mazanga's words that The Renamo Party was withdrawing from the 1992 peace agreement were quoted.
He told the FT that he meant frelimo no longer respected the agreement.
"Our goal is to return to negotiations, but with seriousness," Mr. Mazanga said.
Previous talks between the two sides have done little to ease tensions between the two sides, which have been instigated by a series of skirmishes this year.
It's a skirmish between two great personalities (Guebuza and Dhlakama), said Open University lecturer and Mozambique expert Joseph Hanlon.
Neither is a good negotiator, and neither is prepared to make the necessary concessions.
The Renamo party, which has been seeking electoral changes, has already said it would boycott municipal elections scheduled for November.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators interpreted the use of force as an effort by the moribund movement to gain benefits and financial gain from the government.
Renamo's electoral share has been declining since 1992, while a newer party, the Mozambique Democratic Movement (DHM), founded by a former Member of the Renamo Party, is expected to improve its position in the elections.
Mr Mazanga says That Mr Guebuza – whose second term ends next year – wants to destroy the country's democracy.
"He doesn't want a multi-party democratic system, he doesn't want transparent elections, he doesn't want peace because he doesn't want to run for president," Mazanga said.
It is unclear what options renamo has, but it has carried out divisive terrorist attacks on police stations and vehicles on a key north-south road.
Most of the skirmishes occurred in Sofala province, which is several hundred kilometers from the capital Maputo, but where is the city of Beira, a port on which mining companies, including Rio Tinto and Vale, rely on to export coal.
In June, Rio suspended the use of the railway for about a week when The Renamo party threatened to attack the line.
Mr Mazanga would not comment on whether Renamo would repeat his threat.
Renamo wanted to "warn the international community that the situation in Mozambique is not good," Mazanga said.
Instability has increased frustration with the government, says Fernando Lima, head of mediacoop, an independent media company, and many people are also concerned about corruption, slow pace of development and the recent spate of kidnappings.
"People think that the responsibility for the future of the country lies solely with the government and the president, and that he should be the one to find solutions to the problems," he says.
Protester Omar Sultuane says people just want stability.
"Nobody cares about Renamo or Frelimo, people just want peace again, they want free access to the roads," he says.
Tripodi denies being influenced by Obeid
The former Labor minister of New South Wales (Australia) will be investigated by the State Corruption Oversight Committee.
Former New South Wales Minister Joe Tripodi has denied changing coastal rental policy at the request of his political advisor Eddie Obeid, who had hidden interests in three properties on government-controlled land.
The Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) on Friday widened its inquiry into whether Mr Obeid lobbied several state ministers to have the lease on Circular Quay, where the Obeids owned two restaurants and a café, renewed without having to take part in a tender after it expired in August 2005.
The committee is now investigating claims that Mr Tripodi knew about Mr Obeid's secret interests in these properties, based on evidence presented on Thursday by Mr Tripodi's former deputy chief of staff, Lynne Ashpole.
During years of talks launched in 2005, the government pushed for leases to go to tenders.
The tenants were against it and also wanted longer-term terms and conditions.
In 2009, leases for businesses in Circular Quay, which brought the Obeids $2.5 million a year, were restored without the need to participate in a tender.
Mr Tripodi, who was Minister of Ports from February 2006 to November 2009, was originally a supporter of tenders.
But he denied that the changes were made at the request of Mr Obeid, who, Mr Tripodi admitted, had urged a shift in the government's rental policy.
A transcript of calls submitted to the ICAC showed calls between August and September 2007 between Mr Obeid and Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a senior official who came to the port department after working under Mr Obeid in the fisheries department.
"Was the development of commercial rental policy the subject of these telephone conversations?" asked Assistant Commissioner Anthony Whealy to Mr Tripodi.
"No," Mr. Tripodi replied.
I can't remember what we talked about, but certainly not about this.
Certainly not between me and Mr. Obeid.
LAW, 1 November 2013
The dog rolled up the carpet, the president tripped and ended up on crutches
On Thursday, President Miloš Zeman left motol hospital in Prague, where he spent the night in bed, and went to the chateau in Lány.
What state of health is he in?
Cabbage bubbles in Kunovice, they don't add chemistry to it
More than 1,000 tons of sourdated cabbage are to be produced in the coming months in Slovácko's Fruta Kunovice, which belongs to the Hamé food group.
The season started here in October and will last about six months.
Since 1925, it has been producing a healthy delicacy in the traditional way, i.e. pedalling directly in large tanks.
In modern industrial times, this is a rarity.
Our workers have found a nearly 10km route in a shift.
Fifteen to thirty tons of cabbage can fit in each of the ten tanks, one takes three shifts to fill," said David Kladroba, director of the Slovácká Fruta plant.
Cabbage couds are transported to the company premises directly from their fields by farmers mainly from Ostrožsko and Břeclav region.
Fruta employees then clean the vegetables, remove the brooms and throw them in the twister.
From there, the already chopped cabbage falls into pools of six meters deep, in which treadmills clad in white clothing and boots work tirelessly.
This will extrud unwanted air.
The last layer of cabbage is covered with a tarpaulin and weighed down with water.
"The perinerable crouch then meddies for six to eight weeks under spontaneous milk fermentation without any addition of fermentation-promoting substances," stressed director Kladroba.
The natural process corresponds to production under domestic conditions, individual layers are sprinkled with salt and cumin.
After fermentation, cabbage travels to the filling line.
It is packed in sweet and sour brine in bags or glasses and subjected to sterility.
Hamé supplies sauched cabbage mainly to the domestic and Slovak markets.
It is also registered in some other countries, such as the United Kingdom, Ireland and Canada.
Damkova is said to be prohibited by UEFA from publishing penalties for referees.
Dagmar Damková, chairwoman of the refereeing committee of the Football Association of the Czech Republic, stopped publishing punishments for referees.
It is prohibited by UEFA rules, which she stated in an interview with The Law newspaper.
Otherwise, the FAČR would be threatened with a penalty.
Damková also denied that she had sided with the footballers of Pilsen, where she comes from.
These speculations are really pointless.
It is true that I live in Pilsen, but the other members of the commission are from other countries, for example from Prague.
So in the event of a vote, I can lose 1-6," Damková said in response to criticism that has raged after Pilsen has recently played twice as many penalties as other league teams.
Therefore, although in recent months the FAČR has stopped publishing penalties for referees, Damková assures that the judges are paying for their mistakes.
"Believe me, if the committee finds out that the referee made a mistake, they will limit his delegation, whatever the match," Damkova said.
According to Damkova, the reason why punishments are not published is because of the ban from the European Football Union.
"UEFA prohibits the disclosure of such information and severely punishes violations."
"We're very suspicious of each other, and we're looking for something behind every mistake."
"We have published restrictions, but I have received two very strong warnings that if we do not stop, there will be severe sanctions," Damkova said.
Other countries respect the ban.
"We were really the exception," she added.
If the disclosure continues, the commission could lose money from UEFA to educate and develop referees.
"And they're very important to us."
"Without them, we would not be able to fulfill the program to educate referees," Damková added.
Does the Internet mean the end of travel agencies?
Flight Centre seems to be successfully bucking this trend.
The company has updated its estimate of annual profit and expects record profits from holidaymakers in Australia and the UK.
The travel agency now expects its annual underlying pre-tax profit to be between $325 million and $340 million, compared with $305 million to $315 million from the previous forecast.
If current developments are maintained, this will represent a 12 to 17% increase from a record profit of $290.4 million in 2011/12.
Managing director Graham Turner said Flight Centre generated an 8 per cent profit in the first half of the year and started the second half with strong growth, particularly in Australian and UK off-business travel.
"To date, our 10 countries are profitable and several are heading for record annual earnings before interest and tax," he said.
This includes Australia and the UK, which are traditionally our biggest profit creators.
The recreational business has buoyed in Australia during the second half of the year, offsetting a slightly weaker domestic business travel market.
Similarly, in the UK, Flight Centre performed well in the leisure area, while corporate clients spent less.
U.S. trade recovered from a loss during a seasonally weaker half-year and is expected to deliver full-year profit for the third year in a row.
Flight Centre shares were 3 cents higher yesterday at $38.20.
British police deliver extradition notice to Assange
British police today delivered an extradition notice to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who took refuge in the Ecuadorian embassy in London, where he applied for asylum.
Scotland Yard said it had delivered an "extradition notice" to the 40-year-old Australian, asking him to appear at a police station and that if he did not, he could be threatened with arrest.
Assange exhausted his options under British law when the Supreme Court this month overturned his appeal against extradition, and he faces extradition to Sweden on sex crimes charges.
Fearing that Stockholm would extradite him to the US, he sought refuge in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London on June 19, where he applied for asylum in the South American country.
Scotland Yard "delivered an extradition notice to a 40-year-old man requesting that he appear at the police station on the day and hour specified for him," a spokesman said.
Assange continues to violate bail conditions.
The embassy declined to comment on the delivery of the extradition notice.
Assange fears extradition from Sweden to the United States, where he may face espionage charges, because he has published 250,000 U.S. diplomatic documents on the WikiLeaks website.
The Supreme Court has ruled: Time can be prosecuted.
The Supreme Court ruled that former Prime Minister Petr Nečas could also be prosecuted for possible crimes he may have committed before the dissolution of the Chamber of Deputies in August.
He was protected only by procedural immunity, which applies to speeches in the Chamber of Deputies.
On the contrary, in the case of former ODS members Ivan Fuksa, Mark Šnajdr and Petr Tluchora, he decided that they could not be punished for possible crimes until they resigned last November, said Supreme Court spokesman Petr Knötig.
With this decision, the court rejected a proposal by the public prosecutor, Yev Ishtvan, who wanted to continue criminal proceedings with members.
According to him, they accepted bribes in the form of lucrative positions in state-owned firms for rescheduing their mandates and not making it a problem to pass laws.
On the contrary, the former prime minister who offered them these positions can be prosecuted further.
Aircraft manufacturers fight over seat width, big orders at stake
A dispute has erupted between leading aircraft manufacturers over the width of second-class seats on long-distance flights, causing a bitter exchange at the Dubai Air Show this month.
The issue is the width of seats provided for economy class long-haul flights – not exactly the one that airlines would normally have preceded, but whose allocated space is key to efficiency requirements for the last aircraft offered by Airbus SAS and Boeing.
Airbus this week called for industry standards that would offer at least 46 cm wide economy class seats, but major U.S. rival Boeing says airlines are to decide.
The controversy arose at a time when aircraft manufacturers are competing to sell the largest version of their twin-engine long-haul aircraft, with a potentially record number of orders expected during the event from November 17 to 21.
The way the rear of the aircraft is laid out – especially whether there are 9 or 10 seats side by side – underpins the economic performance demands of designing new "mini-jumbo" aircraft.
Boeing says the improved "777X" will transport 406 people in economy seats more than 43 cm wide spread over 10 in each row.
Airbus says a rival version of its A350 will transport 350 people in 46 cm wide economy seats spread over the 9th floor.
Giant aircraft often attack each other on technical issues through advertisements in professional media.
Airbus is now appealing directly to the public ahead of the Dubai Air Show, where the 777X is expected to gain the upper hand with more than 100 orders.
He recently tentatively demonstrated what the start of a new advertising war might be when he showed financiers a picture showing three people in a restaurant with the caption "Would you like it?"
"Boeing promotes long-haul flights in seats narrower than those in regional turboprop aircraft," said Airbus sales manager John Leahy.
As dietary habits change, people are bigger, but airplane seats haven't changed radically.
From the early 1970s, when the Boeing 747 jumbo defined modern long-distance air travel, by the turn of the century, the weight of the average American aged 40 to 49 increased by 10 percent, according to U.S. Department of Health data.
According to AMERICAN health statistics, the average American in the 21st century has a waist of 100 cm.
Airbus claims that its rival is sticking to the seat concept of the 1950s, when the average seat width of the newly baptized aircraft was lower.
Airbus says it has conducted research suggesting that extending the seat by 2.5 cm will improve sleep quality by 53 percent.
Boeing rejects Airbus's seat dimensions and says it is not within the jurisdiction of aircraft manufacturers to decide how airlines balance fees and equipment.
The company also says that research shows that the cabin experience depends on more than just the width of the seat.
"It's really about giving airlines flexibility and allowing them to do the things they believe they need to do to be successful," said cabin space expert Kent Craver.
They don't want us to dictate what's profitable for them.
They know their business better than anyone.
More elbow space is essential for passengers, but it is a growing problem for suppliers that can affect revenues.
Behind this dispute is a race to order aircraft with an estimated trade value of at least $700 billion in catalog prices in the coming decades, enough to steer the weight of American and European exports.
As Reuters reported in July, seat layout is exactly what drives the battle between the last planes.
Both Airbus and Boeing claim to achieve 20 percent better efficiency in their latest twin-engine long-haul aircraft designs than the market leader in this segment, the 365-seat Boeing 777-300ER.
Boeing's performance requirements depend in part on comparing the design of the 777X with 10 seats in a row and the 777 concept with 9 seats in a row.
Profit in unit costs is weakened compared to the 10-seat concept.
"The reason Boeing is doing this is to stock up on more seats and make its planes more competitive than our products," said Kevin Keniston, Airbus's head of passenger comfort for Europe.
On the other hand, analysts say that cabins with 10 seats in a row for the existing 777 models are in line with the fact that many passengers are in for a denser layout that can go hand in hand with lower fees.
"A 45-centimetre-wide seat would be great for passengers, but the reality is that from Airbus's business point of view, the design is motivated by the threat of the 777," said cabin interior expert Mary Kirby, founder and editor of runway girl network.
Airbus and Boeing do not deliver seats, but offer airlines a catalogue of suppliers to choose from.
Traveled aircraft dealers even carry a measuring band to check the competitive arrangements.
While boasting comfort, all manufacturers also offer high-dense aircraft for low-cost companies and regional travellers.
Airbus offers the A350 with 10 seats in a row, but says it hasn't sold it yet.
Until recently, Airbus emphasized the need for greater cabin modification by offering wider aisle seats on some of its aircraft.
Experts say that without the support of a single other manufacturer of large modern aircraft, the call for new industry standards will remain unedted, but may deter a wave of 777X sales.
CME will focus on the TV business.
They're going to release almost a quarter of the people.
The CME Media Group will be layoffs.
He wants to slim down by 1,000 people by the end of the year.
He's going to cut all the side business, and he just wants to focus on his core business, television.
The group, which owns Nova TV in the Czech Republic and also operates in Slovakia, Bulgaria, Romania, Croatia and Slovenia, employs a total of around 4,500 people.
Almost a quarter of people will lose their jobs.
The media group operates television in the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Bulgaria, Romania, Croatia and Slovenia.
Part of the CME is CET 21, which holds licenses for broadcasting television stations Nova, Nova Cinema, Nova Sport, Fanda, Smíchov, Telka and czech versions of the music station MTV.
How much the savings will affect the Czech Republic, where the group employs about 650 people, and what this will mean for the domestic TV nova number one, is not yet clear.
"This is premature and we cannot really comment on it," said Josef Koukolíček, Nova's director of communications.
According to information provided by MF DNES, significant redundancies will certainly not be avoided in the Czech Republic, but this should have by far the greatest impact on the staffing of CME branches in Romania and other countries.
The two new Nova bosses, Christoph Mainusch and Michael Del Nin, who succeeded longtime CEO Adrian Sarbu, said on a conference call with analysts Wednesday that they want to limit any activities that are not directly related to the TV business.
It is therefore quite likely that they will significantly reduce, in particular, the costs of producing their own programmes, filmmaking and production activities.
Google, Samsung and Huawei sued over Nortel patents
The group, which owns thousands of patents from the defunct Nortel, filed a patent infringement suit Thursday against mobile phone manufacturers, including Google, a company it over-liclicted in an auction as part of Nortel's bankruptcy.
Rockstar, which bought Nortel's patents for $4.5 billion, sued Samsung Electronics, HTC, Huawei and four other companies in U.S. District Court in Texas for patent infringement.
Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of violating seven patents.
Patents include technology that helps link terms searched online to the ad, the lawsuit states, which is at the heart of Google's search business.
Representatives for Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar could not immediately be reached.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC make phones that work on Google Android's operating system, which competes strongly with mobile products from Apple and Microsoft.
In 2011, Google made an initial bid of $900 million for Nortel patents.
Google increased its offer several times and eventually offered up to $4.4 billion.
After being defeated by Rockstar in the battle for Nortel patents, Google acquired Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, a deal motivated in part by Motorola's patent group.
"Despite the failure to obtain the patents at auction that are the subject of the dispute, Google has infringed and continues to infringe patents," the suit states.
Rockstar is seeking increased damages from Google because it claims that Google's patent infringement is intentional, as the lawsuit alleges.
George Kerevan: A divided Europe gives Scots a choice
Another day, another scary story about independence.
This time there is a warning that its accession to Schengen would be a condition for an independent Scotland's membership of the EU.
This gave rise to stories of passport controls in Berwick and barbed wire along Hadrian's Wall.
The truth is that strathclyde mentioned the possible economic benefits of free movement with the rest of Europe, but – as expected – this did not make the headlines.
No one has also mentioned that EU Member States spend a lot of time adapting their official laws, if that suits them.
Given that Scotland is not in Schengen now, offering continued inconsistencies would be a cheap concession to Brussels in return for whatever they really want from the Scots.
So it's a pretty weak story.
And so old, it became an excavation. I heard the press duck that "independence means passport controls" at least 40 years ago.
Yet there is an interesting thought in this bearded story.
Why should an independent Scotland be expected to listen to Europe in the first place?
Why trade the London tuft for the Brussels one, especially now?
This is the real European story: the great post-war plan to unite Europe has finally failed.
Due to the euro crisis, the so-called Project Europe is officially dead.
Across Europe, parties dedicated to opposition to the EU or the abolition of the euro as a common currency are gaining influence.
Even in Germany, the Eurosceptic Alternative for Germany party – founded this year – came out of the blue, snareing nearly five million votes in September's federal elections, essentially "taking" the Free Democrats (the equivalent of britain's Liberal Democrats) out of the Bundestag.
On home soil, there has always been opposition to the plan to create a federal Europe.
But the current economic crisis has become a defining moment.
The austerity dictated by Germany and the European Central Bank, together with the straitjacket on national economies by clinging to the common currency, has led many to believe that Project Europe has gone too far.
The euro crisis has little to do with national governments running a large budget deficit – this was true only in the case of Greece.
Rather, it is a euro system that blocks its members from exchange rates favorable to German exporters – something German politicians want to keep.
Without the possibility of devaluing the domestic currency, southern Europe has a disadvantage in terms of domestic production compared to Germany.
The only help is to cut revenues and public spending – as Germany encourages.
Behind the current problems with the budget and currency is a deeper cause of Europe's maladly performance.
As a result of the "green" energy policy supported by Brussels – code for supporting French and German firms at consumer expense – European industry pays twice as much for electricity and four times more for gasoline than in the United States.
This is a paralysing cost disadvantage, as we have already seen in the case of Grangemouth.
Even any pay freeze in the world would not avert a smourding of Europe's petrochemical industry with cheap US shale oil.
The result is a simmering rebellion, especially in France, once an enthusiastic supporter of the EU.
After the war, the political elite in France saw the EU as a tool to keep Germany in check and allow Paris to stand on Washington's level in the world.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a mark of political legitimacy, and it has pushed its own economic policy in Europe, leaving france's worn-out economy to its fate.
The result: Marine Le Pen's right wing, the anti-European National Front, has just won a crucial by-election, resuspending the ruling Socialists into third place.
With 24% of the vote, the front is now the most popular party in France – an early warning to British Labour that they cannot conclude that the splitting of the right will automatically translate positively on the left.
How does Le Pen handle her newfoil popularity among the white working class?
She would like to use next year's European elections to create an anti-European bloc across the European Parliament against the common currency.
If anti-European parties do well in this election, as is likely, such a bloc may dominate the European Parliament for the first time in its history.
It occurs to me that, in the foreseeable future, the growing anti-European feeling and attitude against the common currency will unite and the euro will be destroyed.
The EU will not disappear, but rather will turn into something freer in the sense of the "Europe of (sovereign) nations" preferred by General de Gaulle.
Germany and several of its satellite economies may retain the euro, but France and southern Europe will restore their own currencies.
I expect the UK to distance itself from this project and join the United States.
But Washington's increased interest in the Pacific suggests that Britain will be left to the Atlantic cold.
And where will Scotland be?
We can choose to be an area (basically) of Little England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests – this includes the possibility of notifying Berlin and Brussels when to leave us alone.
I suppose Scotland would do well in a relaxed order of Europe, provided it preserved its own currency.
Cooperation with other like-minded countries would be easier in a non-federal Europe of nations.
Otherwise, we should take an example from Norway and keep our economic independence.
The SNP government in Scotland is – oddly enough – the most successful non-austerity political movement in Europe, which won by a large majority in 2011 thanks to its opposition to cuts planned (and implemented) by Labour Chancellor Alistair Darling and subsequent coalitions of Conservatives and Liberal Democrats.
It would be ridiculous if Scotland now voted for independence just to adopt the austerity measures dictated by Berlin and Brussels.
Parents of intersex children can choose 'indeterminate sex'
Germany has become the first European nation to recognise the third sex in children born with ambiguous sexual tracts.
Newborn babies will no longer be categored only as male or female.
The new law does not require parents to list any gender for such children, and allows them to list the sex as "indeterminate" or "unspecified" on their birth certificates.
The law aims to stop pressuring parents to rush their child into gender-determining surgery and to combat discrimination against those who are intersex.
According to the BBC, one intersex person said after many years: "I am neither a man nor a woman."
I'm going to stay a slayer created by doctors, bruised and scarred.
It is estimated that every year out of 2,000 babies, one is born, neither a boy nor a girl.
They are intersex, part of a group of about 60 facts that fall within the diagnosis of sexual development disorders, an umbrella term for those who have atypical chromosomes, sex glands (ovaries or testicles) or unusually developed genitalia.
Wallis Simpson could have been intersex.
Gender determination is not yet fully understood, but most experts in the United States say that when gender cannot be determined, it is better to use the best available information and determine it, instead of waiting and monitoring the psychological and physical development of the child until the operation is performed, if at all.
Dr. Jack Drescher, a New York psychiatrist who specializes in gender issues, said the new German law "seems like a good thing."
Intersex children present an ethical dilemma.
"Some people are in a life-threatening condition that requires surgery, but most children don't," he said.
Gender determination can be done without surgery, and then you can wait to see how the identity develops.
Knowing how a child develops gender is not very accurate.
No one can answer the question of why this is happening.
It's like a mystery why some people are gay.
A report to the European Committee in 2011 described intersex people as distinct from transgender or transgender people, because their status is not gender-related, but their biological structure, which is not exclusively male or female, but typically consists of both and cannot be clearly defined as either.
These features can manifest themselves in secondary sexual characteristics, such as muscle volume, hair growth, bust and physique, in primary sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genital tract, or in the structure of chromosomes and hormones.
The report also provides an overview of the discrimination experienced by intersex and transgender people in the work area, as well as levels of harassment, violence and prejudice.
Boys who don't match any gender now have a special camp.
Australia and Nepal already allow adults to mark male, female or "third sex" in official documents.
Norrie May-Welby, a 52-year-old Australian, became the world's first recognized "genderless" person in June when she won a court appeal to keep her "indeterminate" gender status for the rest of her life.
According to the Ministry of the Interior, german passports will have a third designation, X, in addition to M (male) and F (female), for intersex persons.
In neighboring France, according to a news report on France 24, gender issues are still controversial.
In 2011, dozens of French legislators from this heavily Catholic country signed a petition to remove the "gender theory" from school textbooks.
Catholic online, an American website, also commented on the German law, writing, "As the world is dragged into a new state, where gender is a matter of choice but sexual activity is not, we are turning two other pillars of civilization upside down."
One mother of a newborn from Maryland also told the Baby Zone that she would rather see children assigned sex at birth.
"Parenting itself is stressful without further restrictions, especially if you don't know the sex of your child," she told the parental care website.
Children need stability and security.
Historically, children with both male and female sexes have been called hermaphrodites, after a handsome Greek who had a dual sex.
And about a decade ago, the medical community thought that gender was like a blackboard that could be erased and redrawn.
But now many are questioning the ethical basis of the operation, saying that gender is a complex matter, and doctors can sometimes make the wrong choice because they don't know how children will feel when they grow up.
"In the mid-20th century, it was called a psychiatric emergency," Drescher said.
When these babies were born, you didn't call a psychiatrist, you called a surgeon.
The lingering theory on how to treat children with ambiguous sex was put forward by Dr. John Money at Johns Hopkins University, who argued that gender is malleable.
He created a new concept of "gender identity" and argued that the social causes and influences of the environment – how parents raised their child – affected children's genes and hormones and shaped the child, regardless of whether they were identified as male or female.
But in one 1966 case, known as "John/Joan," his theory became questionable.
He advised the parents of a boy whose penis was damaged due to poor circumcision to have his child completely neutered, his testicles removed and raised as a girl.
"The media presented this case as a successful case of transformation, but the reality was different," Drescher said.
When the boy was 15 years old, he had surgery back into a boy and married a woman.
At the age of 38, however, he committed suicide.
Drescher said that some doctors "use this model" to this day.
But in the 1990s, with the advent of the Internet, survivors of these operations appeared "dissatisfied with the outcome."
This was also the case with Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana who was born with male chromosomes but an ambiguous genital system.
Doctors were unsure whether he had a large clitoris or a small penis, and were convinced that as a man he could never live a "satisfactory life."
And so, shortly after his birth in 1976, Bruce's external organs and testicles were surgically removed and he was raised a girl.
At the age of 12, he got female hormones.
"I knew I wasn't a girl," he told ABCNews.com.
I was unhappy, but it was very hard to ask.
At 18, he was sent for vagina surgery.
But because he was depressed and knew something was wrong, he asked for medical records.
What he found was terrifying.
I was sterilized after I was born, and no one ever told me anything.
Bruce was born with a gender development disorder (DSD) that prevented the body from producing enough testosterone to properly develop its genital tract.
After learning the truth, he turned back into a man, took testosterone doses and had his bust removed,
The surgeries caused his infertility.
Today, he represents others in an organization called interface project and tries to normalize the perception of those who are intersex.
But Anne Tamar-Mattis, director of california-based legal group Advocates for Informed Choice, fears that german law "calls for branding and stigma."
"Many activists fear that German law will encourage parents to make a quick decision and choose 'vague' for the child," she said.
We're afraid it'll encourage intervention.
We believe that it is better to assign a male or female sex and then wait.
But we don't know how the law will ultimately sound, so all we can do is speculate.
Tamar-Mattis said her organization supports Australian law because it "allows adults to choose to be included in the third sex."
"Adults should be able to make their own decisions about the legally valid gender," she said.
German law is going to assign it at birth.
This is a battle that a small child should not seduce at this point.
When they grow up, they can make their own decisions about their own bodies.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a chest radiologist from Pittsburgh who has a daughter with a sexual developmental disorder and helps hundreds of others in a support group, said the German law would "grant powers" to both parents and children.
Baratz's daughter, Katie, was born with male chromosomes, but has a DSD called androgens numbness syndrome.
Because her androgenic receptors are defective, Katie developed feminine traits.
She has a vagina, but she doesn't have a uterus and ovaries.
Katie, now 29, is married and is an intern in child psychiatry as part of her studies at the University of Pennsylvania.
Although infertile, she hopes to become a parent through adoption or surrogacy.
"The law will give parents some room not to rush their decision," Baratz said.
It gives them time to run certain tests and change their mind, and it gives them time to write "man" or "woman."
In this regard, everything is fine – you raise and love your child.
You have an amazing child and you rejoice in it.
You don't have to rush an operation that's irreversible.
"It gives the child the opportunity to be involved in decision-making and it take away the anxiety that binds parents because they are not sure they are doing the right thing," she said.
Eventually, the child decides which gender they identify with more – and that's a great thing.
It gives children the power to make their own decisions.
The bird was airlifted from a drilling rig in the North Sea and released back into the wild
The bird was brought ashore after being found exhausted on an oil rig in the Black Sea and released back into the wild.
One of the ascails was flown by helicopter to Aberdeen last month after being treated by the Scottish SPCA at a rescue centre until he recovered.
Operations centre Colin Seddon said: "This asobeer was probably migrating from northern Europe when it was caught in strong winds over the North Sea."
Apparently, he's out of strength and found refuge on an oil rig.
Mr Seddon added: "He was unable to take off again, so they contacted us asking for help."
By the time the aser was released, he was in good shape and well.
Znojmo begins stadium reconstruction
At the beginning of November, the reconstruction of the football stadium will begin in Znojmo.
On Thursday, the stadium was taken over by the builders, who will reconstruct the lawn.
The reconstruction of the municipal stadium in Znojmo is divided into four stages to meet the standards for the first football league.
Karel Drábek: Uhlířský vrch - one of our youngest volcanoes.
Uhlířský vrch is a striking hill 3 km southeast of Bruntál.
Together with several others, it is evidence of volcanic activity in Low Jeseník at a time (from a geological point of view) recent.
The last eruptions were still here at the beginning of the quarter-mountain.
Viewed from a distance, the white plastered Baroque pilgrimage church of Our Lady of Auxiliary, built between 1755 and 1765, is conspicuously on top of Uhlířský Hill.
He replaced the original wooden pilgrimage chapel.
The inn next to the church was not well-tedusted.
Shortly after the church was finished, an outlying of four rows of linden trees, about 1 km long, was planted.
The Cross Road on Uhlířské vrch is the third version, the original one stood here after 1916, the second, from 2001 it lasted only until 2004.
At fifteen stops there are wooden sculptures made by local art carver František Nedomlel.
He used various types of trees from the Area of Low Jeseník.
Similarly, pedetes made of rocks from the area form an interesting geological exposice.
Each stop also shows the name of the sponsor.
Coal Hill is the remnant of a young volcano.
Although the data from radiometric measurements of age vary somewhat, the last eruption here was about 1.5 million years ago.
It is therefore younger than The Great Roudný (age 3.3 million years) and older than Venus's volcano (age 0.8 million years).
The volcano was born by an explosion.
In it, it cast out a considerable amount of volcanic ash, along with fragments of rock from the subsoil, which by burning it acquired a reddish-brown color.
At the end of this phase, lava flowed to the surface - today it is a layer of porous bumble state up to 13 meters powerful.
The second eruption effahed red, brownish-red, and in places black tuffs.
Their layer is powerful up to 50 meters, and part of it is accessible in the wall of the quarry.
In the tuffs, volcanic bombs are up to 1 meter in size, and the second eruption was ended by an outpouring of lava.
At the end of the activity, lava flowed out of the volcano, which today forms up to 50 m thick layer of slag-like bumble state.
Volcanoes where volcanic ash effluent alternates with lava flows are the most common type of volcanoes.
Because they're actually composed of layers, they've been named stratovolcanas.
The original volcanic cone was gradually subjected to erosion.
However, it was endangered only by the mining of rocks in the quarry on the south side.
The most intensive mining took place here from 1953 to 1962.
Tufu were added to the concrete, which was then lighter and had better thermal insulation properties.
Mining was stopped under pressure from experts and the public, thus preserving this unique place.
However, the problem is in the porousness and small cohesion of the rocks, which quickly wind up, crumble and slope down the slope.
The quarry disappears quite quickly.
To complicate things even more complicated, the warm, south-facing slope is an ideal place for some rare species of plants and animals.
The remedy is therefore problematic, but over time it will be necessary to select and maintain a characteristic geological profile.
It's nothing new, similar profiles are maintained in a number of important locations.
You can reach Uhlířský Vrch via a green hiking trail from Bruntál or Silesian Kočov.
Motorists can use the free parking at the beginning of the linden park, where a short educational trail begins.
A drunk poured gasoline all over the house: He threatened to set it on fire with his own family!
Tensions increased, fear escalated.
The man threatened to set the whole house on fire.
All available police patrols in the area, as well as a fire brigade from Mladá Boleslav and a unit of the volunteer fire brigade, went to the scene.
A police negotiator arrived at the scene, trying to talk the man out of his irrational behavior.
The man continued to threaten to set the house on fire.
A task force had to enter the house and disarmed and handcuffed the man.
The aggressor then ended up in the Mladoboleslav hospital for examination, from where he was transferred to an anti-police rescue station.
Firefighters eventually buried the house dosed with gasoline with sorbent, which they later cleaned up.
In addition to people, all pets were rescued from the house.
The man didn't give a go to the police negotiator, so a commando went after him.
Anger over Bali bombing verdict
Survivors and relatives of the 202 people killed in the 2002 Bali bombing reacted angrily to the verdict handed down on the last of the plotting to be brought to justice, saying that Umar Patek should have been executed.
Patek, who spent nearly 10 years on the run as one of Southeast Asia's most wanted, was yesterday sentenced to 20 years in prison for building explosive devices that were used in the bombing.
He could be paroled in 15 years.
The 45-year-old man was found guilty of mass murder in an attack on two nightclubs in the popular tourist area of Kuta that left 202 people dead, including 88 Australians, and many injured.
He was also found guilty on several other terrorism-related charges, including a series of bombings of churches in Indonesia on Christmas Eve 2000.
The prosecution demanded life in prison, although it could have insisted that a man nicknamed "Demolition man" (crasher) should be given the death penalty because of his reputation as an explosives expert.
The decision revived the painful memories of June Corteen, a Perth mother who lost her 39-year-old twins Jane and Jenny in a devastating attack launched by Patek and other plotators nearly a decade ago.
With tears in her eyes, she said Patek should have been sentenced to death.
I really think he should follow in the footsteps of the others.
For AAP, Ms Corteen said: "He should be put in front of a firing squad."
Every day I have to live with not seeing more grandchildren and my daughters.
The Sari Club was flattened when a powerful truck was detonated shortly after 11pm on October 12, 2002.
Peter Hughes was at paddy's bar, where just 20 seconds earlier, a suicide bomber detonated a backpack filled with explosives.
As a result of the explosion, he fell into a coma for a month, and while he was kept alive, he "died" three times to doctors.
Mr Hughes said Pateka should face the same fate as the three other members of the Jamaat-iya terrorist cell responsible for the massacre – Amrozi, Muscat and Imam Samudra – who were executed four years ago.
This guy should get the death penalty like nobody else.
Keeping him alive... There's no reason to keep him alive.
Getting 20 years for killing 202 people and injuring hundreds more isn't that good.
Patek was the last of the Bali bombers to stand trial.
He avoided arrest for nearly a decade, but was finally captured in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where, less than four months later, AMERICAN forces killed former Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden.
During the trial, an FBI agent said in his testimony that intelligence reports revealed that Patek was in Pakistan to meet with bin Laden in an effort to reconnect with Southeast Asian terrorist groups and Al Qaeda.
"He didn't give up voluntarily," Mrs. Corteen said.
To this day, he has not felt sorry for how much grief he has caused others.
The verdict comes ahead of the 10th anniversary of the attack later this year, which will include ceremonies in Bali and Australia.
"We're going to see a lot of tears this year," Mrs. Corteen said.
Patek can still appeal the verdict.
Pope Francis appoints first cardinals in February
The Vatican announced on Thursday that Pope Francis will appoint new cardinals of the Catholic Church for the first time on February 22.
Cardinals are the highest position in the clergy of the Catholic Church after the Pope, and they are the ones who elect the Pope, so Francis will appoint his first group of men who will eventually help choose his successor.
There are now 201 cardinals.
But once the cardinal reaches the age of 80, he can no longer participate in the election of the Pope – the group shrinks to 120 electing cardinals.
In a statement announcing the report, the Rev. Federico Lombardi, a Vatican spokesman, said that a gathering of current cardinals known as the consistrium would be held before the ceremonial promotion of the new cardinals.
"Pope Francis has decided to communicate his decision to convene the February consul in advance in order to facilitate the planning of other assemblies that require the participation of cardinals from different parts of the world," Lombardi said.
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said the number of cardinals voting is likely to fall by February.
He said the Pope usually appoints as many cardinals as it takes to increase the number of electors again to 120, and as many cardinals over the age of 80 as he wants.
Next year's consul will be significant because it will be the first since Francis was elected in March of this year, Valero said.
At the moment, there is a certain focus on Europe and, above all, Italy.
"It will be interesting to see if the new Pope nominates cardinals from the rest of the world to restore balance," he said.
Forty percent of Roman Catholics are in South America, but they have only a tiny number of cardinals.
It will also be the first choice of cardinals since Francis appointed the Council of Cardinals, a group of eight cardinals from around the world to find ways to reform the church.
In the past, the Pope made all his own decisions.
"Now Francis has chosen these eight cardinals to help him," Valero said.
He said it was "quite possible" that the Pope would ask these cardinals for advice.
But we haven't been in this situation before – it's completely new.
Valero said popes have traditionally e-ed bishops from large places as cardinals, but Francis is "full of surprises -- so we don't know who he's going to appoint."
Land Rover series announced
The interior features racing seats and six-point seat belts, as well as intercom equipment.
There are improved brakes, a service package providing access to Bowler Works mechanics, logistical support and storage of the vehicle between races.
Drew Bowler, technical director of Bowler Motorsport, said: "The race participants coming to Bowler have changed."
Not everyone is an experienced racer, but they are people who want excitement and adventure, as well as an achievable path to world-class races.
We are happy to offer them this journey in cooperation with Land Rover and MSA, and we believe that this format offers a new way to experience different racing disciplines in Britain and overseas, and that it will prepare competitors for the hardness and reality of Rally Raid races.
We really enjoyed developing the Defender Challenge – it's going to be a really exciting competition.
In addition, the Defender Challenge will offer a training and testing day in February, as well as the opportunity to compete in desert races in North Africa and the Middle East.
Living legend Wayne Shorter closes next week's Strings of Autumn
Saxophone great and jazz legend Wayne Shorter will make a dot next Wednesday for the 18th annual Strings of Autumn festival.
Shorter will perform at the Lucerna Grand Hall on November 6, along with his quartet of Danilo Perez, John Patitucci and Brian Blade.
In the second half of the evening, Shorter will be joined by a spontaneous jazz improvisation of PKF - Prague Philharmonia under the direction of Martin Kumžák.
Shorter's adaptations for the symphony orchestra will also features Pegasus from the new album Without A Net, as well as his earlier compositions Lotus and Prometheus Unbound.
Although he celebrated his 80th birthday this August, Shorter is still full of strength, as evidenced by the fact that the Prague concert on Strings of Autumn will kick off his world tour.
Wayne Shorter entered the world of music more than sixty years ago.
The list of performers he has worked with ranges from Miles Davis to Herbie Hancock, Joni Mitchell to Carlos Santana.
On his musical journey, he also met Czech musician Miroslav Vitouš and Viennese-born Joe Zawinul, with whom they set the course for a new fusion style in the legendary Weather Report for more than a decade.
For the past thirteen years, he has performed mainly with the Wayne Shorter Quartet.
There will also be a club night Spotlight after the festival, which will take place on November 9 at the Roxy/NoD Club.
In addition to charismatic singer Andrea Triana, manchester trio Go Go Penguin will be introduced to the domestic audience with their jazz-influenced electronics and young jazz talent Ian Mikyska, who will bring an electro-jazz formation Profound Bass inspired by dance styles.
Secret wars: Syria, Libya and Iran.
Training Obama on how to bomb Syria.
American commandos in Libya.
TOP GUN in the Persian Gulf.
The Israelis have demonstrated exactly what bombing Syria should look like.
Without unnecessary hype, threats and millions of statements, they sent planes, they hit the target and came back.
Without being lulled into official chemical weapons removal in Syria.
They refuse to confirm the whole operation and do not comment on it again.
The exact opposite of a confused and large-scale, actions unsupsupcted by Obama's Syria policy.
And the most satisfying thing about the whole attack was what the Israelis bombed.
Don't be ermed by the media's claims that a "Syrian base" or "supplies for Hezbollah" were bombed.
I recently wrote here that while US aid to the country's secular rebels remains rhetorical, Russia cheerfully continues to supply Weapons to Syria.
And it was the fresh delivery of Russian missiles unloaded at the port of Latakia that was the target of an Israeli airstrike.
A clear message.
And note that Israel has once again bombed the Assad regime, not the rebels, although popular internet theories say it should be the other way around.
The U.S. government has honored two members of the Sacial Force, presumably the Delta Force.
It was not known until now that they had distinguished themselves during the attack on the American consulate in Benghazi.
The heroic deaths of two former SEALs who defended the CIA compound in the city are known, in my opinion, to be members of a secret CIA commando made up of former soldiers.
There has long been speculation about what the SEALs were doing at the consulate or even at the CIA residence located elsewhere.
It's clearer now.
In any case, the information that the CIA has its offices in Libya protected by machine-gun nests (on one of these, both SEALs died after being hit by a mortar) is quite surprising.
But even more surprising is the information about the two hitherto unknown heroes.
They were part of an American commando in Tripoli, and as soon as they received the news of the Benghazi attack, they volunteered to intervene and, together with five private contractors, shot their way into the CIA compound in Benghazi.
The Obama administration is blessed with the fact that during the attack, the commando was not deployed officially and in its entirete, and that there was simply hesitation about what to do.
Commando commander, without orders, will probably release these volunteers.
Anyway, the fact that there are not one-time, but permanently American commandos, CIA agents, and private contractors in the country is quite interesting information.
This is because, until recently, no such thing was officially acknowledged, and even now there is talk of a sort of NATO advisory mission in Libya.
But it is a good thing that the US, even if it is half-heartedly trying to combat terrorism in Libya.
Although it would take much more help to resolve the national situation.
The last place of secret and permanent conflict I want to write about today is the coast of Iran.
Not so long ago, the media almost praised the Iranian Air Force for prosecuting American drones.
But little is known about how americans effectively protect their drones.
Of course, if we happen to be able to discover your drone in airspace, there's nothing we can do about it.
But if an Iranian drone is discovered in international space, the situation is quite different.
And so it came to be that an Iranian F-4 Phantom was pursuing an American drone in international airspace over the sea, perhaps the first sharp deployment of an American F-22 Raptor super fighter in history.
He snackled the Phantom to visually verify his armament without phantom registering him on radar or simply noticing him, and then when he suddenly showed up at his house and asked the Iranian pilot to return home, he listened without grumbling.
No wonder the Phantom is an American-made aircraft that remembers the Vietnam War.
He can't compare to the Raptor.
Court blocks NY Police Department's stop-and-frisp procedure
A federal appeals court on Thursday blocked a court order requiring changes to the New York Police Department's stop-and-friction program and removed the judge from the case.
A second U.S. appeals court said Judge Shira Scheindlin's decision would be postponed pending an appeal filed by the city.
A judge ruled in August that the city violated the Constitution by implementing its stop-and-interview program.
The city attacked its conclusions and its remediable regulations, including the decision to assign oversight to help the police department change its procedures and its training program associated with them.
The appeals court heard arguments on Tuesday for the requested postponement.
The appeals court said the judge must be removed from the case because she conflicted with the judge's code of conduct by not acting as a judge to avoid the appearance of bias, in part because of a series of media interviews and public statements in which she openly responded to the court's criticism.
A judge ruled that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people by wrongfully targeting blacks and Hispanics as part of their stop-and-fries program.
It established an independent watchdog to oversee major changes, including reform of procedures, training and supervision, and ordered the launch of a pilot programme to test body-worn cameras in some areas where people are most frequently stopped.
In August, the city of New York agreed to end the method of storing the names and addresses of people whose cases were dismissed after a police search.
An oral justification for the city's appeal is scheduled sometime after March 14, 2014.
The stop-and-frisp tactics have been criticised by a number of civil rights defenders.
In some form, stop-and-frised has existed for decades, but recorded searches under independent Mayor Michael Bloomberg dramatically rose to a record high of 684,330 in 2011, mostly blacks and Hispanics.
In 2004, four men, all of whom are minorities, filed a lawsuit that became a class-action case.
Proponents of changes to the NYPD's stop-and-frisparation program argue that the changes will end unfair practices, increase the credibility and effectiveness of the police force, and may affect how other police departments use these practices.
Opponents argue that the changes will reduce police morale, but not crime, and that it will waste money, but it will not solve the broader problem of police force being under pressure after its numbers have fallen by several thousand over the past decade.
The judge noted that she did not end the practice of stopping and searching people, which is constitutional, but reformed the way the NYPD introduced searches.
CDC issues guidelines for schools on allergy in children
On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a set of guidelines to help with children's food allergies at school.
This is the first set of such guidelines issued by the US government, due to the increasing number of school-age children suffering from food allergies.
One in 20 children in the United States has a food allergy.
The CDC found that the incidence of food allergies in children increased by 18 percent between 1997 and 2007.
The guidelines provide information for schools on how to notify teachers and staff about childhood food allergies and how to respond to an allergic reaction if it occurs.
They also recommend that schools have adrenaline at their disposal – the epipen automatic injector is most commonly used – to be able to respond to potentially life-threatening hypersensitivity.
State legislatures recently updated rules that allow schools to store adrenaline more easily.
The report also contains a list of typical symptoms occurring in conversations with children who have an allergic reaction.
A child can say, "It's like someone's sticking in my tongue," "I feel like I have hair on my tongue" or "My tongue itches."
How Tipsport (not)deletes personal data.
More than a year ago, I registered on Tipsport.cz website.
However, I did not finish it afterwards, because someone who could not complete the registration from the Internet was sitting at the branch.
And because I didn't want to go to another branch, my registration failed, then I moved, and as a result, my address and id number changed.
When I wanted to complete the registration later, I was told that I could not do it because I have a different OP number, address and that I simply cannot complete it and that I should request the deletion of the data and make a new registration.
So I did, and on October 24, 2013, I wrote to technical support that I was requesting that all my personal data be deleted from the database under the applicable data protection law.
On that day, technical support wrote to me to complete the registration at the branch.
This started a marathon of technical support emails, where they eventually wrote after 4/25/10 that they had deleted the personal data at my request.
So you'd think you could do the new registration, and here the problems started again first it wrote to me that my username is already occupied (I understand it wasn't deleted - it's not personal data, but in the end they also disabled this).
So I used a different username and it popped up that my personal data was already stored to complete the registration at the branch (how can they store something they claim to have deleted?), so I contacted technical support again.
When asked how this is possible, they wrote back that they actually deleted the personal data on October 25th and to send an email with the error.
I did this (yesterday around 3.22pm) and to which I was written back today that I registered on the same day (31.10.2013) at 1.22pm and that this is why I cannot because I used the same name and date of birth.
What does it matter that I have been contacting technical support for a week and dealing with them that it is still not possible.
What if what he claims (as it isn't) is true, no one with the same name or date of birth could register if this is already registered.
By the way, at 1.22pm I actually registered, to the same name and date of birth, but I used a made-up email and phone number and the world wondered, a page appeared to me that they sent me a link to email to complete the registration.
But how is it possible if you can't register for the same name and date of birth?
Probably because Tipsport ties registration to an email and phone number, and he just didn't disable the data as he claims.
So again, I told technical support that they are simply lying (either deliberately or do not know what they are writing) because what they are writing is not true.
I've demonstrated several screens that the registration problem was already before 31.10.
Tipsport wrote me a blunt sentence for that- I'm sorry, but since you're registered again, we can't verify your claim.
And he ended the communication.
Or it repeats the same sentence over and over again that registration is tied to the name and date of birth.
They can't even accept the fact that the registration wasn't completed by clicking on the link in the email, and so it didn't actually take place.
In summary, Tipsport not only hasn't deleted the data as it claims, but is still lying when it claims otherwise.
What's even worse is that it's easy to prove how they lie and try to make it look like the customer's fault is on the customer's side.
By the way, after the introduction of this matter on my personal blog, things got a little moving and from Technical Support came an email that they are handing over the matter for review and I will be informed (after a week of urgenation and haggling and notification of the same error).
We're sorry to kill, but we're innocent, Khmer Reds officials say
Nuon Chea was number two in the Khmer Rouge hierarchy and Khieu Samphan is a former head of state.
More than three million Cambodians, at least a quarter of the population at the time, lost their lives as a result of exhaustion, hunger, disease, torture and executions under the Khmer Rouge, which relied on a mixture of Maoism and nationalism from 1975 to 1979.
In 2010, the International Criminal Tribunal for Cambodia handed this commander of the infamous S-21 prison a life sentence.
Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan are accused of genocide and crimes against humanity, including torture, enslavement and murder.
Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan defended themselves by believing they were acting in the best interests of the nation and had no idea what the true scale of the killings was.
"It's easy to say that I should have known everything, understood everything, and therefore intervened and corrected the situation," Khieu Samphan said in court on Thursday.
Do you really think I wanted this to happen to my people?
The reality is that I had no authority," he added.
Nuon Chea said he never ordered Khmer Rouge cadres to "treat people badly or kill them to deny them food or commit genocide."
But he acknowledged "moral responsibility" for the dead.
"I would like to sincerely apologize to the public, the victims, their families, all the Cambodian people," he said.
Bin Sivla, 55, who lost 11 relatives under the Khmer Rouge regime, told AFP she could not accept Nuon Che's apology."
"He lied to us."
"He just wants to be acquitted."
"He doesn't care about others," she said.
"If he hadn't given orders, his subordinates wouldn't have killed," she added, adding that the Khmer Rouge leaders were "worse than monsters."
Ieng Sara, the "foreign minister" of the Khmer Rouge regime, was also due to stand trial, but he died in March this year.
His wife, Ieng Thirith, then Minister of Social Affairs, was found incapable of trial by a court in September 2012 due to dementia.
Khmer Rouge leader Pol Pot died in 1998.
Fantastic ice cream that shines in the dark?
A British businessman made the first ice cream to shine in the dark – using jellyfish.
Charlie Francis took advantage of the fluorescent properties of this marine animal and developed a luminous treat.
He came up with the idea when he read a scientific paper on jellyfish and persuaded scientists in China to chemically produce a protein that causes light-edging.
This ice cream reacts with the consumer's tongue – it increases the pH level of the protein and subsequently causes its radiation.
Chris says that ice cream shines when it reacts with the warmth of your mouth, which is why the more you lick, the brighter it shines.
Charlie, founder of ice cream company "Lick me I'm delicious" (lick me, I taste great), says: "It's an amazing fabric, but in terms of production, we're at the beginning, so for £200 you get about 2g of this fabric."
The protein we use in ice cream reacts with your tongue at a neutral pH.
So as your mouth warms up the protein, the pH level increases and the ice cream begins to shine.
We've been testing it over the last few months and it seems like a great idea to celebrate Halloween as it causes this fantastic radiant effect.
It's probably the most expensive ice cream I've ever made, because jellyfish light is four times more expensive than gold.
And so each hill costs me about £140.
But it tastes delicious.
Charlie's experimental company, based in Bristol, is known for its unconventional flavors of beer, cheese, beef and gold leaves.
But its next product is supposed to be even more ambitious.
He says, "I really wish I could make invisible ice cream."
In essence, this is impossible because of the quarry of light caused by the ice crystals that make up the ice cream, but I'm counting on us to find some way to do it.
Ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of jellyfish, artificially made by Chinese scientists.
Ski resorts want to make it cheaper for families with children
Oil price further plummets to $96 a barrel
The price of oil continued to fall on Friday as concerns about high inventories were offset by a report that showed a strengthening of China's energy-supply manufacturing sector.
The U.S. benchmark for December delivery fell 14 cents to $96.24 a barrel in European electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
On Thursday, the decline was 39 cents, and for October it fell 5.8 percent.
The rich oil reserves have been burdening the price in recent weeks.
The Energy Department said Wednesday that U.S. inventories increased by 4.1 million barrels last week.
In five weeks, stocks have increased by more than 25 million barrels.
On Friday, however, two reports on Chinese manufacturing showed an incentive for more demand, showing growth in activity.
This suggests that China's economic recovery could continue to strengthen after growth that had recovered to 7.8 percent in the third quarter after two weak decades.
Brent crude, also used by U.S. refiners, fell 26 cents to $108.58 a barrel on the International Trade Exchange in London.
Martin Doctor on problems with oh in Sochi: Communication with Russians is difficult
The corners of his mouth indicate a slight smile, and then he just breathes deep, "It's challenging."
According to Martin Doctor, cooperation with the organizing team of the Sochi 2014 Olympics is a little more complicated.
We can forget about what happened at the last Olympics.
"Nothing works the same," says the head of the Czech Olympic mission.
What exactly is going on?
Many things work slower and not so precisely.
It's kind of confusing.
In terms of invoices, they are relatively fast, not so fast in terms of supplying information on fundamental things.
Maybe we've been prying out of them for three months to tell us how individual villages will be officially designated so that we can do a whole range of things accordingly.
We're still waiting, and they keep saying they're communicating with this thing.
They're still communicating in a lot of things.
Is the Olympic village at least finished?
But it's not a catastrophic situation anymore.
A month ago, we were walking around empty rooms.
Fortunately, the houses are standing.
What does it mean they're empty?
Do you need finished floors?
Just basic concrete, that's what the condition was a month ago.
But they still have time.
Although there is a danger that when we get there on January 26 as vanguard, it will still smell of glue.
And if they don't make it, what will it be?
President Putin, do you think, would he drive an army there?
That's exactly how it's going to turn out.
Just so it's not that the Olympic village = the villages of Potemkin.
Rather, they risk not being able to modify the paths, for example, they do not finish the details.
Maybe their roads will be in such a state that we'll have to bring our london games boots with us.
But I believe they're going to put it together somehow.
How many Czech athletes could go to Sochi?
Now there are about 78, although that number varies depending on the nomination criteria.
Maybe the figure skaters will probably ride in the trio they went out in.
No one has to doubt the speed skater Martina Sáblíková, but otherwise it is in development.
Are you still going to Sochi?
No, if nothing happens, I shouldn't go there until January 26th.
We know what the houses in the Olympic village will look like.
We even measured some things ourselves on the subway so we wouldn't just believe the sketches.
We are also preparing a number of other things, including transport.
And what's the head of mission doing 100 days before the Olympics?
I am preparing for the annual evaluation of individual Olympic sports plus I am doing a normal agenda in terms of communication with the Organizing Committee in Sochi.
Place post-election sirloin post-election goulash
The October elections, rather than the winners, brought a bunch of losers.
It is not only the parties that did not even get into the Chamber of Deputies (e.g. SPOZ), but also the previous ruling parties (ODS, TOP 09) and, finally, the ČSSD due to their internal divisions.
Instead of festive sirloin, politicians served us post-election goulash over the weekend.
Andrej Babiš's movement, which promised voters to change the current political style of governance, became an election jumper.
The fragmentation of the electoral result and the split in the winning party are playing into the political (z)will of President Miloš Zeman, regardless of the wishes of voters who did not even elect the party that President Zeman publicly supported to the Chamber of Deputies.
While the president has lost a strategic lead over other politicians due to an unpleasant event, he still has a few ways to win it back - for example, by choosing a future prime minister.
While the ČSSD is moving away from the chances of winning the prime ministership in my eyes, entrepreneurs Andrej Babiš are getting closer.
Post-election developments are still miles away from the early and smooth formation of a stable government, but compared to the pre-election scenario of the communist-backed left-wing ČSSD government, this development is better news for business in the Czech Republic and thus for the economy.
Due to the vocal opposition of ANO to get together with the ODS or TOP 09, the most likely option is still the coalition of ČSSD, ANO and KDU-ČSL (a total of 111 members).
Due to the split in the ČSSD, which has thus become an unreadable and weak parterer in the negotiations, the outcome of the coalition negotiations can be quite daunting for the ČSSD.
The minority government of the ČSSD composed of "non-Zemans" in the Castle is unlikely to pass.
Moreover, any government in which the ČSSD will participate will be threatened by the unsatisfactory ambitions of many Social Democrats, which may sooner or later lead to further divisions in the party.
So I ask myself, "Are we not going to have another early election?"
Another election would be more of a referendum on the strength of the YES movement's electoral mandate.
Čssd's plans for the introduction of sectoral taxes, more significant increases in income taxes or the construction of a state bank have hopefully fallen under the table.
On the contrary, ČSSD, ANO, KDU-ČSL and Dawn agree, for example, on promoting entrepreneurship, austerity fiscal policy (government deficit below 3% of GDP), promoting employment of disadvantaged people, reducing the lower VAT rate on selected goods.
Friction areas are most present in terms of social policy and the size of the state.
YES now has the upper hand, so the program of the most likely coalition so far IS YES, ČSSD, KDU-ČSL would be leaning more to the right.
Which, from my point of view, is ultimately a better outcome than a left-wing tax program for everything that's still moving in the economy.
Until recently, it seemed that the majority of citizens in the Czech Republic wanted early elections.
Corruption, squandering money on overpriced purchases and government contracts, tax increases and, last but not least, government scandals have been cited as reasons.
According to the results of the elections, it can be concluded that the majority of citizens were comfortable with this situation.
That they didn't really mind, and they were actually satisfied with the state that was there (the theft and indebtedness of this state).
Otherwise, I cannot explain that 3,413,497 voters did not show up for the election, 596,357 voters voted TOP 09,384,174 voters voted ods total, so 4,394,028 actually supported the original governing coalition, which represents 52.16% of all rightful voters.
Which is an out-of-half majority.
If I add 1,016,829 CSSD voters to the above parties, then with the old order (because all the parties involved in the "theft" and indebtedness of this state), then 64.23% of the rightful voters actually agreed with this state of affairs.
In fact, a majority of voters have made it clear that they are not in a way to punish the culprits of the state's stealth and over-indemnation.
Or do you think that the members of the ČSSD who participated in this will push for the appropriate laws?
Is he even going to help us?
Olomouc opens a public ice rink in the historic centre
Pavel Spálený, organizer of olomouc Christmas markets and winter skating, said that preparatory work on the ice rink started on October 26th and an ice-making unit is in operation from Wednesday.
The ice layer is already seven centimeters thick, and by Friday morning the area will be ready for the first visitors.
The ice rink has an area of 375 square meters, the stage occupied 358 square meters.
Skaters and passers-by will also have two punch stands.
"We have expanded the floor area, increased the space in front of the stands, and almost the entire area of the stage is covered so that skaters can comfortably change," Spálený described.
The streets of Olomouc are already reminiscent of the approaching Christmas.
Last year, the ice rink was installed directly in front of the main entrance of the Town Hall on the Upper Square for the repair of the Lower Square.
The repair of the Lower Square was completed at the end of the summer, so that the ice surface could return to its original place.
For the first time, people could skate right in front of the town hall in 2009, when the ice rink was open from January to March.
The ice area then became an integral part of the city's Christmas markets.
Christmas markets, which include a rich cultural program, will start on the Upper Square a month before Christmas Eve.
Scientists shed more light on how tail movements are related to the dog's mood
Previous research has shown that joyful dogs wagging their tails more to the right (from the dog's point of view), while nervous dogs wave their tails mostly to the left.
Now, however, scientists say that other dogs can notice and react to these subtle differences in tail movement.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neurobiologist at the University of Trento, said: "It is well known in humans that the left and right side of the brain have different links to stimuli that arouse positive or negative emotions."
We tried to observe the same thing in other species.
He added that, as is the case with humans, the right side of the brain is responsible for left-handed movements and vice versa, and that the two hemispheres play a different role in emotions.
In an effort to learn more about how dogs respond to the asymmetrical wagging of other dogs' tails, researchers monitored animals that watched movies about other dogs.
They measured the heart rate of these animals and analyzed their behavior.
It probably won't be long before we understand why their tail sometimes goes to one side, and sometimes to the other.
Professor Vallortigara said: "We showed dogs films about dogs – whether in the natural version or in the form of a silhouette – to get rid of any confusing stimuli, and we were also able to adjust the movement of the tail and depict it more to the right or left."
When the animals saw an otherwise bland dog move its tail to the right (from the point of view of a dog wagging its tail), it remained completely calm.
But when she recorded the tail filming mostly to the left (again from the point of view of the dog wagging its tail), their heart rate increased and the animals looked insecure.
Professor Vallortigara said he did not think dogs would knowingly communicate with each other through these movements.
Rather, he believes that dogs have learned from experience which movements they need to look out for and which they do not have to look out for.
He said: "If you encounter dogs several times and the movement of their tail in one direction is repeatedly associated with rather friendly behavior, and movement to the right breeds less friendly behavior, you will react based on this experience."
Researchers say the findings can help dog owners, veterinarians and trainers better understand their animals' emotions.
Dog behaviour expert John Bradshaw, a university professor of animal science at the University of Bristol, said it was not the first study to examine whether the left and right side were important to dogs.
Last year, a team from Lincoln University found that dogs turn their heads to the left when they observe an aggressive dog, and on the right when they look at a cheerful dog.
And in another expert paper from the University of Victoria in Canada, he said: "Dogs were more likely to get to know a dog robot when it cocked its tail to the left rather than to the right, when they were becoming insecure – just the opposite of the Italian study."
The difference, he says, can be made by the fact that dogs in these different studios did not fully think of animals in movies or dog robots as dogs.
He explained that a study on how dogs respond to real dogs could help.
"Although there is strong evidence in many different mammals that both sides of the brain are used for different purposes, many details still need to be clarified – and dogs are no exception," he said.
But given how easy it is to record their behavior, it probably won't be long before we understand why their tail sometimes goes to one side and sometimes to the other.
RBS suspends two foreign exchange traders
The Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) is suspending two traders in its foreign currency division, another indication that global investigations by regulators into suspected currency market machinations are becoming more frequent, according to two people familiar with the situation.
Some of the world's largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they are working with competent authorities to investigate the world's largest financial market, where $5.3 trillion is changed hands every day.
The two traders would be the first RBS employees suspended as part of an expanding investigation in response to the LIBOR (London Interbank Interest Rate) scandal.
The bank declined to comment on the suspension, but confirmed that it had received a request for information from authorities this month.
"Our ongoing investigation into this matter continues and we are fully cooperating with the FCA and our other authorities," the bank said two weeks ago.
Last month, people close to the event said RBS had handed over email and instant message records sent from accounts and accounts of a former trader to the UK Financial Conduct Authority.
This trader, Richard Usher, left RBS in 2010 and is believed to have been relieved of his current position as European Foreign Currency Trading Chairman at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, European chairman of cash trading at Citi, took leave this week, while Matt Gardiner, former head of currency trading at Barclays and UBS, was suspended by Standard Chartered this week.
Neither of these traders has been charged with any offense.
Mr. Usher's instant messaging group included bankers from Barclays and Citigroup, people familiar with the matter said.
UBS said this week that it had taken action against some of its employees after Swiss regulator Finma announced it was investigating suspected foreign currency market machinations at several Swiss banks.
Worldwide, at least six agencies – the European Commission, Finma, swiss antitrust authority Weko, FCA, the US Department of Justice, and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority – are investigating claims that these bankers conspired to move the currency market.
In addition, people familiar with the situation said HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse had launched an internal investigation or received a request for information from the authorities.
Banks are combing through years-old instant messages and e-mails to find cases of misdemeanours.
News of the investigations alarmed traders in what has been one of the biggest engines for generating profits at investment bank closes in recent years, but which has been disrupted by the fact that low currency volatility has limited opportunities for speculators.
Some bankers have tried to reduce the severity of the situation, arguing that a large and highly liquid foreign currency market is virtually impossible to manipulate, but high-ranking traders say that is not necessarily true.
A senior trader said that despite the considerable volume of daily foreign currency trading, the liquidity-chopping between different trading platforms and banks increasing the use of their own internal platforms means that "you can start to have an impact on the market at relatively low prices."
The news came on the same day that Credit Suisse announced it had this week fired a trader from its stock trading division, which caused a loss of nearly $6 million late last year.
The Bank immediately alerted the competent authorities and cooperates with their supervisory authorities.
"We believe that this trader acted alone and that this issue has been resolved," Credit Suisse said.
He negotiated the government with klaus and špida.
Now the People's Party sent Jan Kasal against Babiš.
The People's Party won 14 MPs in the elections, i.e. only a third of the number of Social Democrats or YES representatives.
But they enter into government negotiations with at least one advantage.
In a team that has already begun to argue the outlines of a possible coalition, they have Jan Kasal - a man who, under the People's Party, tuned the conditions of government participation in 1992, 1996, 2002 and 2006.
Neither the Social Democrats nor Andrej Babiš have such a matador on their side.
This time it will probably be reminiscent of the first negotiations in 1992, when the ODS was also a completely new party.
"The experience was minimal at the time," Kasal estimates how this year's talks will unfold.
Driver fined £1,000 for driving over 200km/h with hot drink between his legs
A motorist has been fined £1,000 for driving up to 210km/h with a hot drink between his legs.
Andrew Howie (35) from Tiptree, Essex, was spotted in his Mercedes Benz on the A120 in Braintree on 27 May.
When the police pulled him over, they found a cup of drink between his thighs.
At Colchester Police Court, Howie pleaded guilty to a charge of driving carelessly and carelessly.
Seven points were added to his account, resulting in a six-month driving ban.
Howie was also ordered to pay £90 in costs and a £100 surchare for the accused.
I want a contract in the NHL.
I still have juice, lust and enthusiasm
For Prospal, family has always come first, which is why she wants to submit to her at the age of 38.
Either he gets a job overseas and extends his career, or he's definitely done with hockey.
"I want to play the role of daddy and husband."
"I'm really looking forward to it," says the hockey player, who is still waiting in vain for an offer.
Despite being a renowned worker who never cheats anything.
Despite always leaving his heart on the ice and being able to tear down his teammates.
And also despite the fact that he was Columbus' most productive player last season.
"But the desire to show everyone is still there," he says firmly.
He may see what the New York Rangers, who failed to make the start of the season, are reportedly interested in, and they also have two injured supporters - forwards Rick Nash and Ryan Callahan.
What's it like coming to the Rangers?
It's just speculation.
Until I have something on paper, there's no point in looking into it.
I know there's an article in the New York Post that they should sign me, but that's it.
Nowhere was it said that it had actually happened.
Unfortunately, I'd like to announce myself that I have a contract, but it's just not.
You haven't even heard from the club?
Such communication in the NHL takes place on a daily day.
That's where it's about getting into a situation where the contract actually comes.
When a player gets hurt or someone can't do it and the team doesn't work.
There's a lot of different factors that need to come together to get that contract.
But in New York, circumstances like this happen, don't they?
Rick Nash is injured with Ryan Callahan, and the team didn't make the start of the season, so there's a chance, don't you think?
Of course, there's always a chance.
The second thing is, you always need two sides.
I'd take a lot of offers today, but I haven't gotten one yet.
Unfortunately, that's the reality I have to live in.
You're flying to America on Friday, are you expecting something to work out after all?
I've had those expectations since July 5, when the nhl's free agent market opened, and still nothing.
Are you going to New York to remind yourself?
No, I'm going to Tampa to see my kids and my wife.
I'm looking forward to the sun and seeing you again.
Do you have a program planned?
It's because I'm a father and a husband, and that's what it all depends on.
I'm not a hockey player at the moment - I don't have a contract and I don't play games.
So I'm going to be a daddy and a husband, and I'm really looking forward to it.
Already on Sunday Vasek has two hockey games, this is a holiday for me and my whole family, when we can go support our children in what they want to do.
Are you thinking about doing this in quotes full-time?
Yes, you can think about a lot of things.
This can happen, too.
I tried it three years ago when I missed 50 games because of knee surgery.
And I enjoyed it very, very much.
One day it'll get to the stage where all the goals, wins and passes won't replace what you have at home.
Because family and children, that's the point of life.
Whatever job you want.
I had a job that was the most beautiful thing that could happen to me besides my family.
You've had a lot of offers from Europe: do you want to play NHL just because it's the NHL, or is it because of your family that you want to be in America?
Since I am a hockey player, sporting success also ranks first - apart from my family.
The NHL is the best competition in the world.
And that's what family life depends on.
My children, I'm sorry, our children - mine and my wives - grew up in the States, started going to school there, and so on.
And we would love for them to continue this trend.
Because what we're going to tell each other in America, the possibilities are completely different.
That's the chance we should offer them.
So you plan to stay in America permanently?
We're going to practice it like we used to.
This means that in the summer we will be in the Czech Republic in Hluboká and around České Budějovice.
And in the winter, in Tampa or where our footsteps take us.
It's perfect to stay warm all the time.
I've been very lucky in my life.
You could say I went to meet him, it took a lot of strength and resentance, and it took away a lot of things that I missed.
But hockey offered me a lot of options in return, and this is one of them.
That my wife and I can choose where we live.
There are a lot of people in the world who want this so they can choose what they do and how they live.
At your age, how long will you have the will to work hard, train hard and wait for an offer?
yes, well, that's a question I can't answer.
Today I still have it in me, the juice, the lust, the enthusiasm, the passion for the sport. The desire and motivation to prove to people that you still have the NHL, that I'm still better than someone else.
But I can't tell how much longer it's going to stay there.
It can't be planned.
So you can say you're going to wait this season to see how it goes, and then you're going to decide what to do next?
I'm at the stage where I go day by day.
Distant planets, black-and-white movies, or a little fantasies about extraterrestrial life on earth are not topics that American jazz saxophonist Wayne Shorter would caress about.
In the conception of his quartet, which will conclude this year's Festival Strings of Autumn in the great hall of Prague's Lucerna on November 6, everything has to do with everything.
The score of the quartet of jazz saxophonist Wayne Shorter is the current feelings of musicians.
According to his assignment, two generations younger colleagues are supposed to play what they are experiencing.
They approach music as a completely improvised chamber affair and think not of harmony or rhythm, but of cinemato-like images.
But shorter, now 80 - an extraordinary composer, nine-Grammy winner, former teammate of Miles Davis and arguably the greatest living jazz saxophonist today - doesn't like to explain.
He doesn't talk much about music, although his overall view of life is closely related to music.
At the age of 80, I came to the conclusion that it was best to be surprised by life.
"Too many people plan everything, and then they're disappointed when things turn out differently," Shorter says.
Jagr joked: Goal from the goggles?
He got the puck in the defensive zone and was never caught again.
He also converted the escape after a quick forehand.
Jaromir Jagr scored against Tampa on Wednesday night, and on Thursday night he commented on the 119th nhl winning goal on the social network Facebook.
"After watching this video, my agent Petr Svoboda got a call from the director of Czech Railways and asked him if I would be interested in advertising their state-of-the-art Pendolino train!" wrote Jágr at the beginning with exaggeration.
They say we're a lot alike.
I guess I'm going to have to quit night training so I don't speed up any faster.
"I'm afraid the Secretary of Defense might come in and advertise the jets!" he added with a smiley face.
New Jersey also claimed its second consecutive victory.
"And most importantly, you've noticed - maria rottrová's treatment is working," Jagr concluded.
The brutal murder of a senior citizen in the Zlín region will be dealt with again by the regional court
The regional court acquitted the 25-year-old Slovak and 22-year-old Czech for lack of evidence.
The men denied guilt.
They face 15 to 20 years in prison or even an exceptional sentence.
Spokesman Petr Angyalossy confirmed that the high court overturned the regional decision and returned the case to him for consideration.
The judge declined to comment on the reasons for this, saying that the decision had not yet been served on the parties.
According to the indictment, the youths assaulted a 77-year-old man in his home.
Senior died a harrowing death.
According to the indictment, the men strangled, beat and kicked him all over his body, and also inflicted about three dozen blows to the head with a metal object, apparently a gas pistol.
The man suffered serious injuries, such as fractures to the cranial bone, swelling of the brain and bleeding in the brain, which he succumbed to at the scene.
The youths reportedly took about 3,000 crowns and jewelry worth about 14,000 crowns from the house.
According to the regional court, the only, moreover, circumstantial evidence against the defendants was the odo traces, which the expert assessed as not fully established within the meaning of the legal guidelines.
Although the scents from the crime scene and other things matched the defendants in more than ten cases, they were initially treated by the police as factual and not scented traces.
In addition, there have been some misconduct in their handling.
According to the Senate, the defendants' guilt has not been proven beyond a reasonable doubt.
However, the court acknowledged that the police had very difficult conditions.
A dead senior with a broken head was found by relatives who thought he probably fell and injured himself.
The violent death was not reported by the emergency medical examiner.
After a few days, the criminologists were contacted by Olomouk doctors, who discovered signs of violent death during the autopsy.
The police were no longer able to work with all the traces from the crime scene that relatives had cleaned up.
No DNA from the defendants was found at the scene.
The young Slovak lived in Hungary.
He is now serving an 8.5-year sentence, which was upheld by the Olomouc High Court last year.
According to him, the man was the head of an organized group of six youths responsible for the robberies of a jewelry store.
The robberies took place in October and November 2011, shortly after the murder of a senior citizen in Slopné.
The younger of the accused of the murder of a senior citizen lives in Uherské Hradiště.
The court released him from custody in August after 11 months.
Can Czech Television ever do without signing events?
She entered the era of President Zeman with the legendary ashtray scene, so it is not difficult to listen to the complaint that collects evidence of the castle's pro-mining retinue.
In the past, the long-said influence of such Ivan Langer or Jaroslav Tvrdík has not been documented in this way, let alone signed under it.
True, the editors stood up for the management.
However, the cases described do not answer the question of where such a creeping of some journalists comes from - whether it is a reaction to a direct order or, not to use vulgarism, a typical expression of inappropriate empathic friendliness.
And, assuming widespread rottenness, one cannot forgive the question of whether other, no less unsurgeen, power interests that have not yet been given the opportunity are ausing to change the situation on television.
Those who say that there are no oedily attempted attempts to intervene in broadcasting in developed countries are right.
However, it is also true that this does not mean that complaints about public media do not exist there.
The complainants do not question their independence.
On the contrary, they mainly criticize what they consider to be the tendency that is their own, which is the fruit of their subculture.
Maybe we just haven't reached this civilizational stage yet, and this situation is not with us.
But perhaps even in a country that thinks itself to be the most corrupt in the world, black-and-white stories about evil politicians and good journalists are spent more comfortably than more complicated descriptions of a conduite situation in which the behavior of many imperfect human beings is encountered.
As crowds of horse show experts gathered in Cardiff to fight for the Horse of the Year award, it was clear to everyone that the competition would not be easy.
But no one was ready for 3-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
Although he's not going to school yet, and only a few months ago he took his first steps, this little boy and his pet, the Shetland Pony Toffee, tread smoothly through three rounds to eventually win the grand prize, leaving behind 30 toiling adult rivals.
The inseparable couple - of the same height - were praised for their appearance, behaviour and style at the annual competition run by sunnybank riding centre in the village of Rudry, near Cardiff.
He stood up to the gentlemen and ladies in elegant hats, tilted his beret to a cheerful angle, and let his two-year-old Toffee parade around the circuit.
Fenton was praised by the judges for his natural ability to control the horse, which far exceeds his age.
And Toffee got the highest marks for insight and personality.
Fenton got Toffee for his third birthday in March and has been working out with this Shetland pony every day ever since.
His mother Donna (30) said: "Fenton and Toffee work well together."
They didn't get their hopes up, but they ended up leaving with a gold cup and a bouquet.
It was only the second time he had competed with Toffee, and when he won, we were thrilled.
Everyone thought he was phenomenal, and complete strangers wanted to take pictures with him.
A boy from the village of Nantyglo near Ebbw Vale, South Wales, is following in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been showing off horses for more than 10 years.
Mrs Howells says: "There was an exciting atmosphere and everyone cheered and applauded."
He ran along the sand the entire length of the arena, and though he looked so small, he gave a great performance.
Fenton is obsessed with animals – he loves horses, tractors and a farm, and has been put in charge of two chickens.
Given the way he started, he'll be back at the Horse of the Year competition soon, and I'm sure he'll do well.
A spokesman for the annual horse show competition said: "Fenton is only three, but he already knows how to control a pony."
They make a great team together.
The judges picked up Fenton and Toffee for their outstanding performance and for the way they performed on the competition circuit.
They always see how good teamwork is between the pony and who leads it – and Fenton and Toffee were the best on the oval.
I'm sure Fenton was helped by his lovely clothes, he really fit in with him.
Snowden willing to 'cooperate' with Germany over US surveillance
Edward Snowden, a whistleblower in U.S. intelligence, has announced that he is willing to travel to Berlin to hand over evidence to the German Parliament if the US National Security Agency and its director, Keith Alexander, are unable to provide answers to questions about their activities.
German MP Hans-Christian Sträbele met with Mr Snowden in Russia on Thursday, where he was granted asylum, and discussed the possibility of testifying in Germany.
A letter from Mr Snowden, which the MP handed over to the media in Berlin on Friday, states: "Although the outcome of my efforts has been demonstrably positive, my government continues to treat the opposition as defectors and seeks to criminalise political speech with heavy prosecutions that do not give room for defence."
But telling the truth is not a crime.
In that letter, Mr. Snowden said he believed that supporting the international community could persuade the United States government to drop criminal charges against him.
The charges brought by the U.S. Department of Justice include espionage and theft of state property.
Hans-Peter Friedrich, Germany's interior minister, told Zeit Online magazine: "If Mr Snowden is prepared to talk to German officials, we will find a way to make this possible."
Tensions in the US-Germany relationship began to rise when allegations emerged that the NSA had tapping Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone.
Thomas Oppermann, a member of Parliament who heads the parliamentary panel that oversees intelligence, said that if there was any opportunity to interview Mr Snowden as a witness "without putting himself in danger and completely destroying relations with the US," this should be done.
Mr Sträbele, a Member of Parliament for the German Green Party, posted a photo of himself with Mr Snowden on his Twitter post.
He was accompanied on his trip to Russia by two German journalists.
Mr Sträbele said that, according to a former NSA contractor, Mr Snowden would not be able to return to Russia if he left one day.
If Mr Snowden were to testify in Germany, he would need assurances that he would be "safe" there, the MEMBER of Parliament said.
In his letter, Mr Snowden said he had faced a harsh and sustained campaign of persecution that forced him to leave home.
But he said the world's reaction to his "act of political expression" had given him courage.
Citizens across the country, including those in the United States, have reviewed the revelation of an unjustifiable system of ubiquitous surveillance for public service.
The letter includes an offer to cooperate with the German authorities "when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation are resolved."
So I don't get stuck with hate
Writer Václav Kahuda returned to writing after 12 years.
After many years of reading, living but not writing, VÁCLAV KAHUDA (1965) publishes a new novel Wind, Darkness, Present.
The number of pages comparable to his best-known work Thickets (Petrov, 2001) suggests that this will not be a small volume.
Another prominent Czech writer of the present - Emil Hakl - interviewed for Salon Kahudu.
What moved you to write a novel after 12 years of silence?
I did it so I wouldn't get stuck with hate.
To see around you ever new and new clones of that human foolish pettiness, young organisms affected by blind selfish endeavors.
I'm not even talking about us elders, face ruined by helpless lust, bigoted souls and oppositely over-the-counter ideologues trying to sell their "product" with the expression of a small, marketable whore.
In the early 2000s, I bought a small digital camera and filmed my judo friends, weirdoes and hidden formations.
I'm over it.
Sometimes I feel my brain burn from living on this planet.
I like to go for walks and then read books at the lamppost in the evening.
You're talking about a sense of waste, of hatred.
Was there a break in the past that affected you, or are you just getting older, like the rest of us?
The turning point came a long time ago, about ten years ago.
It didn't have a name then.
Well, that's what I lived for.
There's still a quiet boy in there.
I see more lone trainers, everyone in my tornado of anxiety.
I was saved by writing books.
I'm taking part in this huge, thousands of years-long movement of the life system on this planet - the graspable future.
The immense, breathtaking complexity of life, where every stone is the direct heir to our presence.
We are players of a sad and beautiful game, where the trial-and-error path creates another and next generation of beings who, in trillions of interactions per second, create some superhuman, artifical intelligence.
Twelve years is a relatively long time.
Do you see your writing as a continuous process, or have you started from scratch?
Self-talk, or rather dialogue, which is led by the right and left half of the brain, occasionally comes to the surface and forms into a book.
Like peacetimes are weaps of silently dormant metastases of wars that may wake up one day - so my book is twelve years of silence dressed in words.
I felt the mute avalanche of life grow in my brain, and if I didn't do something, one day they'd quietly thage me.
It is a set of questions formulated by the brain and asked to layers that are stored in darkness "beneath the surface of consciousness."
The neocortex, the gray cortex, asks the older evolutionary formations, goes to the ancient rings of the brain tree.
He speaks to furry beasts, asks snakes, seeks an answer in the flight of birds, raises his eyes to the clouds in the sky.
Yes, the moral law in me and the starry sky above me.
Finally, the brain asks the world.
Relatively often you comment on ego metaphorically - could you define it biologically?
The brain stores in its billions of connections and electrochemical connections all the memories, experiences and experiences that the person has experienced.
This forest of logically and emotionally exposed and branching trees of information, memory registers, uses the brain in its recognition, cognitive, process, being exposed to an ever-changing presence, in an unceasing effort to name and understand its surroundings and decode important messages.
Sometimes there are overload failures.
By analogy - as if you had "dropped" a PC, from a speech emulator program and a translator from foreign languages, you would get tangled up first in the operating environment, such as Windows, and after several unsuccessful restarts ended up at the dark green flashing screen of Bios, in the basic system that controls functions and collaboration on the motherboard, between the processor and the operating memory, etc.
For someone who has not yet understood what we are talking about - I am talking about a psychospiritual crisis.
You mention it a lot - why are you regularly interested in this type of regression?
Because it's a pit.
In the functional mechanisms of our thinking, feeling and behavior to this day, a hole will appear.
Here it is good to quote Nietzsche: "He stared into the abyss for so long that the abyss looked into him."
A pure feeling - that a person is lost, if all hope disappears, mentally "dies" and a new quality comes into being.
And why do I care personally?
I'll answer with a parable.
Once upon a time, one fell into a swimming veil and drowned, days, months and years passed, he was still drowning while reading, and the books taught him to swim - that is, to live.
He became a diver.
Perhaps some sentence written by me will help someone, as Hrabal's lyrics once helped me.
To what extent do you think of the reader, the specific person who will read your text?
The one about whom nothing meaningful can be said, some call it consciousness, another super ego, but I think arthur rimbaud characterized it best in a letter to a friend:
"I'm someone else - this reader is directly involved in the process of formulating words and sentences."
From an early age he read books of old Czech fairy tales, sailed in Captain Nemo's submarine, ran on shades in dark alleys.
In the end, however, behind all the branching of the authors and their message, is: "The sun bright of the worlds of other Karel Hynek Mácha".
And when the book's out?
Do you care about the reader's opinion?
On the feedback that gets to you through the people who read the book?
Of course, I care about the opinion of people who take three hundred crowns and are willing to read five hundred pages of text.
And then, years later, they randomly contact me on the street and thank me for helping them make some difficult life choices with my book.
Books are actually "lives" or rather "worlds."
They are encoded in letter characters, bearing experience, the history of the regions of which language.
We can bring them to life at any time by letting their sentences flow to the brain.
It's actually, in a way, something forbiddenly divine - waking up more and more life stories, small universes and temporary planets.
It is a fact whose DNA is stored in the lines - according to the old demonological books, we commit witchcraft.
After the book is published, as is often the case, you will have a chain of author readings.
I remember you used to like to read.
Are you going to jump back into it with pleasure, or do you feel differently years later?
I prefer to just talk nowadays.
And what did I find out?
There are good intelligent people everywhere.
Their basic feature - they are inconspicuous, do not draw much attention to themselves, have a friendly radiation, do not feel lonely with them.
I will give an example - in the town of Červený Kostelec lived there was (and I hope he is still alive) one curly bookseller (his name is conveniently Cervenka), a cheerful cronies and a good girl bull.
During one drink, he introduced me to the individual articles of the chain of readers of my book Thickets.
I looked them in the eye, and then I was shown a smashed, read copy of my book.
Embarrassed, I put down the just-read fire and wept briefly.
We all stood there in silence, swialing and weed drunkenly.
Then the young blonde half-timer couldn't take it, and with a roar he leapt head-first out of the window into a snowding snowdress.
It was on the ground floor.
We ran out into the night landscape and slaughtered with the happy rabies of the sensitives, the aching soul of the compatriots, and the sadness of the sunken patriots - howling and pampering like werewolves until morning.
Each of your books is formally and content different from the previous ones.
Is this also true of the text Wind, Darkness, Presence?
It's a story.
It's a fairy tale about one country across nine rivers and nine mountains.
In his novel Suchodol, Ivan Bunin puts into the mouth of a folk healer the words of an old Russian myth: At sea, on the ocean, on the island of Bujan.
There's a dog on it, a gray chest on it.
Horror, terror, mystery.
It never happened, but we all know it from where.
Maybe a long time ago we were devils in hell and drew lots - what role we're going to play on this earth.
Are you going to keep writing, or are you going to leave it to the free tide of inspiration again?
The answers are eternal - Otokar Březina.
Writing is a wonderful way of dialogue.
Something huge and unnamed, similar to the movement of continents on the planet, affects our volition from such depth and breadth that it completely transcends our horizon - and so, with absolute course, we act precisely in the direction of our programmed assignment.
We are rewarded with an influx of dopamine, a mixture of endorphins and other substances.
We're biological machines.
We want to mate, we die defending and acquiring new personal territories.
Sometimes a disorder happens and we radiate compassion.
Only then do we have the right to call ourselves human.
That's the answer to your question - the biological robot is already full of various malfunctions, standing on the ocean coast unconscious, catching tides of balmy wind in a leaky tarpaulin made of dirty handkerchiefs.
I have to write to be human.
Schools should focus more on math, spelling and grammar
During English literature classes, at least one Shakespeare play, a 19th-century novel, romantic poetry and contemporary British fiction will have to be studied further.
The exam will also include "hidden text" to encourage deeper reading;
Combined English literature and language courses will be cancelled.
From 2015, students will be required to take the language maturita exam and will be encouraged to choose English literature as an optional subject.
The Ministry of Education is due to publish new curricuals for English and mathematics tomorrow – the first subjects to undergo radical change.
Other major subjects are expected to change next year.
In a separate move, Ofqual, which oversees GCSEs, will unveil changes in the structure of the maturita examination, along with a new grading system and a smaller volume of projects for students.
In a speech in the summer, Education Secretary Michael Gove said there was a "broad consensus on whether we need to reform our exam system to regain the trust of society", and that it was necessary to insist that the GCSEs be "more demanding, ambitious and stricter."
The study shows that English schools spend less time in math – 116 hours a year or three hours a week – than most other countries.
By comparison, schools in Australia spend an average of 143 hours a year on maths and about 138 in Singapore.
Although there will be no official requirement to devote more time to mathematics, coalition sources said that a comprehensive maths GCSEs – along with a greater emphasis on the subject in the scoreboards – are likely to encourage schools to provide extra tuition.
The curriculum will focus more on "real-world problems," including financial mathematics.
Ostrava Mayor Kajnar: I am not the cancer in ČSSD
Before the elections, a long-simmering dispute between two wings fighting for influence within the Ostrava ČSSD was fully in flames.
It all culminated when the Mayor of Ostrava, Petr Kajnar, appealed to the court for undemocratic listing of candidates.
Still, the actors in the case did not want to comment too much so as not to damage the party even more before the elections.
But now the voters' votes are counted.
The leadership of the Ostrava ČSSD called on the Mayor of Ostrava to step down from the party on Monday evening and will probably also push for him to lose his post.
But Peter Kajnar wants to keep fighting.
He described what the controversy was about and who was on whose side, he described in an exclusive interview with the Daily Mail.
How do you feel about the outcome of the election?
ČSSD certainly expected a much better result.
Has it been damaged in our country by the fact that there were disputes within the party in the media before the election?
I imagine that social democracy could have a better electoral outcome.
But on the other hand, it corresponds to the state in which ČSSD is now.
It's a party that has its own internal problems, it's internally ill, and people perceive that everything is not right in it.
They made that clear in the election.
What are the internal diseases of the ČSSD?
I think the ODS has been going through a decline for some time now, and unfortunately, such things are now taking place in a social democracy.
It is that lobbyists, influential people who previously expected to find their prebends with the ODS, have moved to the people in the ČSSD and have influence over them.
This has to do with the fact that the police go around the offices of the Ostrava Municipality and collect computers.
It shows that ČSSD is not only composed of people who want the good of everyone else, but many of them think above all about their own good.
ČSSD is divided into two irreconcilable camps also in Prague, as can be seen in the current power struggle between Hašek and Sobotka.
But even that has been in the works for a long time.
What happened before the elections in Ostrava was just a harbinger of what is happening now in Prague.
Hasek's wing gradually occupied positions so that after the elections it could create a situation that would weaken Sobotka's wing.
One is in a situation in politics where sometimes you have to compromise.
But everyone has an internal boundary where you can't compromise anymore, and that's my case.
Originally, I did not want to run for the House, but when I perceived the whole thing within the party, I agreed with Luboš Zaorálek that I would try to get on the regional list in order to strengthen Sobotka's wing as mayor of Ostrava.
But Hask's wing gave it a clue.
Why are you on bohuslav sobotka's side and not Michal Hašek?
Slavek Sobotka is, in my opinion, a person who always talks primarily about the ČSSD program and, to some extent, visions for the party and for this country.
I'll admit, I haven't heard anything like that from the other side.
Michal Hašek is just fighting for power.
I do not understand how the Bureau, which is a lower body than the Central Executive Committee, can start simply dismissing the party chairman.
This is a power struggle regardless of everything and against the party's statutes.
In my opinion, what Michal Hašek has now demonstrated in Prague has ended his political career.
How did you perceive that the Ostrava leadership of the ČSSD did not approve you as a candidate.
Political parties are based on a competition to see who will be placed.
The competition should be largely based on the program visions and the ability of those people to fulfill those visions.
Of course, there are also people who do not have much ability or vision in this competition, but a political party is an elevator to money that they would not get elsewhere.
The problem is when these people start to come to the fore by breaking the rules without scruples, they violate the party's statutes.
They use their practices to make political parties mafias and, in my opinion, they also violate the laws of the Czech Republic.
Drawing attention to this problem is more important to me than taking into account whether any Kajnar has a political future.
It is important that the parties start respecting the statutes.
Is that why you filed an application to the court before the elections for interim measures against the form of the ČSSD candidate in the Moravian-Silesian Region?
The current CSSD District Executive Committee in Ostrava consolidates its power by being able to abolish organizations that do not suit it, purposefully founding new organizations, gradually firing uncomfortable party members.
An example is that they wanted to expel Richard Bednařík from the club of representatives, but he filed a lawsuit against it, and they then overturned the resolution to expel him.
This shows that, while it is the last resort to enforce the party's statutes through the courts, it is the only option when the other methods and supervisory authorities within the ČSSD have ceased to function.
The aim of the leadership of the Ostrava ČSSD, headed by Deputy Adam Rykala, is to remove you from the position of mayor.
It is an open secret that the mayor of Poruba, Lumír Palyza, has a crush on this post.
That's right, Adam Rykala and Lumir Palyza are trying to do everything they can to get me recalled.
They promise people positions, they get votes, and for those votes, they consolidate their power in the party.
Going back to the past, everything that happened around baník ostrava football club and the purchase of the Bazala Stadium was just an excuse for them to attack me.
It was artificially staged so they could call me a man who puts money where it doesn't belong.
In doing so, the city bought property that is strategically of great value to it.
So how do you see it with your stay as mayor?
On Monday, the District Committee invited me and other people to consider staying in the ČSSD.
But I think it's like a thief yelling, "Catch the thief!"
If we look at the results of my work over the last eleven years, I do not see anyone in Ostrava's social democracy initiating and asserting, sometimes against party members, the emergence of so many development things, such as industrial zones or the expansion of a science and technology park.
Yet everything becomes uncomfortable.
I don't read it any other way than I'm getting in the way of others getting into the places they want.
Will you still be fighting these efforts?
Because if this republic is going to work well, so must political parties.
I can hardly believe that any party will be able to effectively run the state if it can't even control itself.
So I am not considering leaving čssd now, because I think that the person who is causing this party's cancer is not me, but these people who are trying to exte me.
We want to show that Pilsen can still win, rajtoral promises
It's kind of a paradox.
While his team has not been doing well recently, Defender or Midfielder Viktoria Plzeň František Rajtoral has been in form that has earned him a return to the national team after a year.
He also thrives on shooting, he is full of activity, after the intervention he was ordered to take a penalty kick in the match in Teplice.
Viktoria reached for victory in the last two rounds against Slavia and Teplice, but in the end she took only one point from these two duels.
František Rajtoral believes that his team will break an unpleasant series against Jablonec.
We want to show that we can win.
"I believe we can beat Jablonec at home," promises František Rajtoral.
The team is carefully preparing for a tough match with the North Bohemians, who play attacking football.
Everything is heading towards the match with Jablonec, the coach prepares us well, as always we draw a lot from the video game of the opponent.
"I believe it will be a great match on Friday night," the Czech representative lures fans to the stands of the Doosan Arena.
Plzen's last few matches have not been as well-watched as she would have liked, but the word of the crisis is rejected by defender Victoria.
That's the way it is in football, sometimes you're in good shape and sometimes you're worse.
But there's no way I'd talk about a crisis.
"I believe we will win on Friday and it will be good again," says the West Bohemian defender.
The Victoria team will once again rely on the support of the fans.
"It's a Friday night game, and I'd like to invite our fans who are great."
"I believe we will repay them with a win," Rajtoral adds.
Defend academic freedoms, this applies to Zeman and the ODS.
In recent months, I have repeatedly called on students, educators and the management of secondary schools and universities in several regions to defend academic freedoms from the election campaign carried out by President Miloš Zeman in schools.
I've had more or less success.
The Rector of Masaryk University in Brno, who refused a lecture by the honorary chairman of the SPOZ - Zemanovci during the election period, even received retaliation in the form of not invited to celebrate a public holiday of the Czech Republic.
Here is a list of school representatives who were not so brave enough to visit Miloš Zeman: Brno University of Technology, Gymnasium Hladnov in Ostrava, University of Business in Ostrava, Business Academy in Kolín, J.E. Purkyně University in Usti nad Labem.
Now in Pardubice we are seeing the continuation of the promotion of policy at universities.
Simeon Karamazov, newly elected MEMBER of the ODS, Dean of the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Informatics of the University of Pardubice, refuses to resign from his academic position and, moreover, it seems normal to him.
Professor, this is really not the same as staying, for example, as mayor of a smaller city.
Do you want to join the cssd governors, who serve as members and governors at the same time and, like them, demote both professions?
This is what you tell people that both of these demanding functions can be handled with the left back.
I know, we have the example of Michal Hasek, who can even handle several dozen functions at once.
But that's probably not exactly an example of a person you should follow.
We can also find the opposite and positive example of The Local's Stepanka Fraňková, who preferred to leave her post in order to be able to devote her full attention to the management of the city of Pardubice.
However, the main reason for my recommendation to leave the dean's office is that by running out of functions, you will violate the apoliticality of the academic soil of the University of Pardubice.
The management of the Pardubice ODS sees your current work in both positions as an advantage for the University.
However, you will be able to help "your" school without remaining dean.
I think your students will have a similar opinion to me and Rector Miroslav Ludwig.
So consider resigning and keep your face.
Otherwise, you may get voters to count it for you at the next election.
And that may not last long.
John Kerry admitted: Spying has gone too far!
The United States has sometimes gone "too far" in spying, US Diplomatic Chief John Kerry admitted during a video conference between Washington and London, according to AFP.
But, according to the minister, the collection of information served to avert terrorist attacks.
According to AFP, the "first admission from Washington" came amid fierce controversy on both sides of the Atlantic over scandalous revelations about mass data surveillance by the US National Security Agency (NSA), which has also been targeted by US allies.
"In some cases, I admit, as President (Barack Obama) did, some of these actions have gone too far, and we are making sure that this does not happen in the future," Kerry said.
In the interview, however, he defended his practice to date.
Collecting information, he said, is essential to combat terrorism and prevent assassinations such as the 9/11 attacks in the US, the Madrid bombings in March 2004, and the London attacks of July 2005.
"We prevented planes from falling, buildings exploding, and people being killed because we were able to be informed of the plots in a timely manner," Kerry stressed.
However, he again admitted that the collection of information 'in some cases has gone unreasonably far'.
The U.S. intelligence affair, which allegedly tracked hundreds of millions of phone calls, erupted in Europe this month.
Among other things, it turned out that the Americans were also tracking German Chancellor Angela Merkel's cell phone.
European leaders have made no hiding their indignation, and some have called on the European Union to try to reach an agreement with the United States that would conceal or significantly limit surveillance.
The royal commission heard that two employees of the Christian Youth Association (YMCA) had been charged before the prosecutions against Jonathan Lord.
The Royal Commission into Child Sexual Abuse has learned that two staff members of the Christian Young Men's Association (YMCA) in New South Wales were accused of sexually abusing children before charges were brought against child educator Jonathan Lord of Caringbah in 2011.
But the committee said in its opening statement to the commission that the association had never dealt with a case of child sexual abuse in their organization.
Ceo Phillip Hare was asked about a case in which one YMCA employee was charged with child pornography offences, and another where a YMCA gym teacher in Caringbah was convicted in 1991 of sexually harassing children in his care.
Mr. Hare told Gaili Furness, the commission's counsel, that he knew about the first case, but not the second.
He acknowledged that the YMCA's opening statement was also inaccurate, ncing on the fact that external audits had been carried out at the YMCA, which praised the organisation as a leading advocate for children's rights.
The evidence presented by the commission suggests that the YMCA was alerted to receiving the second lowest of the four possible assessments in an Audit by the Ministry of Education and Society in August this year.
Mr Hare, who started working with the YMCA when he was 21, admitted that management had failed to take Mr Lord down from him without making sure staff were aware of the obligation to report breaches of child safety rules.
Earlier this year, Lord was convicted of sexually harassing 12 boys during his two years at the YMCA.
He was jailed for a minimum of six years.
But Mr Hare rejected claims that the YMCA had a cultural problem that prevented staff from reporting child safety breaches by Lord Lord.
Staff members gave evidence that they had witnessed such breaches, including Lord being alone with the children, privately guarding them, letting them sit on his lap, telling them he loved them, and letting them play with his mobile phone.
Danielle Ockwell, who was Lord's subordinate and asked for child safety training because she was concerned about his behaviour, testified that Jacqui Barnat, head of children's services at the YMCA in Caringbah, who was Lord's superior, was "very intimidating and often difficult to talk to him about."
The CEO said he doesn't accept staff evidence that they felt comfortable contacting their superiors and reporting the actions.
Instead, he said that their friendship with the Lord clouded their judgment, and that's why they didn't report the problem.
Mr Hare said he had told the YMCA board in New South Wales that the lesson of the "Jonathan Lord case" for the organisation was that the staff had "not reported" and the board agreed with him.
Mr Hare said the decision to have staff sign confidentiality agreements shortly after the allegations emerged was made by YMCA's general manager of children's services Liam Whitley.
He said the aim was to avoid disturbing the evidence, but was "overzealous" and poorly executed.
Child sexual abuse expert Professor Stephen Smallbone, of Griffith University, told the commission that the YMCA in New South Wales was not an organisation safe for children between 2009 and 2011.
He said there were serious problems in recruiting, vetting, incorporating, training and staffing.
The hearing was adjourned until December 20.
Václav Matyáš, President of the Association of Construction Entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic: The new green savings should continue
Since 2008, the Czech construction industry has been facing a continuous decrease in the volume of orders and a state's interest in addressing the issue of investment construction.
The announcement of the New Green Savings programme was a positive signal for our construction industry, especially for small and medium-sized companies in individual regions.
It is a great opportunity not only for citizens who, after implementing the measures, will save significant amounts for heating, but also a chance for construction companies and building materials manufacturers.
Each billion invested will bring more than 2,700 newly created jobs to the state.
Leverage and multiplier effects are important in terms of the state's fiscal policy, and it is also one of the most important pro-growth measures.
The Association of Construction Entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic therefore strongly disagrees with the government's resolution and asks for the implementation of such steps that would allow the programme to continue so that further calls can be announced within it.
FAA: Air passengers can now use technological achievements on planes (but not make calls from their mobile phones)
Airline passengers will be able to use their electronic devices "gate-to-gate" – in addition to calling from their mobile phones – to read, play games, watch movies, and listen to music under eagerly awaited new rules issued Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).
However, passengers should not expect changes to occur immediately.
How quickly the change is implemented will vary by airline, FAA Administrator Michael Huerta said at a news conference.
Airlines will need to demonstrate to the FAA how much their aircraft comply with the new rules and that they have updated the cabin crew training manuals and equipment storage guidelines to comply with the new rules.
The FAA said it has already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic devices on aircraft.
Among the companies that have already submitted plans are Delta and JetBlue.
"Depending on the status of such a plan, we can improve the widespread use of electronic devices very quickly," the FAA said in a statement.
Currently, passengers are required to turn off their smartphones, tablets and other devices as soon as the plane doors close.
They can't turn them on until the plane reaches an altitude of 3 kilometers and the captain has issued a warrant.
Passengers are expected to turn off their devices again when the plane descends to land and do not turn them on until the plane is on the ground.
Under the new rules, airlines whose aircraft are properly protected from electronic interference can allow their passengers to use their devices during takeoff, landing and taxiing, the FAA said.
Most new airliners and other aircraft that have been modified to allow passengers to use Wifi at higher altitudes are expected to meet these criteria.
Laura Glading, president of the Professional Stewards Association, welcomed the changes.
"Once the new rules are safely implemented -- and we work closely with transport companies on this -- it will be a success," Glading said in a statement.
Frankly, we're tired of looking like "watchmen."
However, internet surfing, emailing and texting or downloading data will continue to be prohibited below 3 kilometers of altitude, the agency said.
Passengers will be notified to switch their smartphones, tablets and other devices to air mode.
So still no Words with friends, an online scrabble game played by actor Alec Baldwin on his smartphone in 2011, when, as is well known, he was thrown off an American Airlines plane because he refused to turn off his device when the plane was parked at the gate.
And heavier devices like laptops will have to continue to be stored because of fears that someone might get hurt if they were flying around the cabin.
Calls from mobile phones will continue to be banned on board.
The rules for using cell phones are determined not by the FAA, but by the U.S. Federal Telecommunications Committee.
The FAA may lift the ban on some electronic devices during takeoff and landing.
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the National Transportation Safety Board, a national transportation safety expert, told CBS News that cell phones continue to be considered a risk.
"Mobile phones are a real problem, not only because they can potentially create interference with navigational devices, but we also know from FCC data that they can cause interference to transmission towers in the air," Rosenker said.
A industry advisory committee created by the FAA to investigate the issue proposed last month that the government allow the wider use of electronic devices.
The FAA has been under pressure in recent years to ease restrictions on their use.
Critics, such as Senator Claire McCaskill, Democrat of Missouri, argue that there is no legal security reason for the ban.
Restrictions are also becoming increasingly difficult to enforce because the use of such devices is ubiquitous.
Some studies suggest that up to a third of passengers forget or ignore the obligation to turn off their devices.
The FAA began restricting the use of electronic devices by passengers in 1966 in response to interference with navigation and communication equipment when passengers began carrying FM radios, a technical prom of the time.
New airlines are much more resentful of electrical systems than previous generations, but they are also designed and approved by the FAA to be resistant to electronic interference.
Airlines have been offering passengers wi-fi at cruising altitudes for several years.
Plans modified for Wi-Fi systems are also more resistant to interference.
Under the new rules, the vast majority of airlines should adapt to greater use of electronic devices, Huert said.
Today's electronic devices generally emit much less intensive radio broadcasting than previous generations.
For example, e-readers emit only minimal broadcasts when you turn a page.
But the broadcast is stronger when devices download or send data.
There is a significant number of people pushing for restrictions on the use of these devices by passengers Amazon.com.
In 2011, representatives of this company loaded the airliner with their Kindle electronic readers and conducted a test flight, but no problem emerged.
Members of the FAA advisory committee expressed mixed feelings about whether these facilities pose any risks.
Douglas Kidd of the National Airline Passengers Association said he believes the interference from these devices is real, even if the risk is minimal.
Other committee members have said that there are only fragmented reports from pilots to support the fact that such devices can cause interference with aviation systems, and most of these reports are very old.
However, the committee recommended that the FAA allow pilots to order passengers to turn off equipment while flying low-visibility instruments.
The travel industry group welcomed these changes and, in its opinion, this is a sensible course of action for the travelling public, which uses technology extensively.
"We are pleased that the FAA has recognized that a pleasant travel experience is not against safety," said Roger Dow, executive director of the American Travel Association.
In an unprecedented confession, John Kerry said U.S. espionage "went too far"
John Kerry hinted at softening us defensive stance on its surveillance programs, saying in an unprecedented admission that in some cases espionage "went too far."
The Secretary of State also admitted that he and Barack Obama were responsible for acting as "autopilot" in light of the insuberable revelations about NSA spying that emerged from whistleblower Edward Snowden.
The leaked information has triggered a diplomatic storm between the US government and its allies.
Mr Kerry said via video link at an open government conference in London: "There is no doubt that the President and I and others in the government actually learned about some of the things that were going on out of inertia, because there was this possibility, referring to The Second World War, a difficult period of the Cold War and then, of course, 9/11."
So he became the first high-ranking member of the U.S. government to admit that American espionage had crossed the line, but stressed that no one's rights had been violated.
He said, "In some cases, it's gone too far."
And the president is determined to try to explain and clarify this to people, and he's already conducting a thorough review so that no one feels abused.
I assure you that there is no abuse of the rights of innocent persons in this process.
But Mr. Kerry insisted that the NSA was doing good and that its surveillance operations had saved many lives.
He added, "We are facing a new world in which people are willing to blow themselves up."
There is radical extremism in the world that is determined to murder and blow up people and attack governments.
What if you were able to intercept it and stop it before it happened?
In fact, we have prevented planes from crashing, buildings exploding and people being executed, because we can already learn about these plans in advance.
The chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs said Thursday that U.S. lawmakers are going to Europe to respond to foreign concerns about alleged U.S. espionage and to convince Europeans that their forces in the fight against terrorism need to continue to be joined.
Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut said he spoke to Members of the European Parliament and others this week and that he was concerned about their threats to stop participating in counterterrorism organizations because they were disillusioned with national security agency (NSA) surveillance.
It is really important for US national security interests that Europe stays in the same boat with us, given the joint efforts in the fight against terrorism, Murphy, a Democratic member and chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Foreign Relations on European Affairs, said in an interview from Washington.
And I am going to Europe to make it clear that we must continue to work together to fight terrorism, despite their anger at the NSA programs.
Media reports that the NSA collected millions of phone records in Europe have disrupted relations with some U.S. allies, although the agency's chief said this week that they were inaccurate and reflected a misunderstanding of the metadata NATO allies collected and shared with the United States,
Other revelations cited documents leaked by Snowden that the NSA was tracking the mobile phone of German Chancellor Angela Merkel and up to 34 other world leaders.
Director of National Intelligence James Clapper defended the spying of the Allies as necessary and said it was commonplace on both sides.
Amid the upsuaule, Murphy said his office is planning a parliamentary trip this year and hopes that members of both parties and chambers will appear in the delegation.
The names of the other legislators who intend to participate are due to be published in the coming days.
He said the program was still in the works.
Although Murphy said the trip was aimed at helping mend relations, he added that "well-intentioned educational measures" would also be prepared.
He said that European leaders must be honest with their own people about the espionage programs they have been using for years.
"While we are adjusting our surveillance programs to better protect the rights of Europeans, they, too, need to recognize that we are not the only ones conducting espionage here," Murphy said.
Meanwhile, Mr Kerry is scheduled to head to the Middle East and Poland this weekend to respond to the hostility generated by America's strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as US surveillance activities.
The words "Mugabe is a limp donkey" are no longer in prison, the court overturned the law
Until now, Zimbabweans have had to be careful how they talk publicly about 89-year-old Mugabe, who has ruled the country since the early 1980s and has led it since late 1987.
Under Section 33 of the Criminal Code, disparaging the presidency was a $100 fine to one year in prison.
"Prosecutors should not be eager to blame people who comment on the president in pubs or other public places," constitutional court officials said.
Nine judges unanimously agreed that the law undermines freedom of expression.
The government is likely to appeal the court's decision, the BRITISH BBC reported.
A number of agious Zimbabweans, including Tendai Danga, who was arrested by police two years ago for allegedly insulting the president in an altercation with a bar policeman, spoke out against the law.
In May, an opposition activist publicly calling Mugabe a "limp donkey" ended up in prison.
Then, in August, prosecutors charged a 26-year-old man with his intention to use a poster with Robert Mugabe's face as toilet paper.
The court also declared an unconstitutional law restricting media freedom.
"The state cannot punish people whose statements later turn out to be false," said Deputy Attorney General Luke Malala.
Until now, Zimbabwean law has allowed a person who publishes false information to be sentenced to 20 years in prison.
"The existence of a law allowing someone to be criminalized for making false statements has a froze effect on the right to express themselves freely," Malala added.
Despite mugabe ruling the country with a hard hand for more than 33 years, Zimbabwe adopted a new constitution with broader civil liberisms in March following a referendum.
Small steps away from the one-man dictatorship began in 2009, when an agreement between Mugabe and the opposition ousted Morgan Tsvangiyi as prime minister.
However, the country continues to suffer from the economic crisis and, until 2008, the highest inflation in the world, which exceeded 100,000 percent.
In 2009, therefore, the government completely abolished the national currency.
Today, zimbabwe pays only with the currency of other countries.
The impoverished economy is at the expense of Mugabe's reckless agricultural reform.
In 2000, he redistributed white farmers' land to his supporters and war veterans.
Most of them, however, had no experience running farms.
Young couple matured to live with parents, new house offers privacy to both generations
Japanese studio Tai and Associates was commissioned to design a house on a plot of land on the corner of two streets, with the land itself somewhat sloping.
The request also stated that there would be two generations living in the house who would like to live together, but each should have its own clearly separate space.
The younger couple also needed a small office.
The house stands on the corner of two streets and on a slightly sloping plot.
Therefore, the architects decided to place each household on one of the floors of the house.
"When creating the design, we respected family ties, history and memories associated with the place."
"Three different functions of the house are connected through the exterior of the building in several ways, so everyone is aware of the presence of others, but at the same time they have their privacy," the designers explain.
The parents' household is at the level of a garden with an old pine, to which family traditions and memories are to be joined.
The individual parts of the house are easily recognizable from the outside, because they differ in different finishings of facades.
While the main segment of the building is made of concrete, the surface of which has been shaped using panels from planks, the part where the office is plastered in white, leaving the remaining elements in a clean concrete design without further modifications.
Many walls of the house are completely glazed, thanks to which the interior of the house is very interconnected with the exterior.
The parents' home, more precisely the kitchen, dining room and living room, surrounds a small garden with a tree, which is of great importance to the family.
The connection of the interior with the exterior is underlined by a side wall, which begins in the garden and continues to the living room.
Kitchen space in the home of a young couple.
The young couple enters the house through the main entrance to the hall and from there climbs the stairs to their premises.
The stairs are the main dominant feature of the interior of the house.
Their design allows a lot of natural light to fall through them.
It was by this that the architects tried to distinguish the house from others and imprint something unique on it.
The young couple's home is described as one open space with a kitchen area, dining room and living room together.
It is separated from the terrace only by a glass wall with sliding doors.
Living area with dining and kitchen area in the young couple's home.
The second floor is composed as one large open space, which freely passes to the terrace, from where there is a nice view of Tokyo Bay.
The office itself on the top floor is conceived in a pure combination of white and black color.
The staircase is the dominant element of the interior of the house.
The young couple enter the house through the main entrance, find themselves in the lobby, and from there they climb up the stairs.
Fire crews have arrived to rescue a missing puppy who was stranded 15 metres above the ground on a dangerous protruding in a quarry
Ruby the co-chkrchpache escaped after a small car accident.
Three days later, trapped in a quarry, he was spotted by a man walking his dog.
Firefighters swiled down a rock face to save the dog from certain death.
The puppy was rescued by fire crews who came to rescue him after somehow traping himself on a dangerous protruding in a quarry 15 metres above the ground.
Ruby, a nine-month-old co-quarry, escaped after a minor car accident on Sunday afternoon, surviving alone for three days until he was rescued from a quarry on Wednesday.
Its owners Scott Alderson (25) and his girlfriend Becky Hall (20) were at the Flappit quarry in Denholme, West Yorkshire, to reunite with Ruby and to thank the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
After escaping when he got into a small accident, they frantized their search for their lost dog and posted appeals on social media.
At about 2.15pm on Wednesday, a bright-eyed dog-dog spotted Ruby stuck on a protruding quarry 15 metres above the ground.
A technical rescue team from Cleckheaton Fire Station raced to the scene and slapped down to free Ruby, using an animal transport bag to pick him up by the rock.
Technical Rescue Team Expert Commander Andy Clayton said: 'The dog was in a dangerous situation.
It was right in the middle of the rock wall – 15 meters from the top and from below.
He didn't move his during the rescue - he was totally frozen.
But he's all right now.
Then he got cookies.
It was a very unusual trip.
The fact that someone saw the dog is unbelievable.
Technical Rescue Team Expert Commander Peter Lau said, "Ruby was very lucky during his escape."
There was a possibility that he would be very seriously injured or worse.
Ruby was taken to the vet for a check-up, and in addition to exhaustion and dehydration, he was fine.
Miss Hall, from Halifax, West Yorkshire, said: "I was worried at the sight of the rescue."
First of all, I couldn't believe how he got there.
It was amazing to hold him in my arms again.
The vet said if he had run out too much and collapsed, he would probably have fallen.
The fire department did a great job.
What they did was very brave.
We're very grateful to them, they were all just great.
Mr Alderson, from Keighley, added: "We were afraid he might fall, but he stayed there."
The firemen were great.
We just still don't understand how he got there.
A cooling tower burned down at night in the ČKD industrial complex in Prague
A large-capacity storage tank was on fire in the ČKD industrial complex in Prague, apparently a cooling tower, according to firefighters.
"Firefighters were already on their way to the fire just before 11 p.m. on Thursday, and this morning they were still extinguishing the fire," said Pavlína Adamcová, a spokeswoman for the Prague Fire Brigade.
The amount of pollutants in the air in the vicinity did not exceed the permitted limits according to the measurements.
The extent of the damage and the cause of the fire are as yet unknown.
About five dozen firefighters gradually arrived at the premises in Kolbenova Street.
"This is a fire in a large storage tank, probably a cooling tower," Adamcova said.
"There is no working hydrant network on the premises, so we are extinguishing with the help of transport lines from tanks," she added.
According to the tn.cz, the firefighting was complicated by a poorly functioning network of hydrants, so firefighters had to transport water from other times.
The fire chief has issued a second-degree fire alarm.
There are four grades in total, and in the most serious situations, a fourth is announced.
Chemists also went to the scene to check the level of hazardous substances that could have been air-fired in the fire.
"However, they did not measure the amount of pollutants in the air that exceeded hygiene standards," a fire department spokeswoman said.
$325 million rescue package for Tasmanian health service
The federal government insists the $325 million rescue package for Tasmania's moribund health system contains tough conditions to ensure the state government does not waste funding.
Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek said the Australian Union was taking "urgent action" to avert the crisis caused by the island's ageing population, higher chronic disease rates and systemic disorders.
Funding for four years was decided after government consultation with independent Tasmanian MP Andrew Wilkie.
"The government has come up with an emergency rescue package that we believe will solve the specific problems facing the state," Ms Plibersek said today.
The $325 million package includes $31 million for patient-request surgery.
Another 2,600 operations, including orthopaedic and cataract operations, will help eliminate indebtedness.
There is also money for open-source clinics in Hobart and Launceston, better postoperative care, training of health specialists, mental health services and the introduction of personal electronic health record systems in local hospitals.
"These investments respond to ideas that leading clinical doctors have told me will help the Tasmanian health system in the best way," Ms Plibersek said.
The Minister stressed that the Tasmanian Government must require a strict reporting regime and registration obligations.
The state will have to maintain the current level of funding in order to receive the Australian Union's money and report monthly on where the additional funding has been spent.
A three-member committee will be set up to ensure that the State supplies services as efficiently as possible.
Mr Wilkie said today that $325 million would be of no use "until real reform follows to lay a more sustainable foundation for Tasmania's public health system."
Still, he praised the government for responding to his request for urgent assistance, which he first raised in a meeting with the Prime Minister in early May.
"I believe the federal aid package can free the state's public health service from critical condition," Mr. Wilkie said.
According to the state government, these additional procedures chosen will significantly reverse recent cuts.
Federal Health Opposition health spokesman Peter Dutton believes today's announcement is just a "band-aid."
"The reason I'm here is because the Labor government has taken $430 million out of our health system," he told ABC TV.
You can't have a state government that takes almost half a billion dollars and an Australian Union that donates $300 million and pretend it's good news.
Mr Dutton called on Ms Plibersek to guarantee that not a single dollar of the rescue package would be spent on more bureaucracy.
There is music on the metro on the Bridge
The transport company hl.m. (DPP) of Prague launched the Project Music in the Subway.
The first vestibule where the reproduced instrumental music plays continuously during metro operation is the Bridge of line A at the exit to Wenceslas Square.
The trial run will take six months.
There's probably going to be police specialists in the ghettos to ease the tension.
Police specialists should operate in ghettos in the Czech Republic in the future.
They'd spend up to half their errands here.
They'd keep an eye on order and solve problems.
Thanks to their knowledge of the environment, they should contribute to reducing tensions between people from poor places and residents of the surrounding area.
In its proposal to reduce security risks, the Ministry of the Interior envisages this.
According to him, "accelerated provision of social housing" would mainly help improve the situation in the country.
The document was discussed by the government.
According to the analysis, there were about 300 slums and neighborhoods in the Czech Republic a few years ago.
Some 80,000 people lived there, mainly Roma.
Adults in ghettos were out of work, families were dependent on benefits, children ended up in "special" schools.
Us us us us was on.
Meanwhile, experts say the problem locations have increased by 100.
Relations between their inhabitants and others are sharpening.
Anti-Roma marches were held in several places.
People from the area joined the extremists.
According to the interior, it is difficult for the police to maintain security and order in ghetto areas.
The fundamental condition, he says, is "consistent application of equal access to law enforcement."
But this cannot be achieved without a detailed knowledge of the place and people.
A specialist would go on er windows in the ghetto, where he would spend up to half of his service, the rest would serve in his district.
In a troubled location, he would oversee order.
He would also know the locals, so he could better solve problems or misdemeanors.
"Thanks to the established trust, specialists will be more easily able to prevent a wide range of infringements," the Interior Ministry said.
Specialists in ghettos would receive surcharges of 500 to 1000 crowns per month.
The introduction of special police officers into problem areas is to be covered by Norwegian funds.
The budget is about 600,000 euros (now about 15.5 million crowns).
The Czech Republic pays 15 percent of the sum, the funds 85 percent.
Preparations started this year, now a detailed proposal is being processed.
The project is expected to last until 2016.
The authors were inspired by the neighbors.
This mechanism has been successfully applied for several years in Slovakia, where the problem with socially excluded locations is incomparably higher than in the Czech Republic.
"There are so-called Roma settlements," the report's authors said.
It is not yet clear how many specialists should be in the Czech Republic.
The answer is to be given by an analysis that determines the places where a special police officer would be needed.
It will also depend on how much money the police will be able to release each year after the project.
According to the project proposal, the first selected police officers will complete an internship in Slovakia.
Five dozen members should undergo this training each year.
From them will come the most suitable candidates.
Special training should also be created for police officers who will operate in ghettos.
According to the authors, social housing would mainly help to improve the situation.
It should motivate and lead to integration, they say.
According to the ideas of the Interior, it would have three categories.
Hostels with well-defined rules, such as the number of people per room, would meet the minimum standard.
The middle standard would be in smaller apartments.
Social housing would have a higher standard, which would be comparable to ordinary housing.
Tenants would have to comply with an integration plan that social workers would draw up with them.
They would have to comply with the accommodation rules, take care of their health, send their children to schools, retrain and actively look for work.
If they tried to integrate, they would move to a higher standard of housing.
According to the Interior, the permeable housing system should work for at least 30 years until the next generation grows "in a pro-integration-motivated environment."
The social housing model is prepared by local development and labour departments.
They're supposed to design it by the end of the year.
Together with Barta, the inspectorate and the anti-corruption police analyst were arrested
News of Vít Bárta's arrest began to spread on Thursday evening, when the news was reported by the Prvnízpravy.cz.
MF DNES soon discovered that the case had been taken care of by the General Inspectorate of Security Forces (GIBS), its people were to arrest Barta in the center of Prague.
It took place outside the Four Seasons Hotel.
The inspection deals with cases where there are police officers among the accused, but its competence also applies to civilians.
According to MF DNES, one of the officers of the anti-corruption police - jan Petržílek, head of analytics and informatics - is among those arrested.
He worked for the Security Information Service in the past.
However, jaroslav Ibehej, a spokesman for the anti-corruption police, declined to comment on the information, saying that the media had to contact GIBS on this matter.
However, radka Sandorová, her spokeswoman for the inspection, did not want to say anything about the case, she immediately referred to the Municipal Prosecutor's Office in Prague.
"We will not comment on this question with regard to the protection of classified information," said Štěpánka Zenklová, a spokeswoman for the prosecutor's office.
It can also be inferred from this vague response that the event took place, but it is in a cover-up mode that does not allow speakers to say anything specific.
Bart's lawyer Oldřich Chudoba is in a similar situation.
He told the media that he represented Barta "in this matter, too," but since it is classified information, he cannot confirm or refute Bart's arrest.
Some media initially speculated that Bart's arrest might be related to former police president Peter Lessy.
This was promoted to the post by Bárta together with the former Chairman of the VV Radek John, who was the head of the Ministry of the Interior.
The dispute that erupted between ex-Prime Minister Petr Nečas and the VV had to be resolved even by the then President Václav Klaus.
I don't know where this connection came from to me.
No one contacted me, I wasn't questioned.
"I don't really know anything about the matter," iDNES.cz Lessy said.
In January 2011, Lessy became chief of police.
Radek John officially promoted him, but bárta was the real leader of the party at the time.
Bárta has now run for election for the Dawn movement, narrowly escaping his seat - by 175 votes.
Dawn leader Tomio Okamura said he had no idea what was going on.
"Vít Bárta was one of the many candidates of many parties on our list, and as I said repeatedly before the elections, he was not or is not a member of The Dawn of Direct Democracy by Tomio Okamura," he distanced himself from Barta Okamura, who said before the elections that he had given Bart the space to run for Dawn because he helped him solve the problem of bailiffs.
Vít Bárta appeared in court in 2012 with his former VV partner Jaroslav Škárka.
Foreign workers with visas may undergo a "legitimacy" test
As the government intends to expand police interventions, it is considering a "eligibility" test for foreign visa-licensed workers.
The test, if adopted, will be applied through criteria to prevent the 457 program from being used to fill unskilled jobs, or as a backdoor for moving family and friends to Australia.
When the government's debate paper was published today, former Labor MP Maxine McKew condemned the government's rhetoric about foreign workers, saying it could offend Australia's neighbours.
"The loud statements of 'foreigners at the end of the queue' and 'work first for Australians' are a very unpleasant relic from when unions demanded a protected labour market," she told the Australian-India Institute today.
Historically, this meant that the white workforce should have been protected – and I wouldn't be surprised if anyone in the region recorded an echo of this historic artifact.
The discussion paper discusses 12 measures previously considered by former Immigration Minister Chris Bowen.
Immigration Minister Brendan O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka yesterday to deal with officials for people smuggling, implemented five of the recommended changes and the rest remain to be considered.
If the criteria of 'eligibility' are accepted, visa applicants may be examined in detail whether 'the nomination is justified in a situation where the candidate is in a relationship or personal connection with the owner or relevant person of the sponsoring undertaking.'
After previous experience with businesses that intended to sponsor a small number of workers but then employed hundreds, businesses may also be required to justify the number of visa holders of 457.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan man seeking asylum died of a suspected heart attack after arriving on an asylum boat on christmas island this week.
The man's frightened nine-year-old son travelled to Australia with him and was comforted by an adult cousin who was also on the boat after his father's death on Wednesday.
Australian authorities rushed the man to a hospital in the Christmas Islands, where he died.
Israeli warplanes attacked target in Syria, official says
Israeli warplanes hit a target in the Syrian port of Lázikiya on Thursday night, an administration official confirmed to Fox News.
This official did not specifically say what the target was, but said there was at least one.
The Associated Press news agency reports that the target was Russian-made SA-125 missiles.
At least twice before this year, Israel had carried out air strikes on missile deliveries in Syria.
She moved from the villa to a block of flats.
Ivana grew up and spent most of her life in an apartment villa with a garden and swimming pool in one of prague's most beautiful residential districts in Ořechovka.
However, the original owners of the house recovered it in restitution and the tenants had to move out with a small severance package.
Ivana was therefore quickly looking for alternative housing for herself and her then older mother.
From friends she received a tip for apartment 3 + kk in an older block of flats on the opposite side of Prague.
"At first it was a shock, but the view from the fourth floor of the extensive forest park and dam exaspered me," ivana recalls at first impression.
At first, I thought it'd be a commission for, like, three years.
"We have lived here for more than thirteen years today and I would not change it because of the gradual reconstruction," adds the owner.
At that time, mother and daughter moved from a 120-meter apartment to a smaller one with an area of 62 m2 and gave away almost all the equipment.
The event was not easy, things were stored with friends and gradual arrangements took almost a year.
The new apartment was in quite good condition, but necessary modifications had to be made, such as painting doors or replacing windows.
The previous owner demolished the core, but the owner was most bothered by the impractically designed and unnecessarily large hall, and on the contrary, the small bathroom.
The combination of two rooms created a multifunctional living space.
The architects used plasterboard to delimit the individual zones and the subdime of the room, which allowed the new location of the lights.
The first intervention she took in a few years was to remove the partition in the living room.
This changed the layout of the apartment to 2 + kk, but the room gained airiness and opened up panoramic views of the surrounding greenery.
The next step towards a partial improvement of the standard was to replace the PVC floor with laminate flooring.
Ivana didn't know what to do with the bathroom.
For years, I've been taking housing magazines looking for inspiration.
In one of them I recently discovered an interesting realization.
On recommendation, I approached the young architect Kamila Douděrová.
"It was actually the most important step for the future," ivana says.
Thanks to the reconstruction of the bathroom, the layout of the hallway was also modified.
The architect combined the toilet and bathroom space and replaced the two doors with opening wings with one sliding one, saving space.
The bathroom is timeless and also wheelchair accessible.
Quality tiles are imbued with sandstone, in the shower there is also a comfortable seat, at the toilet a bidet shower.
Successful cooperation with Kamila Douděrová continued.
As part of the programme How to Build a Dream, a quick but fundamental transformation of the living room took place, in which the architect Martin Čeněk also participated.
We had to get three functions, dining, living and sleeping, into the space, which was created by combining two smaller rooms, without helping each other with the classic principles of optical division, such as semi-partitions or Japanese walls.
"This would ultimately violate the openness and uniformity of space," explains the architect.
The sleeping and living area were originally separated.
All you had to do was turn two sofas back to each other and build a custom-made duvet cabinet between them.
The dining area is defined by shades of flooring and paintings.
The architect used quality marmoleum on the kitchen floor and dining area, and she revived the sliding door with patterned wallpaper.
If necessary, the kitchenette is covered with sliding panels with wallpaper.
The new antiallergic marmoleum floor has many advantages over the previous laminate: a softer, non-slippery, jointless surface and better sound insulation.
The system of plasterboard niches and ceilings highlighted by the color is an example of how to work with space in a block of flats.
I left the colors to the architects, I wished it was joyful.
"I like orange, I had the same shade in my previous apartment," says Ivana.
The grapho-like cladding with a motif of blooming magnolia is practical and creates a distinctive aesthetic element.
For a warm, energetic tone, the architects chose white, which underlined the modern functional style.
In a small apartment, books were stored, among other things, in the space under the window sills.
Everything is at your fingertips, the lamps are comfortably controlled remotely.
In the redesigned interior, the contrast of the new with the older works perfectly, for example with a decades-old crystal chandelier as well as with quality art objects that Ivana collects all her life.
The kitchen was the last one.
The lockers had previously been placed on both sides, and the owner felt a bit like a tunnel.
The architect reduced their number and repositioned them.
Furniture in a simple design is made to order, the white area is softened by a slightly pearly surface.
The small space was used for washing machines, dryers and dishwashers thanks to the imaginative solution.
The appearance of the small kitchen was brought to life by the all-glass wall cladding above the work plate.
The unique graphosk with a digitally printed motif is attractive, in addition, it is excellently maintained.
Ivana chose magnolia flowers that reminded her of the popular neighborhood in which she had lived for years.
Now she seems satisfied here, too.
In the original bathroom there was a small bath and sink, for the new owner she chose a neutral shade of tiling.
The large shower has a Ronal glass door.
The task was to create a clear, simple space from the environment, in which functions and devices would be in harmony.
We unified the interior materially and colorfully and tried its elegant, cozy, not too crowded look.
"Another condition of the assignment was a barrier-free solution with a minimum of obstacles and the possibility of easy movement around furniture and the availability of everyday items," adds Kamila Douděrová.
Minister Holcát has renewed his position as Head Nurse for the Czech Republic
The head nurse for the Czech Republic should represent the interests of nurses whose number in the Czech Republic exceeds 100 thousand.
"I think it is essential that this function be clearly defined and formalised, that nurses have a representative within the structure of the Office - a representative to whom they can always turn if necessary," explained Martin Holcát, Minister of Health.
I appreciate the work of the nurses and I think that the field of nursing deserves to be given due attention by the Ministry as well.
In the pursuit of this profession, not only high professional professionalism is needed, but also a human approach and personal conviction.
"I will be happy and with all my responsibility to try to promote those steps that can improve the position of nurses."
"We have excellent and skilful nurses in our healthcare system, but I would also like to appeal to those colleagues who, with their approach to patients, do not help us much to carry out their calls with all empathy and help us improve the image of nurses in the eyes of the public," says Alena Šmídová.
The newly appointed Head Nurse for the Czech Republic Alena Šmídová also stated on the occasion of her inauguration that she wants to deal with various aspects of the position of nurse and intends, among other things, to cooperate with professional associations, professional companies, educators, other non-medical professions and doctors.
"Fundamentally, I don't want to separate the professions of doctors and nurses, but on the contrary, I see them standing side by side, each with their own competences and, together with other health professionals, forming a well-coordinated working team that provides health services for the benefit of the patient."
"I myself encounter a number of problems that occur in the profession of nurses, I perceive these problems and I intend to participate in their solution."
These include, for example, ensuring simplification of nursing and medical documentation.
"I know from my own experience that some administrative tasks unnecessarily burden nurses and take away the time they could and should devote to patients," says Alena Šmídová.
Other areas he intends to focus on include improving working conditions, finding ways to better cooperate with each other in the team and with the management of health service providers, adjusting competences, as well as labour law issues such as compliance with the Labour Code or not overloading nurses with insufficient numbers at a given time and place.
We often hear anonymous scourings, but for fear of possible sanctions, they are not documented in a specific case where violations could occur.
"Where there is no plaintiff, there is no judge, so the function of the Head Nurse of the Czech Republic in this case could serve as a guarantee of the anonymity of such a complaint and have the specific case examined by the competent authorities," concludes Alena Šmídová.
Mgr. Alena Šmídová graduated from the Secondary Medical School in the field of Nurse (graduated in 1978) and the Faculty of Arts of Charles University in Prague in the study programme Nursing - Pedagogy (graduated in 1992).
Since 2010, he has been head of the Department of Nursing and Other Non-Medical Disciplines and Recognition of Qualifications at the Department of Education and Science of the Ministry of Education and Science of the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports.
During her professional career, she worked as a bedside nurse in the internal department, and as a teacher at the Secondary Medical School, where she was also a statutory deputy director for 8 years.
From 2004 to 2009 she worked as the head nurse of the Prison Service of the Czech Republic.
She published several professional nursing textbooks and articles in professional journals, devoted herself to lecture activities in the field of nursing.
She is not a member of any political party.
Guillaume Nicloux has adapted Denis Diderot's novel, which brings an exceptional cinematic journey and rendition of the times, but is also more boring than it should be.
It unfolds in 1860s France and tells a bleak story about Suzanne, a young noblewoman who is sent to a monastery by her family.
When she rebels, she experiences extremely cruel treatment from the reprehensible mother superior, and for another she becomes the object of sexual passion.
The film never slides into a scheming or sensationalism, and that's its problem.
The ceremonial nature of this story leads to viewers experiencing an anaesthymage similar to wearing a linen shirt.
Jana Péťová: Step Back.
So I decided to take a step back, but come to think of it, it's not really a step at all, but a big leap - a leap a few years back, and that's into memories, into my childhood.
It's a memory of what it was like to have no worries and just come home from school and do the dishes, vacuum and do my homework.
Although these "duties" were mostly just a theory, the wishes of parents.
The practice was completely different - running home from school, throwing a bag in a corner and running outside.
Play ball games with other kids, jump shots.
Then, during the series Helena and her boys embroidered a ceremonial tablecloth for grandma's birthday with a chain stitch.
And only then, after several warnings, to finally wash the dishes, vacuum, in winter put wood in the quarry stoves and do the tasks only after dark under the lamp (or rely on a classmate and instead of the tasks to write love verses addressed to school love).
In the morning, have breakfast of homemade strawberry jam (from real fruit, not the kind of jams that are sold now, the contents of which did not even lie next to strawberries) and drink it with tea from dried herbs that my mom and I loved to collect.
I also remember those magical evenings when there was a grave silence in the room when my sister and I were recording radio songs on tapes that were loudly filmed in my mom's old tape recorder.
And then we rewinded the tapes on a tinge and played the same song over and over again, our favorite, and toasted with a siphon.
Or we talked on the phone across the table using cans that were tied together with a string - and while we were on the phone to get a better hearing, it was necessary to clean our ears thoroughly, the earful at the time was a match + wool.
The minimum wage was more than three times lower than it is now, and my parents were able to live off it in a way that we didn't miss.
We didn't need any of those iPhones, iPads or even cell phones and laptops or designer clothes.
Clothes were passed down from generation to generation, and the best "addition" to the wardrobe was a batik T-shirt made with the help of SAVA.
From the electronics, the aforementioned mother's tape recorder was enough for us, and at most the Walkman, which my sister and I shared and which, by the way, we used anyway only on the train on a school trip.
We found it more interesting to play with AuntIe Hat Hop or Man, don't be angry, or as I said to go "just" out.
When I was a little older we got a video player under the tree, surely my parents saved for it for a long time, but unfortunately it did not warm up for a long time.
My little sister stuffed strudel into him, said he was so beautifully stuffing the tapes, so she tried to see if he could sleep the strudel.
Unfortunately, he fell through, but it was his last bite.
Well, he still has this story, poor thing, on his dad's plate all the time.
She says that when Lenka was little, she shove strudel into a video and thought he was going to play her recipe and not play it, which is why she still can't bake it.
I remember how we were all able to communicate with each other, communicate without a cell phone, a computer.
My sister and I arranged with our neighbor's granddaughter on holiday, when we would meet again next summer at grandma's - and that was it, that's the way it was.
We met.
Now promise to see someone in a year?!
I also remember the winter when we used to run outside with the whole village, build snowmen, ride on a snowy hill by the church on hay-stuffed bags.
Then my whole family and I had dinner and talked about the past day.
Of course, my sister and I used to hear that notorious line before every dinner: "Go wash your hands!"
Yes, that's true today, but I'm sure you don't have soap tied to your bathroom with a lemon net.
After dinner, when dad was "working" in the garage having a beer with Jarda from the village, my mom and I lay on the floor, rested our feet on the embed stove, opened the door and looked at the flame, listening to the crackling of wood that was licking from the stove.
We were closer - really - we didn't count how many friends we had on social media, we knew how many friends we had, the real ones!
We communicated - we talked - we didn't write messages daily through different cabins, messages.
There was no such thing, and yet we knew a lot more about each other.
And I could go on like this for a long time.
It's nice to remember, especially if I add to those memories by looking at albums that are neatly glued with black corners induced by black-and-white photos.
And if I didn't know how old I was then, the back of the photo is always written the year the picture was taken.
I see that even though the pot haircuts didn't suit us very well and we had our cousin's trousers two sizes bigger, no one had laughed at us before, it was so normal (not IN).
And I'd rather go back to that step forward - reality.
Until 2013, and I'll be waiting to see what modern times can come up with for my kids someday.
What I do know for sure is that these memories of me are now at least somewhere "a hundred years behind the apes" for the young adolescent generation, and I think they're missing out a lot, that they're not going to experience this "pre-monkey" time either.
I wish they could!
Savings must be made, young Czechs know.
But most of them don't even know what interest
More and more Czechs are putting their money aside.
However, they do not reach the savings champions in the region.
Austrians, who save an average of €181 a month, save the most money on the side.
People in Slovakia save a little more than Czechs.
This results from a survey by the Erste Savings Barometer group in central and eastern European countries.
It also showed that the mood of savers is improving, with two-thirds of respondents planning to set aside more money.
While Czechs are roughly in the middle of the savers' rankings, in Romania and Serbia people still use very little of the savings products.
For example, almost one in two Serbs saves at home "under a pillow," according to the survey.
In the Czech Republic, the number of those who save higher amounts per month has increased this year.
As recently as last year, 26 percent of respondents spent 1,000 to 2.5 thousand crowns on various types of savings every month, up five percent this year.
However, the average monthly rate decreased slightly to CZK 2078 in the year-on-year comparison.
The biggest hit among savings products is supplementary pension insurance.
This is preferred by 54 percent of Czechs, while three years ago it was the most popular way to evaluate savings for only 36 percent of people.
On the contrary, the popularity of building savings is declining, compared to last year, interest in investment funds also decreased significantly.
Only 16 percent of respondents use them, compared to almost a quarter last year.
The survey also showed that while people consider it important to save, most of them do not know what revenues they achieve on individual products.
Young people under the age of 30, in particular, do not know how their money is remediated.
On the contrary, the oldest group of respondents has the best awareness of the profitability of their deposited money, among people over 50, 73 percent of respondents know this.
In international comparison, Erste Group Czechs lead in the use of online banking, which is regularly used by 44 percent of people.
They are followed by Slovaks and Austrians with a 12% margin.
Australian woman appeals against being in Thai prison
A 21-year-old Sydney woman who was sentenced to 15 days in prison on Phuket Island after falsely claiming she was attacked by a taxi driver has appealed the verdict and has been released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was originally charged by phuket county court on June 15 with perjury after she told Thai police that a taxi driver and two other men allegedly detained her assaulted her in the early hours of Sunday, June 10.
However, cctv footage later revealed that she had returned safely to her hotel after breaking up with her Australian boyfriend.
Phuket Island police interviewed Bamford for two days before confessing to making up the incident.
She was held in a local police cell before the trial.
Bamford was sentenced to 15 days in a low-security correctional facility on the periphery of Phuket instead of being placed in an adult women's prison.
She is the daughter of former Australian league player Peter Tunks, who asked the Department of Foreign Affairs in Canberra for help in his daughter's case.
Tunks told sydney's Sunday Telegraph that the whole family had "extreme concerns" about their daughter's fate and wanted her back in Australia.
"It's obviously a challenging time, but we hope he'll come back to us safely as soon as possible," Tunks said.
Bamford appealed the sentence and was released on $50,000 bail.
Reports from Australia state that in the meantime she was holidaying in the Krabi recreation area in southern Thailand.
Legal sources in Thailand claim that Bamford was represented by a local lawyer in Phuket, but she was warned that an appeal could lead to a trial that would increase her sentence and result in an adult prison.
But after the recent murder of Australian travel agent Michelle Smith in Phuket, Thailand may also be trying to rectify a bruised picture for tourists, which may have just been behind the acquittal.
Michal Horáček introduced his new double album, band and three singers
Lyricist Michal Horáček brought not only his brand new doubleCD Czech Calendar to the hall of the Cologne Municipal Social House, but especially in the programme Between Us singers Lenka Nova, František Segrad and Ondra Ruml accompanied by the excellent Matěj Benek Orchestra.
After the opening intro and the acting ethos about the delayed musician, Michal Horáček gradually invited all three singers to the stage, he himself came with a candle in his hand, reminding us of the story of the last time they played in Kolín and in the theatre and the whole city went out of power.
"Otherwise, they made two kinds of cards in Kolín, which I came into contact with a lot," he recalled.
He also recalled a native of President Zeman.
"Maybe we could do a tour of Zákolany or Dúbravka near Bratislava," he joked about the birthplaces of other presidents.
Several times in the evening, Horáček, who did not leave the stage and, if he did not speak, sat at the table with a glass of wine, touched on his new musical achievement.
The calendar was also made by Josef Mánes, who put it on the astronomical clock, but at that time he had no idea about ice hockey, how we meet in those squares and chant who does not jump, is not Czech.
That's the name of one song from the Czech calendar, but we're not going to play it here today," he said.
Ondra Ruml sang from this record, however, that he was very suitable for him To sleep in the daytime, sing at night and accompany himself on guitar.
Otherwise, if he did not sing, he played percussion, all three singers were accompanied by a band composed of keyboards, cello, guitar and double bass.
All three vocalists sang together a little sing a little shriad into the hillside of the heart, which immediately stirred up the auditorium.
"I'm glad you were interested in the song, which didn't surprise me in Kmoch's town," Michal Horáček responded afterwards.
After the memory of Petr Hapka, I recognized františek segrad, in the original by Richard Müller rewarded with a huge applause, Hana Hegerová was reminded of the song Dad liked Lída Baarová with Horace's explanation about the communist ban and baarová's replacement by the American actress Mae Westová.
Composer Michael Kocáb was reminded of the composition Sebastián, segrado then sang a beautiful composition Prague by Jarda Svoboda, a native of Zasmuk and a former Kolíňák.
But that was the end, a standing ovation and an encore in the form of the optimistic song We Live in Wonderful Times.
There was another encore on the playlist, but it was no longer applauded by fans.
Almost immediately after the concert, the whole four of them sat at the table to sign not only the Czech calendar, but also older CDs, Michal Horáček's books and even the cover from the legendary LP and took a picture with potential interested parties.
Recently, CEZ's Ceo announced that he was postponing the decision on the construction of the 3rd and 4th blocks of the Temelín power plant until the end of 2014 or 2015.
He justified this by waiting for a new State Energy Concept and agreeing to contracts of difference by the government.
For these reasons, CEZ's current management is trying to transfer its responsibility to the government - that is, for the majority shareholder.
But a qualified manager should give a recommendation to the shareholder, not hide behind it.
Clive Palmer says Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest over the parental leave scheme
Billionaire MP Clive Palmer says Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest over the parental leave scheme because his daughters can get pregnant and benefit from it.
The mining magnate, who is in dispute over paying a $6 million coal tax bill, made the claim as he tried to take the question of whether he had a conflict of interest off the table.
Palmer's United Party can control up to four votes in the Senate, which play a crucial role in deciding whether to levy taxes on coal and mining activities.
But Mr Palmer argued that only ministers could have a conflict of interest, adding that Abbott's daughters were in a position to benefit from the policy.
"He got into a big conflict of interest when it came to paid parental leave, because if any of his daughters got pregnant, he would have a direct interest in whether she would get parental leave," Mr Palmer said.
Two months after the election, the Electoral Commission officially declared Mr Palmer the winner of the race for the Fairfax seat in the Sunshine Coast region by a margin of 53 votes.
Mr Palmer called for a review of the election results to speed up the process.
Tony Abbott's daughters Frances and Bridget.
Should this election be decided two months after polling stations are closed?
"We must have a better system," he said.
Why can't we have a system where you can come in, tapping the details into your computer, voting immediately, and having results at 6:30 p.m.?
Mr Palmer also criticised the use of austere to mark ballots.
The point is, can results be erased if someone doesn't like them?
These days and at this time, the use of the austere seems incredible.
The Electoral Commission has studied the possibilities of electronic voting and recently issued a joint contribution to the debate with New Zealand.
Mr Palmer (59) said his policy agenda extends to airports in the Sunshine Coast area and that he would take his new job "very seriously."
A public office is a public service.
"We are not looking for any reward except to serve society at this critical time," he said.
Six out of ten companies are preparing for the new Civil Code
Six out of ten companies are intensively preparing for the impending effectiveness of the new Civil Code and the Commercial Corporations Act from 1 January 2014.
Only eight percent of the firms surveyed said they had not addressed issues related to the two key codes in their company.
This results from a survey by Ambruz & Dark Deloitte Legal, which surveyed the opinions of 108 Czech companies.
As the effective date of both key codes approaches, it is only now at the last minute that many managers are beginning to realise how much influence they can have on their companies' business.
In our opinion, the biggest changes in private law in the last 50 years will affect all citizens and companies in the Czech Republic.
Because of politicians' lagging, the business sector has long been uncertain whether or not revolutionary changes will eventually happen.
"Now, however, they have only a few weeks left to make the transition to the new law without complications for their companies," commented Jan Spáčil, partner of Ambruz & Dark Deloitte Legal.
Of the 61 percent of companies heavily involved in the new laws, 26 percent said their companies had already taken all necessary measures to be ready in time.
Furthermore, 35 percent of companies in this number are preparing to take the necessary measures in the near future.
By contrast, one in five companies has not yet dealt with recodifications, yet they have a concrete idea of how to prepare for them.
A total of 11 percent have no opinion and cannot assess the issue.
Only eight percent of companies admit that they have not yet addressed the issues related to recodifications.
The most important legal issue related to the new Civil Code for the largest number of companies surveyed is the conclusion of new contracts (21 percent), followed by the resolution of terms and conditions (16 percent), as well as changes in the land register and liability for damages (ten percent each).
For contracts, one of the most important innovations of the entire recodification will take place, which is the unification of the treaty arrangements only within the framework of the new Civil Code.
The current parallel regulation in both the Civil and Commercial Code will disappear, as a result of which the contract law should become clearer for citizens and entrepreneurs.
"In the case of entrepreneurs, the new regulation will offer a lot of news with an emphasis on greater freedom of organization of relationships," said Lukáš Poddaný, a lawyer at Ambruz & Dark Deloitte Legal.
In the context of the Corporations Act, almost a quarter of companies consider the issue of increasing the liability of statutory bodies to be the most important issue.
The following are topics related to changes in the convening and course of the general meeting (15 percent) and the representation of the company (14 percent).
The new legislation means tightening up obligations and possible impacts for statutory bodies, especially in situations where a company is in danger of going into decline or falling into it.
"In practice, this means that if the members of the boards and the executives of the companies do not act with the care of a proper manager and avert the impending decline of the company, they may lose the benefit gained for the performance of their duties only in the last two years," added Spáčil.
NSA revelations increase social paranoia of surveillance by the state
One peaceful day in late August, a German police helicopter buzzed over the U.S. Consular Office in Frankfurt, the capital of the German economy.
At the behest of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV), Germany's domestic intelligence agency, the purpose of the mission was to take photographs of the roof of the American forward patrol, which is located less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
German media say the BfV hoped to identify the presence of listening antennas, and the event triggered an exchange of views between the US and German foreign ministers in Berlin.
James Clapper, america's director of national intelligence, insisted again in September that the United States was not using its foreign intelligence capabilities "to steal the trade secrets of foreign companies for the benefit of American companies, the way they strengthen their international competitiveness or increase their profits."
But ever since Edward Snowden, who went from associate to informant, began uncovering his valuable collection from covert surveillance by the United States, European governments and business leaders no longer know whether to believe the director's words.
After reports that the US National Security Agency was spying on a Brazilian oil company and gained access to data available to US cloud providers including Google and Yahoo, the general paranoia about state surveillance has reached new proportions.
The final straw came with the revelation that Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone may have been bugged for a decade.
If the most powerful person in Europe can be targeted, then leading entrepreneurs are certainly potential targets.
Snowden has made the intense cooperation between US intelligence services and companies more transparent.
I would say that it is possible that this data is being used for mutual benefit.
"Germany needs to wake up," said Oliver Grün, president of BITMi, which represents small and medium-sized IT companies in Germany.
According to a survey released in July by the consultancy EY, German companies believe that the US now poses as much risk as China when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft.
But so far, there is no evidence in the entire dossier revealed by Mr Snowden that the United States passed on trade secrets of foreign firms to its own companies.
Politicians expressed concern that the EU lacked certain IT and Internet capabilities and said it should seek to reduce its dependence on the US:
Business leaders are skeptical.
There are voices from the German Parliament that we should make a German Google.
I can just close my eyes and slowly open them again...
That's not the way, says Hasso Plattner, chairman of German software company SAP.
If someone wanted a strong European IT industry, they shouldn't have let them die 20 years ago.
Everything in Germany is subsidized, from coal to cars and farmers.
Everything but the IT industry.
Yet the scale and technical sophistication of the US spy agencies revealed by Snowden is shocking to some companies, who have so far believed that China poses the greatest threat from surveillance.
There is a big turnaround in cloud computing, where European leaders have more broadly recognized that data stored in the US falls under its jurisdiction and is therefore potentially challengeable.
According to a survey conducted by the Cloud Security Alliance, about 10 percent of non-U.S. members canceled plans to use a U.S.-based cloud provider after the unveiling of the U.S. Prism data mining program.
Jim Snabe, one of SAP's CEOs, says: "We have a new question for customers that wasn't here a year ago - where is my data stored and can you guarantee that it will physically remain in this jurisdiction?"
Many German high-powered officials argue that the latest reports are just confirmation of what they already knew: that powerful states want to steal their most valuable secrets, and that data must be protected at all costs.
That economic espionage is being carried out is no surprise.
It's always been happening.
"This has been a fundamental issue for many years, and it hasn't changed significantly during the current discussion," says Kurt Bock, CEO of BASF, an agrochemicals company.
The Americans are spying on us at a commercial and industrial level, just as we are spying on them because it is in our national interest to defend our businesses.
Corporate leaders generally don't want to brag about the countermeasures they've taken to potentially give the attacker an advantage.
In the case of large companies, it has long been recalled that taking a free USB storage disk at the fair or leaving an unprotected laptop in a hotel room is, to say the least, unreasonable.
Ulrich Hackenberg, a board member of Audi, says it has been common practice for many years to collect mobile phones before a board meeting so that they cannot be used as a listening device.
Germany's BfV advises executives to consider using simple prepaid mobile phones on foreign trips because of the risk that smartphones can be embezzed.
Prepaid mobile phones are then thrown away.
However, there is a concern that SMEs will continue to be vulnerable to hacking and surveillance.
In Germany, many of these companies are global market leaders in their specific areas.
"SMEs often lack the experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect corporate secrets against unauthorised access," the BfV warns in its report.
The US warns its own companies against economic espionage by other countries.
According to the Washington Post, US national intelligence estimate documents in February put France alongside Russia and Israel in the second row of perpetrators involved in hacking for economic intelligence, just behind China.
A board member at a German risk-free society concluded that when it comes to economic espionage, "the French are the worst."
Bernard Squarcini, the former head of France's internal intelligence agency DCRI, said in an interview this month: "The services know perfectly well that all countries, even when cooperating in the fight against terrorism, are spying on their allies."
New nicotine vaccine can take away the pleasures of smoking
Scientists have developed a nicotine vaccine that can take away the pleasure of smoking a cigarette.
A single dose of the vaccine was able to protect the mouse from nicotine addiction for life.
Before human trials, more tests need to be performed that will take several years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of Weill Cornell Medical School in New York says the early signs are good.
"We strongly hope that this kind of vaccination strategy can finally help the millions of smokers who have tried to quit and exhausted all the methods available on the market today, but have found that their nicotine addiction is strong enough to overcome all current approaches," Professor Cornell said.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been designed to carry genetic information to create anti-nicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects the liver cells, which then begin to form a smooth stream of these antibodies.
Antibodies haunt all nicotine molecules in the bloodstream and neutralize them before they reach the brain, preventing the smoker from getting nicotine hit.
In the tests, vaccinated mice that were additionally supplied with nicotine continued their normal activities.
But mice that were not vaccinated "calmed down," the researchers said, a sign that nicotine had entered their brains.
The experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.
Injections had to be given so often as to maintain sufficient levels of antibodies, so they proved expensive and impractical.
The cost of new vaccines should be much lower, since they convert liver cells into antibody factories.
Professor Crystal said that if future vaccines are completely safe for humans, they could be given to children before they want to try a cigarette, thus avoiding nicotine addiction.
However, it would be much more likely to be used by smokers to stop.
"They'll know that if they start smoking again, they won't get any benefit from the nicotine vaccine, and that will help them get rid of that habit," he said.
British scientists said the results were interesting, but cautioned that more research was needed.
The Desperate Cry of Obama's Voter
I voted for Obama twice – I shared hope for a possible change
He says Obama's sincere efforts derailed the Republican Party's filibuster
Obstructionary Policy Cannot Excuse the Woes of Obamacare Websites or Drone Strikes
Obama's 2008 campaign memoir is a sad reminder of what may have happened
Nathaniel P. Morris is in his second year of medical school at Harvard.
I read a very sad book these days.
I thought this book would cheer me up during the gloomy days of my second year at medical school and restore a modind of hope in me.
It's called "The Audacity to Win" and it's a reel of Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign.
When I finish my patient reviews in the evening and go to bed, the book brings me back to a time when politics inspired millions of people and speeches took your breath away.
The election ended in overwhelming dominance, and television news made us reflect on the historical value of this moment.
My classmates wept with joy, and my parents kept the newspaper they could get.
A young team of visionaries headed to the White House, and the nation was ready for change.
During his inauguration in 2008, Obama had 82 percent support.
And this is where I close the book.
Going into the present is a rude awakening, like waking up from a dream.
It's hard to remember these optimistic days – they seem distant memories, sad reminders of missed opportunities.
Indeed, in the years after I threw in my first ballot, there have been changes.
It was definitely nothing I imagined.
I recognize that Obama has achieved a number of great and varied achievements – from the Affordable Care Act to the removal of our troops from Iraq and the end of the "ask no questions, say nothing" policy after the killing of Osama bin Laden.
Moreover, I believe that partisan obstruction has reversed so many efforts to move our nation forward: immigration reform, the public's ability to choose health care, and the closure of the Guantanamo base, among other things.
But after many situations where I defended the Obama administration in front of colleagues and friends, I have reached an absolute limit in terms of the explanations they can provide.
I found myself in a place of political despair.
The Republican filibuster cannot explain agreeing to eavesdrop on foreign leaders or drone strikes that kill innocent children overseas.
They cannot explain the fact that the National Security Agency collects data on Americans' private lives, nor that it pursues those who expose government misconduct.
They cannot be held responsible for the execution of Anwar al-Awlaki, an American citizen, without due process, or for cutting public contributions and spending during presidential campaigns.
They cannot justify the findings of a report that says the White House's efforts to silence the media are "the most aggressive ... from the Nixon administration".
And most recently, they can't even excuse the inability to create a simple website more than three years after the Affordable Care Act was signed.
I don't know if that's what to expect.
Whether, at the age of 18, I should have known that government power might conflict with the political campaigns that preceded it.
Elected office is clearly not predictable, and our public conversations will be shaped by an opposition political party and random events like the Newton massacre.
However, all the examples I have given above largely appear to be the result of the administration's own decision.
And that's what bothers me the most.
I voted for Obama again in 2012, but not because I was excited about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney was a confused and unassued alternative, and he seemed unable to consolidate his policies or position.
I had a feeling that a second term for Obama, free from the pressure of the next election, would fulfill the hopes we had once heard of.
Yet returning to 2008 – with Obama's support falling below 45% this week – is getting harder with this book.
It makes me remember the many promises that have disappeared.
This week, I read a chapter in my book about how Obama suffered a crushing defeat to Clinton in the Pennsylvania primary.
At an additional meeting during the campaign, he told his staff that he had to get back on pace and stay true to his mission.
"I want our magic back," he said.
We mustn't forget who we are.
Five years have passed, Mr. President, and I completely agree with you.
The ideas expressed in this commentary are exclusively those of Nathaniel Morris.
The shop and marketing of ŠkoFIN is led by Abraham
Its competences include product and marketing and strengthening cooperation with business partners.
He replaced Ludek Šantora.
Abraham has connected the last 14 years of his professional career with the automotive sector.
He worked at Toyota Motor Czech, then at Fiat ČR, where he was responsible for the Alfa Romeo brand and dealers for seven years.
His last job was Suzuki Motor Czech, where he held the position of manager of the automotive division for over five years.
ŠkoFIN was established in 1992.
Syria has destroyed its means of producing chemical weapons, says supervisory authority
Syria has destroyed vital equipment for the production of chemical weapons and poison gas mummies, the Committee on Global Chemical Weapons Oversight said on Thursday, as fierce conflicts erupted in the north of the country, not far from one of the sites where toxic substances are expected to be stored.
Also on Thursday, a Syrian activist group said that more than 120,000 people have been killed since the civil war began nearly three years ago.
The announcement by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons came the day before November 1,
the deadline set by this Organisation, based in The Hague, for the destruction or dismantling of all chemical weapons and chemical mixing machinery to create toxic gas and to supply ammunition.
The completion of this essentially initial phase of destruction is an important milestone in an ambitious timetable that aims to destroy all of Damascus' chemical weapons by mid-2014.
The destruction of equipment means that Syria will no longer be able to produce new chemical weapons.
But Damascus has yet to begin the destruction of existing weapons and supplies.
The country is believed to have about 1,000 tons of chemicals and weapons, including mustard gas and sarin nerve gas.
The announcement came as fighting raged in the city of Safira on Thursday, which experts say is the headquarters of a chemical weapons factory and storage, the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said.
The activist group, which monitored the total number of victims through a network of activists in Syria, reported on Thursday that 120,296 people had died.
Of these, 61,067 are to be civilians, including 6,365 children.
The ruling party is to have 29,954 members of Bashar al-Assad's armed forces, 18,678 pro-government fighters and 187 militants from Lebanon's Hezbollah.
Among those killed are 2,202 government defectors and some 5,375 opposition fighters, many of them foreigners.
On July 25, the UN estimated that 100,000 people had died in the conflict since March 2011.
This number has not been updated since.
The conflict has forced some 2 million people to leave the country.
Assad's forces have been fighting insurgents in Safira, many of whom are affiliated with Al Qaeda, for weeks.
The Observatory said on Thursday that the losses were on both sides, but did not have specific figures.
The fighting has underscored the danger faced by chemical weapons inspectors, who face tight deadlines in their mission to rid Syria of its chemical arsenal amid syria's ongoing civil war.
A statement from the OPCW, which works closely with the UN, said his team was now "satisfied that it has verified – and monitored the destruction – of Syria's declared essential equipment for production and mixing/filling."
He added that "no further control activities are currently planned."
Earlier this week, inspectors said they had completed the first round of verification work, visiting 21 of the 23 sites declared by Damascus.
Inspectors said they were unable to visit two locations due to security concerns.
On Thursday, the OPCW said that according to Syria, the two sites had been "abandoned and ... the chemical weapons programme items it contained have been moved to two other declared sites that have been checked'.
It was not immediately clear whether the facility in Safira was one of those places that OPCW inspectors could not visit.
Syria has agreed to a plan to completely destroy its chemical weapons, which must be approved next month by the OPCW's executive committee.
"I bow to the courage and bravery you have shown in fulfilling this most demanding mission this organization has ever had," said Observer Director Ahmet Uzumcu in a commentary issued by the OPCW.
Now in its third year, sunni Muslim rebels and assad's government, with their security forces full of members of the Alawite sect, an offshoot of Shiite Islam, are facing each other in the civil war.
As for further developments, the head of the Observatory, Rami Abdul Rahman, said there was a powerful explosion inside an air defense facility in Syria's coastal province of Lázikiya on Wednesday.
He said the cause of the explosion was unknown.
Gazprom's Alexei Miller says pipeline in Bulgaria usesunate new gas era
The start of construction of the South Stream gas pipeline in Bulgaria marks the launch of one of Europe's largest energy projects, the gazprom director said.
"Today we are witnessing a milestone: Construction has begun on the Bulgarian part of the South Stream gas pipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe," Gazprom President Alexei Miller said in a statement.
This project is a key element of the energy security of the entire European continent.
The South Stream pipeline should add diversity to Russian export routes through Europe.
The contractual dispute between Gazprom and its partners in Ukraine, which brings most of Russia's gas to Europe, adds to the riskiness of conventional routes, officials say.
Miller says that direct access to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means that geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are "removed" "once and for all."
Once the project starts operations in 2015, Bulgarian consumers will receive gas from the South Stream pipeline at a discounted price.
Gazprom says construction is due to begin in other countries in the direction of the flow later this year.
The pipeline is designed for an annual capacity of 2.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.
Early puberty: Mature earlier
Research has shown that African-American women and Hispanic women reach puberty earlier than their white peers.
Physical changes don't mean puberty is coming
It is not proven that hormones or other chemicals are behind this
Experts say that one of the triggers of earlier puberty may be the obesity epidemic.
The trend of early puberty is not so noticeable in boys.
Former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist who specializes in children's health and family issues.
Should a mother be horrified when her daughter's breasts and pubic hair start growing at 7 or 8 years old?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics this week in Orlando, Florida, pediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz explained that these physical changes are quite common among American girls and represent a new standard.
"I've spent a lot of time making sure my parents that it's not usually a sign of rapid development toward full puberty," Kaplowitz said.
Visible signs of development, such as breast growth, pubic hair and armpits, and body odo, appear earlier in girls.
In the last forty years, however, there has been little shift in the age at which the first menstruation occurs.
In the United States, the average age is now 12.5 years, compared to 12.75 in 1970.
"When breasts start to develop, it's at least two to three years before the first menstruation occurs," said Kaplowitz, who is also the author of "Early Puberty in Girls: The Essential Guide to Coping with This Common Problem."
The most reliable test of how puberty will continue is time.
It is discussed what activates the actual beginning of puberty, but if breast growth is accompanied by a growth spurt before the age of 8, the girl is considered "precocious".
In most cases, the process slows down or stops – which can be closely monitored by children's doctors.
Faster growth may be a reason for the endocrinologist to perform tests to eliminate serious problems such as a tumor or cyst.
There are treatments that delay early menstruation and prevent other consequences: premature bone aging, which can eventually lead to a halt in growth and stunting in adulthood.
Recommendations on medications and hormonal treatment depend on the child's age, speed of development, growth rate and emotional maturity.
Psychosociological aspects are also important.
When it comes to the use of drugs, Kaplowitz is cautious, but acknowledges that "suppressing puberty can alleviate problems with a girl's behavior and her feelings that she differs from her peers."
Understandable is another big problem: Parents simply don't want their very young daughters to have menstruation.
"They're worried that she might get pregnant or manage hygiene," Kaplowitz said.
"It was a shock," recalls one woman whose daughter began her period at the age of 10.
Although there were hints and we talked about menstruation, she wasn't prepared emotionally.
She came home from school scared and angry that she was the first of her friends.
There are many well-known theories about the causes of premature puberty.
However, there is not yet a continuous body of evidence that hormones in milk or other foods, environmental chemicals or sexual messages in the media are to blame.
Boys – like girls – reach puberty earlier.
Kaplowitz advocates the assumption that the obesity epidemic is the most serious reason.
In 2001, he helped conduct a study in girls aged 6 to 9 years that linked body fat to the timing of puberty.
Other findings support this conclusion, but there are many other contributing factors.
In this country, African-American women and Hispanic women tend to reach puberty before their white counterparts.
Explanations vary.
From a global perspective, early puberty patterns seem to be influenced by everything from economic conditions to climates to genes.
Another puzzle: Although boys already experience facial hair and pubic hair at a young age, the trend towards the full flowering of early puberty is not as pronounced as that of girls.
Other doctors attending the American Association of PediatricIans (AAP) conference added more complexity to the topic.
Acne and pubic hair are common even in infants and toddlers.
"We have to be careful about how we identify the actual onset of puberty," said Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric endocrinologist at Goryeb Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to get instructions from their pediatrician on how to talk to their child.
"It may mean having to talk to the child sooner than you'd expect," Kaplowitz advised.
If you stay calm, your child will probably react well.
Girls who develop earlier need reassurance that even if it happens prematurely, this process is a normal part of life.
Hezbollah has sent thousands of fighters to Syria.
They're in for a decisive battle.
Lebanon's Hezbollah movement has deployed 15,000 of its fighters north of Damascus in preparation for a decisive battle for the mountainous kalamoon region.
According to increasingly advanced reports, Israel destroyed missiles intended specifically for Hezbollah in wednesday's airstrikes on two locations in western Syria.
This Lebanese Shiite organization is fighting in Syria on the side of its military.
Its agenda is also the fight against Israel, which is not meddly in the Syrian conflict, but has made it clear that it will prevent the transfer of armaments to Hezbollah's hands in Lebanon.
Reports of Israeli airstrikes on weapons depots in western Syria on Wednesday are yet to be released.
Israel has not commented on the attack, but U.S. sources have confirmed it.
According to the Syrian Dampress.com, missiles fired from the Mediterranean sea area hit the Syrian missile base Snúbar Jabla south of Latakia.
Al-Arabiya news station claims that two warehouses were hit, where the missiles were ready for transport to Lebanon.
According to its sources, they were Russian-made SA-8 missiles.
Israel declined to comment on the report, but military analyst Ron ben Yishai said Syria is constantly trying to supply Hezbollah with missiles, and the Syrian Air Force is teaching members of Hezbollah's armed section to handle the missiles.
SA-8s are outdated missiles that the Syrian army has had since the 1980s.
They are placed on a movable chassis.
Although they are quite primitive, thanks to mobility and small dimensions, they can be easily hidden.
They are equipped with radar, but they shut down when the missile is fired, making them difficult to lock on to.
Latakia lies in western Syria, an area inhabited by the ruling Alávitas.
It is a well-guarded area, and Hezbollah has been involved in fighting in western Syria in the past.
He claims to be helping to protect Syria's Shiite community, to which the Alavites belong.
Now 15,000 of his fighters are reportedly ready to help retake the army from Calamoun.
Along with Hezbollah, the Syrian army is also strengthening its forces there.
Kalamoon lies between Damascus and homs, the country's third largest city.
The battle is intended to be retaliation for the recent attack by the opposition on the headquarters of Abu Fadl Abbas' Syrian Shiite Brigade in the Shiite part of Damascus, according to an al-Arabiya source.
Hezbollah helped the Syrian army re-take back the town of Kusayr near the Lebanese border this year.
Many of the insurgents from Kusayr have just left for Kalamun.
In it, he argues that Máliki has a large part to do with the resuasurment of sectarian violence in Iraq, which he says is partly due to the fighting in neighboring Syria.
Sobotka negotiates for ČSSD.
Social democracies are crumbling, the People's Party and the Babišovs are talking to each other and are preparing a common approach.
If the Social Democrats get confused in a few weeks, they will sit at the negotiating table with perfectly coordinated partners who will put a ready-made list of demands, including ministerial posts, on the table.
Čssd envoys then either swallow the sour coalition grapes or nod to a fickle minority government.
Bohuslav Sobotka first stumbled upon the wave of sympathy after four days of carrying himself.
Yesterday, he failed to control the political committee and, most importantly, force convicted liars to resign.
So far, only he is the confirmed negotiator for the party, the other members of the team will be allowed only after a key meeting of the Central Executive Committee (ÚVV).
I apologized to the members of the committee and now to the citizens.
You're not supposed to lie, in your personal life or in public.
"It was a mistake," Michal Hašek said after the meeting of the closest leadership of the Social Democrats.
He added that he was not a first vice-president.
"I will communicate my decision to the IAEA on 10 November," hašek said.
Zdeněk Škromach, Vice-President of the ČSSD and Jeroným Tejc, head of the Parliamentary Group, spoke similarly.
However, he pointed out that he had been elected only two days ago.
Both Members then stated that they would do their 50-member ČSSD club to sound with one voice.
Michal Hašek crowned the absurd theatre with the sentence: "I have been a member of the ČSSD for fifteen years, I have always been loyal to its brand and respected the decision of the party authorities."
So another lie on live TV.
Or perhaps when calling for Sobotka's resignation and his removal from the negotiating team, he forgot that the August IOU had decided with 57 percent that Bohuslav Sobotka was the party's candidate for prime minister?
However, the head of the ČSSD, by convening the IAEA until next Sunday, produced a powerful army of enemies.
His opponents have 10 days to flood the emails of the 192 members of the body and the media with a smaug of rumors and rumors, possibly recalling the real mistakes of Sobotka's political career.
Dirty laundry will be washed mightily, there will be hints of dark alliances between the charcoal Zdeněk Bakala and sobotka's wing.
The friendly relationship between Bohuslav Sobotka and the influential lawyer Radek Pokorný will be discussed.
Disputes in the South Moravian or Moravian-Silesian organization ČSSD are exploding.
Warnings are the words of the Mayor of Ostrava and Sobotka's ally Petr Kajnar: "I signed Charter 77 so that the country would not be dominated by idiots."
If the I.F.D. had met this weekend, the liars would probably have been forced to ritually sacrifice their functions.
Traitors will scatter their heads with ashes and stay.
And the currently winning head of the ČSSD will end up with the nickname Bohuslav Pyrrha.
UN celebrates new goals to combat poverty
The United Nations is urgently starting work on a new set of targets to replace the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which were introduced 12 years ago to tackle global poverty.
Ahead of the UN Sustainable Development Summit, which began overnight in Rio de Janeiro, Australian diplomats played a key role in pushing for "sustainable development goals" to replace the MDGs, which expire in 2015.
They were included in the final draft of the document, which will be approved by world leaders, including Mrs Gillard, during the summit.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said overnight at the summit that now was the time to "rise above national interests."
"I am pleased that the Member States have agreed to launch and take over the process to implement the Universal SDGs - the SDGs," he said.
The SDGs will build on the progress made under the Millennium Development Goals and will be an integral part of the post-2015 development programme.
I will make every effort to fulfil the mandate given to me by the Member States and to implement our vision of the SDGs, which build on the success of the MDGs.
Babiš: Government only with Sobotka.
Andrej Babiš is beginning to make up that his ANO movement will not have time to learn the political craft in opposition and that he will have to go straight to the government to create one at all.
The ANO President admitted this in an interview with Law, which will be published tomorrow.
Putin promises environmental Olympics, plan to be scrammed by giant secret landfills
Winter sports fans are already cutting a meter to the start of the Sochi Olympics, while others are increasingly worried about their preparation.
The Russian Olympics, even if they do not start until February, are facing another scandal.
Russians seem unable to deliver on their promise that the preparations and events of the Games will not in the slightest disturb the nature of Krasnodar Region at the foot of the Caucasus, where thousands of athletes and tens of thousands of visitors will head in four months.
After the Vancouver Olympics, the Russians had the bar set very high, the Canadian Games were the most environmentally friendly in the history of the Olympics.
But Russian President Vladimir Putin's commitment to holding the "zero-waste" Games seems to have long since been over.
AP reporters last week discovered a giant construction material dump in the village of Achshtyr, near Sochi.
Thus, a landfill full of building materials, tires, canisters and insulating foams was found by environmentalists back in August, which they immediately reported.
The Russian authorities were reassuing and the dump was gone.
But just for a little while.
Last week, reporters got a glimpse of a landfill the size of three football fields.
She is not the only one who has created several such places, the British newspaper The Times reported.
Russian Railways, a state monopoly that builds a roughly 60km route between Sochi airport and the sports resort, are working on the site.
The company, which has already swallowed 280 billion rubles, was run by one of Putin's close associates, Vladimir Jakunin.
In August, the railroads argued that the dump was founded by a subcontractor.
But the locals are already desperate.
According to the inhabitants of Achštyr, trucks full of waste material have been driving around the country day and night for three months.
According to experts, the waste threatens to contaminate the local Mzymtu River, other streams and eventually the Black Sea.
"The water from here will contaminate the Sochi water springs for the next 10 to 15 years," Vladimir Kimayev of the environmental nonprofit EWNC told the British newspaper.
Illegal landfills are not the only problem of the Russian Organizing Committee and the government.
The most expensive Olympics in history are one big tunnel, according to the opposition.
By comparison, the Sochi Games will cost $51 billion, while the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing cost $43 billion.
Last year's Games in London cost only $19 billion, and vancouver's nine billion.
In addition to corruption scandals, project delays, and concerns about whether there will be enough snow in the end, there have also been reports that human rights are not being respected while working on the exhibition of sports grounds and infrastructure.
Last month, one of the workers sewed his mouth shut in protest that he had not been paid for two months.
Many also worry about how Russian organizers will deal with a new law during the Games that prohibits the promotion of homosexuality.
Some visitors are going to support Russian gays at the Olympics.
Rules on the use of electronic devices on aircraft will remain in force in Australia for the time being
Australian airline passengers will have to continue to turn off their tablets and smartphones during take-off and landing, regardless of changes in the US, in order to relax regulations on these devices.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has given U.S. airlines room to change their procedures so that passengers can read e-books, watch videos, or play games on their devices during critical phases of flight if the devices remain in "air" mode.
Passengers can already do this during the bulk of the flight, but many people are annoyed that they cannot access their eBooks during take-off and landing.
Australian carriers are exploring this decision, which requires a great deal of work from US carriers to meet the requirements, but have indicated that they have no plans to change their procedures anytime soon.
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) also said it had examined the announcement, but stressed that restrictions on the use of electronic devices at critical stages of flight were still in place in Australia.
"CASA currently has no specific regulations regulating the use of electronic devices on aircraft," he said.
This issue is covered by regulations requiring aircraft operators to ensure that safety is maintained at all times and that passengers act in accordance with safety instructions they receive from crew members.
Virgin, which has already spoken to CASA about expanding the use of its on-board wi-fi entertainment system, was in favour of the change, but announced that it would submit to the regulator's decision.
"We would welcome CASA to analyse permission to use electronic devices, because we really think it would improve customer experiences now that we have (wireless infable entertainment)," the spokesman said.
Qantas has announced that it will follow current regulations for the time being.
"Our current policy is that electronic devices must not be used during take-off and landing, and we have no intention of changing that anytime soon," he said.
FAA regulations apply to U.S. airlines.
However, we are constantly interested in regulatory developments that can be useful to our passengers, and we will certainly thoroughly study the FAA's decision and the reasons behind it.
In the case of US air carriers, the impact of the regulations will vary from company to company and will depend on the age of their fleet.
Carriers will have to demonstrate that their aircraft can tolerate radio interference to mobile phones, as well as revise manuals, training material, hand luggage programmes and passenger information.
"Once the airline has confirmed its fleet's tolerance, it can allow passengers to use portable and lightweight electronic devices such as tablets, e-readers, and smartphones at any altitude," the FAA said.
In rare cases of low visibility, the crew orders passengers to turn off the device during landing.
The group also recommended that heavier devices be safely stored under seats or in overhead storage during takeoff and descent.
There's nonsense in Gravity, but the spectacle is beautiful, experts say
A fantastic film from the universe Gravity sold out in cinemas in the Czech Republic some time after its premiere.
In October, according to the Union of Film Distributors, almost 150,000 viewers saw it and earned over 26 million czech crowns.
Most reviews rate the image positively.
Others, however, find some inconsistencies.
The Lidovky.cz asked astronomers and astrophysicists how they liked the film and whether they noticed any nonsense that appeared in the film.
Jiří Dušek (Director of the Brno Observatory and Planetarium): I like science-fantastic films, which I consider to be modern, dream fairy tales.
The film Gravity, including even though it pretends to be a "physically real" performance.
It's not, but that doesn't mean it's bad.
I enjoyed it very much.
You may notice Sandra Bullock's hair, which does not float in a weightless state.
The Hubb Space Telescope and the International Space Station move in significantly different orbits, so they cannot be seen in one shot.
Some viewers of the film blame the unrealistic effect and the whole behavior of the fire in a state of weightlessness.
Suits, they say, wouldn't last that much, too.
The heroes in Gravity often collide with different objects, and the suits can withstand everything without much difficulty.
The plot was not spared even the criticism.
Such a large-scale tragedy in Earth orbit is unrealistic, according to some debaters.
Plus, she wonders why the doctor was sent into space to fix the technique.
People also argue about the "unrealistic" behavior of ropes in forums.
They say it looks like it's meant for bungee jumping.
Marcel Grün (Director of the Observatory and Planetarium of Prague.m: I have only seen him on a wide screen so far, but I can say unequivocally, I was enchanted.
I'm glad it wasn't a documentary film, it was science fiction.
And with such a story, the author has the right (almost an obligation) not to adhere consistently to reality.
"More than the inconsistencies you mentioned, I was touched by the way the space station with degrading levels of technology (most recently Chinese) is shown three times."
"After all, Chinese will be at the end of the decade, and it will probably look better than it is in the film."
Vladimír Karas (Director of the Astronomical Institute of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic): In computer-generated scenes, the authors try very successfully not to violate the laws of physics, and so the natural-oriented viewer appreciates that in various cosmic collisions and collisions, the moment of momentum is quite correctly preserved, in the physics dictionary, also the view of The Earth from space is very realistic, including the thin skin of the atmosphere and the aurora flashing in the polar regions.
Inconsistencies can certainly be found in more detailed examination.
Additionally, for example, when reading the comments, I found that the preferred direction of circulation of various space garbage in orbit appears in some scenes to be reversed than it should actually be (from west to east).
Jiří Štěpán (employee of the Astronomical Institute of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic): Some things were adapted by the filmmakers to their needs, but I did not notice any fundamental and blatant violation of logic or natural laws in the film, and compared to other films of similar focus, it can be seen that the filmmakers took care of the credibility of the events depicted.
Of the moments that don't make sense, it's worth naming the fact that the Hubble Space Telescope orbits in a different inclined orbit than the ISS.
The result is a very different speed, and the rescue operation would therefore not actually be able to take place as shown in the film.
Furthermore, at the moment of separation of Kowalski (Clooney) and Stone (Bullock), I did not notice that the entire ISS was rotating, so it is not clear the origin of the force acting on Kowalski, which forces both actors to let go when they are no longer moving towards each other.
Bombardier profit falls due to drop in deliveries and orders
Canadian aircraft and train maker Bombardier reported a 15 percent drop in net profit on Thursday, due to fewer orders and deliveries of aircraft in the third quarter and contract problems at the train unit.
Montreal-based Bombardier also did not disclose any flight test data for its new CSeries aircraft, nor did it offer up-to-date information on whether the aircraft will comply with its ambitious plan to begin commercial operations from next September.
After the inaugural test flight about a month and a half ago, the aircraft flew only three times, and the question arose as to whether the test phase was progressing well.
The results fell not to estimates, and shares fell 8 percent on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
State bank analyst Cameron Doerksen downgraded his rating on Thursday from "higher returns" to "sector performance" in anticipation of the stock market experiencing limited growth over the next quarter or two.
"While we mostly expected smaller aircraft deliveries, we were significantly disappointed with the profit margin in the transport sector," Doerksen said in a note to clients.
As the trial program continues, we believe Bombardier will receive new orders for CSeries aircraft.
However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, we expect market scepticism towards the programme to increase.
Bombardier hopes that CSeries aircraft will make their way into the lower end of the market, which is now dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft was unveiled in March, and after several months of delay, the first flight took place in September.
However, the number of binding orders for CSeries aircraft reaches a modest 177, as potential buyers wait for the results of the test flight to verify the company's claims of low consumption and cost savings for this airliner.
There are currently a total of 403 orders and commitments from 15 customers and operators.
Ceo Pierre Beaudoin expected Bombardier to reach its target of 300 binding orders when the first aircraft was put into commercial use.
Executives also assured analysts and media on Thursday that the program was proceeding as planned.
"The test aircraft didn't stay on the ground any longer than expected," Beaudoin said on a conference call, noting that ground testing and software updates were scheduled during the plane's shutdown.
Each manufacturer plans them differently.
We decided to take the first flight and then focus on updates and that's what we did.
That's what's going to happen throughout the flight program.
According to Bombardier, the second of the five test aircraft is expected to take off in the coming weeks and the others not long after.
Still, analysts are skeptical that the first customer could start operating a CSeries aircraft 12 months after its first flight.
Bombardier says it is evaluating its plan to commission the aircraft and will provide updated information in the coming months.
"This slow pace of flight testing – while in line with Bombardier's internal plan – is likely to reinforce our view that commissioning will be pushed back to the first quarter of 2015," Doerksen said.
Bombardier's net income fell to $147 million, or 8 cents per share, in the third quarter ended September 30 from $172 million, or 9 cents a share, a year earlier.
Adjusted earnings per share remained unchanged at 9 cents.
Revenue fell marginally from USD 4.2 billion to USD 4.1 billion.
Analysts had expected earnings of 10 cents per share and revenue of 4.56 billion, according to Thomson Reuters IBES.
The fourth-largest aircraft manufacturer said it delivered only 45 aircraft during the quarter, compared with 57 the year before.
Net orders fell from 83 aircraft to 26.
Unfulfilled orders in the aviation division amounted to 32.9 billion as of 30 September, unchanged from 31 December.
"The results in aviation were in line with our outlook, but we were disappointed with the low order intake and the overall state of the market," Beaudoin said.
Revenue in the aerospace industry fell 13 percent to $2 billion.
Bombardier, the world's largest train maker, said revenue in the division rose nearly 11 percent to $2.1 billion.
Unfulfilled transport orders amounted to 32.6 billion as of 30 September, a marginal increase from 31 December.
The profit margin in the transport division was affected by problems with the implementation of several large contracts.
Executives said new outlooks would be provided in the fourth quarter.
Shares of Bombardier, which also announced the arrival of Google CFO Patrick Pichette, fell 8.5 percent to $4.83 in trading Thursday afternoon.
Brazil's Embraer SA, the third-largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and Bombardier's closest competitor, reported a 10 percent drop in quarterly profit on Thursday.
Mick Jagger says he definitely didn't go after katy perry, then 18.
During an interview with an Australian radio show this week, the pop star said she sang backing vocals for Jagger's 2004 song "Old habits die hard."
Perry said that when she was 18, she had dinner with this rock veteran, and he hit on her.
She added, "That was a long time ago, and now he's very nice to me."
In a statement Thursday, Jagger's (70) rep said he categorically denies ever making katy perry advances.
The deputy said, "Maybe he's confusing him with someone else."
Perry was one of the guest singers who appeared on the Rolling Stones' concert tour this year.
Her new album, "Prism," debuted in the top spot this week.
Kenyan press outraged by controversial media law
"This is terrible news, and it is worth asking what will prevent parliament from simply sweeping away the independence of the judiciary tomorrow," said the newspaper, which considers the bill unconstitutional.
"This law is strict and very repressive, and we reject it," said Cyrus Kamau, ceo of Capital Group, which includes CapitalFM, one of the most respected independent radio stations and news sites.
He said that the new media tribunal "will always be biased because it is an extended hand of the government" and that restrictions on content and advertising would damage Kenya's position in the global economy.
"I hope the President will hear us, and we will ask him to reject this bill and return it to members," he said.
According to the Star, the bill effectively handes the government "complete control over the media," and the Standard newspaper says democracy and freedom of expression in Kenya have "taken a severe hit" and criticize the bill as "severe."
The passage of the bill comes amid a series of measures aimed at strengthening national security in the wake of an Islamic gunman attack on a Westgate shopping mall in September.
Kenyan media turned their anger on themselves when they broadcast security camera footage of soldiers sent to the scene of the attack allegedly looting a luxury goods store.
The police chief responded by summoning two journalists and a senior media executive for questioning, but the subpoena was later withdrawn after pressure from the media.
Under the new bill, media companies can be fined up to 20 million Kenyan shillings and individual journalists up to $1 million, along with the risk of "being removed from the list", or they may be denied official journalistic accreditation.
The General Court also has the right to seize the property of the offender if the fine is not paid.
According to the Daily Nation, "even one fine is enough to take out most radio stations."
It is also stated that these measures may have a liquidating impact on what is called Kenya's 'live blogosphere'.
Politicians know that if they silence the media, they can do whatever they want with impunity.
"You never know what can happen," wrote Nation journalist Mutuma Mathiu, describing Kenyan media as a key source of a system of mutual control and balance in public life.
"Leaving it to politicians to bankrupt the country and throw us back into hunting and collecting," he wrote.
Legislators in Kenya have been the target of public criticism in the past.
In May, they voted to lift cuts mandated by the National Living Wage Agency and to restore their fat salaries of around 532,000 uns tax-free shillings a month, which ranks among the highest in the world.
London bubble bursts as a result of tax on foreign property owners
The Treasury has tentatively quantified the tax on the proceeds of financial assets, but is awaiting a final decision by Mr Osborne, who introduced a 7% property transfer fee for buildings worth more than £2m in the 2012 budget and annual fees for buyers who own properties within the company, rather than as individuals.
The proceeds from the property transfer fee in the housing stock in Westminster and Kensington and Chelsea, which reached £708 million in the 2012/13 tax year, already exceed the total for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, north-east, north-west and yorkshire and humber combined.
Mr Cook said: "Given the increase in property transfers for high-value homes and the introduction of related legislation to prevent tax avoidance, it is very difficult to argue that high-value property is under-taxed regardless of the effect of an outdated head tax system."
He added that "this move may have made some foreign investors reluctant to buy property in London, or that existing owners are reluctant to sell."
Leading properties – the top 5% to 10% of the housing market by price – in the wealthy strip, which stretches from Fulham to Wimbledon, have seen a record 11.8% increase over the past year.
Prices in central London continue to show steady growth of 5.6% year on year, but have been overshadowed by the booming "domestic market" experienced by the South West, North (7.4%) and East (6.5%) increment.
Arctic Monkeys postpone Glasgow concert due to Alex Turner illness
Rock band Arctic Monkeys postponed a concert in Glasgow after the lead singer was diagnosed with larynx inflammation.
The Sheffield group was due to perform at the city's Hydro complex on Friday.
But the illness of lead singer Alex Turner forced her to reschedule the show.
The band's announcement came after she was similarly forced to postpone Thursday's performance at the LG Arena in Birmingham.
In a statement on its official website, Arctic Monkeys says: "Following the decision to postpone today's performance at the LG Arena in Birmingham and following medical advice, arctic monkeys must also postpone the performance at the Hydro complex in Glasgow scheduled for Friday 1 November."
"Alex Turner has been diagnosed with larynx inflammation and unfortunately won't be able to perform."
Performances at the LG Arena in Birmingham will take place on 20 November and performances at the Hydro complex in Glasgow on 21 November.
All tickets for these performances remain valid.
