Petr Čech: Transfer at the last minute?
Possible is everything
Today is the last day to jump through the transfer window and make a big transfer.
The next chance comes in the winter.
Petr Cech, currently substitute goalkeeper for Chelsea, is not sitting over a new professional contract in Madrid, Monaco or Paris.
He sits in the Smichov NH Hotel, talks with Czech journalists and is going with the Czech national team for a game dress rehearsal with the Americans and subsequently also for the sharp start of the Euro 2016 qualification against the Netherlands.
In Chelsea's goal, Thibaut Courtois is preferred in the new Premier League season, with the Czech Republic taking the position of substitute for the first time in ten years at the London club.
Earlier in the day, it was speculated that Real Madrid might be interested in the Czech.
He lost the Spanish Super Cup in the early part of the season and failed to make it to the league season, losing 2-4 in San Sebastián.
There was also speculation about the interest of Paris SG.
He was relegated to the French league season with two wins and two draws, scoring 5-0 on Sunday.
Relatively the most pushing the shoe club AS Monaco.
He has a 1-1-2 record in the league so far and broke up with Lille amicably 1-1 at the weekend.
Reports jumped on the English website today that the Czech might want to be in Queens Park Rangers.
According to English bookmakers, however, the Czech's departure from Chelsea at the last minute is not very likely.
Skybet set him a 4-1 odds.
Peter, is it possible that you will still change the jersey within the next few hours?
I'm not counting on it, but there's never anything 100 per cent in football.
Perhaps during the day there will be an offer that will not be refused.
What would such an offer look like?
(laughs) "Well, I don't know yet how such an offer that can't be rejected actually looks like.
There would have to be a consensus from all parties First of all, it would depend on Chelsea's stance on whether or not the club would deal with any offer.
Is it even technically feasible to make such a transfer now that you are in Prague?
Wouldn't it be necessary for you to sign a possible new contract somewhere in the new location?
That's not what I thought about.
But in such a situation there are a lot of players today, they are all somewhere at the representative reunions and I'm sure a lot of transfers will be closed today.
So somehow it would be feasible.
How many clubs on the planet that could afford you?
Well, I really don't know.
And you're not pushing for a go?
The situation where I didn't play in the first three games of the new season is new for me after 15 years of my career.
However, there is no reason to panic, to pack and to go somewhere.
I want to continue to participate in this Chelsea goalkeeper's challenge and it is up to the coach who he chooses what decisions he will make over the next few weeks.
What role does the family play in your decision-making?
I take all the factors into account.
The important thing for me is, of course, a sporting aspect, but I also look at it from the personal side to which the family's needs of course belong.
Is it possible that you would have been catching for another club in England?
That's the question I thought would never concern me.
But in football, anything is possible.
I don't want to rule anything out.
I don't know the answer.
Prime Ministers of India and Japan at a meeting in Tokyo
India's new Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, is in Tokyo to meet with his Japanese counterpart, Shinzo Abe. He is due to discuss economic and security commitments on his first major visit since winning the election in May.
Modi is on a five-day trip to Japan to consolidate economic ties with the world's third-largest economy.
On the list are first and foremost plans for more extensive cooperation on nuclear energy.
According to the rapporteurs of India, he also hopes that the two nations agree to cooperate on defence issues.
Police in Karrata arrested a 20-year-old teenager after a motorcycle chase
The bike was stopped after a zone with a maximum permitted speed of 70 km/h, hurtling 125 km/h and drove into the bush to escape the officers.
In Karrata, the traffic police were in Karrata who tried to stop a blue motorcycle at the side of the road when they noticed that the exit from the gas station on Bathgate Road was going 125 km/h.
According to police, the driver did not stop and proceeded after Burgess Road and then turned to the bush, leaving the officers out of sight.
The bike and the person who matched the description of the driver were then spotted at the house in Walcott Way in Bulgara.
Karrathská police have charged the 20-year-old with disobeying a call to stop and careless proceedings.
He will stand trial in Karrata on September 23.
The motorcycle was confiscated for three months.
George Webster charged with rape at Nairn and Pitlochry hotels
The man will be brought to justice on charges of raping women in two hotels.
George Webster, 28, was briefed on the charge during a hearing at the Glasgow Supreme Court.
He was reportedly raped by a woman at Scotland's Hotel in Pitlochry, Perthshire, on 7 June 2013.
According to the claim, Webster attacked her while she "destained consciousness, she slept and was in no condition to give her consent."
Webster is also prosecuted for the rape of another woman at the Golf View Hotel in Nairn, the Scottish Highlands, on May 4, 2014.
Judge Lady Rae set the trial date for 17 November at the Supreme Court in Edinburgh.
Restoring the very American ideal that labour rights are also human rights
Congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis proposed a bill to protect trade union organizing as a civil right.
"Depending on how the unions work, middle-class jobs work," says Ellison, the Democratic senator for Minnesota, who is co-chaired to the Congressional Committee.
That is why I am so proud that I can, together with the model of occasional rights, John Lewis, present the law empowering the staff.
This breakthrough legislation will give workers the same legal options to prevent discrimination in organizing trade unions, as in other forms of discrimination - and halt the anti-boff forces
Amend the labour relations law to allow all employees who face discrimination when they want to join the trade unions to sue in a civil court - and to obtain compensation or damages - an initiative is the right and necessary.
But it is certainly not a radical initiative - at least not according to American standards.
The best way to understand what Ellison, Lewis, and other proponents are putting forward in the law is to re-establel the American ideal.
Despite the trade union struggles that took place in recent years - in Wisconsin, Michigan, and other nations - Americans once supported countries around the world to adopt, expand, and respect labour rights.
There were times, and millions of Americans still remembering them, when the country, in the same breath, advocated democracy, freedom of the press, and the right to assembly.
When the United States seized Japan after World War II, General Douglas MacArthur and his advisers supported the country to adopt a constitution designed to ensure that the military autocracy of Hideki Toja would be replaced by democracy.
They were convinced that the staff and their unions played a role in the formation of the new Japan, encompassing the language, and openly acknowledged that "the workers' right to gather, collectively negotiate, and act is guaranteed."
When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his advisers urged the Germans to create a constitution to ensure that Adolf Hitler's fascism would be replaced by a strong democracy.
The Germans were aware that the staff would need to be organized and promoted in the new nation, and therefore included a clause that openly said: "The right to create associations that will safeguard and improve working and economic conditions will be guaranteed to each individual and to each profession or profession.
Arrangements that will restrict this right or seek to have it damaged will be revoked. Measures leading to such a purpose are illegal.
When former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt chaired the International Human Rights Commission, which proposed the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which was adopted by the United Nations as a global treaty in 1948, the proponents and the Roosevelt Guaranteed that "everyone has the right to create and enter unions as part of the protection of their interests."
Americans for generations accepted the basic premise that labour rights are human rights.
When the country advised other countries on how to create a civic and democratic society, the Americans explained that the right to form labour unions - and their participation in collective bargaining with companies and government agencies in the position of an equal partner - must be protected.
Now that these rights are being challenged in America, it is definitely necessary to return to the American ideal that working people must have the right to organize and promote themselves in a free and open society.
As the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr said fifty years ago.
History is a great teacher.
Today, everyone knows that the union has not diminanced the nation's strength, but has expanded it.
They raised the standard of living for millions of people, created a market for industry, and raised production to an unsuspected level.
Those who attack the unions forget these simple truths, but history remembers them.
History does not forget and we would not.
Formal recognition of labour rights as human - and the extension of the protection of civil rights to prevent discrimination in organising trade unions - is overdue.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis are rebuilding the ideals that have lifted America and made it a true promise of democracy.
The judge temporarily blocked a law that could have closed all abortion clinics in Louisiana
A federal judge on Sunday temporarily blocked the Louisiana law, which attorneys say would likely close all five clinics performing abortion in the state.
The regulation, enacted by the signature of Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal in June, to come into force on 1 September, would require abortion doctors to have the right to receive a patient in a hospital within 30 miles of their practice.
The judge's order means that doctors can temporarily continue to carry out legal abortion and must obtain this authorisation in the meantime.
"The nominating party will be able to lawfully carry out its activities and in the meantime obtains a permit," reads the order of federal judge John deGravels.
The hearing will be scheduled in one month for the judge to issue a more permanent resolution on the law.
The activators for the rights of abortion welcomed the latest in a series of similar measures and said it would give doctors more time to obtain a permit.
"Today's decision makes women in Louisiana safe from a tricky law to deprive them of their health and their rights," said Nancy Northup, the president and executive director of the Center for Reproductive Rights, who sought the law from the lawsuit with the lawsuit.
It was not immediately clear whether the decision also applied to the doctors from the two clinics that were not among the plaintiffs, as well as asking for this authorisation to be granted.
Louisiana is among the eleven states that passed similar laws, with the Alabama and Mississippi courts declaring such measures to be unconstitutional.
Key parts of the Texas law that would close most of the remaining clinics in the state were blocked by federal judges on Friday.
Fighters for women's rights to have abortions, together with the Association of American Acivees and Gynecologists and the American Medical Association, argue that the need to have this permission is placed on doctors with demands that are not necessary from a medical standpoint.
Opponents of abortion opposed the measures aimed at protecting women's health, and some also welcomed the fact that clinics would be closed for the sake of the measures.
The Reproductive Rights Center said that in Louisiana, only one doctor performing abortion has a permit.
If all the doctors in the state were forced to stop performing abortion, this doctor would also, for fear of his safety, stop performing the procedure, the group said.
In response, the Louisiana authorities said they would not punish the doctors who perform the abortion while awaiting the processing of the request for the granting of rights.
Due to late diagnosis and poor availability of treatment, ovarian cancer kills in the countryside more often
Angelina Jolie and her brother James released a video of the tribute to their late mother, who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
Women in the Australian countryside are at a higher risk of dying of ovarian cancer than in their counterparts in the city.
Researchers analyzed the medical records of more than 1100 Australians diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2005 and found that only 35% lived for 35 years after the diagnosis.
Research director Susan Jordan of the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute said that women in rural and remote areas of the state were about twenty percent more likely to die during the study than in women in urban areas.
MALÁ STUDY: New drugs may slow down lung and ovarian cancer
Researchers followed the women during seven years of treatment.
Dr. Jordan said the chances of survival were influenced by the age of women at the time of diagnosis, the type of ovarian cancer, other existing diseases, and socio-economic status.
The lowest survival rates occurred in older women who were diagnosed with cancer at a more advanced stage.
Women in rural and remote areas of the state were about twenty percent more likely to die during the study than in women in urban areas.
Although the study was not designed to determine why women living outside the city were more likely to die from ovarian cancer, Dr. Jordan argues that the factors may be late diagnosis and poor availability of treatment.
"The disease is best treated by gynaeconologists who are usually based in larger cities," she said.
Despite the improvement in the medical services at the distance to overcome the distance barrier, the doctor has proposed to help boost the transport service to be able to treat the specialists closer to their homes and programs to support people who are being treated far from their family and friends.
Dr. Jordan said the study revealed that the long-term survival of ovarian women has been low regardless of the geographical location, highlighting the need for better treatment and preventive programs.
Research funded by the Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer cancer will be released today by the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2012, at the age of 33, young mother Elisha Neave of the Gold Coast was diagnosed with an aggressive form of ovarian cancer.
Garden centres regret reducing the number of homeowners
According to a study by the Financial Times, according to a HTA study published by the downturn linked to the extraordinary loss of homeowners under the age of 35, it could lead to the "lead age group of consumers reaching the "lead age group of gardeners" by the garden centres losing up to £10 million a year.
According to the report, people who rent housing spend on average 55% of the amount spent on their own landlords on their own.
As other factors threatening the sector, which makes an estimated £5 billion a year, the increase in the number of people living in very urbanised areas, where there are no gardens, the popularity of paving instead of the front gardens is not popular with the front gardens, and the shrinking size of the gardens.
In the Greater London area, where the share of home owned has fallen from 61% to 43% in six years, one household accounts for the lowest expenditure on gardening products in Britain.
HTA and the Royal Horticultural Society said that lodging in lodgings or the lack of space does not mean that people could not grow plants.
Guy Barter, the chief horticultural advisor to the RHS, said: "For tenants, growing potted plants is very popular - when they move, they can take the plants with them."
The HTA report revealed that the "golden age" of the horticultural retail sector was between 1997 and 2005 and was the result of a higher share of homeowners and economic prosperity lasting from the 1980s to the mid-1990s.
It also forecasts a higher sales for this year thanks to the better weather, which came after adverse conditions in March and April.
When the Eastern dictator preaches about democracy.
After Putin's reunion at the reunion of his youth organization, which reminds me most of all of the Hitler Youth, he rattled with atomic weapons and basically made it clear to everyone that his views were not theirs, he gave us a lecture on democracy today.
But I have a feeling that the current regime in Russia exhibits many features of the fascist state.
The great nations have one thing in common, and that is that they can be dominated by both tense nationalism and that they can transform the inferiority complex into imperialist appetitory.
Time passes differently in the east than in the west.
While the Western world thought the time of the wars of domain over Europe was long gone, in the east, on the contrary, they think they have been overlooked for a long time and it is necessary to win back their international position.
Such mood and frustration reigned in Germany in the 1930s, just before the Nazis seized power, followed by an explosion of nationalism unlike today's situation in Russia.
And then the very identical cult of a strong leader, the beating of journalists, the elimination of inconvenient political opponents, discrimination against minorities and homosexuals, is therefore quite similar.
Vladimir Putin, and certainly a large proportion of Russians, may miss the time when Russia ruled halfway around the world and the second part was shaking.
I guess Western politicians were responsible for themselves, maybe patting Vladimir on the shoulders little, maybe not invited him where he wanted to go and maybe they started to underestimate him, and he just acted like a typical Russian man.
He had put his house in order, pretending that he didn't really want to go anywhere, sharpening knives at home.
Now he decided to take back the lost position.
He'll start slowly, he's got time.
The leader is probably for life, so what would he be in the hurry.
He's trodden the Caucasus, now he's trampling the Ukrainians, then the Baltics' Dwarves are next.
They've been stinging the Russian bear in a fur coat for quite a while.
I'm sure it's going to be noticed by China, which is jumping up too much and is certainly making a look at the far east.
And those Germans are also pretty pissed off by this Vladimir, how well they're doing and we gave them a spank at the time of '45.
How about doing a new Novorosija in Karlovy Vary.
That would be the base and ours there are a lot of them and how they are oppressed by the dachuke they already wanted to demolish some of them.
After all, our veterans have so far remembered how they were in that Czechoslovakia.
Nu vot, their Prime Minister Gospodin Sobotka, he's so soft, you can peel like onions and I'll eat all of their EU.
That would play so to jump out at the great Russia.
They must be reminded of their place.
And as detonators, we will use our soukmen who live in their territory.
There are a lot of Russians everywhere and when they say they're being oppressed, they just oppress them and we don't let that happen, we protect them.
And again, the Russian will rule, what else is born.
Europe is only as good as a preposition that the proud Ivan can dance to a Cossack.
Turkey summons US diplomat over spy report
Turkey's foreign minister called in the country's highest-ranking US diplomat to explain the news of US and British espionage activity in Turkey.
Deputy Prime Minister Bulent said the US charge d'affaires and Turkish civil servants discussed the report on Monday.
German magazine Der Spiegel and the online magazine The Intercept reported that according to documents provided by a former analyst of the US National Security Agency, Turkey was a priority target for US and British intelligence services.
According to Turkish media, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan downplayed the importance of the report, saying that all major states were following each other.
The earlier report, according to which the German intelligence service also targeted Ankara, provoked a more indignant reaction from the Turkish government.
Game of Thrones presented more tricks of the fourth series
The creators of Game of Thrones are currently filming episodes of the fifth orders of the cult series.
At the same time, they boasted about how the tricks of the fourth series were created.
The most visible are the computer editing of the series environment and the mass scene, with a bunch of soldiers becoming the giant army of the famous Daenerys.
Magaluf Police Director charged with corruption
On Friday, the complainants presented the Mallor State Attorney's Office for evidence of blackmail by police officers and state city hall officials in the Calvia self-government region.
The director of the Calvia Police on the holiday island of Mallorca was arrested following charges against businessmen and bar owners at the infamous party district of Magaluf.
Chief Inspector José Antonio Navarro was taken into custody after allegations of corruption against him by several businessmen from Punta Ballena, a street in which most of the bars and nightclubs in Magaluf are located.
According to the Mallorca Diario online newspaper, on Friday, the complainant presented evidence to the Mallor Corruption's Councillor's Anti-Government Office for the Prosecutor of the Corruption Bureau of blackmail and city hall civil servants in the Calvia self-government region.
Two other local police officers have been arrested by Spanish State Police for links to corruption charges and will be interviewed by a judge and he and Navarre will be interviewed by a judge.
Spain's national daily ABC quoted disgruntled owners of night-time businesses as saying that favouritism by public officials has serious repercussions for their business.
"It's not about making money, it's about making money," one businessman said in court.
Don't play with our living.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf made it to the top pages of magazines worldwide after a video of an 18-year-old British tourist who provided oral sex to 24 men on YouTube during a tour of bars.
The island's authorities have since tried to oversee drunks and rioters in the ranks of holiday party attendees in Magafulo by reducing the number of not-yet-famous alcohol tours in bars.
In addition, the Playhouse club, where the event was given to the oral sex, was forced to close for a year and, together with the organisers of the Carnage-goal touring, pay a fine of 55,000 euro ($73,000).
The tourist resort of Magaluf, which is particularly popular with the British, has also witnessed many alcohol-fet-famous accidents, including the fashionable wave known as "balconing," in which people jump from one balcony to the other or from the balcony to the hotel pool.
The first day of spring marked by rain and thunderstorms that had an impact on the flight at the airport in Adelaide
JARO gave the south of South Australia an icy surprise, coming in with heavy rain and a fierce wind that seriously hit the Adelaide airport.
The city's next 5 mm of precipitation is expected to fall until 9 p.m. and another 6.6 mm will fall during the night on a Sunday.
The last rain was introduced together with a few short showers associated with the storm and gusts of wind, which began before 8 p.m. and brought in almost 4 mm of precipitation in about ten minutes.
After several early doses of spring arrived after the winter last week, temperatures in the city fell again to just 15.8°C on Monday.
The storm weather is thought to have contributed to the delayed arrival of Virgin Airlines from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The plane was supposed to land just after 7:30 p.m., but was hit by a change in wind speed or direction and was forced to postpone the landing.
Wind gusts at the Adelaide airport at that time reached a speed of about 50 km/h on the ground.
Flight data showed that the plane had to drop the second landing and eventually touched down at about 20:40.
The delay in the aircraft subsequently caused delays of other flights, including an Emirates flight from Dubai and a Qantas flight from Sydney.
The Adelaide temperatures are expected to reach a maximum of 16°C on Tuesday and one or two showers may occur.
Israeli children return to school after war in Gaza
Thousands of Israeli children from areas near the Gaza Strip returned to school on Monday after spending the summer in anti-combard shelters, while rockets and mortars attacked their homes during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas. However, the Gaza Schools remain closed while the territory is recovering from the fighting.
The start of the school brought a sense of joy and excitement to the communities in the south of Israel scarred by attacks, but signs of fighting are still evident.
In Asdod, a city in the country's south, the kindergarten staff hit by a rocket has removed the remnants of the shrapnel from the wall, and are slowly awaiting the children's return.
"We're a little scared, but other than that, we're looking forward to it," said Ronit Bart, a kibbutz resident of Saad and an English teacher at the local school.
A lot of kids in this area really need to get back to the daily routine.
Her 11-year-old daughter, Shani Bart, revealed that "it's a little strange" to go to school all of a sudden.
"We've had some tough times and we haven't left the house at all," she said.
Kibbutz, located close to the Gaza border, was visited by President Reuven Rivlin to offer his support to the residents.
Until the cease-fire ended last week, thousands of residents of border settlements like the Saad remained inside their homes or left their homes and went to safer areas farther from Gaza to escape rockets and mortars.
Many residents of the Nachal Oz, a village close to the Gaza border in which a Palestinian mortar missile killed a four-year-old boy, are hesitant to return.
The Education Minister said that about a dozen families have still not returned.
Their children were temporarily placed in replacement schools.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited the school in Sderot, a city on the Gaza border that was heavily hit by Palestinian fire.
He urged the children to study diligently, adding, "We will provide you for education and safety."
Israel and Hamas agreed to an unlimited time last Tuesday.
While the ceasefire led to an immediate end to the fighting, it did not solve key challenges as Hamas's demand to end the Israeli-Egyptian blockade of Gaza and the reopening of Gaza's airports and ports.
Israel is demanding the disarmament of Hamas and the return of the bodies of the two soldiers killed in the war.
A new round of indirect negotiations is expected to begin later this month in Egypt.
According to Palestinians and UN estimates, more than 2,100 Palestinians died in the war, three-quarters of whom were civilians and at least 494 children.
Israel disputes these figures, estimating that at least half of those killed were radicals, even though it has no clear evidence for these claims.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians, including a Thai worker, died.
Hamas and other Gaza militants fired 4,591 missiles and mortar missiles and mortar missiles during the fighting at Israeli cities, mainly in the country's south.
The Israeli military, for its part, has carried out more than 5,000 air raids and other attacks.
The Israeli attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in Gaza, and an estimated 250,000 people hid in a hundred UN schools that turned into makeshift shelters.
Because of the tens of thousands of people still in hiding, and because of the ongoing struggles, school officials postponed the start of the school year last week.
"I hope they will open the school soon so that we can finish our education as well as the Jewish children and the other children in the world," said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old boy from the school's largest city in Gaza.
Willow at the reunion: I stand behind Vácha.
And Lafatu is suffering from the temperature
The Czech national football team met before noon in Prague today before the pre-season match with the USA on Wednesday and the subsequent opening match of the European Championship qualifier against the Netherlands.
Of the 23-man cadre, Spartan striker David Lafata, who is suffering from the temperature, is in trouble.
David's not here yet, but Sparta had some problems last week, there were more players involved and David probably still has a little bit of those problems.
But we want him to be here and be okay as soon as possible," coach Pavel Vrba told reporters.
"Whether it's two or three days, or it's going to be fit tomorrow, that's going to be seen by his health, which will be decided by our doctor," he added.
The other players are fine.
"Of course, someone has some ache, but it's not like they can't train or take part in the match on Wednesday with the USA," said the Czech coach.
On Sunday night, Vrba called up Spartan midfielder Lukáš Vácha as the last player.
He admitted that it had not been an easy decision to make, other midfielders were also an option.
I decided on the basis that Lukas is a prospective player who is 25 years old.
It was very difficult to make the decision, but I stand by it,' said Willow to Vách.
What about Shural?
We'll see what happens to Latata
It is not excluded that in the event of health problems, the nomination could still change.
At the weekend, a great performance was flashed by, for example, Liberec's Josef Šural, who scored a hat-trick.
Of course, there are players who have been showing form lately.
Let's see how David Lafata is.
In case he can't be available on Wednesday, I'm not saying I can't help renominate one of the players who impressed in the Czech league," Vrba said.
This afternoon the national team will be training in Strahov, then on Tuesday a classic pre-season training session with the USA at Letná, which will be open to fans and will be followed by an autograph session.
The match with the Americans is played on Wednesday from 8:15 p.m. and the national team will aim for a first-ever victory under Wilring.
He had played in two draws in the previous three preseason games and lost once.
The qualifying match with the Netherlands is then on 9 September from 8:45 p.m.
Pešice goes to the Dutch to Italy
Vrba is glad to have more time to train, unlike in previous reunions.
It's an advantage when you have players for eight days and you can rehearse with them certain things that maybe we didn't have that much time before.
Now we will only be able to focus on getting the best prepared for the Netherlands," Vrba said.
The Dutch will present themselves in Italy before the match in Prague on Thursday and the duel will be watched in person by former interim representative coach Josef Pešice.
He'll give us the information that's from the game.
But it won't just be about him, we'll have the game filmed and we'll discuss it.
A new coach is coming to the Netherlands, we will see what the changes will be there," Vrba said to the bronze medalists from the recent world championships.
According to high-profile statistics, the prices of flats in the winter season rose the most in the last seven years.
According to the housing value index in the Australian capital RP, CoreLogic Hedonic, housing prices rose by 1.1% in August, the agency said on Monday.
The increase led to an overall increase for June, July and August to 4.2%, the highest increase in the winter months since 2007.
The annual price increase climbed to 10.9%, more than double in one year to August 2013, but the profit was not evenly distributed in the country.
RP Data research director Tim Lawless said that Sydney and Melbourne are leading the market.
Figures from the RP The data shows that prices of flats in Sydney rose by 16.1% last year, while prices in Melbourne rose by 11.7%.
Among the other strongest markets were Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin, with price increases averaging between five and six percent.
On the other side of the scale was Canberra, which was hurt by a state-mandated expenditure cut and where prices rose by only 1.4% during the year.
Lawless said that now that spring has started, the number of properties for sale will increase in the coming months, which will be a "snow test" for the market.
"Given the persistent high level of auction sales, generally high sales speeds and a low interest rate, the value of housing is likely to increase further over the next three months," he said.
Lenny Henry: My father never huged me.
He never said to me "I love you"
Henry was born in 1958 as one of the seven children of Jamaican immigrant in Dudley, Midlands.
He and his father, who died when Henry was 19 and who worked in the factory, they had a colder relationship.
Henry is rehearsing a comedy, Rudy's Rare Records, which is partly based on an imaginary interview with his father, and which is part of the Radio 4 series.
The soundtrack is a mixture of reggae and rap and the melody is optimistic.
But Henry had to deal with some unpleasant childhood memories.
After his mother's death, Henry went through a "pretty" therapy, and now he's thinking about his relationship with his father.
He knew precious little about him.
You've never seen his face before, you've only heard his voice: "Stop the noise.
Leave your sister alone.
Move!
I want to watch cricket.
My older brothers, Seymour, and Hilton - when I was a child, they were adults - would go to the bar with him, discussing things like the shape of a beer jar or the beauty of a cricket strike.
I've never spoken to him like that.
Most of my life, he's been a serious guy in a corner reading the paper.
Recently, Henry had visited the foundry at Dudley, and although the terms were better than in his father's time, he looked into the way life must have been for him.
There's a bit more light now, but it's still a dark, smoomy, gloomy labyrinth where the flames explode and there's a lot of smoke and soot.
Dad always got in the tub and just lay there, then you could hear him slowly sing to himself because he was washed the foundry.
When I walked by, I realized he'd been doing this for years to support his family, and I'd come to appreciate him more.
Even so, Henry spent his childhood without parental love.
Dad didn't embrove anyone, said "I like to be happy for you."
It wasn't until my mom was sick and dying that we started to say to themselves "I love you, I love you, I love you."
His daughter, Billie, whom he has with Dawn French, allowed him to experience the love he lacked as a child.
Can you stop with the "I love you"?
Don't hug me all the time!
Dad, I'm 22!
With Dawn French.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mom
French, who was married to for 25 years, are still good friends.
Dawn's good.
Why shouldn't Dawn and I be friends?
She's a great mom.
Henry's own mother had diabetes.
It was one of the things that killed her.
So when I was very overweight, very overweight and the symptoms of diabetes were starting to show, the doctor said to me, "You have to make a radical change."
So I started going to a big fitness center, and I also had to go on a drastic diet to get rid of the symptoms.
It's very hard.
And tiring.
Nobody wants to eat all the carrots.
The change in the direction of hinginging Henry's career may be reflected in his elegant, short-crocked beard.
After receiving acclaim from the critics of his Othello, he immersed himself in the theater.
This was followed by a Comedy of Errors and the Fences of Augusto Wilson.
It's a different experience than the sitcoms and comedies that filled out his hectic working life.
He started when he was 16 and worked in a factory.
DJ spotted him on stage parodied someone and wrote about him in the New Faces talent contest.
His television career began in the mid-'70s: "I was the only black impersonator/comedian on television for a long time."
He was taught as he went.
In addition to being noticed by the public, I also had to learn how to make up working jokes between 1975, and be a star, and appear on TV, and that was really hard.
Lenny in New Faces in 1975
Since his manager owned the rights to the stage production of The Black and White Minstrel Show, an entertainment program in which the actors dressed up as black, Henry eventually performed in it with his comedy for five years.
My family was already uneaten about this.
I kind of wish it never happened, but I don't regret it.
Although it was a strange and embarrassing position, I worked on the big scenes and learned how to work with the crowd.
What was "the years awards major product of British television" but was also a "grotesque parody of blacks."
In the 1980s, Henry worked in alternative comedy circles and introduced characters who both ridiculed and celebrated British black culture.
The first series of The Lenny Henry Show began airing in 1984, and in the 1990s it was known as the chef Gareth Blacklock in the comedy series Chef!.
The next decades were for him to be held by ads, documentaries, TV series and roles in the movies, but after the aired on the BBC's LennyHenry.tv series in 2008, he said, "So what are you going to do now, Len, because it looks a little like you're stuck in one place, or you're a little out of the way."
Next up was a Radio 4 documentary show called What's So Great About...?/What's so great about...?
The first was Shakespeare.
I had a serious allergy to Shakespeare.
We didn't really learn him at school, and I thought it was something for the white middle class.
So I was so worried about it.
Everyone we interviewed on the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench, said, "You should try it."
Don't get involved when you don't know what you're talking about.
Try a few words and see why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry had delivered twenty lines of the documentary from Othello's closing argument, and he was in it.
It made me feel like I could do it.
It's like it gives me the courage.
"It's a serious matter, take it seriously, learn the lyrics, find out about it.
So the rehearsal was hard, and I'd read the play for months and months before.
And it was a success.
It looked like they were in trouble, which didn't happen.
He soon began playing in a Comedy of Errors.
Suddenly I was at the National Theatre, I couldn't believe it.
At one point I thought, "You've changed."
There was a technical glitch, and Henry instinctively felt he had to take responsibility for the confiscation of the audience.
"The hla in my head said to me, 'Before the computer fixes you must entertain them for ten minutes now.'"
Instead, the theater director announced that the show would resume as soon as the problem was resolved.
I left the stage, and something in me said, "Well, thank God."
It's not my responsibility.
It could be solved for me by someone else.
"You're playing, so stay in the role."
Henry in Plotes at Duchess Theatre
Learning the fullback text was a challenge.
Panic is pretty good, he adds determination.
The game was also well received, so it's like a sign of God that says, "This is what you should do."
Of course, he says it in a UWN TOWN voice.
So I'm staying with it.
I really like it.
I like being in the rehearsal room.
Nevertheless, Henry remains the brain of a comedian - he interrupts our conversation all the time with humorous performances as he enters and steps up from the role of imitator.
I decided not to make stand-ups because having the satisfaction of a room full of strangers is a little dangerous, I'd say.
When you're still looking for something, you can get to a dead end.
Sometimes when I want to, I do Live at the Apollo, but I'm not happy about it as I used to.
I asked if he'd ever organize a stand-up tour again.
The joy of sitting in the same room with the director, who helps to put out the outlines of the beginning, the middle and the end of the road - I don't think I ever want to give it up.
So, your new incarnation?
I think so.
I enjoy acting.
It's fun.
You keep telling stories, which is great.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Kenya registers state officials to shine a light on nonexistent employees
Kenya began with the biometric registration of all of her civil servants to try to remove non-existent employees from the government's payroll.
According to the government's statement, employees who are not registering in the next two weeks will stop receiving a payday.
The government believes that thousands of people receive a salary even after they left the civil service.
After taking office in 2013, President Uhuru Kenyatta promised to prevent corruption in the civil service.
An audit conducted this year showed that the state is losing at least $1 million (£700,000) a month to pay for non-existent employees and further abuse of official authority.
The government suspects that salaries continue to be placed on bank accounts after the employee's death or after the employee leaves the civil service, the BBC's Nairobi, Wanyama Chebusiri, a BBC reporter, said.
All civil servants must report to the identification centres within the next two weeks, where their data will be biometrically recorded, the government statement said.
He goes on to say that anyone who does not appear without a sufficient apology will be removed from the payroll.
"By de-eschedule, the measure will make a significant contribution to its management and will also be used to clear the payroll at both levels of the government, thus resolving the problem of non-existent employees," said Anne Waiguru, Secretary of the Ministry of Development and Planning.
Dozens of Turkish police arrested over "conspiracy" against government
Local media reports that a total of 33 police officers were detained in Turkey on suspicion of a "conspic of the government."
The police department has yet to comment on the case.
According to the Hurriyet Dail News, there were fourteen high-ranking officials among the detained.
Some of them were implicated in a corruption investigation in December, targeting government officials, including four ministers.
In July, several Turkish police officers were arrested for allegedly organizing a criminal gang and telephone eavesdropping.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (the Prime Minister at the time) called their actions part of the actions of Islamic cleric Fethullah Gülen against him and other people in power.
Not all children returned to school in Ukraine
Most schools in Ukraine reopened on Monday (September 1) after the summer holidays.
This day is traditionally important for families, and like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arseniy Yatenyuk took his daughter to school.
On this occasion, he told the journalists present that not all schools had reopened, but that they were determined to defend the country for the next generation:
Not at all schools were held in the traditional ceremony for 1st.
Not all of Ukraine is the peace.
We must fight for peace.
The whole of Ukraine, the combined Ukrainian front, must fight for peace.
Alexan Pastukhov, a teacher at a school in Slavyansk attended by Yatňuk's daughter, spoke in Russian.
We hope that peace will finally be achieved here and that children will gain the knowledge that will be useful to them in the future.
The first day of school is traditionally celebrated by the children wearing embroidered shirts, bring balloons and give the teachers flowers.
In Ron Fairhead, the BBC may have found a boss for the hard times
It carries with it a cloud of fame from the world of banking, media management, and an internal conclave of the conservative party.
She has experience in the front lines.
She began her career at consultants Bain and Co, then continued through Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and the media world of Pearsons.
For seven years, she was executive director of the Financial Times. She resigned when her junior colleague took over the top job at the parent company Pearson's.
They say her severance package was close to £1 million.
Its political portfolio is also extensive.
She was recommended to David Cameron by Lord Browne, the former director of BP, when Cameron needed a private expertise in Whitehall: she became an adviser to the Cabinet Office.
Her husband is a former city council member.
In May, I described the work of the director as a chalice with poison.
Not only is the BBC a large and intrait entity at the centre of public life, but there is also an internal paradox in its structure.
The corporation turns in two directions: in the top of the BBC's own-led hierarchy, but also out in the voice of the public in times of unrest when things don't work.
This is an almost unsustainable monopoly that calls for a thorough reform.
But what director would risk coming into the company as complex as the Chinese dynasty, dismandony with it, and thereby take his own jobs.
It's a tough challenge.
If it weren't so hard, a lot of people would like to see the BBC shrink - its power, its finances - and how its status is being revised.
As the competition arises and the new technology calls into question the old certainties, the immediate negotiation of the concession fees for the BBC carries a great danger.
For a modest amount of £145.50 a year, the British public buys a stake in what is certainly the world's largest media business.
The BBC tells a good story: it claims that its production reaches 96% of households, each costing only 40pc.
Moreover, the BBC's popularity is clearly rising: to 53% of supporters, up from 31% a decade ago.
BBC service usage models have changed: Today, my newspaper subtitles are shown on my mobile phone, and I can watch iPlayer on the shows I missed.
But the BBC remains a very beloved and wonderful institution.
She needs an amazing director - I hope she found one.
Texas Governor Perry says he didn't approve the insulting tweet
A tweet from the official Twitter account of Texas Governor Rick Perry, released on Sunday, included an offensive picture of the Democratic Attorney's Attorney who initiated Perry's criminal charges for abuse of power.
The tweet was later deleted and another was posted on Perry's account, which distanced itself from the previous one.
A tweet that was not authorized by the postoron left my account.
"I disagree with the tweet and I downloaded it," he said in another post.
Perry's assistants did not respond to the news asking questions immediately.
Although the tweets were sent from Perry's official account, it is unclear who is actually responsible for managing it.
The previous tweet was posted by an unflattering, humorous picture of Travis County Attorney General Rosemary Lehmberg, who was convicted of drunk driving in April 2013.
When she refused to resign, Perry refused to disburse funds for her office, which brought up a possible 2016 presidential nominee in the 2016 election before a grand jury in Austin.
The tweeted label read: "I don't always drive with a blood-alcohol level three times higher than the permitted limit . . . but if I do, I'll sue Governor Perry for being held accountable for it."
I'm the drunkest Democrat in Texas.
The investigation against Perry was not held by Lehmberg's office.
He was in charge of Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor from San Antonio who was designated by the Republican judge.
Perry was found not guilty and called the accusation a tactical, political maneuver.
His qualified law team has asked the judge overseeing the case to dismiss the charges because the use of the lawsuit for the prosecution of the longest-serving governor in Texas history is unconstitutional.
Perry interrupted the disbursement of $7.5 million from the state's Public Interest Department, which is headquartered in Travis County and prosecuted corruption in Texas, after Lehmberg refused to resign.
The rejection was prompted by a formal complaint from a left-leaning group of civil rights activists.
Perry's official account is active - and sometimes it's famous.
After finishing fifth on his party's committee in Iowa during his 2012 presidential campaign, Perry responded to speculation that he might be done by now, tweeting with his own photo of him running near the lake, saying, "Here I am, South Carolina!"
According to Berkeley, the housing market is returning to normal
One of London's most prominent development companies has warned that the housing market has "refuted" to the normal level of activity in South-East England.
Housing in the capital was subject to high demand and rising prices and widespread concerns about the credit bubble prompted the Bank of England to impose limits on mortgages in June.
Tony Pidgley, founder and chairman of the property developer for demanding clients, Berkeley said on Monday: "From the start of the current financial year, the market has returned from the top point in 2013 to the normal level of transactions." It adds that it provides a "stable environment for operation."
The London housing market did well during the downturn, as buyers from abroad flooded the capital.
According to Land Registry data, prices in the city jumped by 18.5% in the past year alone, far overtake the average of 6.7% in England and throughout Wales.
Average sales prices for private, affordable and student housing from Berkeley rose by about a fifth last year and climbed to £423,000 at the end of April.
However, because of the strengthening pound, they have not been as attractive to foreign buyers of London properties in recent months - some of them have also been intimidated by the introduction of new property taxes and talk of a possible "squeech tax" that politicians came up with before next May's parliamentary elections.
London real estate agency Foxtons warned last week that the April revision of the mortgage market, which introduced stricter lending rules, would also slow the pace of market growth for both house sales and prices during the second half of the year.
New data from the Bank of England on Monday showed a drop in the amount of approved mortgages for the month of July, suggesting that the housing market is calming down.
Hamptons International, another real estate agency, has fallen on the basis that house prices have already started to fall, their forecast of a rise in the price of London's properties for 2015 to 3%.
Meanwhile, according to real estate agent WA Ellis, the volume of transactions fell by a quarter each year in London's most expensive neighborhoods, such as Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington.
Still, the demand for housing in the capital was a boon for Berkeley, as it increased cash for forward sales to more than £2.2 billion.
Pidgley added, "Demand for the right, good-looking housing in a good location has remained the same, and as a result, the forward sale has been maintained."
In June, the company reported that it had sold 3,742 properties from the beginning of the year to the end of April, almost a third more than before the peak of the crisis in 2007.
Annual pre-tax profit increased by 40% to £380 million, yields by 18% to £1.6 billion.
Spear on Monday, Pidgley said he had predicted that Berkeley's annual returns would be in line with current market expectations.
Analysts agree that the annual pre-tax profit will be £450 million.
Berkeley's stock stopped at £23.96 in the afternoon on the London Stock Exchange.
Hacker posted pictures of nude Jennifer Lawrence online
Jennifer Lawrence arrives for the 85th Academy Awards.
Photos of Oscar winner Jennifer Lawrence were leaked online for a hacker claiming to have a "list" of pictures of hundreds of aspiring actresses.
A spokesman for the star of the "Hunger Games" confirmed that Lawrence's photos were genuine and criticized the hacker for "an official privacy breaches."
Authorities have already been contacted and will prosecute anyone who releases the stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence.
The hacker reportedly acquired the photos, which were originally posted on the 4chan image-sharing site, due to a gap in the Apple iCloud internet repository system. The alleged list of photos of hacked victims, according to BuzzFeed, includes the names of dozens of stars including Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Mary-Kate Olsen.
It is unclear how many photos are authentic, however, the star of the film "Scott Pilgrim against the rest of the world" Winstead also criticized the act on Twitter.
"I hope those of you who look at the pictures my husband and I took in the privacy of your home years ago are happy with each other," Winstead wrote on Twitter.
But Victoria Justice, a friend of the Nickolodeon cable series "iCarly" and "Victorious," denied that the photos were real. She posted on Twitter, "These nude photos of me are HAH, CBC."
Better to cut it out in the heat. *intent verbal play*.
Buzzfeed announced Sunday night that a spokesman for pop star Ariana Grande denied that the alleged photographs were genuine.
Extraordinary excerpt from Howard Jacobson's a touted new novel about the love and the letter "J"
They dissolve, that's the best way to describe it, they gradually unfolor them as a cardboard box left in the rain.
Only from time to time did a woman tell him that he was too serious, complex, violent, isolated, and perhaps a little irritable.
And then she shook his hand.
Infit's anannotated he admitted it.
He could sting like a hedgehog, yes.
The last victim of this abilities of his was an incipient love affair that more than ever promised to relieve him of the lonely boredom of his life and perhaps give him some satisfaction.
Ailinn Solomons was a frail beauty with a wild-haired mane of hair and a fickle heart from a village on the northern island that was even more remote and inhospitable than Port Reuben.
To the south, she came with an older companion whom Kevern thought was her aunt, who had inherited the property in a damp but beautiful valley called, a sorely, Paradise Valley.
The house has not been lived in the house for several years.
The pipes seer was leaking, the tubes were dead in the tubes, the slugs with a slime sign on the windows, as if to think the place belonged to them, the garden was overgrown, and the weeds resembled huge cabbage-push rops.
The house looked like a cottage from children's stories, terrifying and both glamorous, with a garden full of secrets.
Author's profile: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" is on the preliminary list of nominations for the 2014 Man Booker Prize.
A narrower selection will be announced next week.
Kevern and Ailinn sat on folding chairs in the long grass, holding hands, enjoying an unexpectedly warm spring afternoon, absently tuning in to a public-seat station that supplied the country with comforting music and soothing news as the sight of its tanned, crossed legs reminded him of an old song by a long-forgotten black comedian, whom his father liked to listen to with the turf-turned shuttles.
Your legs are too big.
Because of their natural aggressiveness, they didn't play such songs on the radio anymore.
They weren't forbidden - there was really no forbidden - they just weren't played.
They helped them get into the desuetrach, as well as the word desuetudo itself.
Folk taste has proved what the regulations and status of the outside the law have never proved, and just as people are choosing a memoir in books in which the poor man becomes rich, cookbooks and love novels, so music is chosen by ballads.
Kavern let himself down his day and began to play the imaginary piano and, in a coarse, comic voice, sang to Aillin's big feet.
Ailinn didn't understand.
"That was a favorite song by the jazz pianist Fats Waller," he said, automatically putting two fingers to his lips.
That's what his father always did when he wanted to suppress the letter j before he comes out of his mouth.
It started out as a game when he was a kid.
His father told him he had played the game with his father.
When you didn't put two fingers in the word that started for the j, it cost you a penny.
Even then, it wasn't very funny, and it wasn't funny now.
He just knew it was expected of him, that was all.
He had to explain what jazz was.
Ailinn had never heard one.
Even jazz, even if it was not outlawed directly, did not play.
Improvisation has come out of fashion.
There was only room in life for one "if."
When the tunes started to play, people wanted to know exactly where they'd end up.
Same with humor.
His unseeingability got on people's nerves.
And jazz was a humor expressed in song.
Although he had not heard of Samma Davis Junior until he was ten, Kevern knew the jazz from his father's semi-secret collection of old CDs.
But at least Aillin didn't have to say that Fats Waller was a black man.
Because of her age, she couldn't remember the time when the popular singers weren't black.
Also without laws or coercion.
The permant society is one in which every part of it, with gratitude - the gratitude of those who were fortuitous by chance - agrees with the principle of group gratitude.
People of Afro-Caribibbean were well suited to entertaining and athletics by temperament and constitution, so they sang and ran.
People from the Indian subcontinent, as if by nature gifted for electronics, took responsibility for the fact that no family would be without a functional phone.
The Poles who remained were plumbers, the Greeks left, the dishes werehed out.
Those from the Gulf states and the Levant, whose grandparents did not leave the country quickly, while it was done TOWN, WHAT SE STALO, WHEN SE TO STALO - they were afraid of accusing them of putting them in the fire, in fact, fearing that the fire would be spent next time - they opened the restaurants where the labno was sold and the water-dimno smoked, they didn't draw attention to themselves, and the inactivity was slowly consuming them.
To each to his talent.
As she only listened to ballads, Ailinn found it hard to see how the dirty words Kavern had just sung to her could have produced music.
Music was an expression of love.
"They're not really rude," Kevern said.
Maybe just for people who have too big feet.
My father never offended anyone, but he liked this song.
He spoke too much, but the neglected garden gave the illusion of safety.
From behind the soundproofed leaves, no word could escape.
Ailinn still didn't understand.
Why would your father like that?
He wanted to say it was a joke, but he was reluctant to put two fingers to his mouth again in her presence.
She thought he was weird.
"He was witty," he said at last.
She shook her head in infbelt, and her viewed Kevern.
There was nothing to see in the wide world but a jumble of her raven hair.
He didn't want to see anything else.
"If you say so," she said doubtfully.
That still doesn't explain why you're singing it to me.
She looked really upset.
My legs are too big?
He looked again.
No.
Maybe a little ankle...
You're saying you hate me because my ankles are too fat?
Do I?
That's not true.
It's just a silly song.
He could have called her "I love you," but it was too soon.
"Your fat ankles are attracting me right now," he tried.
I'm kind of creepy.
That didn't work.
He wanted to be funny.
When he wanted to be funny, he was often in trouble, because, like his father, he lacked the magic necessary to tame the cruelty that lurked in the jokes.
Perhaps his father was cruel intentionally.
Perhaps Kavern was deliberately cruel.
In spite of the kind eyes.
Ailinn Solomons reddened and rose from the crippled, knocked the radio off, and spilled the unfinished wine.
Bezin wine, so it's not the drink.
She looked as if she was shaking in her excitement like palm leaves in a storm.
"I'm sickly drawn to being a jerk," she said. . . .
Except I'm not drawn to it.
He felt sorry for her, both for her unloatteal words, the fear she had in her eyes when she faced him.
Did she think she'd be hit?
She didn't talk to him about life on the cold northern peninsula where she grew up, but he had no doubt that in the foundations it was the same as here.
The same wide and icy ocean shattered over them.
The same deranged men, then, WITH THE STALO, even even more pett and grumpy than their ancestors, the smugglers and spooners, angrily wandering from pub to pub to pub, ready to lay their hand on any woman who would dare to refuse or laugh at them.
A moron?
If she's not careful, they'll show her their fists!
First, cuddly her - cuddly, she became the most common term for erotic irritation between a man and a woman: an antidote to the frosting ballads of love that the radio was chasing - first she was anointed, then one of hers.
In Kevern's view, over-cultivating, because the cuddling was an act of violence in itself.
Ailinn Solomons neverbicly indicated to him to leave.
He got up from the cripple like an old man.
She felt cranky, but the weight of his sadness surprised her.
It wasn't the end of the world.
They hardly knew each.
She watched her walk - as if she had been watching him from a upstairs window - the man who had caught up with what had he himself caused.
Adam leaving the garden, she thought.
Her heart tightened for him and for all the men in general, regardless of the fact that a few of them beat her.
The man turned away from her, his shoulders down, shaken, defeated, all the belligerence had left him - why did it feel he knew this look well, though she couldn't recall a single moment until today, that she'd ever seen it before?
Ailinn Solomons, alone again, looked at her legs.
About twenty years after these events, Esme Nussbaum, an intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year-old researcher working in Ofnow, the non-statutory Public Moods Monitoring System, prepared a short article about the persistence of minor and moderate violent acts in the country's mitigation or a direct halt were most expected if enough money and energy were spent on its removal.
"A lot has been done, and a lot has yet to be done," she wrote, "to be reassured by the innate aggressiveness of the people who have fought in many battles and won most of them, especially in the hilted, hard-to-reach places of the earth, where, despite the tips of the church towers, the air of human kindness has rarely been found historically, despite the tips of the church towers ascended by living fences of human kindness."
But some things are irreplaceable.
It might seem that the higher the church tower, the lower the instincts.
Residents sigh at the sentimental ballads, devour unhappy stories and declare that they firmly believe in the value of marriage and family life, but not only do old brutality hold as stubbornly in rural areas as stubborn as in urban agglomerations, but the evidence also shows that new and offensive intolerance is emerging at home, in the workplace, the roads and even on the sports grounds.
"Unfortunately, you tend to be too florid," her superior said.
I would suggest that you read fewer novels.
Esme Nussbaum bowed her head.
I also have to ask: are you an atheist?
"I don't think I have to answer that," Esme Nussbaum said.
Are you a lesbian?
Esme once again objected to her privacy and silence.
Feminist?
More silence.
"I'm not asking for that," Rabinowitz said at last, "that I have something against atheists, lesbians or feminists.
We're not prejudiced in this workplace.
We serve unplupic companies.
But a kind of hypersensitivity that is itself perfectly acceptable and commendable can sometimes distort judgment as you have demonstrated.
Obviously, you yourself are biased against the church - the things you call "cruel" and "brutal" others might also interpret as an expression of natural power and energy.
Always solving CO SE STALO, WHEN SE TO STALO, as if that had happened, yesterday, was preparing a country with its basic life force.
While Rabinowitz spoke, Esme Nussbaum looked around.
Behind his head, the light board's light-scented recommendation flashed pink, which had been broadcasting into the world of the last quarter-century or more.
Smile at your neighbor, take care of your partner, listen to the ballads, go to the musicals, use your phone, converse, explain, agree, apologize.
Talking is better than silence, the sung is better than the written one, but there is nothing better than love.
"I completely understand your reservations," Esme Nussbaum replied quietly, as she was sure her superior had finished, "and I no longer say that the blow was not healed as we tell myself it to healed.
Above all, I fear is that if we are not alerted to this in advance, we will repeat the same mistake that led to CO SE STALO, WHENS SE TO STALO.
This time, though, we're not going to vent our anger and distrust on the others.
Luther Rabinowitz joined the fingertips.
This was meant to indicate endless patience.
"You're looking too far," he said, "when the steps they may have taken and may have not been taken by your grandparents are described as mistakes.
You also go too far in talking about venting their "refumel" and "distrust" on the "others."
I should not be reminded of anyone in your position that in understanding the past and in the protection of the present we do not talk about "them" and "kun."
There was no "we" and there were no "they."
All we know is that these were chaotic times.
'Whe's at which, if we're honest with each other,' Esme said, 'no one is blameless.
I'm not blaming anyone.
Just or not, what happened, happened.
That was before.
There's nothing to say about that - we agree on this.
And just as there is no guilt to blame for anyone, there are no things that should be corrected, even if the remedy was appropriate and perhaps.
But what's the point of the past is for but to learn from it -
The past exists to forget her.
If there's anything I can add to that -
Luther Rabinowitz unplug the fingertips.
"I'll take your report into consideration," he said, releating it.
The day she went to work as usual, she was hit by a motorcyclist who hit the pavement in a way that was described by passers-by as "brutal and furious."
Accidents happen.
The Forest Kingdom's Army says no coup is planned - the Prime Minister remains in South Africa
Military officers of the Forest Reality denied that they were organizing a coup to overthrow the government and claim to have acted against the police suspected of attempting to arm political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane fled the country and says the military has surrounded his official headquarters and seized government buildings in the capital, Maseru.
After saying he was being threatened with death, the prime minister and his family went to the neighbouring South Africa.
Army spokesman Major Ntlele Ntoi said it was not really a coup, but the army's response to the threat of "political fanatics" that the police were trying to arm.
"The command of the Defence Forces of the Lesothic Defense Service acted this morning after receiving several reports from the information service that there were several groups in the police ranks that were planning to arm some radical, political fanatics who were about to make havoc in the country," he told The Voice of America.
South African government spokesman Clayson Monyela said the military actions looked like an attempt to overthrow the government.
"Although no one has declared that he has seized government power with force, the actions of the Forest ofoth Defence seem to bear signs of a coup d'état," he said.
Military officials of the Kingdom of Leshoth said the soldiers returned to their barracks on Sunday and the capital was quiet.
During Thaban's absence, Deputy Prime Minister Mothetjoa Metsing will be responsible for the government.
Thabane said that, in his view, he was targeted for his efforts to fight corruption in the country.
Since Thabane suspended parliament sessions in June over internal disputes, there has been tension in Lesotho.
He said that, despite the opposite of claims, he did not undermine the government's actions.
Eurozone production at 13-month low
Production growth, according to a closely watched poll in the eurozone in August, slowed to a 13-month low.
The final index of euro area purchasing managers (PMI) from June's 51.8 to fell to 50.7 in August.
A figure higher than 50 indicates expansion.
New orders have been lost and the factories have been hurt by rising tensions between the EU and Russia over Ukraine.
The figures come from Thursday's meeting of the European Central Bank (ECB).
Markets will want a clear plan from the bank to deal with the delayed recovery of the euro area as well as the threat of deflation with inflation stagnant at 0.3%.
There has been speculation that ECB Director Mario Draghi may have indicated this week that he is considering quantitative easing for the eurozone, similar to what the UK and the US had approached during the financial crisis.
"Although at least some growth is better than no growth, the braking effect that the growing economy and geopolitical insecurity have on manufacturers is becoming increasingly visible," said Rob Dobson, Markit's chief economist.
Germany's production PMI, Russia's largest trading partner in the EU, fell to an 11-month low of 51.4.
In the zone's second-largest economy, France, the PMI fell to 46.9.
There is concern about France, Italy has gone from the expansion of the stagnation.
Signs that the driving force for growth in the most important industrial areas in Germany, Spain and also the Netherlands has disappeared is also not very reassuring," Dobson said.
The slowdown in the industry is likely to add fuel to the fire for analysts expecting the implementation of other monetary or tax incentives.
One positive report came from the Republic of Ireland, where the PMI rose to 57.3, the highest level since the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, chief economist at IHS Global Insight, said, "The best you can say about the purchasing managers' production report for August is that it shows that the sector is still growing."
He added: Eurozone manufacturers currently have a very complex life, because the increasing geopolitical tensions - especially between Russia and Ukraine - add even more insecurity to the still challenging conditions in many countries.
This increasing uncertainty has demonstrably hit the trade - and in particular consumer confidence, which is likely to cause some of the orders to be deferred or even cancelled, especially the costly ones.
He said that it appeared to be "quite more likely" that the ECB would eventually have to implement some form of quantitative easing, "althy, if we expect it to be limited."
Ten years of hell for the Beslan survivors: Ten years since the horror of the occupied school, children are still suffering
Ten years ago, 1,000 people were taken hostage by Chechen militants at a school in Beslan, South Russia
During the ordeal, which lasted three days and which shocked the world, more than 330 people were killed, more than half of whom were children
We returned to Beslan to seek out some of the victims who escaped death during the atrorose at the school
Exactly ten years after the horrific cast of the Beslan school, which killed 334 people, including 186 children, the surviving heroes warned last night about a new apocalypse in Ukraine.
When, on September 1, 2004, at the start of the new school year, fanatical terrorists captured children and parents, it looked like the deepest bottom of hell.
Resistance to the tragedy united the east and west, leading to negotiations and the future in this disastrous disaster.
After ten years, we returned to Beslan in southern Russia to seek out some of the victims who had escaped death during the atrorocity at the school.
We have found amazing young people who have resisted the misfortune, even if the memory of the inferno caused by the terrorists will live in them.
What is their greatest wish?
That the war that is now destroying Ukraine - and in which children like they were dying - should be over.
A girl trying to climb back into a ruined school gym
She was captured by the leading Russian photographer, Dimitrij Beliakov, as she only tried to crawl back into the bombed-out school gym in her underwear after a bomb exploded.
Confused, Aida searched desperately for her mother, Larissa, who is now forty.
There were fears that they were both dead, but had actually survived.
"A woman told me to run and save my life, but I couldn't," Aida had said.
My legs were bloody.
I got up and got in and crawled back to find my mother.
She was rescued by a soldier.
After several surgeries, she thought she had made her full recovery, but yesterday she said, "Three months ago, the pains returned.
I'm afraid I'll have to have another surgery.
I was left with bits of shrapnel in my knee.
Her goal is to become a dentist so she can help people the way the doctors helped her.
"This tragedy changed my life, but it certainly didn't destroy it," she said firmly.
"It just happened to me, and it can't be changed.
I go to the gym once a year to remember the ones who stayed there.
Otherwise, we try not to talk to your friends about it.
The pain is too much.
My best friend and future classmate of Jeru Gapoevu's class were killed there.
We played together as a kid and imagined us going to school together.
"I don't want to get married until I finish school and start my career.
I'll think about the family later.
She says she hasn't forgotten the capture, but the memories fade a little by the year.
I'm glad so many people around the world still remember what happened, and we're very grateful for the help we got from Britain and other countries.
When I look at my picture online, climbing through the school window, I tell myself that a lot of people will see it for the first time, understand the disaster and prevent it from happening again.
A boy who escaped with a rain of bullets and believed his mother was dead
It was his first day of school (in Russia, children start school at the age of seven) and survived a three-day siege of a school in the embrace of his mother, Tamara.
At the time, the seven-year-old said, "My mom told me that if there was an explosion, I should lie down on the ground and hold her hand."
After the explosion, he thought his mother was dying.
She said to him, "Reminate."
He was afraid she was dead, ran, and saw a crying toddler as he went, grabbed the child's hand and ran by the shower of bullets.
His father, Vladimir, who caught him outside, said, "Damir told me that his mother was dead."
She says, "I couldn't have saved her."
In fact, Tamara staggered to her release and lay in the hospital with her injured leg, and on the contrary she thought her son had died.
After they met again, she said, "I cried with happiness.
I couldn't believe it.
He came in and hugged me.
Damir then flew to London (according to the defunct News of the World), where then-Schame Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Cherie were declared the winner of Bernardo's Children.
"The horror comes back every day, but I wish I could stop thinking about it," he said yesterday.
But I can say that the memories are fading.
I remember right after that, I threw away all my toy guns.
But today I can play computer games that shoot in, and I don't have a problem with that.
"I'm not afraid to go back to the gym, but I don't think about myself.
I remember the kids I played with in the yard who didn't get out.
We never say they were killed or died.
We say they stayed in the gym.
I remember the trip to London well, especially how I could have picked out anything I wanted in the toy store, and how I drove through a convertible.
But now he is concerned about a place like Ukraine where he suffers because of the war as he and his friends suffered.
The horror comes back every day, but I wish I could stop thinking about it
"I am terribly sorry for anyone who has to go through such a horror," says Damir, who attended the monastery's volunteering business last week.
I want to help so much.
I want to work in the police force one day and I hope to be accepted to the academy next year.
His mother, Tamara, 48, says, "They've got 37 children from our neighborhood, can you imagine?
I remember the silence right after the attack. There were no children to scream and run around, and the silence lasted for months.
He remembers his journey with Damir to London.
When I told our story in London, people cried.
Then I realized how people on the other side of the world could understand our feelings and how they could express their support.
She was grateful to Cherie Blair and her foundation for the award and the chance to go to London in autumn 2004.
I wish I could call Cherie and say in person that even though it's been ten years, I still remember meeting her and her husband in London and how they helped me and Damiro.
I remember Damir's appetite for borsch, so they called all the Russian restaurants.
I also remember him playing with the waiters in the restaurant, Damir shooting a water pistol at them, and they ran and played with him.
And that was only a month since the horror.
I was surprised how the British wanted to share our pain with us and how they supported us.
She said, "I still think the world hasn't changed for the better in ten years.
Now there is a war in Ukraine, people are dying every day, and I think a lot of children have been and will be killed.
They're the same kids as ours.
I think for a lot of people, war is just something on the news that they listen to when they're bored or while doing something else.
I know what these people are going through, what the horror is.
I can still feel it.
Nothing's changed, people still want to murder each other, it's so sad.
Damir grew up and he's a nice and quiet kid, not at all aggressive or angry.
For example, he doesn't want revenge, he doesn't care about that at all.
I know he doesn't like to remember it, but he's very close to six classmates and from time to time he goes to the gym and light candles.
When he was younger, he had trouble with it - I remember sometimes lying on the couch with his face facing away from us and sometimes lying for hours.
He wasn't sleeping, his eyes were open.
I also remember he threw out all his guns or other toys. the Damiro is 17, he's taller than me, handsome, smart and healthy.
I can hardly believe that I was sure for several hours that he was dead and that I would never see him again.
When I recovered from the explosion and got up to my feet, I looked around and saw the inferno, there were pieces of human body everywhere.
I was absolutely sure my little boy didn't have a chance to survive this hell.
"I remember yelling 'Damir, run, run!' but I was convinced he hadn't heard me.
But he heard her and ran away.
So our lives go on, as opposed to others.
Grigory Ilyin, 17
The boy taken photo taken after the attack became a symbol of the horrors in Beslan
Ail: The Beslan survivor Grigorij Ilyin with his mother Fatima after the 2004 attack, Grigori to the right
As he ran for his life after a Chechen terrorist shot his classmates, he was intimidated into his bloodied face.
His photo was one of the most shocking symbols of the atrocity in Beslan.
His mother, Fatima, 54, a doctor, dropped him off at the school on his first day and rushed to take his older son, Vladimir, to the university.
"I left two minutes before the terrorists stormed into the yard, leaving my little boy alone for three days," she recalled.
Not all by myself, because we had relatives there, but they all died.
Only my Grigori survived.
As the date gets coming, it's getting harder to think about and talk about it.
Not a single day goes by that we don't remember the tragedy.
It doesn't seem to us that it happened a long time ago, I feel like it was yesterday, some of the moments keep coming back to me.
I promise no one will ever forget.
Still returning memories: A photo of Grigory (left) was one of the most shocking pictures of the attack and was immortalized as a sculpture (right)
I remember when Grigori was really looking forward to school that day, saying he wanted to hug his teacher.
I learned that he was alive when I saw him on TV.
There's even a statue of the weeping Grigori in San Marino.
Grigori doesn't like looking at the photo, and we're hiding it in the bookcase at home.
I get it, but I also think that the picture makes people all over the world know the pain we feel.
Today, Grigori says, "The important thing is that this doesn't happen again.
"I doubt we'll ever know the truth.
Tragies like this are still under investigation, but no one will ever find out the truth.
They're now investigating the Boeing crash in Ukraine.
Will we ever know what the cause was?
This world is in for something very bad.
"I don't understand why this is happening, because if you ask people, no one wants a war, then how is that possible?
Ten years is nothing to do for such pain.
To forget a little, he needs decades.
It's had an impact on my health, I can still feel it.
I had nightmares for three or four years because of the attack, but then it got better.
Then, when I returned to school in 2004, I was terrified every day.
I was thinking about my friends and classmates who were killed.
That's why, as September 1st, I go to the gym.
I want to honor the memory of childhood friends.
It's hard for me to enter the gym, but I have to.
I don't feel like a victim, this story is a thing of the past.
I won't forget it, but I don't regret it.
My life goes on.
This year I finished school and started studying medicine at the University of Vladikavkaz.
I want to be a cardiothoracic surgeon.
First I wanted to join the army.
I wanted to be a soldier, but I couldn't help it because of my health.
I wanted to fight for my country, but I can't.
Grogori Farniyyev, 20
The boy who survived despite being held at the feet of the murdering terrorist
A miracle: Gregori Farniyev was held at the feet of the murdering terrorist during the attack, but still managed to survive
When the attack was in full swing, he was caught trapped in the gym sitting next to the bomb at the feet of the murdering terrorist.
It's a real miracle he survived.
"It feels like it was yesterday," said Gregori, who wanted to become an agent of the Federal Security Service but was unable to suffer because of the injuries he sustained during the attack.
It's still with me, it's not something I put behind me.
I'm older now, and it's said that kids can deal with bad experiences better - I have to say, that's not true.
"I went to a psychologist in 2006 and it made me feel a little better, but I can't forget.
And I'd like to forget.
In 2005 - the year after - it was the first and last time I entered the gym again.
I fainted.
I will never go there again, and please do not ask me to show you where I am sitting on the well-known picture.
Survival: Gregory Farniev today, on his laptop with his photo taken in hospital after the attack
The pain is enormous and I bring it with me every day.
My friends know I don't like to think about it or talk about it, and they never ask me about school.
As for physical health, I'm fine.
I have to be careful with my knee, which I hurt myself, but I'm walking normally.
But even so, for the sake of my health, I was unable to enter and to study at the FBS Academy in St. Petersburg as I wanted.
I sent them my documents, including medical reports, and they replied that this was not possible.
My next hob, the animals, so I got into the vet.
I made it for the second year.
They learn how to heal all animals from "knuck in to cows."
He said, "I know I will never tell my children about it.
It's not something that children should know about, and certainly not something they should experience.
His mother, Marina, 42, said, "The pain will be here all the time.
He's inside and worsens with the upcoming anniversary.
I will attend the commemorative ceremonies.
I know Grigori won't go.
It must be even stronger for him because he was there, unlike me.
I was waiting for him at home and I couldn't help him.
I'm so grateful to thank him to get it back. here in Beslan, there's footprints everywhere.
It stays with us.
Gregori is an adult today, but he carries the horror.
It's hard to accept when something so terribly unfair happens to you.
He's a kid, he likes sports, but he can't do it for his knee.
He's had several surgeries, he can walk, but he can't exercise.
I'd say, about a 50% of the horror, but you can't forget it completely and you can't forget it.
This terrible experience with us will always be.
A lot of our friends and neighbors were killed during the attack, and that only makes the pain worse.
I lost a lot of people I loved and who were close to me.
My son is with me, and that's the greatest gift God could give me, but it hurts me to lose the killings.
I know families in whom more children were born, but also widows who were not married again.
It's hard to accept that life goes on, even if you don't want to.
I'll never forget my heart almost jumping out of my chest when I saw him in the hospital.
Now I observe what is happening in the world - wars in other places.
What are these people fighting for?
Why are they killing each other?
The war is now approaching our country, which I can hardly believe.
We've been a friendly country in the past, so how did we get to the fact that we're fighting now?
People and children are suffering, I am sure that many children in Ukraine have been and will still be killed.
If only we could have taken all the rebels together and throw them away as far as we could.
Alyona Tskaev, 10
The child who was taken to safety by a special squad
Saved: Alyon Tskaev is carried into a verving Russian special commando (left).
Now she is ten (right) and does not remember the tragedy at all
The world gasped in 2004 when little Alyon was carried out in her arms by a Russian police officer in Beslan's captivity.
The terrorists released her, but in captivity at the school's gym, they retained her 30-year-old mother, 10-year-old sister Kristina and brother Makhar.
Makhar, who was three years old at the time, escaped, but Alyon's mother and sister died in the massacre.
Her brother Ruslan remarried and he and his new wife, Svetlana, have a little girl, who was named Kristina after the dead daughter.
Neighbors say that Alyona, who is now ten, has no recollection of the attack and has grown into a glitky and happy little girl.
A close friend said that "it's a big happy family and Alyona and Makhar are great kids."
Ruslan is an excellent father and wants to keep the children far from the memories of the tenth anniversary.
You can understand why.
Man accused of hinging a girl at a sign crossing in the village of Fife
A 78-year-old man in court for hinging on a three-year-old girl at a signal crossing in the village of Fife.
Gordon Stewart allegedly hit the girl at a crossing in Pittenween in East Neuk.
Prosecutors claim that Stewart did not drive his Audi Q3 with sufficient regard and attention to the girl.
Stewart (78) of Anstrutheru denied the charges in Dundee's trial.
Judge Charles Macnair set the trial date for January.
4 tips on getting better photos and videos underwater
If you are interested in taking pictures or underwater shoot, you have a large selection of equipment.
The cheapest option is a compact such as the Nikon Coolpix AW120 or an outdoors-like GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition camera, which costs around $300.
I took these photos at the family party with a few cameras, all of which cost less than $350.
It doesn't matter what equipment you use, but there are several rules to achieve the best results.
Check your equipment.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure the batteries and other parts are tightly closed.
Next, set up the camera depending on what type of photos or videos you will take.
Some cameras and video cameras have a scenic or shooting mode that optimizes the exposure to the dark underwater environment.
And before you get started, see how far you can dive with your equipment.
Some cameras are only designed for 5 feet, with others up to 50 to 60.
Read our guide to the purchase and evaluation of digital cameras in both normal and waterproof design.
Always take a few pictures - a lot of them don't come out.
Compact cameras have LCDs to help you with a composite of photos, but the outdoors don't have it.
Even if you have an LCD, it will be hard to see under the water and the composition of the shot will be unseeable.
So always take multiple shots.
If the camera has a bracketing mode that makes a series of frames with a slightly different exposure dispersion, take advantage of it.
Stay close to the surface.
With a deeper dive of light, the light dives significantly.
If possible, stay close to the surface when taking pictures in the pool, the boron or the sea.
This also allows you to capture more light in the photos - the deeper you sink, the less color you will see.
Get close to the photographed object.
This is excellent advice if you are taking pictures on land, but underwater it is even more important because of the more muffled light.
This is particularly important if you are filming with an outdoor camera: Such devices usually have a fixed and wide lens angle, which means that if you want to fill the photo frame, you have to get closer to the objects.
Andrew Lawson was a man whose personality strength could change things even in such a huge organization as the NHS.
As an anaesthetist, he dedicated his career to relieving the pain caused by the disease and the treatment of the disease.
His wife recalls that one of the people who sought his help was an MI6 officer who had to live with the consequences of torture that mutilated him.
Lawson understood that while doctors focused on diagnoses and illnesses, the patients treated overwhelmingly interested in something else entirely: pain.
But one day in 2007, he was the one who began to suffer.
"I don't feel like myself," he wrote in May of that year.
I felt without power.
He struggled with the symptoms of the flu and found that he was impatient and his wife Juliet was a remorse.
He noted, "I want everything to happen sooner rather than later."
When Juliet left for a week's business trip, Lawson was unusually and inexplicably agitated.
Something was wrong.
A colleague gave him a chest X-ray.
He had been skiing in the French Alps two weeks before.
X-ray results came in.
It had a mesothelioma, an incurable tumor that afflicts the pleura, or the lining of the lungs.
For most, it is difficult to determine what was the cause of cancer.
Although some smokers get lung cancer, not all lung cancer patients have smoked.
But the mezoteliom is different.
In almost all cases, it is the cause of asbestos - the construction fibrous material, which was previously described as "distant" but is now known to be deadly.
For most of us, it was not difficult to ignore the mesotheome.
Asbestos, after all, belongs to the past.
The most dangerous type of asbestos has not been used in Britain since the 1960s, when the ban on the use of asbestos in industry came into force.
Even when asbestos was used, only certain groups of people came into close contact with it, such as insulation treasier, builders, carpenters and shipymen workers.
Toxin used in industry in another era now appears to be a cause for concern.
But such complacency is misplaced.
As it turns out, a cancer epidemic is now culminating in Britain.
The number of deaths per mesotheic is higher here than in any other country in the world.
2,500 deaths from the disease a year are twice as many as the number of victims of car accidents.
Deaths from mesotheicoma per year from 1980 and estimated deaths in the UK in the future
The reason we are only now feeling its effects, even though the use of asbestos has been illegal for years (all asbestos species were eventually banned by law in 1999) is that it usually takes several decades to develop a mesotheque.
The disaster of mesothelist, is not just about the veterans of the construction industry.
Asbestos was, and in many cases, it is still present, present in the homes in which we live, the offices where we work, in the schools where we learn, and in the shops we shop in.
So the Mezothecoma does not respect the social stratum, wealth, occupation, or age.
The privileged bastions from London's department stores to public schools do not constitute a hideout.
Parliament, too, is full of asbestos.
Even the hospitals in which we should be treated are the repositories of this mortal carcinogen.
Andrew Lawson was not old.
Nor did he consider isolation.
He tried to find out where he could come into contact with asbestos.
Then he found out.
"It is possible that a lot of asbestos was in the basement corridors of Guy's Hospital, where I spent six years on the practice," he wrote.
All of them - students, nurses, doctors, and doormen - used the corridors.
The question is, how many of my contemporaries get the same disease?
Unfortunately, it was a question he could partially answer.
"From the four doctors who were at the practice at Guy's Hospital and who were then shown to be a mesotheical in the past five years," he noted in a letter in 2010, "I'm the only one still alive."
How many of us get sick?
Andrew Lawson was diagnosed with the mesotheic when he was 48.
When he died on February 17 of this year, he was 55.
Survit with this diagnosis is not usual for so long.
55 percent of people diagnosed with mesotheia die within eight months of diagnosis.
The disease is always fatal.
So now we can only repeat to Lawson's question: "How much of us will get the same disease?"
According to the leading British mesothelioma expert Professor Julian Pete, the best estimate is that between 1970 and 2050, when the asbestos epidemic in Britain is taking place, around 90,000 people will die.
Most of them currently have no idea they will die in this way.
Asbestos Mine in Quebec, Canada
A by-graft insight into the files from the archives of the courts, to which the disabled often turn and require compensation, it shows how much the mesothelic scourge has spread.
For example, this June was admitted by Marks & Spencer to display asbestos Janice Allen out of negligence.
She worked for the chain for nine years, from 1978 to 1987, when she oversaw two stores in the clothing section - one of the sites being the company's flagship, a shop on Oxford Street.
Allen was only 18 when she started working for M&S.
Today he has two children, who are in their 20s.
"Before it happened," she says, "I've never heard of mesotheicoma before, I've barely known anything about asbestos.
I never dreamed he'd be involved in me.
There aren't many people who know something about asbestos.
In fact, it is not one substance that is asbestos, but a group of six minerals.
He was named because of his fibrillary structure, which gives him strength and flexibility.
Of the six minerals in the construction industry three were used.
Most often today, chryzotil, commonly known as white asbestos, is found in buildings.
It was used in roof panels, floor tiles, boiler tights and even brake lining.
It is not as lethal as other as asbestos forms, yet the EU and the WHO see it as a "great health risk" that can cause death.
But the more dangerous is brown asbestos (amosit) and blue asbestos (steykydolit).
Britain was once the world's largest importer of brown asbestos, and experts say that "there is a conclusive but circumstantial evidence that it was the main cause of the unusually high incidence of mesotheia [in the UK]."
Marsk & Spencer was exhibited at a flagship store in Oxford Street, London
Janice Allen may not consider herself a typical victim of mesothelioma, but Julian Pete's work points out that her story is not uncommon at all.
His patient study claims that "a substantial part of the cases of mesotheicoma without known exposure to asbestos at work or at home was likely caused by exposure to asbestos in the environment."
Much of this exposure is due to the "course use and weathering" of the buildings.
It seems that no one can be sure that he is safe.
The Goddard Consulting report, which examined the Palace of Westminster, shows that even the people of the government on Wednesday need not know that they may be subjected to asbestos.
In 2009, Goddard published a report saying that service lifts and pipelines behind the rooms of the parliamentary committee are contaminated with asbestos, the fatal fibres of which could be broken by something as harmless as the "strong air flow."
Ministers are often accused of only caring for their own interests, but in this case the opposite may be true.
Although the Directorate for Parliament's services insisted that the Palace of Westminster be given a "positated medical certificate" now, it is now envisaged that it will take £1 million and several years of work to be thoroughly inspected by Parliament, electricity to be modernised and asbestos removed, and that, after the 2015 elections, MPs will sit on the Green benches in Westminster rather than sit on the Green benches in Westminster.
The Goddard report states that "the presence of asbestos is not in line with several regulations."
It is impossible to say whether this mismatch will cost lives.
Everyone can only wait now.
One of the people who was never able to determine when they had an asbestos exhibit occurred was Graham Abbott, the doctor.
Like Andrew Lawson, Abbott (50) is suspected of being exposed to asbestos while working in hospitals.
"I worked at the hospital where the presence of asbestos was established," he says, "but in my case I cannot prove it.
It's difficult to remember all the places he worked and worked there.
But he clearly remembers the day at the beginning of December 2009, when he was climbed by something of a chilly.
He was 45, it was evening and he was in the middle of surgery.
Suddenly I shuddered.
It came at once.
I felt awful.
I thought I couldn't get in the car home.
Being a doctor, he knew the pain was coming from a pleura, a lining around his lungs.
But like Janice Allen, he had no reason to believe it was a mesotheicome.
He ended up spending a month at home.
Confused doctors gave him an X-ray of the chest and introduced him to have a chest catheter to remove the liquid from his lungs, which they sent for analysis.
Still, they've not diagnosed.
His condition slowly improved and returned to work.
From time to time, however, the symptoms returned to him, often after he had trained and breatdled.
In 2011, one of Abbott's patients with similar symptoms came to the OR and was subsequently diagnosed with mesotheelioma.
Even then, Abbott didn't associit with his own case.
After all, his patient was a few decades older and came into direct contact with asbestos at work.
In this case, the link was clear.
In September 2011, Abbott's condition deteriorated again and his doctor consulted his CT scan and X-rays with the panel of experts.
In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbott began to feel ill, a probe equipped with a camera was inserted into the space between the lining of the chest cavity and the lining of his lungs.
I'm optimistic.
I tend to not take much of anything," he says.
To be honest, I wasn't really worried about that.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried.
The biopsy results arrived between Christmas and New Year: "They told me it was a mesothelioma."
Graham Abbott: diagnosed with mesotheistoma
Abbott began to meet with sisters from the charity Macmillan, and one advised him to contact a lawyer.
That's when he realized the scale of the epidemic.
"It turns out that asbestos has been widely used, especially in large public buildings that often have asbestos thermal insulation in the pipes," he says.
For the people who were exposed to asbestos in these buildings, the disease is now beginning to show.
So the Mesotheome is now starting to apply to younger people who do not have risky occupations.
The most dangerous asbestos-insulated pipes were in the basement in hospitals, so it was unlikely that they would endanger the patients.
However, the staff members who crossed the basement corridors between the buildings (like Andrew Lawson) or ate in the basement dining halls (as often Graham Abbott) came into contact with the toxic substance.
As it now turns out, hospitals were a place to save the patients' lives, but also a place that could have endangered the lives of the doctors who treated them.
Asbestos is still being removed today.
Pupils built Bunsen's kahan on asbestos pads
And it's not just the hospitals.
Asbestos was often used in offices, shops, libraries and town halls for its excellent insulating and non-flammable properties.
Schools, too.
In fact, many people were exposed to asbestos at school.
Somewhere, in the myaltal hours of chemistry, the students were building a Bunsen kahan on the asbestos pad.
There have been a website dealing with the issue of asbestos in schools.
Harmless things like floor tiles or roofs of tool shelters in our homes were commonly included asbestos.
"This is an industrial poison built into a large number of houses," notes Andrew Morgan, the lawyer who represented Andrew Lawson in his lawsuit against Guy's Hospital.
In one case, there was only one contact with asbestos that a woman suffering from a mesotheicom could remember in the 1970s while downing a garden house.
So be careful how you're diving the garden house.
Knowing that the disease is untreatable, the impact of the diagnosis is huge.
"It takes a while for you to figure it out," Graham Abbott says.
I went back to work and tried to keep going, but I found I couldn't focus on what I was doing.
I was in the operating room for two weeks.
Then I realized I'd have to leave and deal with myself.
Well, I won't live to see another Christmas.
One of the most difficult things was going from a doctor's position to the position of the patient.
As a my sin of the patients before him, he remembers how confused he felt about the amount of information he had to deal with.
"It was hard to understand all this," he says.
"I asked my doctor, "How long did I have?"
I've been told 12 months.
I remember thinking, "Well, I'm not going to live to see another Christmas.
That's it.'
The Mesotheelom is particularly destructive because the very mechanism of what keeps us alive - the very breathing itself - is what causes the cancer that kills.
Most of the cases of mesothelicoma are caused by exposure to asbestos.
Asbestos is made up of tiny fibres.
When the asbestos is broken and the fibers are inhaled, they can settle in the pleura, the lining of the lungs.
The asbestos fibres irritate the plehabian and can induce a mutation of the cells.
"The problem is inhaled asbestos fibres in the shape of the needles," explains Professor Tom Treasure, a cardiothoracic surgeon who joined Guy's Hospital in 2001.
To the same hospital where Andrew Lawson was apparently exposed to asbestos and which, ironically, is the head center in the treatment of mesothelin.
Treasure knows and has also treated other patients who were exposed to asbestos probably during his experience at the hospital.
Asbestos needles enter the lung's tissue, says Treasure, and "the breathing itself pushes them to the edge where the lining is located.
By its nature, it has been invasive from the very beginning.
The mesotheic of the common therapeutic options used for other types of cancer do not work as much.
There is a hot debate, for example, on the effectiveness of the operation.
Some say it would be worth a try.
Treasure disagrees.
"You can't remove the pleura," he says.
You don't get a scalpel around it.
Cancer "not fans over to chemotherapy" which "has some effect" but does not heal.
"Sometimes there's someone who can survive lung cancer," says Treasure.
But in the end, they all die.
Fortunately, some patients live much longer than expected.
Author Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after the diagnosis.
Two and a half years since his own diagnosis, Graham Abbott has been still fighting.
After discovering the mesotheics, Abbott made contact with Andrew Lawson, who, four years after his diagnosis, became individual support and advisor for people equally affected.
As they called, he cheerfully introduced himself, "Hello, you've reached the cancer headquarters."
"He was very positive," says Abbott.
He was diagnosed with the disease four years ago and he was still very active.
In the beginning, Abbott was offered six cycles of chemotherapy that would last four months, and would probably only extend his life by a month.
"I was desperate," he says.
I wanted to give up.
But Lawson "call the things to be in a more optimistic light."
After visiting several doctors, Abbott decided to continue his treatment with Professor Loic Lang-Lazduski of the thoracic surgery department at Guy's Hospital.
"I had the advantage of not having to wait for them to be sent to him, but I just called and they gave me a look," Graham admits.
A normal patient would have to receive a requisitection and would have to approve the reimbursement.
In order to access the best available treatments, the issue of mesotheistoma is crucial for patients with mesotheome.
But when various treatments inevitably fail in the end, many patients face other financial concerns - the future of the family they leave behind.
And that's why they turn to the courts and want compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan of Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
"Since 1988, asbestos has been known to be harmful to health," says Morgan.
In the 1960s, however, it was discovered that even a very small amount of it could pose a health risk.
And here we encounter the negligence of companies.
Andrew Lawson and Guy's Hospital eventually leveled off, but according to Morgan, it was not a "full settlement" because Lawson could not definitively prove that the mesotheome was the result of asbestos exposure to Guy's Hospital.
However, after the investigation into the case, a spokesman for Guy's Hospital confirmed that "asbestos in the basement section in question was removed in the 1990s."
That was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How to remove asbestos
It has shown an exposure to fatal asbestos per company or job site - usually decades after it happened - has proved to be a huge problem for patients with mesotheome seeking compensation.
A lot of former workplaces changed hands or went bankrupt.
The insurance records were lost.
And those who are now resisting the charges have time on their side, which their prosecutors certainly do not.
In response to this fact, important new legislation was passed this year, making it easier for patients with a mesotheic to seek a settlement even if it is impossible to trace their former employer.
The law created a $350 million financial reserve, which is covered by insurance companies and which is intended for people diagnosed after July 2012, who can prove that they have been exposed to asbestos but have no one to sue.
In such a case, the disability will receive 80% of the amount that the court would normally have given them as a settlement - around £120,000.
There are 300 successful applications expected each year.
Andrew Morgan, like the mesothelioma patients, thinks £350 million is a "good job."
"It's an insurance deal for insurance companies," he says, pointing out that the sum is a quarter of what insurance companies would have to pay if time had not been hitting and people with mesothelioma would be able to reach out to their former employers and sue them in the normal way.
Even Mike Penning, a former Secretary of Labor and Social Affairs, admitted that the law "his gaps."
But both Penning and Morgan admit that, given the seven deaths each year, swift action was required.
"People are suffering too much and need help right away," Penning said in December last year during the second reading of the Mesothere Act.
Graham Abbott was in the care of Professor Loic Lang-Lazdunski for 19 months.
After initial consultations, Lang-Lazdunski recommended an operation that, unlike Tom Treasur, he thought had a positive effect.
The surgery was followed by radiotherapy and chemotherapy - a triple treatment for which Lang-Lazdunski can boast a survival rate of five years in up to 40% of patients.
Abbott was strengthened.
"That's not the most important thing, of course," says Abbott.
You see it all the time in patients.
There's something that drives you.
If you surrender, your condition can get worse very quickly.
Graham Abbott underwent surgery in March 2012.
In late August, he completed the last of six cycles of chemotherapy.
The checkpoints showed no symptoms of the disease.
I went to the next check in March [2014].
I had a few spots scattered in my chest [craw).
It was just approaching my 50th birthday.
It's not threatening life.
It's taking him.
Abbott underwent six cycles of chemotherapy again.
There are currently no traces of a tumor in his system.
But it is both a physically and emotionally exhausting process.
You have to think about practical things - financial security, when I die, or to show the woman how the alarm clock works on the boiler.
When you learn the bad news, you start to be negative.
You have to look forward.
As for the father of Ellie (16) and Tamsin (14), it's not always easy.
"It's hard for parents," he says.
It's hard to decide what to say and how much to say.
After the diagnosis, I told the girls that my condition meant I would never be old.
Their reaction was different.
Tamsin is very social and wild.
She told her friends, and all of a sudden, a lot of people started calling us.
Ellie was more restrained.
She didn't say much.
Such talks must be faced by all cancer patients.
In mesothelioma patients, however, such conversations are not reliered by hope or just a hint of a chance at survival.
The disease brings with it (and eventually brought to Stephen Jay Gould) a bleak certainty.
As Andrew Morgan says, "the enslelet doesn't threaten life."

Prohibition on the import of blue asbestos
The Court of Appeal confirms the first successful action for personal injury as a result of asbestos exposure in Britain.
World asbestos production is increasing to more than 4,213 000 tonnes per year.
The United Kingdom imports 139,000 tonnes.
The UK's Institute for Health and Safety requires all asbestos suppliers to have a licence.
The import and use of blue and brown asbestos are prohibited by law in Britain.
In Britain, the use of all types of asbestos is prohibited.
In the United Kingdom, the law on mesotheicoma comes into force.
It is launched for the $350 million compensation program.
Asbestos is banned in more than 50 countries, but in many parts of the world white asbestos is still used as a cheap building material.
World production is held at two million tonnes a year.
China refuses to give Hong Kong the power to choose leadership - protesters promise revenge
The Chinese parliament, despite the proliferating discussions on democratic reform on Sunday, decided not to allow voters in Hong Kong to nominate candidates for the 2017 elections.
The move is likely to spark long-promised protests in Hong Kong's business district, as activists began to organize and prepare just hours after the announcement.
China's People's Congress essentially allows communist leaders to eliminate any candidate who is not loyal to Beijing.
"We weren't surprised, but we were enraged," said lawmaker Emily Lau, the Democratic leader.
That's not what Beijing promised.
People were lied to in Hong Kong.
And it is clear that we are dealing with an authoritarian regime.
In defense of the Chinese decision, the Deputy Secretary-General of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, Li Fei, said that allowing public nominations in the Hong Kong leadership elections would be caused by a "chaos."
Since 1997, when Britain returned to China's administration to Hong Kong, Beijing has promised that from 2017, residents will be able to vote for executive power.
Chinese leaders presented Sunday's decision as a democratic breakthrough because Hong Kong is allowed to vote in direct, but the decision also makes it clear that Chinese leaders hold firm in the hands of the nomination process of a committee strictly controlled by Beijing.
And under the new clause, only the candidates who "love the country and Hong Kong" will be admissible.
The decision came after the summer months, which recorded some of the biggest and most watched protests in Hong Kong in several years.
Most of the pro-democratic protests in Hong Kong are the Occupy of Central Occupy and Peace movement, whose organizers have threatened to close the financial quarter if Beijing does not grant them universal voting rights.
On Sunday evening, just hours after the announcement, hundreds of Occupation supporters rallied in the rain outside the headquarters of the Hong Kong government.
At the demonstration, organizers said that their movement was entering a new phase of civil disobedience and that it would launch waves of protests in the coming weeks.
But they provided no further details, apparently to avoid problems with the authorities.
In their online statement, the organizers said the movement "did in direct the Centralement's occupation as a final step in the event that all the possibilities of dialogue are exhausted and there will be no other choice.
We regret to announce that today all possibilities of dialogue have been exhausted and the occupation of the Central is inevitable.
Authorities in Hong Kong have been preparing for Beijing's announcement for days, and on Sunday they strengthened the protection of the government's seat and deployed police and barricades.
The perimulation of the unrest, according to many Hong Kong residents, is a sign that it is slowly losing control of the city.
The torrential of landmen is increasing competition for products and services.
There are also growing concern that values such as democracy and freedom of speech are bending with increasing pressure from Beijing.
Some have criticized the Occupy of Central movement, saying their demonstrations threaten the trade - the Hong Kong lifeboat.
"The protest he's talking about could cause much more economic damage, depending on how many people attend and for how long," says politician Regina Ip, who has long criticized the movement.
We do not want to spread the concern that Hong Kong is getting out of control.
Such perceptions could hurt investment.
Chinese state media have also come up with reports in recent days that have been portrayed by democratic activists in Hong Kong as subversive agents run by the West.
In the summer, activists organised an unofficial referendum on voting rights, attended by 780 000 participants - more than a fifth of voters in Hong Kong.
And in July, tens of thousands of people took part in one of the largest pro-democratic demonstrations in the region's history.
The pre-election agitator?
The league in Jihlava is named after the political movement
The small soccer players in the regional city of Vysočina by around 1,600 amateur athletes.
And their top-flight is newly named Together for Jihlava League.
She took the name after one movement that goes to the local elections in October.
In addition, the ten on his ticket is the head of a small football in Jihlava, Jan Mráka.
"There was a general meeting where there was no problem with it," Mráka said.
The situation surrounding the first league of small football has already been dealt with by lawyers at Jihlava City Hall and recommended to change the subsidy distribution system.
Malá kicking received around a million crowns last year, according to the city's website.
This year, too, the figure is in the hundreds of thousands.
In the legal view, the procedure of small football is not against the law or the Municipality's directives.
However, the situation is an incentive for the Office to modify the rules for awarding grants and subsidies," said Municipality spokesman Radek Tulis.
Drain the city's subsidies and at the same time express support for one political party as a little soccer support in the election, it is unlikely to be possible.
A similar demand for highland "big" football has not yet come to the politicians.
That the CSSD, for example, would be formed by the regional champion, the ODS division or the KDU-ČSL 1.
And the class and the competition like that?
I wouldn't be in favour.
On the contrary, I would like to see us contacted by company sponsors," said Miroslav Vrzáček, chairman of the regional football association.
The head of small football of another party and the movement will not let into the league's name
According to the players of the small soccer, the sport in Jihlava deserved its own area with six playgrounds, dressing rooms and a sanitary facility.
"For example, the Na Stoupách pitch is not ours, we are rented there," said Ondřej Lapeš from the Starlet Jihlava club.
The most suitable location would be the Czech Mill.
But there will be, for example, a senseless area for skaters, of which there are about fifty in Jihlava, will be built there," Mráka pointed out.
The mayor of Jihlava, Jaroslav Vymazal (ODS), responded that the small soccer playground uses the artificial grass playground in the streets of Rošický and Na Stoupách, which are in the city's possession.
We want to build such playgrounds that have the maximum use.
We are preparing to modernise or build sports venues at schools that will be accessible in the afternoon.
I think there has been huge progress for the small soccer in the last few years," Vymazal added.
Other political parties in the league names will not appear, according to Jan Mráka.
We have limitations.
If someone from one field enters the partnership, we are no longer there for the other," he explained.
"The political movement in the name of the league, I consider this to be at least an unfortunate move," said Karel Voldán, a member of the town hall commission for sport.
"But let the voters assess whether Mr. Mráka is using the association Malá kopaná Jihlava and the city's subsidies for political purposes or not," he added.
American tradition infiltrates university life - freshman can fly jettroon
We are pleased to be able to respond to the demand by launching the first luxury travel service for students in Britain.
In order to leave the best impression on arrival at the university, the company also offers transport options including a private jet or type of Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Martin or McLaren P1 cars.
Stewart also stated that the service had a security page.
Service is the ideal option for students who would otherwise have to drag their stuff across the state in a dangerously loaded car.
We look forward to ensuring that with our VIF (very important fresher - a very important freshman) variants this year, we will ensure that students arrive at the university with a minimum of nervousness and the maximum of luxury.
A spokesman for the company said that, as the services have only just started, they have no reservations yet, but added: "Students will start making reservations in the next few weeks."
The company also said that although students pay annual tuition fees of £91,000, it expects the service to find its place on the market.
Compared to students ten, twenty, thirty, or forty years ago, today's students are different in terms of expectations and wishes - it's more important than ever to make the right first impression, and the VIF program is exactly the right way to do it.
But the National Union of Students criticized the service as unattainable.
Megan Dunn, vice president of the Union for Higher Education, noted: "For most students, such a project is unattainable.
A lot of students who are going to university this month have to come to terms with the financial crisis before they throw out thousands of pounds for something as simple as arriving at the college, because the available financial support in the form of loans and grants cannot keep up with the rising cost of basic needs.
Feminists oppose racism and police behavior after events in Ferguson
At the beginning of the month, a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, killed an unarmed teenager.
Those present waiting for the funeral with their hands up chant: "Hands up, don't shoot!"
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Missouri over the shooting of unarmed teenager Michael Brown, blogger Miriam Zoila Peréz noted the shift in online discussions by white female feminists.
She found that when it comes to promoting reproductive rights and income equality, white feminists favor the sexes over race.
With the growing tension in the Midwest, which drew the attention of the national press, Peréz noted that the white man's reaction is 100% focused on the race.
Compared to the reactions of black women soon after the shooting on August 9, personal articles with titles such as "the white woman's reflection on Ferguson" or "Feminism is not just about women's oppression" have occurred relatively late.
According to Peréz, however, this represents an important change.
"I don't think there are many people in the feminist movement who talk about race and privilege at that level," she said.
People felt that they had to comment on what had happened.
The crisis we face is characterised by this, because [the situation in Ferguson] is so racially outspoken that they had to draw attention to it.
According to the professor of English at the University of Ohio, Koritha Mitchell, Ferguson has brought to light the problems that African women have to face every day and which are not perceived as "female issues" in the cultural sphere.
"I can post funny stories about life with my partner on Facebook, and it'll get 150 leks from people from all over the world," Mitchell said.
When I write something about the fact that the coloreds are trapped in their own country, it's a dushding silence.
"How is it that a woman can speak publicly about relationships, but not about security in the public domain?" she asked.
For black women like Mitchell, who have addressed the issue of race, gender and sexuality in American history, there is no question of race and the sex of dichotomy.
The blacks, she said, could not afford the luxury of clearly dividing up these problems: they live in this mixed reality every day.
Although white women are now merited by the issue of race and gender in mainstream feminist circles, Angela Hattery, a female lecturer and gender studies at George Mason University, says their predecessors did the opposite.
Between 1865 and 1890, at least 10,000 blacks were lynched, and the reason was in almost all cases of white rape," Hattery said.
To justify the lynching you needed the cooperation of a white man.
According to Hattery, the split between white women and black women came when the campaign fighters like Susan B. Anthony explored the terrain at the end of the 19th century and realized that only one group of people - women or blacks - could have the right to vote.
"They decided to bet cards on women's voting rights and focus on the right for blacks later," Hattery said.
When we realize this, we get an important perspective on why colored women don't trust white women.
We didn't do a good job.
We never helped black women protect their husbands and children.
Even after women were given the right to vote in 1920, it took ten years to organize against lynching at the Southern Women's Association to Prevent Lynch.
The group was formed 40 years after the blacks first asked for help.
According to Mitchell, the uproar of the white feminists' reactions to the questions raised in Ferguson - the question of police conduct, racial discrimination - reflects a time when white feminists had to "cover up" the issues that black women faced from the generations.
"Wasn't it great if the activists in these areas of [the traditional feminism] took the right to raise a child as seriously as they took the right to contraception?" asked Mitchell.
The second wave of feminists who have made a career fight for reproductive law and access to contraception are now investigating what it means.
Major feminist activists like Gloria Steinem took Facebook's attack two weeks after the shooting of Michael Brown, where they released a Guardian column of Rebecca Carroll, which demanded that white Americans protest more vigorously against racism.
"I hope that women who have different but nevertheless similar reasons for understanding the dangers of society - and the views on the race that differ significantly in the opinion polls - will seek change," Steinem wrote.
Although Steinem espins the inter-sidignism of inter-sidering feminism, which includes both race and gender issues, confusing some people with comments on the issue of race in America.
American Enterprise Institute expert Christina Sommers, author of "Who Steals Feminism?" told The People that young men in the United States, especially young colored men, are "mightly more vulnerable to their sisters," but Steinem's remarks on Ferguson's parties face criticism previously.
We now have hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but almost none for boys.
But when the White House launched a small program, My Brother's Keeper, to help vulnerable young blacks and Hispanics, many feminists, including Gloria Steinem, provoked furious reactions.
The police's relationship with the black community is not the only problem that comes to the forefront of mainstream feminism.
After US border police detained nearly 63,000 unaccompanied teenagers in the southwest of the country this year, the issue of reform of immigration laws - this time as a women's question - has reiterated the issue.
Andrea Mercad, co-chaector We Belong Together, an organization mobilizing Women for the Reform of Immigration Laws, said that in order to present the issue as a necessity for women, all she had to do was share the stories of immigrant women.
"They speak for themselves," Mercado says.
As most work permits are granted to men, women who come with them find themselves in a position of vulnerable in terms of domestic violence and abuse.
"These stories are echoed by the women's organizations," she said.
The residence of the pig in Ipswich for sale
The real estate agency removed the picture of the house for sale in Suffolk - when it was published, a pig was resting on it in the living room.
The one-bedroom home cottage, which is for £120,000 for sale, is on a private trip in Ipswich.
The information photos included a picture of the living room in which he rests with his head on the pig's sofa.
Real estate agency Connells said the pig in the photograph was a pet of the owners.
"The photo was there by mistake, and that's why it's been removed," the office spokesman said.
In the property's property information, the real estate agency Connells described the former prayer room as a "single standone one-bedroom cottage."
Although the office has already removed the photo from its website, it still appears in the promotional material.
The sale of the house sparked interest on social networks, where some asked whether the pig was included in the price.
After lottery win, city of Harvey has a fresh-fresh millionaire in the southwest
The lottery player in Harvey will get a million.
A search for a new millionaire in southeast Perth is underway, one lucky man taking home $1.1 million from Saturday's lottery campaign.
The Harvey Traffic was lucky for the second time in five years, the last time it was a $1 million prize in November 2009.
But the happy winner has yet to register.
The store's owner, Steve Forward, said the entire city in southwest Perth was talking about the winnings.
It's the main theme, and they're all upset.
We thought a win like this was to the touch.
Eight winners split a single win in Western Australia last month, completing a few happy weeks.
Last weekend, a player in Canning Vale became one of the five millionaires in August, and just weeks earlier, a couple of Belmont's had won a whopping $7.5 million.
The winning couple had been betting for twenty years and said the prize would allow them to travel the world and buy a new house.
The millionaire of Harvey is the 59th lottery winner in Western Australia this year, winning a total of $85 million.
The Deutsche Bahn trains will not run out in the evening.
Train drivers want higher wages
In a press release, GDL called the protest a warning strike for which he deliberately chose time outside the rush hour.
The chosen time of the strike is taken into account by the GDL for many people who return from the weekend to the rail only on the first working day.
At the same time, we are also thinking of commuting people during the day," the trade union said in a press release on Monday morning to announce the strike.
"Our first strike should be hit primarily by freight, less by passengers," added the GDL.
DB has yet to release an official response to the strike announcement.
Nor is it clear how the protest action will affect international railway connections, including with the Czech Republic.
The union is demanding a five percent increase in train drivers' wages and a reduction in working hours by two hours per week.
Currently, the average salary of train drivers varies between 36,000 and 46,000 euros ($998,000 and 1.27 million) a year, depending on the years worked.
Train drivers work 39 hours a week at DB.
DB refuses to accept pay increases in the reduction of working hours.
They stress that the payroll valuation of train drivers must be developed in the same way as for other railway staff, for whom DB does not foresee the workweek shortening.
Krest's car was in danger of burning.
That's why he quit the Barum Rally
What exactly happened?
It was a material defect.
The car was brand new, so it didn't even occur to me that something like this would happen.
Could the exhaust be repaired provisionally and proceed at a slower pace to the service, where would the mechanics replace it?
If we'd headed straight there, yes.
But there were two more stages ahead of us, and we couldn't.
It's got a high temperature in it, and the risk of the car starting to burn was great.
I can't afford to.
At full pace, you've done five stages.
What was your impression of them?
Very good.
I felt like I was young.
We were fast, yet I didn't go through the vint.
It was all caused by the car being piped for more than six months to be on some level.
The race showed that we did it.
You drove it so you could have actually thought about winning.
I prepared myself and the car in such a way that we really had to win.
The work was not to be lost.
On the other hand, the result we could have been thinking about did not materialise.
But this is Barumka.
Unfortunately, the technique said no.
You weren't the only one of the top guys who stepped down early from the fight for the first place.
Foreign favorites Breen, Abbring or Lappi also dropped out.
Were you surprised that so many favorites resigned?
Yes.
It was a pity for the spectators, especially, because the race was over for prematurely.
Jaromír Tarabus, to whom you are preparing a car, has also been moving on to the top.
But he paid for flying out of the track and taking on a nearly two-minute shortfall.
How satisfied were you with his performance?
It's a shame, because he could have repeated the podium.
He was running the first second time.
But Mira also confirmed that we had set up the car well.
He was going very fast.
Exactly one year ago, you announced the end of your career, yet you appeared at the start of the Barum rally.
Can you feel good about the ride again make a regular rallying competitor?
Certainly not at this point.
I said last year that Barumka was my last race and I still didn't keep it.
I decided to go it again.
It was my 19th start here, and if there's a chance again in a year, I think I'll go for it.
But I don't think about anything else.
A lot of people came to the track just for you.
Did it please you?
To a certain extent, we started just because of them.
A lot of people, acquaintances or acquaintances, kept asking if I was going to go.
I wanted to make them happy.
What's next for you after Barumc?
The team continues on.
Next week we will go to Vyškov, where Robert Adolf will race.
I hope he didn't do much damage to the car here.
In addition, he wants to borrow the Fabia of Honza Sýkora from us for this race.
With Mira we have a European double race in Switzerland and Corsica.
To do that, we'll have to do things for next year.
Can you give a hint?
No, nothing's decided.
When the Rally Rally belonged to the World Championships, you were fifth in the series to reach your best in the series.
Aren't you attraed to try out the tracks there again?
Not covorn't.
Oral deal with the employer can be a problem
Unfortunately, you did not have a certificate of incapacity for work issued by the doctor, which serves as evidence for the organisation that you cannot perform work duties for health reasons.
Moreover, you did not immediately notify the absence of the employer.
Subsequently, there was an agreement to register the days as a holiday, but the agreement was only orally.
Although the Labour Code does not require it to have the employer's consent to take leave in writing, in practice this procedure has worked well.
If there is only an oral agreement, you do not have confirmation of the agreement.
Later, the alleged consent to taking leave, as in your case, can be denied and absent from the job as a long-term inacisal absence, therefore a reason for the immediate termination of employment under Section 53 of the Labour Code.
In the event of a lawsuit over an appointment with your employer, you lack demonstrable evidence.
However, the employment relationship with you has not been cancelled under Section 53, only the days are given in the credit note as an unexcused absence.
The unexcused absence in the credit note does not have the same consequences as Section 53 (e.g. the impossibility of receiving material unemployment security), yet the possibility of seeking a new job is made more difficult.
We recommend you to see your doctor again and have you confirmed in writing that there was indeed an accident that left you unable to work (this is not a so-called "disability" documenting.
When looking for a new job, you can present the document and explain the situation.
In practice, it is advisable not to underestimate both the issue of a written medical certificate of incapacity for work and an early notification to the employer or to request written consent to take leave.
You avoid any complications.
Accident by Tony Stewart on his return to the track
The return to the track ended for Tony Stewart just a short distance behind the half of the Atlanta Motor Speedway race.
Stewart hit the fitting for the second time after his right front tire blew up in the 172nd lap, and the race was over for him.
Stewart drove the wrecked car to the garage, did not comment to reporters, and left.
His team's chief, Chad Johnston, said the No. 14 car team was disappointed, but he would now concentrate on the race at Richmond, Virginia, which will take place next weekend.
"I'd like us to have a better performance and a better finish," Johnston said.
We'll go to Richmond and hope we do better there.
Stewart crashed into the fitting for the first time in Sunday night's race after a collision with Kyle Bushch, which required the right side of his car to be repaired.
"We had hopes of a good ending in today's race," Johnston said, adding, "It just didn't work out."
Not long after the second crash, Stewart's car was loaded and the team packed and ready to leave.
After his car hit and killed another driver at a race in New York, Stewart missed three NASCAR Sprint Cup races.
He decided to return this weekend and needed to win either the Atlanta race or the next race in Richmond to catch up with the spot in the standings.
He returned to racing during an investigation into a tragic accident in which the death of the death of 20-year-old Kevin Ward Jr., who drove Stewart into his path during the race.
Authorities said the investigation into the cause of the accident would take at least another two weeks.
It has not yet been decided whether Stewart will face any charges.
The three-time champion received warm encouragement before the race.
Stewart started in 12th place, worked his way up to 10th at the start of the race and then even on the 4th.
Then, at the start of the 122nd Round, with Busch's No.
The 18, got out of control, came out of the second corner and crashed into Stewartov, sending both cars to the fitting.
Stewart continued, but withdrew to 21st.
Prague has selected new taxi-searchers, earns 12.3 million
Prague has completed tenders for new taxi service station managers.
It will receive around CZK 12.3 million annually for 103 parking spaces.
Until recently, it collected CZK 150,000 annually for the same driver's seats for the drivers of the taxi.
This was reported by Councillor Lukáš Manhart (TOP 09).
Previously, the city used a draw to select administrators.
The winner then received a lease for a flat-rate amount of CZK 1,000 per year.
But the rules have changed.
The amount of the offer currently decides.
"The year since the termination of the original lease agreements and the initiation of tenders, the new rental system has been shown to be far more advantageous for Prague and, overall, fairer," the councillor says.
The most expensive spot is Na Perštýně
The highest price was offered by those interested in the post in Na Perštýně street.
They pay CZK 2.1 million annually.
Approximately CZK 1.5 million were paid by the new administrators for the seats in front of the Municipal House or on Wenceslas Square.
The new rules for leases of taxis were adopted by councillors in the autumn of 2012 and were terminated in the summer of last year by the original lease agreements.
The selection procedures were held in four waves and the new administrator found 29 stations.
For the second time this year, we had to clean the well.
We released it all each time, creating a virtually second pond around the hut.
Then we poured the Savo in.
Unbelievable smell!
Our well in the cellar always gave plenty of beautiful fragrant water.
And she wasn't very expertly done, Grandpa had her self-help.
Long ago.
She was just three scruit and generally quirking, as was everything in the cottage, but as I say.
The water was great.
Until this year.
When we started the season, of course we exhausted the water.
When she stood there for a number of months, she deserved it.
But even then, it seemed to us that the water didn't smell.
We wondered if something had fallen in.
At the point where the pump passed, it was possible at a little bad luck, there was quite a no-gateboard, so the hole was sopen with a piece of brick.
Our inspection confirmed that the brick was moving.
Otherwise, you couldn't see anything in the water, and we shone through it to the bottom.
So we released it again and cleaned it.
Of course, we improved the improvised seal around the pump pipe.
In the basement we noticed but strange things.
There was a sticky package on the ground with some cubes.
At least that's what it looked like.
And a little further on.
Now it looked like a dreed mice.
At the ceiling, where there are venues, Grandpa's invention, there were the remains of the fish!
And hard to ride!
Our cellar is quunch, too.
Some would say Grandpa just digging the cottage.
And he would not be so far off the mark.
The wall and floor are only packed with sand, only the ceiling is underlad.
It's mainly the boats.
And wheels.
And deck chairs for the beach.
The gates with wide gaps were mostly open, as someone went all the way.
At the ceiling, several of the aforementioned vents.
No net, so birds are usually doused in there and nests are being built on their beams.
It is pointless to mention mice.
Grandpa wanted it to be fraated, and it did.
Now, of course, the luft didn't help.
The whole cellar smelled of stinking.
So we cleaned the whole cellar.
Especially the rag on the beam was nourishing!
We threw out the things that were around: boards, heckle, and so on.
Our cottage at a distance greeted passers-by with a disinfectant odor.
We were wondering who could have pulled the disgusting remnants out there?
The nearest cat lives two kilometres from here in the village.
She'd have a hard part to come to us to snail.
Grandpa was attacked by a neighbor who's not quite right.
Did he, the Franta, get us the nastiness in the vent?
He's here practically all year round, stupid ideas, he's the one.
We decided to keep an eye on the cellar and the well and check it regularly.
After a few days, everything was fine.
We started using the water again, so far just for washing and washing before the tests are ready, but it was good.
Tilling water from the forest well is nothing I've wanted to do for a while.
We once heard the terrible anxious barking of our bitch.
Mom looked out of the balcony and saw a long, thick black hose in the grass next to the porch.
Réza was bouncing over her and stinging as a fool.
Her mom scolded her because she thought Réza had dug out the waste hose from the sink.
Suddenly, however, the hose was partially zald and partially straightened up.
The balcony was hissed.
Réza had a hysterical fit.
We ran downstairs.
The snake, well over a metre long and as thick as a bull, was about to swallow a huge toad, and Réza prevented her.
It wasn't clear if she wanted to save the toad or if she wanted to eat it herself, but that was irrelevant.
When the snake saw the outnumber in the form of our entire family, she probably told herself to eat it when we were so hungry, and she stretched gracefully through the vent to the basement.
We flew after her.
Like a lightning bolt jumped behind the well.
By the way, we've recorded another stinking package on her record.
The smell probably fish.
The day before yesterday, she wasn't there!
Our new security around the pump was a bit of a scum.
And we locks the cellar during the day.
That he would...
We went out and there we each went to one of the vents.
We didn't wait long.
It rued it behind the well.
First there was a flat head with yellow moons on his neck.
Then the whole snakes up the well.
It wrapped around the pump and began to break in.
The fired-and-tuned employee took revenge, bought laptops for the company and sold them
The jilted employee, after being laid, purchased computers from the company and then sold them.
He managed to spend the money raised before being detained by the police.
In a short time, the man had purchased a total of sixteen computers for more than two hundred thousand crowns in twelve cases.
"He took the nulcos to Olomouc after the takeover, where he sold them around the bazaars," said the Chief Commissioner of the Shumper Police, Rostislav Brückner.
The motive for the fraud was revenge against the employer for dismissal, as well as the profit of the money.
"In the interrogation, he told us that he had used the money to repay the loans," Brückner said.
Police also found that the impostor was a pathological gambler who had been repeatedly treated in a psychiatric hospital.
The money could also end up in slot machines or video lottery terminals.
"The fact is, we didn't find any money with him," the commissioner said.
The fraudulent, who has already been convicted of theft once, now faces a prison term of one to five years.
Officers have yet to say whether the bazaars, which the under-priced laptops also face punishment and continued to sell them.
"It is true that they were taking over brand new goods, which is at least suspicious," the Commissioner stated.
However, none of the bazaar owners have yet been charged.
Come, a little more, you'll do it or how I enjoyed We Run Prague
This year, the organizers have prepared some changes for us.
The biggest one was the change of route, which brought the destination to the float, rather than leading back to the Yellow Spa.
I was looking forward to the race with the rest of the Rungo.cz team, but I was going to live it a bit from the other side.
The whole team and I decided to personally greet our readers at the booth, where we took pictures and made videos together.
To perfect my view from the other side, I accepted the role of the personal conductor.
Together with our friend Katya, we obediently joined the end of the corridor for 60 to 70 minutes just before the start.
We greeted our friends, who were passing past us to the sector for faster runners.
There wasn't much time left.
A few jumpers to warm up, turn on the sports testers, countdown and start!
Screams of cheers, but instead of a quick start, the scurrying to the starting line followed.
After five minutes we come to the gate, turn on the measurements and we start at a rate of ten.
Weave with a yellow snake of runners who, like Katya, run their first race.
So far, everyone looks fresh, with the slowly descending sun in the sky giving the view of Vyšehrad almost kitsch with a kitsch.
The dinging of the mass stretching along the embankment looks as if the whole of Prague was running here.
On the embankment between Vyšehrad and the National Theatre, it is traditionally beginning to show who has how much strength.
A light hill in Palacký Square forces many runners to slow down or go to walk.
Just before the run-in to the Theatre I see a police escort and right behind him Vítek Pavlišta flies to the finish line.
I hear the admiring fuffled sigh of other runners.
I move to the edge of the track, encourage him, he prepares to slap me, but just before that my leg gets under the arc and our hands are just down.
With the Story of the Theatre Street, it gives a chance for a short rest and bale.
It is needed, there are places ahead of us where the views will take my breath away.
The turn on the Mánes Bridge shows Prague in the whole beauty of the setting sun.
I'm not in the breeen, and my legs are almost alone.
Behind the first refreshment is a moment of truth.
As the road runs, Katya stummates against the curb and shows a leap in a blond.
I'm looking to see if he needs help, and I'm running a series of encouraging words to keep her time to think about the pain.
It lifts up and we continue with Goat's Lane, it's one of the narrowest places of the track, there is no such rush at this stage of the race, but it is still necessary to keep a good eye on the surroundings.
I have no idea yet that the term of the narrowest place will gain its true meaning later.
Beyond the Powder Gate, we are frenetically encouraged by the tourists and friends of the other runners.
I try to applaud with anyone who offers a hand, and I also advise Kat, because ten cudsle with the fans is like half an energy bar.
It really works, we are speeding up again and although we have fallen quite significantly, now the pursuit has started.
We're getting dozens of runners passed by passing someone particularly tired, trying to cheer him up with a few words, "Come on, a little more, you'll make it!"
After the last refreshment room, no one is overt running, we are speeding up.
So far we've run for an hour and a quarter, we're adding, there's nothing to wait for.
Three kilometres to the finish will hurt, but you need to really do it.
The sun has already set itss on, and the end of the day is symbolically shutting down the race.
The last run to the bridge, the turn and just the straight to the finish.
The pace we're running at amazes me, where does that girl get it?
"Come on, we're going under the hour for thirteen, working!" I call.
We're trying, we're sprinting, and there's a goal.
An hour of 13 and six seconds.
Well, what can you do?
The coach entered the limit for an hour of twenty.
So seven minutes under the plan.
Which is a great result.
Just behind the goal, Kat's legs are buckled, helping her to the railing where she's resting for a while.
You can see exhaustion, but also the luck of a well-done performance.
After a while, I slowly divert her out of the target's space.
The euphoria doesn't give us thinking of the crush in the passageways to the dressing rooms.
You can see here that Goat's aisle was not the narrowest point.
This is the float behind the goal, which is packed to the brim of the rush under the onslaught of almost ten thousand runners.
If someone doesn't like crowds, it's not a place for him.
I, too, are losing my head after a while, wondering if the gorgeous views and the more interesting route compared to previous years, the more interesting route was worth what was happening at the finish line.
I know from my own experience that hosting a race is no fun.
If it is added to this by ten thousand people, a rich accompanying programme and the closure of the entire centre of Prague for all transport, there is a huge challenge.
This year's route change showed runners many interesting places, but it also brought some really unpleasant surprises.
The excellent atmosphere pumped up in the Yellow Spa was transferred to the runners and in the race itself.
The organizers around the track and the random spectators stepped up it on every metro of the track.
Unfortunately, during the city's run through the historic centre, obstacles that cannot be removed must be reckoned with, but I do not consider the target of the mass race at the place, which is enclosed on one side by a wall and on the other by the river.
If I tell myself that the race ended with a run-in, I rate it as very good.
Behind the goal I was a little worried about the health of those involved, but in the end everything turned out well.
Write to us in the discussion if you liked the route and what do you say about the situation at the finish.
Prison guards in Bulgaria to organise protests
Hundreds of prison staff across Bulgaria participated in a national protest rally in the Ministry of Justice in the capital Sofia.
At a peaceful demonstration, they reiterated their demand for the reintroduction of the original working conditions, which have changed recently.
The list of requirements to be discussed with the interim Justice Minister Hristo Ivanov also includes higher salaries.
The guards symbolically protested against the new working hours for a month, demanding a return to the original 24-hour shifts.
Although the union of the prison guards and representatives of the Ministry of Justice met, they did not agree, the Bulgarian State Radio (BNR) reported.
"Negotiations are still ongoing," said the head of the General Directorate of Prison, Rosen Zhelyazkov, to the BNR.
Protests of prison staff are also expected to be joined by members of the Federation of Employees' Trade Unions at the Ministry of the Interior.
Why the universe can be of more size and we can't see them
Physicists don't usually write bestsellers, but Brian Green of Columbia University made a hit on the hit in 1999.
His book, Elegant Universe, became the most intransigent way for laymen to penetrate the thicket of problems that a number of theoretical physicists today deal with - to unify two superbly functioning but mutually incompatible discoveries of the 20th century: quantum theory and the theory of general relativity.
One of the causes of the success of the Elegant Universe is undoubtedly that the search for a unified physical theory is not a boring story.
Physicists have been solved by the basic problem between two key theories (after all, our universe is de facto divided into two worlds with different laws) has been addressed and solved so imaginative that it is worth retelling to the laymen as well.
Moreover, Greene dealt with the complex material so fresh and engaging that it is impossible to blame him for not being blamed for how many interesting things he did not include in his book.
In addition, he made up for the most part of his "flaw" in two more books: the Structure of the Universe and Hidden Reality.
Apparently, even the author would not object to his book becoming more outdated, but the fact is that, even after 15 years, the Elegant Universe still provides almost everything essential that an informed layman with the ambition to understand the world should know about this important part of theoretical physics.
It is quite likely that in the coming years it will be a bit more vivid in this area after all (perhaps because the LHC accelerator will finally go for "full gas"), and so it is a good time to enter the Green of the non-violently open door of the world of modern physics.
How many dimensions can our universe have?
The idea that our universe may have more than three spatial dimensions may sound foolish, fantastic, strangely or mystical.
Yet it is concrete and completely acceptable.
To understand this, let us for a moment turn our gaze from the universe as a whole to something of a more mundane, specifically to a long and thin, watering hose.
Imagine how to pull a 100-meter garden hose to the other from one side of the canyon and watch the entire scenery from a half-kilometre distance (as in the picture and on the following page).
From such a distance you can easily see a long hose stretched in the horizontal direction, but if you are not suffering from the bracrack, you can hardly tell the thickness of the hose.
Given its great distance from the hose, you'd think that an ant forced to live on a hose has only one dimension to walk in: a left-right dimension along the hose.
When someone asks you where the ant was at the moment, you answer with just one particular indication: the distance of an anth of the anth from the left (or right) end of the hose.
All we want to say is that from a half-kilometer distance, a long piece of hose looks like a one-dimensional object.
In the real world, the hose has a thickness.
If we enlarge everything, we suddenly see a second dimension - in the shape of a circle, a flaring hose.
In such an enlarged view, it is clear that the ant can actually move in two independent dimensions: in a well-known left-right dimension along the length of the hose, but also in "direit in/agro-point of direction of clockwise" of the clockwork, i.e. around the circular cut of the hose.
You begin to understand that you must enter two numbers to determine the position of the small anater: how far from the end of the hose and where there is a frinking hose on the circle.
This reflects the fact that the surface of the hose is two-dimensional (recognized. Experts will notice that this chapter concentrates purely on the disorder theory of strings.
Non-re-splical aspects are discussed in the 12th and 13th chapters.
The hose's surface is two-dimensional: one longitudinal dimension is shown by a straight arrow, the dimension in the direction of the circumference, marked with a circular arrow, is short and sround.
Nevertheless, there is a clear difference between the two dimensions.
The dimension along the hose is long and easy to see.
The dimension-enwing circuit of the hose is short, "wracking" and less noticeable.
To be aware of the existence of a circular dimension, we had to examine the hose with a significantly better resolution.
The example in question illustrates an important property of spatial dimensions.
That they split into two groups.
They can be either large, vast and therefore directly visible, or, conversely, small, upstery and much harder to observe.
Of course, in that case, we didn't exactly pretend to reveal the "wine" dimension of the hose's fitting thickness.
All you had to do was take the binoculars to help.
But if the hose were thinner - like a hair or a capillar - we would only have uncovered the swu dimensional dimension with great effort.
Kaluza sent his article to Einstein in 1919, in which he pled out with the astonishing thought that the spatial geometry of the universe might have more than three of us known for our dimensions.
Kaluza justified his radical assertions on the grounds that the additional dimension provided an elegant and convincing framework in which Einstein's general relativity and Maxwell's electromagnetic theory could be woven into a single, unified conceptual structure.
Immediately asked how this observation of Kaluzus goes together with the obvious fact that we see just three dimensions of the space.
The answer that Kaluza quietly assumed between the lines and was clearly voiced and clarified by the Swedish mathematician Oskar Klein in 1926 stands and falls, claiming that the spatial geometry of our universe could have both large and coiled dimensions.
This means that, as with the dimensions in the direction of the length of the hose, our universe has a large, vast and slightly visible three dimensions, the existence of which we are aware of at any moment.
But by analogy with the circular perimeter of the garden hose, the universe can have additional dimensions, tightly churched into a space so tiny that it has so far remained hidden from our most sophisticated experimental apparatuses.
To get a clearer picture of the nature of Kaluzus's remarkable proposal, let's stick with the hose for a while.
Imagine, on the circumference of the hose, we draw a fairly dense series of circles in black paint.
A hose still looks like a thin, one-dimensional line.
With the telescope, the drawing now makes it even easier to reveal the swapped dimension, as we will see the theme from Figure 2.
We can clearly see that the surface of the hose is two-dimensional, with one dimension large and almost unlimited and with the other short and circular.
Kaluza and Klein came up with the idea that our universe has a similar structure, but apart from one small circular dimension, it has three large spatial dimensions, a combined four-space dimension.
It is difficult to draw an object with too many dimensions.
To help our imagination a little, let's note the illustration on the giant.3; it shows two large dimensions and one small circular dimension.
In the picture, we magnify the view of the geometry of the space in the same way that we enlarged the surface of the hose.
Each subsequent level represents a huge increase in the geometry of space from the level of the previous one.
Our universe may have additional dimensions (we see them at the fourth level of magnification) if they are swapped into a small enough space; we explain that we have not yet observed them directly.
The square network depicts the commonly known "large" dimensions, while the circles are a new, tiny and swathing dimension.
Just like loops of threads in a densely woven carpet, these circles exist in every place of the usual size - we just drew them to the interseas in the square network for the sake of clarity.
The background of Figure 4 shows the commonly known space structure - the ordinary world around us - in such common scales as the meters, the viewed side of a small square in the square network.
On each of the following, we focus on the small area of the previous image; we magnify it to become visible.
At first, nothing special is happening, as we see at the first levels of enlargement.
However, as we advance on our journey to the microscopic properties of the geometry of space further - to the fourth level of magnification in Figure 3 - we suddenly see a new, in the shape of a circle of a rolling dimens, similar to the loops of the thread in a densely woven piece of the carpet.
Kaluza and Klein came up with the idea that the additional circular dimension exists in each place in the direction of the large dimensions, in the same way that the hose has a circular circumference at each point of its length.
For the sake of clarity, we drew the circular dimension only in some of the points regularly placed.
Figure 4 Kaluza and Klein's idea of the microscopic structure of the space's geometry is summarized.
The similarity with the hose is obvious, although we also see important differences.
First, the universe has three large, far-reveated spanial dimensions (from which we drew only two), whereas the hose has only one large dimension.
The more important difference is that we are now talking about the spatial geometry of the universe itself, not just an object within the universe, like our hose.
But the basic idea is the same.
If the additional circular coil dimension is extremely miniature, recognizing it is much harder - like the circular circuit of the hose - to be seen much harder than to observe the obvious, large and vast dimensions.
If the size of the additional dimension is small enough, it will actually be beyond the strength of our state-of-the-art enhaning tools.
But the most important thing is that the additional dimension is not merely a pair of bumpes within normal dimensions, as the two-dimensional illustration mistakenly suggests.
The circular dimension is a new dimension that exists at each point of three common large dimensions.
It is a dimension on the other three dimensions independent as the dimensions of the top-downs, from the left-right and from the front-addad of independent (and perpendicular) to each other.
A rather small aite could move in all four dimensions, and we would need four data to determine its position, in addition to the usual three position in the circular dimension; if you count the time, the data five, in any case one more than we would normally expect.

You can buy the book of Brian Greeen's Elegant Universe here at the book.idnes.cz.
The price for the e-book is 149,- CZK.
To our surprise, then, we find that, while we are aware of the existence of only three dimensions of the space, Kaluza's and Klein's thinking shows that this is not precluded of the existence of additional coil proportions if they are small enough.
The universe may well have more dimensions than we can see with the naked eye.
How small should they be?
State-of-the-art technical equipment can recognize the structures of the big billionth of a billionth of the meter.
We can barely observe the smaller-fed dimensions.
In 1926, Klein combined Kaluza's original idea with several ideas from the now-fledging quantum mechanics.
His calculations indicated that the additional circular dimension could be in the size of about one of the Planck lengths, a size far beyond the distinctive capability of today's devices.
Since then, physicists have called the possibility of additional small spatial dimensions Kaluza-Klein's theory.
Wohnout Honza Homola advises on how to practice on electric guitar: episode 5
The whole essence of "twelve" lies in a 12-act harmonic form, which you can repeat at will.
Whoever fumbles in music theory will find its principle detailed here.
Jan Homola, or Honza Homolka Tobolka (1976)
By educating the puppeteer and puppeteer, whose Facebook profile can be traced here, has made his living as a graphic artist since graduation twenty years ago.
He is the guitarist of the band Wohnout, which is reportedly impossible to leave.
The guitarist is the father, as is Brother Matej, the leader of the Wohnouts.
Start coaching on one string.
"The Rytmic model is up to you, you can invent anything, you can then apply it to a harmonic 12 model," says Honza.
If you add another string, you can change the figure again.
Just listen to Honza, watch what you can think of with the twelve-clutch harmony on two strings and how pretty it's starting to sound.
If you bring the third string, you can already flirt with the melody of a song.
When you finally add a fourth, beware of the change in the tuning, Honza points out in the video.
Next time, Honza will return to the pentatonice and try to put it together with the 12th.
So practice it honestly.
As best as you can read in an interview with Jan Homola at the first lesson of his school's play on the electric guitar here.
Another goal without waiting?
It's not at the big celebration, acknowledges Hradec Dvořák
We take the point and we are happy for it.
We had more chances for the first half, the second home side," said the striker, who scored from the penalty spot this time.
Weren't you nervous about playing him, was he accompanied by a huge whistle?
I didn't particularly notice it, although it would have been worse for the second goal, where the home fans are.
You equalised with the penalty after half an hour, but you also scored from the penalty spot after less than four minutes.
What happened?
We overslew the start, we were passive, it came out of the corner and then a penalty after that.
After that, you got up and the first half you were the better team with more chances.
Why did that change after the break?
It's hard to say.
I agree that we played well after the goal scored a goal well.
We said in the booth that we wanted to keep the pace of the game after that, but we couldn't do it.
To tell you the truth, I can't even explain why.
But it's probably also true that the home side said something about their game at the break, they probably weren't very happy with it.
You only scored on the pitch for the first time on the pitch, whereas at home you might not have scored a goal.
Why is it so different?
I wouldn't say it makes that much difference, it's up to us to fight it.
We got off to a good start in Brno, but then it was bad for us, Plzeň, that's a different category.
Four games you waited for a goal, weren't you worried that it might be similar after the last game?
Not even that, but of course we are glad that since last week's game we do not have to listen to talk about waiting for a goal.
Now we've added more without waiting, but there's still only three in six games, which is not yet the big celebration.
Iceland - the lava flows from a kilometer away crater.
Lava flying to the surface in the Holuhraun area near the Vatnajökull glacier, flows in an underground tunnel from a kilometer away crater.
It is located under the glacier, as is part of the aforementioned underground lava tunnel.
This fact now worries scientists the most...
The situation remains unchanged for the time being.
Since yesterday morning (318.
2014) still flares about the same amount of lava from the fissure.
However, the amount of it is lower than the original estimates, not 1000 m3, but "only" 300-400 m3.
Compared to the previous eruption of 29.8.
2014 is up to 50 times larger.
However, scientists fear that the lava tunnel could also be opened in places where it is under the ice.
If this were to happen, with a similar intensity to the current eruption, it would mean huge flooding, both on the Jökulsá river á Fjöllum and other rivers.
There is a strong smell of sulphur in the vicinity of the eruption, clouds of steam and gases rise from the crack.
It is certainly not an eruption suitable for tourism, as was the case with the Fimmvörðuháls eruption in 2010.
This is much bigger and there are also many more gases," says volcanologist Ármann Höskuldsson.
However, the weather has improved considerably since yesterday, with almost no wind in the area in the morning.
The traces of the sandstorm were washed with rain.
Scientists can continue their work.
For air traffic, the orange stage (second highest) for Bárðarbungu and the yellow (third) for Askja.
The sky above Cheb was the bold Lady Peggy.
She walked the flanks
Aerial Day in Cheb.
The Boeing Stearman PT-17 machine was introduced to the aircraft acrobatka Peggy Walentin, who climbed out of the cockpit to the trapeze on the upper wing of the biplane on the upper wing of the biplane, as well as between the wings.
There it is confined to the strength of the muscles.
The air day in Cheb was held for the fifth time this year and the organizers again managed to prepare some interesting aerial bits.
The premiere at the oldest Czech airport was not only "walked on the wings" by the German acrobat Peggy Walentin, but also the legendary P-51 D Mustang fighter or the Beechcraft 18.
He drew attention to himself with his brilliant cuff.
The acrobatics called Wingwalking originated in the US.
After World War I, many former war pilots tried to get ahead.
But because of the large number of fatalities, it was forbidden.
Today, however, he is slowly returning to the air days program.
Peggy climbs out of the cockpit to the top wing after takeoff.
There he performs various exercises.
Towards the end of the performance, it will move to the space between the wings of the aircraft, where her show continues," described Luděk Matějíček from the Cheb Ultralight Club and the organizer of the air day.
The pilot of the Boeing Stearman 75 E is her husband Friedrich.
If Peggy's performance was the main highlight of the program, then the next performance of the Mustang fighter was the famous icing on the cake.
The legendary fighter rushed to the field with the Grippen of the Army of the Czech Republic in tow (so-called numbers).
Such a line-up could be seen by aviation fans in the Czech Republic for the first time.
Pilot Miroslav Sázavský then demonstrated to everyone breathtaking acrobatics with a 1945 aircraft.
It was made during the war, but he probably never participated in it.
It was listed in the army reserves.
He has been active in the civilian sphere since 1963.
Even as a racing aircraft.
Today he has his home hangar at the airport in Munich Hradiste.
There is also another pearl of Cheb air day, the twin-enclock Beechcraft C45H Expeditor.
At the airport, the massive machine was not overlooked.
His polished aluminum cover glowed in the distance.
The Max Holste MH MH 1521M Broussard in the colours of the French Air Force also gained an aestage.
The small airliner was taken aback by the rendeceurned Turbolet and brought part of the German delegation from Hof, Germany, for the air day.
German neighbors performed in Cheb with the renovated aircraft of the Yak, as of the as 18T or the three-man formation of biplane biplane Bücker Jungmann.
Lucie Borhy: Dramatic return to the camera!
The parents' worries were traded by Lucie Borhy at least for the work-related ones tonight.
Stress or nervousness - the blonde presenter evidently doesn't know any of this.
The TV news hosting was going well for her, as if she hadn't stopped with him for two months!
It's only been two weeks since the blonde ended up being a six-year-old in which women experience the most stress after childbirth.
Lucie, however, will not be shown regularly in the main news bulletin of TV Nova.
She will not be a regular return for a month, according to news server Blesk.cz.
After all, her daughter Linda now needs her more than the TV audience.
Lucie Borhy returned to the TV screen and it was a hit.
Exhibition for a year in Prague?
The hall would sell out, plans Jagr's borfight
It would be dignified if something like this was done during the World Cup.
But it depends on how the union comes to it," he said in Jihlava after an exhibition called the Golden Game, in which the breathtaking Nagano team reunited.
Even the players who participated in the golden hat-trick.
Players would be hungry, wouldn't they?
For sure.
It would simply be a good idea to do a Golden generation farewell during the championship.
I think you can find one or two days during the tournament when it's a full day off and where you can mingle such a match.
We will tell Gum (Jiru Šlégr) or to Béďa Ščerbane (ask of the Jihlava match) who would take charge of it...
The Arena would sell out.
But what if you play New Jersey playoffs?
Well, if I come in...
You don't want to play in the national team.
Or did the Jihlava meeting alter your decision?
Representation and exhibition matches are two different things and performances are crucial in the national team.
It's one thing to like to see me there, but the performances are crucial, especially at the World Cup.
There should be players who are up for it, and not because they have a good name.
My decision has not changed.
How did you enjoy the Nagano reunion, anyway?
Just meeting the players was great.
You've brought up stories and have had a lot of fun.
It was a great experience not only for the fans, but also for us hockey players.
Most importantly, however, was the tribute to Ivan Hlinka.
And it's good to be reminded of the history of our hockey and that one generation is leaving that was really worth it.
Slavomír Lener, Vladimír Růžička and Petr Čechmánek on the bench.
Do you still remember your first representative match?
You don't forget things like that.
It was against the Calgary Flames and three young: me, Robert Holík and Robert Reichel, came on in one three.
It was the first representative start for everyone.
But that we would have dominated in some way, that's impossible to say.
In Jihlava for the first time in a long time he was catching Dominik Hašek.
What did you say about his performance?
Hashan will never surprise me on the ice.
I wanted to give it back to him with the criticism, but I can't (Hasek criticized Jagr for the reasons why he decided to quit the national team).He just caught it very well.
Even Hnilička was a great show.
You were trained with me one night, and there was a jervicle.
And now he was catching famously.
First the USA and then the Netherlands, the Socceroos start qualifying
The Smichov NH Hotel was joined by prominent guests on Monday morning.
People could see, for example, goalkeeper Petr Čech from Chelsea, the national coach Pavel Vrba...
And there, the figure in the black baseball cap, that's Tomas Rosicky!
The Arsenal midfielder and captain of the national team arrived at the meeting around 11:30 p.m.
We have a wonderful match against the Netherlands.
Who wouldn't be happy?" he said, when he had already appeared before the press in the representative set.
Programme of the Czech national team
Monday, September 1: start of the reunion, first training session
Tuesday, September 2: Training open to fans (18:30, Letná) Autogramiade (20:00 a.m.)
Wednesday, September 3 Czech Republic - USA (20:15, Letná)
Tuesday 9th September Czech Republic - Netherlands (20:45, Letná) end of reunion
Rosicky and Co. can be supported by fans before Wednesday's match against the USA (20:15).
The representation opened for them for them on Tuesday's training, which starts at Letná at 6:30 p.m.
And it will be followed by an autograph session, which will not be missed by Rosický or Čech.
Otherwise, of course, this national team reunion will be quieter.
Which is praised by coach Vrba, who just complained about the number of social events in the spring.
Finally, we will address what we want to do.
Now we're going to focus on the Netherlands.
It's an advantage when you have a player together for eight days.
We'll have time to rehearse things that there hasn't been so much time for," said Vrba, who has officially led the national team since January.
The Czech national football team will be accompanied by a Musketeer image when entering the new qualifying cycle.
The team has had three matches under Willing, all the preliminary.
With Norway and Finland, they drew 2-2 and lost 1-2 to Austria.
However, these results were not yet important.
That's now.
In fact, the match against the Netherlands will kick off qualification for the 2016 European Championship.
It would of course help the Czech team to handle the dress rehearsal against the US.
The first six months were to get to know each other.
Now the results are important.
We have to think about being successful,' agreed Willow.
The only player in the 23-man nomination to have health problems is forward David Lafata.
He's worried about the temperature.
If he failed to recover until Wednesday's match against the U.S., coach Vrba would call up one more striker.
Genetic disorders are often poorly diagnosed
A woman from Britain describes how, after a bad diagnosis, she thought she would die for many years.
After being diagnosed with another disease, Karin Rodgers spent most of her adolescence thinking she only had a few years to live.
In fact, it was Charcot-Marie-Tooth Syndrome (CMT) - a group of hereditary disorders that damage the nerves outside the brain and spine.
CMT UK, the charity, said that a bad diagnosis is a common problem among people with CMTs, because very little is known about the disease.
Around 23,000 people in the UK are considered to be suffering from CMT, which may show symptoms in motor racing such as muscle weakness, clumsy walking and twisted toes.
The sufferers may also experience insensitivity or pain, a condition that is untreatable and progressive, which means that the symptoms are getting worse over time.
When Rodgers was thirteen, she thought she was suffering from Freidreich's ataxia (FA) - a condition that had a very poor prognosis.
She believed that by the time she celebrated her eighteenth birthday, she would be confined to a wheelchair, and dead before she was thirty.
The mother-of-two, who is now 51, says, "As a child, I knew I couldn't do the same things as the others.
I fell off every day and it took me longer.
I could never go roller-skating or skateboarding with the other kids, and I was bullied at school for the way I used to walk and run."
When Rodgers was thirteen and, after several surgeries to release her Achilles' tendons and straighten her feet, she took advantage of her doctor leaving the room and consulted her documentation, where she learned that she was suffering from the FA.
"I felt guilty because I was snooping, so I didn't tell anyone, but when I got home, I looked up information about the disease in the library and wrote to the FA Association," she says.
When they answered me, I was in shock, completely panicked.
I thought I'd end up in a wheelchair by the time I was 18, and by the time I was twenty-five, I'd be dead, and in the meantime, I'd gradually lose all my powers.
I was on my own and planned a funeral."
When she was seventeen, she realized that her gait's ability had not worsen as much as she had anticipated, and asked her surgeon.
He just got up, hugged her, and said, "Golden, I don't think you have the disease, or you'd be in a wheelchair.
I think it's something far less life-threatening."
After passing several genetic tests, it was found to have a CMT.
"When he explained to me what the CMT was, I thought I was a lucky child," she said.
The charity CMT UK launched a month of informing the CMT to highlight the disease.
Entrepreneurs in Washington: tax rises with economic turnover
The growing economy means more customers, higher sales and new jobs.
And higher taxes, too.
According to a new survey published last week, state and local corporate taxation in the country increased slightly last year, with the reschator of the economy accelerating, and companies in Washington were no exception.
Entrepreneurs in Maryland and Virginia collectively diverted $27.6 billion to the state and local coffers for the 2013 fiscal year, up 3.8% higher than the $26.6 billion raised in 2012.
The tax burden - both state and local - rose by 4.3% to $671 billion last year, compared to 3.9% last year, and was the third consecutive year in a row in 2009 and when taxes were falling.
According to a study conducted by the professional firm Ernst & Young and the political grouping Center on State Taxation, government taxes were increasing faster, by 4.3% than local levies, by 3.9%.
More than half of the district's tax revenue, 56%, is on a business tax, and 36% of Maryland's income is from the company.
Virginia, at 28%, shows proportionally the smallest tax revenue from the business.
Researchers argue that the majority share of tax revenue growth comes from an increase in the value of properties belonging to firms, which increased property taxes this year by 3.7% after three consecutive years with a rise of -1%.
Although most of the profits come from major nations like California, New York, and Texas, the situation seems to be the same in Washington.
Last year, D.C., Maryland and Vriginia paid over $10 billion in state and local property taxes, an annual increase of 4.2% compared to $9.6 billion in 2012.
However, the manifest increase in the value of real estate does not so much force the state and local tax revenue in Maryland, where the property tax represents less than a fifth of the company's taxation.
For companies in Virginia and D.C., the property tax accounts for nearly half of the state and local taxation.
"In Maryland, a lot of the companies' properties, most notably the tax base around D.C., the government, or non-profit organizations that don't pay taxes," explained Douglas Lindholm, the Center's Chief Executive Officer of the State Taxation Center.
So Maryland is forced to rely much more on income taxes, for example, to pay for the same services that are in other states.
A recent increase in business tax revenue cannot be attributed solely to the healing real estate market.
According to the data, business revenue also appears to be increasing.
Companies in the region published a corporal income tax of $2.3 billion, which increased from $2.1 billion from 2012.
Maryland withdrew $1 billion in company income taxes, the most in the region.
Although they are moving in the same direction, the local tax burden on entrepreneurs is not growing just as quickly in these three places.
The growth rate in D.C. was at the national average, at 4.3%, while Maryland's growth was significantly higher, 4.9%.
In Virginia alone, the tax increase was below average, to 4.1%.
Virginia has the lowest corporate income tax of all three districts (all of which they have the same taxation) of the lowest corporate income tax.
The rate of taxation of companies in Maryland is 8.25%, while the average of D.C. remains relatively high, at 9.975%.
A similar study conducted this year by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce showed that Virginia had lower state and local taxation and a more favourable tax climate overall than Maryland.
D.C. wasn't the study.
Despite this advantage, Virginia faces pressure from the competition from the south.
North Carolina recently signed a law lowering company tax from 6.9% to 6%, as did Virginia, and next year the tax will be reduced to 5%.
If the state continues to meet the revenue targets in the coming year, the statutory income tax rate could be reduced to 3% in 2017.
According to a recent study, retail entrepreneurs in Washington are doing better, so they pay higher state and local taxes.
The trade-folder tax paid by small business owners as a tax on personal income - the structure of the compensation for cost increases by raising prices, according to which most firms are organized - in D.C., Maryland and Virginia rose by 20% to $2.4 billion last year, much faster than other taxes.
Researchers claim that the trend and nationwide growth in business tax are likely to continue next year, with total tax revenues from sales for both state and local governments rising to 6.2% compared to the same period in the previous year's first three quarters of 2014.
But Washington may lag behind others because cuts in state spending are taking their toll on the labor market.
What you missed: Europe's head will be Tusk, Putin's Novorska and Lafat scissors
A new state will be created in Ukraine?
Putin calls for negotiations on Novorore
Russian President Vladimir Putin mentioned the possibility of creating a new state in southeastern Ukraine, where government troops have been clashing with pro-Russian rebels since April.
He also warned European firms that, following the current regime of anti-Russian sanctions, they would have a difficult return to the Russian market.
The support afforded to the West by the war of the Ukrainian army in eastern Ukraine, he said, contradicts democratic values.
The end of the conflict, he says, depends on Kiev, so he cannot say when the Ukrainian crisis will end.
More sanctions for Russia?
Czech Republic wins right to disagree with part of it
The European Commission, along with diplomats, is to propose a further toughening of anti-Russian sanctions within a week, the EU summit decided last night.
The permanent chairman of the meetings of the member countries, Herman Van Rompuy, told reporters.
According to Czech Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka, concrete proposals for a shift in the form of sanctions are to be prepared as early as Monday.
Tusk will be the new EU "President."
Van Rompuy to be replaced in December
At the European Union summit, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk was elected to head the European Council, the so-called EU president, who directs the summit meetings of the member countries.
From December, for two and a half years, Herman Van Rompuy will replace.
European diplomacy will be headed by Italian Foreign Minister Federica Mogherini.
The Italian woman, who will thus become Vice-President of the future European Commission, has yet to be confirmed by the European Parliament.
Assisted death is a reality in the Czech Republic, it is just not mentioned
Help an incurable and long-term patient with the departure of life?
In Czech conditions, where laws do not permit euthanasia, this is not legally possible.
Yet the comments made by the doctors who approached the LN show that they are hearing about such requests.
ALS: The Here's Toll of Neurology, says doctor about sclerosis
Approximately three hundred people suffer from the Czech Republic's amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), 21 patients undergo experimental stem cell treatment in Motol, Prague.
We definitely don't know if it will be successful.
But if we don't try, we won't find out," says Radim Mazanec, a Motol neurologist.
It shows the CIA's handwriting, they needed war, Huml reports of downing flight MH17
ČSSD MP Stanislav Huml is clear about who shot down the Malaysian plane over Ukraine.
According to him, it is clear that "the hilthill sanctions that were announced with regard to the downing of a civilian aircraft with nearly 300 dead were deliberately caused by the Ukrainian army."
According to the lawmaker, it's also the manuscript of the CIA.
Unfull promises.
Elections are coming up and the parties are offering the impossible again
The end of the homeless on the streets, parking for each family and the cable car above Prague.
It is repeated before every election: the parties promise the impossible.
Also, with local elections approaching, politicians are racing to see who voters will be more appealing to.
Lidovky.cz has selected the impossible promises of the present and past.
70 years ago, the Czechoslovaks landed at Dunkirk.
A fierce siege began
It was on August 30, 1944, when the Czechoslovak Independent Brigade moved to France.
Its commander, Alois Liška, has consistently requested the addition of technical equipment and dispatch to the front.
The British side eventually complied and listed this ground unit as one of its forces in the siege of the port city of Dunkirk, which remained in the power of the German troops.
SUMMARY: Plzeň leads league in front of Prague's "S", Liberec decapitated Baník
Viktoria Plzeň is the new leader of the Football League, which is one point ahead of the two Prague "S".
The changes at the top of the table were caused by the Slavia 1-2 defeat in Mladá Boleslav.
After two defeats, Sparta recovered in the domestic league, beating Jablonec thanks to two Lafat's strikes.
Liberec claimed a record win of the year, scoring 6-0 by Baník Ostrava.

Tickets were sold out in 100 minutes.
How to survive the return from vacation?
Take your honege and get to sleep
The last days of the holidays are ahead of us.
To get used to getting back from a sunny beach or cottage on a normal work-rate can be a nut to take a lot of experience.
It may even be accompanied by depression.
Fortunately, there are proven tips on how to cope with the changed situation: not to rush and indulge in quality sleep.
Joan Rivers' family: 'Feers toe-t)
Joan Rivers has been unconscious for three days, ever since she was brought to a New York City hospital, but her daughter said today that she was not losing hope of the 83-year-old comedian's recovery.
"Thank you for your greetings and support," Melissa Rivers said in a statement today.
Fingers crossed.
Her mother was brought to Mount Sinai Hospital on Thursday after a call to the emergency services, according to which she was at cardiac arrest on a Yorkwarian endoscopy at the Upper East Side, according to a source.
Doctors deliberately keep her under the influence of a sedative and under strict supervision until they are sure of her condition, which remains "serious."
The reactions were not long in coming, and that included incredible support on the Internet from personalities like Donald Trump, Montel Williams, and Kelly Ripa.
Reality is distorted subtitles
That the media distort reality with their headlines is (unfortunately) no news.
I know that the headlines "sell" newspapers, but unfortunately I also know that many are so-called "readers" who read nothing else.
And that's a fact that's been bothering me a lot lately, the word is more apt.
This applies in particular to articles on the conflict between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip.
Quite common are the headlines "Israel attacked Gaza."
Only in the text will you read that the Israeli "attack" was a response to the fired rockets from the Gaza Strip, often at the time of the declared ceasefire.
This then appears headline "Basice parties violated the truce."
Does the journalism community realise that in this process it is directly involved in the anti-Semitic attitudes that are growing across Europe (and not only there)?
Less than sixty years have passed since the end of World War II.
So far, there are survivors of the Shoo.
When I saw the videos from the Federal Republic of Germany, where the crowd shouted the slogans "Jewish swine" and similar to the freshet, I got a chills.
Does the world want to finish what Hitler failed to do?
Do our journalists realise the fact that after the Jews the Slavs were destined for the liquidation?
Ladies and gentlemen of the journalists, please take a little more care for your work.
You are often referred to as the "watchdogs of democracy."
So defend her.
While he's here.
And also defend the right of the only truly democratic state in the Middle East to protect its population.
How would you like our government to behave if one of our neighbours decides to eliminate the Czech nation and wipe the Czech Republic off the map of the world?
Perhaps you should also be aware of one more fact.
Nearly 20% of Arabs with Israeli citizenship live in the state of Israel.
And they're comfortable there.
If you ask them, why don't they go between "their," like to Gaza, by answering you, why would they do that?
In Israel, they have jobs, social security, and top-notch health care (I've seen with my own eyes how to go to the top private Hadassa Hospital, which is funded by sponsorship donations from Jews from all over the world, and are understandably treated there).
Hamas's missiles are also attacking its Arab brothers.
The only real help to Gaza, and thus of this troubled region, is to rid it of Hamas and disarm it.
And not to condemn Israel, albeit indirectly in the headlines.
Inform the practice of Hamas, its exploitation of people as human shields.
Inform that Hamas is to liquidate the state of Israel, at any cost.
Even at the cost of the death of innocent Arab children.
Notify that Hamas is on the list of world terrorist organisations.
To be informed that in nine years of self-government in Gaza, the area may have been in the throes of humanitarian aid from all over the world.
Even from Israel, which supplies water and electricity there, for which the administrators of Gaza do not pay and even fit, that the power supplies are sometimes cut off at this time.
If Hamas had not invested money in the construction of underground tunnels so that suicide attackers in the territory of Israel could infiltrate it, but perhaps in the construction of apartment buildings, hospitals, and schools, its Arab brothers from Gaza would have lived considerably better.
Amazon buys $1.04 billion for Twitch
AMAZON just confirmed the information's claim on Monday morning: An online retailer - a video producer and hundreds of other things - is buying the Twitch video streaming service for $1.04 billion.
The announcement came as a surprise, not because no one expected the Twitch to be bought, but because the buyer was expected to be YouTube.
Three months ago, Google's $1 billion Twitch sales of Twitch looked certain, and the connection looked natural.
Twitch, founded by Justin.tv just three years ago, was on the line to become a widely used video streaming service - a live version of YouTube.
Instead, it quickly became a platform for players who broadcast online game broadcasts to it - in the words of Business Insider "YouTube for live gaming."
Interapace Twitch.
The popular "Let's play" videos are already popular on YouTube, a species where the sages (mostly older) give games to Mystery Science Theater.
The fact is that YouTube comes up a lot when describing the Twitch, so the news that YouTube buys a TWitch didn't excite much, it was a textbook example of how the established company would pay off possible competition.
The challenge is why the YouTube deal didn't work out, even though the company was willing to pay the same amount as Amazon.
All we currently have at our disposal is the statement by CEO of Twitch Emmet Shear: "We chose Amazon because they believe in our company, it has the same values and a long-term vision and wants to help us deliver it more quickly."
Another mystery is - frankly - the incredible success of Twitch.
It's hard for snob. as I say they'd rather do sport than watch, it's hard to understand what's so amazing about just watching the game instead of real playing.
It's one thing to look over a friend's shoulder at 3 a.m., playing Resident Evil, and another thing is to watch a stranger get twenty hits to the head in Call of Duty.
All the games you could just watch.
Another problem is that a lot of today's most popular games are from the perspective of the player, so looking at their record without being able to control the perspective yourself is a pretty good recipe for getting a sore.
I admit that games like the speed run in which the Rogers Bannisters of our electronic time complete the game in record time is entertaining.
But if someone is not a master of playing or humor, their Twitch channel is unlikely to be very interesting.
But what do the skeptics like I know?
Twitch has 55 million visits a month and is fourth at the height of internet traffic.
How exactly will Amazon take advantage of this?
It's hard to imagine Twitch stirs into Amazon Instant Video as elegantly as it could have been swallowed up by YouTube.
But Twitch has something that every company would like to attract: hordes of young men that advertisers want.
As Twitch's director Shear, both Amazon and Twitch have said, and the media don't seem to be reluctant to viewers, not even like - swallowing - viewers.
The second basic lie of creationism.
Another Czech translation by the American atheist vlogger Arona Ra.
This time on the theme of "Horic Scriptures are God's Word."
Couchored original video.
The second basic lie of creationism is the belief that the sacred texts were written by God and not by real human authors.
When believers debate one of the many things that run counter to their religion, they often confront us with the question: Who will you believe?
The alleged word of God or the word of man?
As if human exploration were completely trivial compared to the authority they imagine to have their doctrine.
But when they say "human," they talk about science.
And when they report to "the bele of God," they report to the myths of God-enclareed people.
If there really is an intelligent one with a creator with a purpose, then he is the one who created a fossil record that reveals evolutionary history, and it must be he who invented the genetic formulas that match it, and it has to be he who has supplied the other series of evidence that points exclusively to the evolutionary conclusion to the last detail.
Why else would all these things exist?
It seems like he's trying to tell us something!
People couldn't create any of those things.
But people can tell stories, fabulously.
And it was the people who wrote all the lyrics that pretend to be the word of God.
Every supposedly holy teachings of any religion in the world describes itself as written by people, not by the gods.
People who were "habated" or "inspired" by their favorite gods, or perhaps listened to the dictates of the angels, but those texts were not written by no one but mere mortals with a certain degree of imagination, not angels, and certainly not gods.
If there really was one real god, he would be an integral part of all the gods of all religions, the über-galactic supergénius, the ultimate entity of the entire cosmos.
If a creature of this size had ever written a book, there would have been only one such book, the only script of the saint.
It would be known all over the world, without its predecessors, parallels or alternatives in any language, because mere human authors would not be able to be measured against such a piece.
And people would not have to believe it in the blind because it would be consistent, backed up by verifiable and truthful evidence, and it would reveal a deep morality and wisdom far beyond all human limits.
It would permanently inspire every reader to be unified for the common faith.
If God wrote it, we wouldn't expect anything less.
But what we see instead is the exact opposite.
Instead of the one religion leading to the final truth, we have many different religions with no common origin, and all of them are constantly disintegrating into more and more separate denominations, seeking questionable truths, and each claiming God's leadership in some way, regardless of the continuing dissipation and separation in every direction.
The Jewish Torah, the Christian Gospels, the Islamic Koran, the Bahá'ullah's Kitab-i-Akdás, Zarathhurov's Avests, the Sikhs of the Ali-Granth, the Mahabharata Bhagavad-Gita, the Book of Mormon, or the book of Urantia are all considered "absolute truth" and "the stated word of the only true god" and the relevant believers of each of them say that the others are avenge.
The only logical explanation is probably that everyone is a far-stitus to some extent.
None of the aforementioned books have any advantage over the others.
None of them have evidence support, and none can be historically confirmed.
My name is Dr. Paul Maier, and I'm a professor of ancient history at the University of West Michigan.
I'm not saying I've proven that the Bible is reliable and historical.
Of course it's not.
You must still have faith.
All of them require faith, as well as apologies (obhajoby), because they contain inconsistencies, absurdities, and primitive images once considered true that have already been overcome.
So it cannot be said that they are proof of divine wisdom.
Many of them advocate heinous atrocities instead of morality, and many of them are claimed to have been confirmed by the fulfilment of the prophecy - with the fact that each may also contain prophecies that have not been fulfilled.
Leading theologians concede that all the sacred texts of any religion were written by human hands and are therefore the subject of interpretations, impressions and perspectives of their primitive and often prejudices bound by politically motivated authors, thus explaining many of the contradictions and inconsistencies in these books, especially those in the Bible.
I wouldn't call it contradications, rather the comments made by each other.
We must once again point out that we have two different authors here whose work has somehow been mixed together during some editor's review.
He is right that Genesis has more than one author and is certainly not the narrative of an eyewitness!
Some experts now distinguish four different sources for the Pentateuch alone, i.e. the five Books of the "Meso" and do not attribute to Moses the authorship of any of them, because it almost certainly did not exist as described in the Bible.
Experts agree that Genesis was composed (probably by Ezra) from several mutually unrelated oral traditions less than 2,500 years ago.
The other documents were filtered at the same time and are all attributed to human authors.
The Bible is by no means as old as her believers think.
The Dead Sea's tops are the earliest archaeological findings of texts known for their unfinished foundation of all Western monotheistic faiths, yet many centuries younger than the roots of zoo-astrianism, Buddhism, Hinduism, Helénism, Druid cults, or Egyptian religions.
Christianity began as a Gnostic faith, followed by docic and ebionites and their very different insights into Jesus, which eventually combined in a kind of compromise called orthodoxy.
Other Christian groups as luciferians were dispersed and discredited by further revisions of the Bible.
One of these edits refers to the King of Ugarit, who ruled 3,500 years ago.
Because his followers were a major threat to the young, the authors of the New Testament decided to ridicule, and Ba'al Zebula, "The Lord on the Mountain" turned "The Lord on the Mountain" to Beelzebub.
So the Bible was deliberately and fraudulently altered for both religious and political reasons.
The remainder of what happened to the New Testament was canonized in the 4th century A.N. in a series of commissions decisions at the Nikai Convention.
The four Gospels were taken, and sixteen others were rejected by the simple-micking of the handshake, as if the fact of the matter could be accepted or rejected by the vote.
The way the canon evolved depended on what was read on Sundays in the Christian centers at the time.
What was read on the second Sunday after the Easter in the Jerusalem Church Church?
What about the Roman Church at the same time?
And gradually they discovered that they were approaching the same Gospel stories.
And so the core of the canon evolved from the outstreheuric church.
So the council simply accepted as the Gospel any relevant stories that circulated among the uneducated masses at that time.
But they had also consciously taken more than ten books from the Bible, even though they were reported by the books that had been approved.
Among the rejected items, we find the writings of both the apostles and the prophets.
Why should the word of God refer to books that are just in the words of some people and/or are no longer available?
Who was the real editor here?
The Bible often mentions human authors.
But how could it be approved in this way if God were the true author of this random sung of rumors, parables and psalm lyrics?
The Bible was certainly written by the people and certainly not by the enlightenment, rather the opposite!
That's why so much of its content is historically and scientifically completely wrong, whatever it is from start to finish.
We are talking about people who believed that snakes and donkeys could speak, believed in spells, bloody sacrifices, ritual spells, enchanted objects, fiery potions, astrology, and five elements of magic.
They thought that if they used a magic rod to spray someone with blood, it would heal them of leprosy.
We're talking about people who thought rabbits were chewing and bats were birds and whales were fish and they know it was an integer.
These people believed that if they showed pregnant cow striped patterns, they would give birth to striped calves.
How could someone who knows about genetics say that?
The authors of this book, of course, did not know this.
If the Bible had been written by a higher being, then it would not contain the mistakes it contains.
If it had come from the pen of a truly superior being and was intended as a literal history, then it would not have contained anything at all that contained.
As a moral guide, it totally fails because, most of the original Hebrew writings were written by uneducated and bigoted savages who overlooked or promoted cruelty to animals, incest, slavery, the abuse of slaves, abuse of family members, abuse of children, violence against children, abortion, looting, murder, cannibalism, genocide and prejudice against the race, the nation, religion, gender and sexual orientation.
To defend their inhumanity by claiming that they do God's will.
But the creationists still ignore all this.
Some of their website admit that if any fact is contrary to the Bible, then the fact must be ignored!
And why?
Because if the creationists didn't have their beloved books, they wouldn't have a god.
In their world, one and the other is the same.
Ironically, they reject God's "fitness" as "worshunting creation instead of a creator."
But they themselves see the word man as the word of God and God himself, and even insist that the rebuttal of their supposedly "holy" books somehow uprooted God as such.
Not their version of God but all versions of God.
Kreacionist Christians think that if the Bible is wrong, then God is lying.
They cannot accept that a god might exist and the Bible could be wrong at the same time, because they cannot separate the doctrine from the deity.
So it's a kind of idolaternity where believers worship man's manufactured compilations, as if these books were a god himself, because they think they're the word.
But the god never wrote or dictated any of the writings of any religion.
Everything that people approved or rejected into their supposedly "unwalled word" of any god was invented, assembled, grouped, translated, interpreted, edited, edited and often also intentionally altered and twisted by mere erring people.

Attacker stabbed nine people at Chinese school, three of whom died
A man named Chen, according to the New China Agency, violently entered the primary school building in the morning and attacked around 10:30 p.m. local time.
Three of the nine people he stabbed later died in hospital.
Chen eventually killed himself by a height jump, New China said, referring to the regional government.
In recent years, China has seen a series of similar attacks in schools and against children.
The public is therefore calling for more security measures and better protection for children in a country where many married couples have only one child in line with the government's policies.
Zeman showed first-time students in Lány how he had to sit at school
The smallest schoolchildren were taken by the ninth gamers to their classroom, where he and the teacher waited for the president to be joined.
He then demonstrated to the children how he had to sit alone in the school.
"We had to sit with our hands behind our backs, fortunately that no longer awaits you, you are already free people," Zeman told the children.
His wife then presented the first-graders to the first-graders as a gift.

Education Minister Marcel Chládek started the new school year at a private sports school in Litvínov.
"This year I want to connect Czech education with Czech sport more," he said, explaining one of the reasons he went to the north of Bohemia on the first day of school.
The school management approached him at a hockey match in Litvínov some time ago.
"They were the first, so I accepted the invitation to attend the start of the school year," the minister added.
Education Minister Marcel Chládek (ČSSD) started the school year at a private sports school in Litvínov.
This year's first classes were joined by 115,000 first-graders.
A total of over 850,000 children will attend primary schools and over 405,000 students will be educated in secondary schools, the Education Ministry estimates.
Nova's new art director's news director is David Fiala
The new arts director of Nova's news and journalism since 1 September has become David Fiala.
He will succeed Alan Zárubu, who led the creative department of the entire Nova Group since 1 June.
David Fiala previously worked in the graphics department of news television Z1.
For the last two years, under the leadership of Alan Záruba, he has been involved in the realization of a complete visual transformation of the news broadcasts Televizní noviny, Střepiny, Bang! and other publicist programmes by Nova.
David Fiala has a very good command of the synergy of communication between editorial, studio management and graphics department, which is the essence of the work of the art director of news.
He has a flair for typography and a clean, elegant design, which is the way we want to take further in Nova's visual coverage," says Nova's creative director, Alan Záruba.
Apple iCloud reportedly succumbed to hackers, with nude images of celebrities
Screen screenshot with a leaked file listing
Meanwhile, an anonymous user on 4chan is publishing nude and pornographic images of American celebrities, Mashable.com, the US website, has pointed out.
They were allegedly obtained by unauthorized access to user accounts on Apple's servers, where disabled users uploaded them by automatically backing them uploading images from iPhones and iPads.
Apple has not yet commented on the problem.
Part of the celebrities dismiss the images as falsified, but several of the affected authenticity of the images have already acknowledged.
They include actress Jennifer Lawrence, an acquaintance at the title role of Katniss in the film series The Hunger Games, and Mary Elizabeth Winstead, who starred in Die Hard 4.0, for example.
The aim of the hacker is to use the acquired images and videos to enrich.
American magazines reportedly showed interest in the footage, but according to reports on 4chan, the hacker wants money from the community instead.
According to The Next Web, it is very likely a weakness in the security of iCloud.
In fact, a tool appeared on the GitHub server two days ago to get passwords to user accounts through brute force, i.e. by automatically repeating attempts to log in with different passwords.
This tool has been proven to work, but Apple closed the security hole after two days.
What is certain, however, is that potential attackers had plenty of time to gain access to various accounts before the instrument was released.
As a precautionary measure, iCloud users should change their password associated with the Apple ID.
The length of the password is important, not its complexity.
The length of at least 12 characters is suitable.
The leak of nude images of celebrities to be considered a reminder of the safe use of online services.
Although the servers of companies like Apple, Google or Microsoft are secure many times better than computers in homes or smaller firms, upload of sensitive photos in an unprotected form is an unnecessary risk.
If you want to back up explicit photos or any other sensitive content online, first encrypt the files before upload.
It is also sensible to set up automatic backup of photos from the phone to take place only on wi-fi and when you connect to the charger.
This way, you'll be able to move the sensitive images "to safety" in time, and most importantly, you'll have the space to delete the missed images, so they won't take up space in the online repository.
Instructions for how to encrypt files and communications on the internet are offered to readers of HN and IHNED.cz in the form of an electronic book by Michal Altaire Valášek in the PDF format.
A clever way to save on college scripts
Given that the price for college scripts for many students exceeds $1,000 a year, the upcoming second-year student came up with a smart way to cut costs.
He devised a system of renting books from classmates from senior classmates with an offer of nominal compensation to delay their divest.
"I earned a book on calculations that normally cost $180 for the semester for ten and for chicken nuggets," says Schroeder, 19, who is studying at the Covenant College in Georgia.
The fordals required in its last semester would cost $430, he says.
Speded 120.
According to the university board, the average student spends more than $1,200 a year on textbooks and aids, but students have different options to cope with these expenses.
The preferred choice of students is becoming online shops and creative solutions like Schroeder's.
Textbook lending is on the rise, allowing students to use the book for a semester, often at a significant discount rather than buying it.
Neebo Inc, which operates more than 250 bookstores in campus venues, says that book lending has doubled since 2011.
A survey in the auspies shows that around a quarter of the books in the university bookstore were borrowed in the last spring semester, says Vice President Neebo Trevor Meyer.
Less than half of the teaching texts are bought at university bookstores, according to the National Association of University Businesses.
Here's the 101 best ways to succeed.
Shopping online
Prices of some new books may be up to a third lower online than in the university's bookstore.
The recommended award for the ninth edition of Rone Larson's "Calculus," and Robert Hostetler, is almost $290 for the book, but it is available online to buy a new one for $2399.99 on the Internet.
Buy used
If you don't mind other people's notes or wear and tear and vandal, the appropriate option is the curricure texts used.
On Chegg.com, "Calculus" sells for $93.49.
Matt Casaday, 25, a senior student at Brigham Young University, says he paid 42 cents for a used copy of "Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business" on Amazon.com.
The new was sold for $48.
University lecturer Ingrid Bracey, head of the University of Massachusetts Amherst's College Without Walls, suggests that students at their teachers check to see if the older editions are acceptable.
Sometimes the changes for working in seminars are not relevant.
If so, older releases can be sold at a fraction of the price of the last version.
In addition to Chegg and Amazon, eBay Inc's Half.com is a popular alternative for buying used books.
Borrowing
It is also worth considering lending textbooks, if you treat them well, remember to return them, and you don't need to have them after the seminar is over.
You can save up to 80% of the cost of a new book.
For example, a student could borrow "Calculus" for the entire semester for about $20.
Get to know the terms and conditions of the store in which you borrow the book, including a penalty for notes, highlighting or wear and damage.
Keep in mind: If you don't return the book in time, the fine may be higher than the price of a new book.
E-books
Another option is to get your e-book book instead of a normal book.
Sometimes these books are essentially lent in the form of an electronic licence valid for a certain period of time from distributors such as Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc.
Chegg lends "Calculus" for about $61 for six months.
According to Bracey, literary course students can find the most advantageous offers, as many of the classics are now available for free downloads, while science and technical texts can be very expensive.
In any case, go to the shops.
Joe Gault, 29, who will be joining the Pepperdine Law School soon, recommends following the ISBN because it guarantees that you are buying the right book.
Before you order the book online, make sure it's really in stock, Gault advises.
He made his own eye.
The book he bought was sold out for four weeks, and had to pay the full price for a book from the university bookstore.
Mud, all mud.
And then they found a torso of a rifle from the end of the war in the well
The well is a short walk from St. George's Church.
We uncover the foliage around and started pulling out an aged hield - about a meter and a half of mud and rotten leaves.
As we approached the clamor's bottom, we came upon the barrel," said Radomil Novák.
We pulled it out, purified it, and found it to be the torso of an assault German rifle that was used by SS troops.
The discovery is reportedly unusual.
According to my information, such rifles were made until the end of the war.
And there were about three hundred thousand of them," Novák added.
All the wooden design items have been laid out over time, so it is unusable.
Her body, however, is well preserved - it holds its shape.
How did it end up in the well?
There is an explanation.
It may have been thrown in by people who needed to get rid of the weapon used by the SS, probably for fear of being relegated.
Fascists on the run probably wouldn't do that.
They were droelling their weapons in the woods," the finder thinks.
The rifle was the only thing that enthusiasts from the Rainbow of the Jeseníky Movement found in the well.
"There could have been hand grenades, there were a lot of them around here once, so we slowed the excavations, we felt the mud carefully to avoid any misfortune, but there was nothing else down there," Novák said.
The discovery will end in the depository of the museum at the chateau in the nearby Silesian Rudoltice.
Ukrainian general: I have not yet freed the Cesaten Czech
Aktuálně.cz's exclusive interview with General Colonel Volodymyr Ruban, who liberates Ukrainian soldiers from the captivity of pro-Russian separatists.
Kiev/Prague - "I'm sorry, I have to take it... they're calling me from Donetsk," Ukrainian Colonel-General Volodymyr Ruban apologized, perhaps eight times in an exclusive interview with Aktuálně.cz.
Colonel Volodymyr Ruban in a televised debate.
With each such interruption, it was impossible not to hear from the names of the people, their numbers or their where they were - or should be - which Ruban specifies with his counterpart at the other end of the phone.
"That's it - go there," he concluded one of the lightning discussions with Donetsk, and turned to ours again.
Volodymyr Ruban is a reserve general, a former fighter pilot and an active participant in the anti-government protests at the Maidan.
Yesterday - when we were arrange an interview - he was in Donetsk.
The liberation of Ukrainian soldiers from the captivity of pro-Russian separatists is devoted to twenty-four hours a day.
Aktuálně.cz: You may know that the Czechs are also fighting on the side of the pro-Russian separatists.
Our counterintelligence estimates their number up to 30.
There could be many more, of course.
Have you met with a Czech prisoner in your negotiations?
Volodymyr Ruban: I have freed the already captured Serb, the Dagestans, the Chechens, one the Swede, the Georgian... but not yet a Czech.
But I do know who to turn to in Prague if we came across your captured countryman and can rescue him.
Ukrainian soldier captured by separatists
What do you advise the Czechs who join pro-Russian separatists and Ukrainian soldiers will capture them?
They should understand that if, as the Czechs, they are fighting in the Ukrainian banners of volunteers and the separatists capture them, they will be shot without mercy after being questioned, as will any other foreigner.
The separatists consider these men to be the rent of mercenaries, who they say nothing deserves nothing but death.
But if, for example, Ukrainian soldiers capture a group of Donetsk separatists - and a Czech among them, for one, then they put him behind bars and treat him like a prisoner of war.
The guy just survives.
The Ukrainian side also behaves like a state in the war.
A.cz: And how many of the Ukrainian prisoners have you managed to save?
As I understand it, in exchange.
Some sources say it has long since passed a hundred men.
We've long since stopped counting how many people we helped.
But we just freed them... they didn't save them from the war if they decided to continue the fighting.
The rescuers are doctors in the war, the surgeons, but we certainly aren't.
That's it.
And every day, more and more are added.
We'll save someone every day.
Sometimes one, sometimes a quartet or a five.
And it doesn't always have to be an exchange.
Sometimes, even a human request is enough to release the prisoners.
A.cz: It is rumored to have gained great authority and even trust with the pro-Russian separatists in a few months . . . as well as in Ukrainian society.
How did you manage to build the respect of the two warring parties?
Tough question.
One of the officers in Kiev gave me the nickname "the crazy general with the steel balls."
It's not offense.
And perhaps it captures the essence of our work.
As head of the Ukrainian Officaten Corps, I had gained some of that authority before.
I never catch, cheat and always keep my word.
Whatever's going on, I'm honest with the truth.
Even when it is the Ukrainian government, or the Donetsk or Luhansk very unpleasant one.
If they torture and kill people?
So I simply tell them that they are torting and killing them.
And that they're crimes.
I often risk my life, I even got captured in the prisoner exchange... this job can be the end for me at any time... I don't have to come back.
A.cz: How many executions and torture of prisoners do you know about?
... (long pure)... to torture the prisoners, both Ukrainians and the separatists are resorted to the torture of prisoners.
Unfortunately.
And executions?
These only take place on the Donetsk side.
I do not have information that the Ukrainian army is also executing prisoners.
Nor hints about the Ukrainian military committing such a thing.
We have an idea of the number of executions, but I can't and I don't want to give the numbers.
A.cz: Describe to me the characters and motives of the pro-Russian separatists.
Among them are officers, but also veterans from Afghanistan.
They are trying to make autonomy and perhaps democracy in Donetsk or Luhansk - that's what they say.
They don't want to play games with Ukrainian oligarchs anymore.
The separatists are fed up with the oligarchs and are their impenigned opponents - to the death.
As we say - they've come over to the throat.
The same dreams and ash people, by the way, were shown in the Maidan.
And now I'm going to get a little dicks: Russia is backed by the separatists, and the West, on the contrary, by the Ukrainian state.
I consider one speculation to be a big one, and the other one, on the other hand, to be small.
But this line of mine already holds an impespent contradiction.
A.cz: For example, how do you find one of the toughest leaders of pro-Russian separatists, Igor Bezler?
Every time I cross the line of the war front, I'm unarmed and show soldiers or militants their bare hands outstretched.
And I've always got both sides of the two or three hundred yards in the sights or the optical sights.
The faces of the people who point to me, I can see well every time... and they can pull the trigger of their weapons at any time.
A paratrooper, an experienced colonel with German and Ukrainian ancestry.
He considers himself a Russian officer, but his family - his mother - lives in Ukraine.
He believes that Ukraine should not exist.
And if so, just as a small governorate in the big Russian empire.
In any case, he talks about it all the time, and he sees Ukraine as a kind of misunderstanding.
Such a state, he said, should not even exist.
At the same time, he is an impenatutor to all Ukrainian oligarchs.
A.cz: Speaking of characters - in a Ukrainian TV discussion show, you called your Prime Minister, Arseniy Yatsenyuk, a weak, clueless and tired "leader" who would do best if he left quickly.
For those three hundred yards of walking, I get scared at least five times.
So why should I be hiding the view that Yotňuk is a very weak prime minister and that he is hurting our country?
A.cz: Do you think he has a part in the war in Ukraine?
You may know that the Ukrainians of Yatsenyuk are nicknamed "the rabbit."
And the rabbit is not, in the eyes of Ukrainians, an animal that would be afraid of or would have respect and authority for others.
His behavior directly follows the behavior of the rabbit.
He may be a good economist, but as a prime minister, he has no right to cry in parliament in a war, to beg, to play with him in his intrigues, to threaten to lay down the job... he must run the country, administer it and protect it in times of war.
At the threat to the country, the prime minister is not entitled to family, his comrades, rest on tearful emotions.
He is the first of the ministers of Ukraine.
And Yatonuk?
He's being a teenage girl.
Yes, he's tired, but he's also weak, because he's never been strong... he's not fighting for Ukraine, he's just complaining about everything all the time.
He should therefore leave.
The sooner the better for Ukraine.
Why the Guardians of the Galaxy couldn't save the sales
The Spassel 3 of Sylvester Stallone's $90 million have been returned from a $90 million budget in the US, and by Sin City: A woman for whom I would return only $12 million from the $70 million budget.
The film Sex Tape with Cameron Diaz grossed only $14.6 million on its first weekend, as well as films for children such as How to Train the Dragon 2 were a disappointment to theatres.
According to an article by the film critic Robbie Collin in the Telegraph, the quality of their very adole is to blame for children's films.
Collin called 2014 the "worst" year of children's films, and called How to Train Your Dragon 2 a mere "functional" sequel.
When it comes to films put on a slightly older target audience, it seems that the problem is not necessarily in the quality of the films themselves.
In July, Entertainment Weekly compared CinemaScore and Metacritic servers and their average rating of summer film premieres aired in at least 2,000 cinemas between the Victims of the War Day and July 20 in 2013 and that year.
The results, which take into account the view of both viewers and film critics, suggest that this year's film crop is of similar quality to last year's hits.
According to some commentators, a change in viewers' access and the higher popularity of internet sites like Netflix may be to blame.
Director Jon Favreau, who is currently working on Disney's treatment of the Jungle Book, told the Hollywood Reporter website, "I think times are changing."
We have to admit it and not try to chase at what was already there.
Unlike the current crisis in Hollywood box office caseload, Netflix's profit was $1.2 billion thanks to internet services, almost twice as much as last year's $837 million.
Last summer, director Steven Spielberg criticized the studio for relying on comic book rights too much, and predicted the "fame" of Hollywood.
In light of the current slump, some commentators claim that there may be something to it about its catastrophic prophell.
With the launch of possible major box-office hit-and-line hit in the summer of 2015, including the Avengers: Age of Ultron, the Outs are the Outs and Jurassic Worlds, other numbers are more optimistic in the film industry.
X-Men producer Simon Kinberg recently called the drop in sales simply "cyclical." For the Hollywood Reporter, he said, "Next summer will be the summer's biggest box-office hitters in history and no one will worry about the sale."
DPRK threatens Seoul again, launches another short-range missile
North Korea has launched another short-range missile into the sea, Seoul reported.
The missile's alleged test was carried out shortly after the completion of the joint military maneuvers of the United States and South Korea, which Pyongyang perceives as preparation for the invasion.
The province of Chagang is in the northwest KDLR at the border with China.
A spokesman for the South Korean Defense Ministry told DPA that the missiles were launched from a place in the northwest of the DPRK and reached a distance of roughly 200 kilometers.
North Korea thus apparently first launched a missile from the province of Zhagang, South Korean media reported, citing military circles.
The province is said to be home to an underground launch pad for Scud rocket missiles.
This is another in a series of similar trials that the isolated North Korean regime has conducted in recent weeks.
North Korea conducted an unusually large number of missile and artillery tests this year.
NATO Summit: First Protests in Newport and Cardiff
Over the weekend, protests were held by protests from opponents of the NATO summit in Newport.
On Saturday, hundreds of people gathered in central Newport to take part in the march against NATO.
And on Sunday, about 150 people came to the town hall in Cardiff for a meeting that was described as an anti-summit.
Stephen Fairclough watched the situation over the weekend and spoke to the protesters who had travelled from Bridgend to Belgium.
Teenagers had to be airlifted from the Blue Mountains
TWO teenage tourists were picked up by plane and taken to safety after spending the night at the Blue Mountains in New South Wales.
A 16-year-old girl and an 18-year-old man made a hike to Govetts Leap in Blackheath after noon on Sunday.
When they did not return home, the anxious relatives called the police around 8 p.m.
A search crew was dispatched, including a local police and a rescue team, and the couple was found near Bridal Veil Falls at around 11 p.m.
The girl injured her knee and the man fell and hit his head in the process.
The police stayed with them overnight and were picked up on Monday morning.
In a stable condition they were taken by ambulance to the Blue Mountains Hospital.
Olomouc brought only a point from Opava, the win was on Vasicek's leg
The 23-year-old forward could have made the decision, but failed in the two-ghest chances.
After the goal, a shot called mainly from close range three minutes before the end, but instead of in the net, it ended up on the goalkeeper of the Opava goalkeeper Josef Květoňovi.
I had it on my leg, I have to give those chances.
I'm mad at myself," Vasicek said, pouring ashes on his head.
"I guess I should have put it higher under the lid, it got a little bit of a pass," he mused.
Sigma's defense did not allow Opava much, with the exception of Mikul's 11th-minute drive, which was covered by the goalkeeper Reichl.
Then they started to push Hanáci, but they were not allowed to the chance in the block defending the home side and the shots from the distance were caught by Květoň.
We compared ourselves for 15 minutes, then took the initiative.
We were better in the second half, we had more of the game and Opava only threatened us from standard situations.
But the outright chance was not converted by Vasicek, and it ended 0-0," said Leoš Kalvoda, the coach of Hanák.
Opava also took the point because of absences from the line-up, where in addition to the pair of injured, Petr Vavřík and the three-goal scorer Petr Ševčík, who are hosting from Sigma in Silesia, were missing.
Unlike her earlier policy, she did not allow them to step in.
The replaachers deserve a discharge.
Sigma looked more football, but we didn't let her do anything except for one standard," Silesian coach Petr Baránek said.
There was a lot of emphasis, aggression and vigour.
The draw is probably deserved, the point is a good gain for us," he added.
Sigma scored four points in the draw, which means 13th place.
Nothing that could satisfy the club's chief executive, Josef Lébro, who, after his defeat to Znojmo, made his million-dollar contribution to the coffers conditional on vastly different performances in other matches.
"We were aware of Mr. Lébro's warning, so there's no question of the guys not wanting to fight," Kalvoda noted, adding to the sleeping shooter Vasicek: "I believe it will come and when he scores, he will start to fall.
But after the first shot, I'll replace him with goals to save goals for the next games," Kalvoda laughed.
Al Pacino has twice thrilled Venice.
Film Festival is experiencing a crisis in the face
After the tremendous enthusiasm for the inaugural film Birdman, whose director Alejandro González Iňárritu suddenly became one of the serious candidates for the Golden Lion, the next few days suggested the impression that interest in the 71st edition of the Venice Festival had somewhat waned.
Whether because the number of seats in the largest room increased to fourteen hundred or because Birdman was followed by critics recognized, but less appealing to the audience, as a documentary about the genocide in Indonesia of the 1960s View of Silence and other social-themed films from American 99 homes to Iran's Stestiings, in cinemas, in the cinemas, they simply remained empty seats.
Heroes from the Comics
Even the red carpet in front of the festival palace has not yet been so far hastened by the crowds as in the past, and it has reportedly stopped getting the problem of getting a last-minute hotel job.
The crisis is talked about in Italy more than elsewhere, and it is no wonder that it has suffered even as ecclesiighted institutions as the Biennale and the world's oldest film festival.
Fortunately, the crisis does not manifest itself in a lack of personalities, but those present exclusively in connection with the films.
While younger fans longed for the autographs of comic book superheroes Michael Shannon and Andrew Garfield, who had been quite successful in dramatic roles in 99 homes, a visit to the legendary actor, the main event for all generations, was the main event.
He also starled here in two films.
In the story of The Initiation, performed out of the competition, by Oscar-winning Barry Levison, based on Philip Roth's novel, the 74-year-old Pacino has a role that is close to him: an actor at the height of fame who suffers from the depression of the end of his career and his personal life.
But seeing him the very next day as the eccasant owner of a hardware store from a rural town in the film Manglehorn, directed by David Gordon Green, was a truly unforgettable experience.
The Volpi Cup for Best Actor should not miss it - but does the Pacinova-style artist still need awards?
Perhaps the greatest satisfaction for him is the love of the audience, and the Italian one in particular, for although he was born in New York, Al Pacino is proudly proclaiming himself to the country from which his grandparents come.
Points for the Italians
Indeed, it is the Italian film that is doing very well in Venice this year.
The black souls, directed by Francesco Munzi, became the first picture rewarded with a rewarded long standing ovation after Birdman.
In it, the Calabrian offshoot of the Mafia is viewed by the view of family relationships between the clans, which struggle for each other's power and money, and the director has been able to reconcile all the prerequisites for a good film: a quality script, a camera, music, and anherl.
He was also intrigued by the chamber psychothriller Hlad's Hearts, filmed by Saverio Costanzo with Alba Rohrwacher in the role of a woman who almost wills her own child with her misguided anxiety.
In contrast, French competition films did not receive a warm welcome either the Fame or 3 Hearts, both of the works clinging to the traditional model of consumer films, which rely on the popularity of the performers.
But, after all, two really excellent films, Birdman and the Black Souls, are not so little at the first half of the festival.
And while the festival films have mostly depressing themes, Peter Bogdanovich's new film, She's Funny That Way, a witty comedy out of competition in Venice and shot in the style of the American bookies of the 1940s, was able to lift the mood for more than a day.
Police officers catch four meth manufacturers in Prague, brought the drugs from Poland
"Detectives have detained three men in the past few days, aged 42, 42 and 37, and a 25-year-old woman who had produced and sold the drug of meth in Prague 9 from last November until this August," police spokesperson Jana Rösslerová said.
First, on Tuesday, August 12, a SWAT team in Cihlářské Street caught a 42-year-old organizer and a dealer in one person and a young woman who was in the group as a drug buyer in Poland and a saleswatch saleswoman.
The following day, the detectives detained another member of the group on the basis of the prior approval of the prosecutor, the 37-year-old.
The last of the four officers were caught in the morning of 20 on Wednesday, August 20, in the area of the picturesque incinerator," the spokesperson described.
For transporting drugs from Poland, the woman received a third of the drug
The main organizer had a wide field of action.
In the workshop of the ticket area, in the garden house in Horoměřice, in the apartment in Koněvova Street and other places in Prague 9 he produced meth, provided various aids and chemicals needed to make it and provided the transfer of drugs with pseudoephedrine from the Republic of Poland.
He weighed the manufactured drug, divided into plastic bags and subsequently sold meth.
With the transfer of drugs from Poland or the sale of the addicts, he was helped by a 25-year-old, hitherto unpunished woman.
For this, she received a reward from the organizer in the form of a third of the drug produced," Rösslerová added.
Criminals also carried out several house searches on the judge's order, where they secured the drug, industrial chemicals, digital scales, pay bags, syringes, tubes and other aids, and items that, according to the experts, can be considered as a complete methampampamone production kit.
The dealer has been convicted seven times since 1995
"From the available records, the officers discovered that the main organizer had been convicted of property crimes in total seven times since 1995, the woman was not being convicted," the police spokesperson said.
The last detainee was in 2006 suspended for the offence of sexual abuse, and the 37-year-old mechanic who is on the loose who has been prosecuted nine times has been convicted of justice since 2009.
It was mostly for property crimes for him, too.
The investigator charged three men and a woman with committing the crime of illicit manufacture and other handling of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances and poisons, punishable by up to ten years in prison.
For three persons, the investigator eventually filed a motion to the prosecutor to impose custody, where the judge eventually placed them," the spokesperson said.
The fourth accused, a 37-year-old repeat offender, ended up at large.
His position and role in this case were not as essential as those of the other accused.
Police officers continue to work with this man anyway.

The abolition of grammar schools and secondary schools makes no sense.
The Czech Republic has few generally educated people, and the statistics show that grammar schools have a good application.
The start of the school year is here.
In the last fortnight, the schools have taken place in great preparation.
Most of them are routine matters, like transfering the pots from the summer repository back to the classrooms and get chalks.
In the grammar school in the grammar school, they'll be a little bit more gusfol.
A few days before the start of the season, they are looking for furniture, computers and other technical equipment as well as library literature.
There was no robbery or embezzlement, the four-year grammar school in Hořice is opening and restoring its activities after three years.
Not on a public, but on a private platform.
The lack of material equipment is not due to the founding people being so incompetent.
They had to wait to see if the school's existence would be confirmed by the registration of schools administered by the Ministry of Education.
"French socialists should shut up and fix France," says Francois Hollande's key ally
Valls calls on the highly fragmented left to "superfile her support" to a belligerent socialist president whose new distribution of office has not been met with the approval of the majority of the French.
The president deserves universal respect, he deserves loyalty, he deserves our support.
"Our duty is to stay by his side," he said, repping in applause.
As a conciliatory gesture, the Prime Minister insisted that his government would not question the controversial French 30-hour work week, despite the heated conjecture of Emmanuel Macron, the new Chancellor of the Exchequer, who suggested that the rules be relaxed at the beginning of the week.
On Saturday, Hollande asked the Socialists to remain "coheric" with the government.
But Christiane Taubiro, the Minister of Justice, drew a line under his budget when she appeared at a meeting of rebellious socialist MPs, where she criticized the Socialist Party for "Francouzi's loss of faith in the future."
Marine Le Pen, the leader of the extremely conservative right, laughed at the incessant internal controversy among the Socialists when she said she did not anticipate that the new Valls government would last for more than a few months.
Emperor Francois Hollande is naked, and so is Prince Manuel Valls. They were forced to form a new government when the previous one did not last until the end of the summer.
"And the new one won't last until the end of autumn or winter," Le Pen told her supporters.
It reiterated its party's call for the dissolution of Parliament, saying that it believed that the party could win an early election and that it was ready to run the country.
The French ruling party suffered a defeat in the municipal elections in March, and the extremely conservative right was successful in the European Parliament elections in May.
According to a poll by the Journal du Dimanche, 76 percent of French people think that the Socialist Party runs the risk of splitting into several rival factions before the end of Hollande's term of office in 2017.
Pascal Perrineau, a political scientist at Sciences Po University, warned that the French would soon run out of patience if the new socialist government failed to improve the economy and reduce record unemployment.
"It's a limited space for opportunity, but public opinion must think that there are changes in the situation," he warned.
Otherwise, the situation could get worse.
Gambling and street art will no longer be restricted by Prague until the election
Amendments to the relevant decrees should be prepared and approved by the new capital management.
Other gambling establishments will not disappear from the streets of Prague before the local elections, and the city will not restrict street art.
Nor will the dog walk be restricted.
Prague will not be able to prepare and approve changes to the relevant decrees in the council by the October elections.
"Moreover, the decision on the changes should not be made by the current city leadership, which is ending its mandate in a few weeks," said Councillor Lukáš Manhart (TOP 09).
The cusch-based gambling on its territory has been decided in recent weeks by several town halls, such as Prague 5 and 7.
But the gambling will not disappear; the gambling decree will not be changed yet.
It is the task of the new leadership of the city after the election.
Now we would not technically do so, given the deadlines for submitting comments and the like," Manhart explained.
He added that the latest meeting of the current council, which must approve the amendment to the decree, would take place on 9/11.
A referendum on the blanket ban on gambling is planned on the day of the local elections of the city districts of Prague 1 and Prague 8.
There is currently a ban on gambling in Prague 2 or Prague 12.
The decree will not be changed for the same reasons in the case of street art, so-called busking.
This is particularly complained about by Prague 1, which has already sent the Municipality a proposal for places to expand the current list of banned places.
The musicians are also not wanted by Prague 5 in the vicinity of Anděl.
The decree regulating the dog-walking city is planning several months, not yet completed.
The placement of gaming rooms and the issue of busking are dealt with by the city ordinances.
They can be issued or modified only by the city council.
Councils have only an advisory vote, they are not allowed to issue ordinances themselves.
Last week he placed victory at his fingertips of Scottish independence at his fingertips
The Scottish independence campaign was in the danger of making this mistake a third time when it almost put the question of whether the Scots wanted to be rich.
But you don't get to the hearts of the Scottish electorate by appealing to their wallet, or get their respect when you start threatening them.
The Morality of the New Testament is still alive in Scotland, although few Scots still go to church today.
Scots have a much greater tendency to drive the money-gumpers out of the temple than to have them dictated how to vote.
The head of the Scottish nationalists, Alex Salmond, is well aware of this, which is why he repeatedly asked his opponent, the Unionan Darling, in a televised discussion as to whether he was willing to respect the 'sovereign will of the Scottish people's people's 'sovereign' if Scottish voters voted for independence, and start supporting the single currency for both Scotland and England.
This forced Darling to choose between Scottish civil society and London financiers, and he fell into this trap with a grimace.
Of course, Darling will not support the Scottish electorate's mandate.
However, the discussion about Scotland's currency was already more or less neutralised.
What really motivates Scottish voters is the fairness, job opportunities and the defence of the state health service that citizens have for free.
Darling supported London's bankers in the currency and also gave the impression that he would not protest against the privatisation of health care.
The way Salmond put it, "get into bed with the Conservatives."
This is a very dangerous position for any Scottish politician.
Every Scottish voter knows that Scottish businessmen are in bed with the Conservatives.
This was confirmed by David Cameron, who spoke not to voters in Scotland but to the association of "bosses," to the Confederation of British Industry.
It is becoming clear that Cameron's refusal to debate independence with Scottish Prime Minister Salmondo was a serious mistake for the Unionical campaign.
Cameron thus looks like a cowardly absentee domestic.
Scots would respect him if he came to the debate with the Scottish Prime Minister.
At least Cameron could say that Scotland could be a "successful independent country."
Alistair Darling can't say that, it's almost a physical pain.
What he says is clear: Scots are not supposed to jump out and they have to accept what is.
The longest year is 10 months.
The pessimistic start of the school by Miloš Urban
Illustration to the shortest year
Miloš Urban The longest year
The end was the best of the holidays ever, the last week that wasn't going anywhere, and we were just lying around and wowing with the Indian summer, the silence before the storm, the calm before the stress.
New clothes when you could get from Tuzex, boots from East Germany.
Reading the Fast Arrows, for the fiftieth time, the grounding on his bike through the hindsight to the back of the Vars, somewhere near the tennis courts, no longer hot, the sun stroking his back and shoulders, tapping the farewell rays.
In the evening, a mild nervousness, still a holiday regime, not to sleep until half-past ten, a week's time worse, the moment before falling asleep will stretch from a few minutes to two hours, then get up at 6:30 in the morning.
It'll come Monday.
It doesn't usually hour, on the contrary, summer sneers mischiechieb in front of the school.
To be served in the ghostly light on a patch and feel like a plastic figure in a glass paperweight, there's that school, the Elementary A.
Zápotocký with monstrous pink plaster, and in front of her old familiar faces as well as a few new ones, boys more oranky, girls more boorish.
There are punk, to avoid them, it's still interesting how infamously they keep together and how early they are here.
And these mature-looking girls who came in for the jinx are laughing at something now, I guess something has changed in their lives over the holidays while everything is the same for me.
And again the new first-graders, some of the nerves and others excited, why do they come in at all?
Because they have to, the educational military obligatory.
So in the inside, the cool moisture of the floor and the light smell of disinfectant, the poisoned janitor with the mop, unfortunately, the same one that is said to lend the pupil's tin-box keys, where you can leave the textbooks and which are still so little.
For a bottle.
The smell of the locker room remains in the memory, now it is not held, it is pretty air-louse, but in a week it will be worse.
The image alone crecks on the stomach and a headache begins to ache.
A head that even harder to embrace the maths curriculum, that diabolical game for the elect, which I'm not one of those who are and never will be.
Again, the threes and fours, the forbid, fives, hide from rehearsal, fit in from the bench and best be dug up, be there even if it weren't, to exist only as a name in the classroom, and to dream stories of the nicer girls and nicer buildings, about antennas in space, where no one is in court, is offends anyone, and doesn't do anyone's leg.
The longest year is ten months.
And it's only the first day, now as it was years ago.
She let her daughters born die.
She faces exceptional punishment - Novinky.cz
The first birth took place in March 2012 in the public toilets in the bus station in Jihlava.
Without any help, her baby girl was born, which she wrapped in a prepared blanket after being cut from the umbilical cord, hid under her jacket and carried her to the road feeder, where she placed it in the bushes located a few dozen meters from the road.
She was born on the way to school
It came to me a little earlier, I guess.
I was on my way to school.
On the bus, I felt the need to go to the bathroom, that's where I gave birth.
She was born alive, looking at me.
I cut the umbilical cord with the scissors I wore to the school," the defendant described, stating that she was said to be ashamed of her pregnancy.
"The following day, she returned to the site, put the child's body in her backpack and taken away, removed the body from her backpack, wrapped in a black plastic bag and hid and left it under the stairs at her grandmother's house in Havlíčkův Brod," the lawsuit reads, noting that it is not entirely clear when the newborn's death occurred.
It could have been in tens of minutes, but also a few hours after giving birth, as weed by a blanket or inserting it under a jacket, hypothermia, or bleeding from the unsurpassed umbilical cord.
A similar scenario was repeated next spring.
The woman at the undetected time from February to April 12, when the corpse of the child was found by accidental witnesses under the bush at the pond in Havlíčkobrodsko, again secretly gave birth to herself.
This time in the bathroom of the attic apartment in the family home.
Without checking to see if it was born alive without scissing and bracing the umbilic that was wrapped around the neck, she put the child in several plastic wrappers, including a plastic bag, and left it in the bathroom.
Subsequently, in the afternoon, he and his then-partner took him to the pond.
She was eventually given in by a friend
The father of both children was the defendant's friend, who was allegedly unaware of his partner's pregnancies.
For that reason, too, he is not now in court, only being punished for a transgression against the Funerals Act.
He, too, was the one who later turned himself in to the police.
I don't like the fact that he's not being punished as an an outuse can.
He manipulated the child against my wishes.
I know my solution was wrong, but it felt human at the time," said the defendant, who allegedly succinited and feared the man in the relationship.
In the course of her testimony, the young woman sounded rather composed.
Tears into her eyes were only brought to her eyes by the moment when she spoke of her relationship with her parents, from whom she had left after reaching the age of majority.
She said she didn't want to kill
"They come to me every 14 days to visit, they do everything for me, even though I know I don't deserve it," she sobed.
I didn't get a kit because I didn't want kids, I felt young.
I was always going to put him in a babybox, but I don't know what happened that I didn't do that.
I can't explain that to you," she said to the judge.
However, she refused to act with the thought and intention of killing the newborn.
In addition, the second child was believed to have been stillborn.
Even in her pregnancy, she did not stop drinking alcohol.
But I have restricted it.
And she didn't drink hard.
I have also restricted smoking," she said.
Although the pregnancy was evident in both cases, she told everyone, even to repeated questions, that she had a medical condition, that she was ircured.
And my friend.
The trial will continue at the court in Hradec on Tuesday with the testimony of forensic experts.
A verdict could already be handed down on Wednesday.
The woman is at risk of a penalty of up to 18 years in prison, or even an exceptional sentence.
Norwegian Cruise approaches $2 billion buy-in to Prestige Cruise
According to sources briefing the matter, Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings s.r.o. (NCHL.O), the third largest cruise liner in the world, has advanced in negotiations to buy Prestige Cruises International Inc. for approximately $3 billion.
The deal by Norwegian Cruise, a market value of $6.8 billion that competes with greater competition from the Royal Carrebian Cruises s.r.o. (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N), has given access to the luxury cruise ships of Prestige Cruises and the wealthy clientele.
The deal may be released as early as this week, the source revealed on Sunday, but pointed out that the negotiations still may not be successful.
The owner of Prestige Cruises, the private investment company Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N), also owns a 20% stake in Norwegian Cruise.
Sources did not wish to be named because the negotiations are not public.
Officials from Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to requests for comment, a spokesman for Apollo declined to comment.
Norwegian-based Nav Cruise, based in Miami, operates thirteen cruise ships in North America, the Mediterranean and the Baltic Sea, Central America and the Caribbean.
The company's revenue in 2013 was $2.57 billion, 13% more than in 2012.
Prestige Cruises operates under the Oceania and Regent brands, which together own eight cruise ships sailing to Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
The company announced sales of $1.2 billion in 2013, 6% more than in the previous year.
The twenty-nine billion-dollar segment of cruise cruises is expected to profit from the rise of the middle class in growing economies like China and India in the coming year.
Companies compete to make them the preferred option for the selection of cruise cruise customers.
Prestige Cruises registered its first public offering with the US regulatory authorities in January 2014.
Apollo has had a majority stake in the company since 2007 since the close of the deal worth $850 million.
Norwegian Cruise has been in existence in its current form since the merger with the cruise operator owned by the Genting Bhd (GENT.KL) cruise liners, a consortium of leisure and casinos-seams businesses controlled by Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thay.
In 2008, Apollo invested $1 billion in Norwegian Cruise.
Norwegian Cruise listed the shares on the stock exchange in January 2013.
According to the registration with the regulatory authorities at the end of June, Genting held a capital shareholding of 28%, Apollo 20 % and the private investment company TPG Capital LP 8%.
According to the registration dossier, the first public offers include Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruise, a combined total of 82% of the size of North American passengers.
Pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong the day after vote decision provoke Chinese authorities
Nearby, a group of people loyal to Beijing were standing, waving the Chinese flag.
The Permanent Commission of the National People's Congress approved on Sunday that only two of the three candidates should participate in the 2017 elections in Hong Kong.
All candidates must first receive the support of the appointment committee, which is likely to be made up of members of the faithful Beijing.
Because of this decision, it is almost impossible for the opposition Democrats to get on the ballot papers and get pro-democratic activists to renew the promise and cripple Hong Kong's financial center with the protests of the "Centre's Occupation" movement.
In Hong Kong, political reform is a major cause of tension, with Chinese leaders fear that the demand for democratization will be extended to other cities.
After Beijing published a detailed report outlines China's official authority in Hong Kong in June, democratic activists held an unofficial referendum on the elections in a special official district, and hundreds of thousands of people marched into and occupied the city's business district.
The press conference, at which Prime Minister Li will address, is organised by the government in Hong Kong and the Chinese liaison office in Hong Kong.
During the day, the chairman of the Standing Committee of the Legislative Commission, Zhang Ronghsun, and the Deputy Director of the State Board of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, Feng Wei, were also scheduled to speak at several press conferences.
Studen activists said they would gather in front of the Hong Kong government's office this afternoon.
Until the last days of the colonial government 150 years ago, Britain has never mentioned democracy in Hong Kong.
Putin asks Kiev to begin negotiations with eastern Ukraine on "state sovereignty"
According to a description of the events by Russian newspapers, Russian President Vladimir Putin asked on Sunday for the Ukrainian government to halt the fighting with the separatists in the east of the country and immediately begin negotiations on the "state sovereignty" of the secreted areas of the secreted areas.
His spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, later explained that Putin's comment had not intended to indicate that the areas of eastern Ukraine under the control of the separatists would become part of Russia, but that their status within Ukraine should be overtly assessed in order to give the Russian-speaking area the authority to protect its rights and interests.
Putin's call to the Kiev government to deal with pro-Russian rebels as equals responds to the apparent strategy that follows it since the unrest broke out five months ago: Help the separatists occupy the territory and give the Ukrainian government to grant the newly declared Novorum Nourose de facto independence so that instead of the West, it can merge with Russia instead of the West.
In an interview with the first channel of state television, Putin condemned Ukrainian military actions to reclaim the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, which were taken over by separatists in March and April after Moscow annexed the Crimean Peninsula belonging to Ukraine on March 18.
The Kremlin and the separatists described the recently occupied territory as "Novorum" or "New Russia," a term that refers to the famous pre-revolutionary days of the Russian Empire.
The Russian Itar-Tass news agency published Putin's words that the "prisoner of the Illusions" is anyone who believes that peace negotiations are on the horizon because Ukrainian politicians launched campaigns ahead of the October 26 parliamentary elections while government troops are challenging the civilian population in areas controlled by the separatists.
"In the interest of the people living in these areas, we must immediately launch meaningful negotiations, not only on legal matters, but also about the political organisation of society and the status of state sovereignty of the southeast of Ukraine," he said.
Peskov said Putin's reference to state sovereignty was meant in the context of broader autonomy, which has been discussed with Kiev's leadership for months, to alleviate the concerns of the Russian-speaking areas of endangering cultural and linguistic rights.
Peskov said that only the Ukrainian government could grant the necessary autonomy to the eastern regions.
This is not a matter for discussion between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov said, "because this is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but an internal Ukrainian conflict."
The Kremlin spokesman's involvement to correct the "unitrite" of Putin's remarks highlighted the leadership's approach to resolving the eastern Separatist uprising, which is different from the open seizure of Crimea, where most of the two-million-strong population of origin is ranked as ethnic Russians.
Moscow should also have much more difficulty in annexing Donetsk and Luhansk in eastern Ukraine, as most of the 6.5 million people are not Russians, and the polls that took place before the conflict have shown broad support for remaining in Ukraine.
The autonomy, which Russian diplomats discussed in international fora, would give regional governments in Ukraine the power to determine their own trade agreements and international relations, essentially giving the Kremlin effective control of the territory that would link the Russian mainland to Crimea.
The Black Sea Peninsula annexed five months ago is the headquarters of Russia's main naval fleet, maritime commercial background and historic coastal resorts.
Areas between Russia's Rostov and Crimea are also a centre of mines, factories and foundries that produce important components for the Russian military.
During his inauguration speech on June 7, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko proposed that Ukrainian lawmakers - after the new elections - consider changes to the constitution that would give diverse regions more control over their finances and language statuses.
But this vision of autonomy differs considerably from that of the Kremlin and the separatists. Moscow is accused of arming and inciting violence.
Putin's final call for Kiev to deal with the separatists as equals followed the rebels' next move last week after Russian troops and tanks from an earlier quiet area along the Sea of Azov penetrated eastern Ukraine.
The separatists, reinforced by the Russians, have taken control of Novoazovsk with such force that the Ukrainian security authorities fear that this is a campaign to occupy the strategic coastal territory as far as Crimea.
This hastened the huge civilian and military effort to fortify Mariupol, a port with metallurgical combinations of 500,000 inhabitants, which lies between Novoazovsk and the narrow entrance gate to the Crimean Peninsula.
Poroshenko spoke at a European Union leaders' meeting in Brussels on Saturday, urging action to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, the former Soviet Republic, which has been independent for the last 23 years.
"We're approaching a point from which there is no return," Poroshenko warned.
Ukraine now houses thousands of foreign military units and hundreds of foreign tanks.
The EU summit has not taken any definitive steps - the leaders are calling for more sanctions to be taken against Russia in the event of an unspecified escalation of the Ukrainian crisis.
Colonel Andriy Lysenko, a spokesman for the Ukrainian National Security and Defence Council of Ukraine told reporters in Kiev on Saturday that Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Ilovaysk after two columns of Russian armoured vehicles and 1,000 military units penetrated the Donetsk region to support the besieged separatists last week.
The first of the 63 reported Ukrainian soldiers who were captured in Ilovaysk in the Russian invasion were exchanged on Sunday for 10 Russian paratroopers captured in the hinterland of Ukraine a week ago, Lysenko said on Sunday.
In the scandal of the exposed photos, Australian celebrities and Gabi Grecko are also involved
Geoffrey Edelsten expressed his disgust at the hackers who probably stole intimate pictures of his fiancée Gabi Grecko and other influential Hollywood stars.
Tinseltown is in shock after a series of explicit pictures of Jennifer Lawrence's, a series of explicit pictures of the naked Jennifer Lawrence made the internet on the internet.
Hacker claims to have sixty photos with the nude star Hunger Games Lawrenco and other stars, including Kate Upton and Cary Delevingne, singers Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Ley Michell, and actresses Kirsten Dunst.
The escape from iCloud reportedly made personal films by Australian actresses Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovski and Melbourne actress Grecko.
There are 101 celebrities on the list.
Edelsten, who proposed to Greco last month, told Confidential magazine, "It's disgusting."
All private correspondence and all private images should remain private.
It is a shame that personal information can be stolen and disseminated to the public.
Grecko, who is now in New York, told online newspapers, according to the news reporters that the hacking was "shame-day" and those who have become his target "famous humiliation."
The hacker is thought to have obtained 30 pictures of Palmer with former boyfriend Scott Speedman, including two pictures of himself topless sprawl by the pool.
Palmer, for example, starred in Love and Honor, where her counterpart was Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, TV series star Chuck Strahovski and actress from the thriller Sucker Punch Browning, did not comment on the stolen pictures yesterday.
A representative of Lawrence TMZ said, "This is a clear violation of privacy."
Actor Seth Rogen criticized the hacker on his Twitter page: "Publishing photos from hacked phones is exactly the same as selling stolen goods."
From a legal standpoint, the publication of the stolen images should not be tolerated.
The Socceroos made up for the Legging, even without a win
Olomouc - Thunder and lightning, which the co-owner of Olomouc Sigma, Josef Lébr, sent to his subordinates last week, seems to be a thing of the past.
Although they brought in a point from Opava in the end only a point for a scoreless draw.
By deploying and belligerence, they made up for the club's boss a little.
Paying money could soon be coming to the club.
"I'll keep one more game as I talked about last week, but I'm much more optimistic," Lébr confirmed, despite the fact that Sigma did not win, the players convinced him with an improved performance.
The combativeness and commitment we played with mainly in the second half was exactly what I wanted to see from the players.
In that case, I am able to forgive that it will not be won.
If we had played that way since the beginning of the season, I am convinced that we have not lost yet," thinks Lébr.
Sigma at Opava withdone the home side's initial pressure, then levelled the game and was better in the second half.
After the victory, Kalvodo's charges reached, but they didn't make the goal of their options, so they couldn't win.
The result is not to our liking.
To complete satisfaction, however, we lacked only one converted chance," said Lébr, who does not think that only his threat caused the change in the attitude of the footballers.
There were certainly more aspects.
Whether from my side, from the coach or the fans," Lébr said.
The pressure must be reckoned with Sigma
The players did not want to comment much on the events of last week after the match in Opava.
I'm trying to put these things out of here.
I tried not to admit it," said the young goalkeeper, Michal Reichl, shaking his head.
Completely without comment, the question was left to the Lekbr Statement last week by striker Václav Vašíček, who did not convert Sigma's biggest opportunity in Saturday's game.
Eventually, however, he did talk a little about the pressure.
We'll be under pressure all the time.
Everybody wants to pull out on us.
We showed today that if we fight and all of us ride on the ass, we'll do it," he said.
The warnings were taken to heart
Even coach Leoš Kalvoda did not shame out that the preparation for the match was not the easiest given the atmosphere in Olomouc last week.
It was pretty hard.
But I think the boys realized that, and you could see today that Mr. Lébro's warning was taken to heart.
Although even before, it wasn't about not wanting to fight and fling it off," the Olomouc coach said.
It was similar to the first 15 minutes today.
It took time to get our tough and realize what the second league was about.
That it's not just about football, it's about the fight," Kalvoda said.
One can only hope that in the next few games it will work from the start.
"I'd love to believe that," he added.
