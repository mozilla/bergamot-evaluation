Barack Obama to receive the Nobel Peace Prize as America's fourth president
US President Barack Obama will arrive in Oslo, Norway, for 26 hours to take the Nobel Peace Prize as the fourth US president in history.
He will receive a diploma, a medal and a check for $1.4 million for, among other things, exceptional efforts to strengthen world diplomacy and cooperation between nations.
The White House official will arrive in the Norwegian capital in the morning with his wife, Michelle, and will be busy.
He will first visit the Nobel Institute, where he will meet for the first time with five committee members selected from 172 people and 33 organisations in October.
The presidents are then scheduled to meet with King Harald V of Norway and Queen Sonja.
In the afternoon, the visit culminates in a ceremony at which Obama will receive the prestigious award.
He will receive it as the fourth American president, but only the third to win the award directly in office.
The White House has already announced that Obama will talk about the Afghan war as he takes the awards.
The president does not want to avoid the subject because he realizes that he is accepting the award as the president currently at war in two countries.
He increased the war effort a few days ago by sending additional troops to Afghanistan, which none of his critics will remember to highlight.
At the ceremony, Obama will also receive a gold medal, a diploma and a cheque for ten million Swedish kronor (about 24 million Czech crowns).
He intends to give those to charitable causes, but he has not yet decided on a particular charity.
The packed program will then be introduced by the president and his spouse to the banquet, where, in addition to the King of Norway and the Queen, there will also be a Prime Minister and another 250 invited guests.
From the beginning, Obama was more restrained to price.
He said, for example, that she felt that she did not fully deserve it.
He also reiterated several times that it was not just a prize for him, but for all those who seek the same values as him.
He said immediately after the announcement that they would be "challenged for him to take action."
Conservation Guards accused of extortion
The Litoměřice police have charged the chairman of the civic association Society of Conservation of Conservation of the Litoměřice of blackmail.
In several cases in the past year, he has appealed to some building proceedings, demanding money for his benefit from investors for the withdrawal of the appeal, said Litoměřická police spokeswoman Alena Romová.
The chairman of the Litoměřice Society of Conservation of Nature is Lubomír Studnička.
He is now in custody and faces up to three years in prison.
The sorting containers of Brno don't smell very good
In Prague, ordinary people can sort beverage packaging, in the South Moravian villages you will meet sorting containers at every step.
And in Brno?
There to be a few minutes to reserve for a few minutes before you find suitable bins.
I don't want to say that waste would not be arranged in Brno at all.
But it seems to me that we are the second largest city in the Republic, the councillors are insufficiently interested in this problem.
Brno is in the jungle league of waste sorting not only by being able to throw only paper, glass and plastics into the sorting containers here, but above all by the number of bins for such waste.
Have you ever tried to throw a PET bottle in a collection basket in the center?
It's a complete trick, it just takes time and steady nerves.
The only place I have come to find so far is in Moravský náměstí opposite Potrefené Huse.
Don't let Mr. Onderka and my colleagues get angry with me, but I don't find it a hell of a lot.
Not to mention the fact that in other parts, there is no honey sorting of waste.
Many of my friends would rather not sort the waste.
Out of laziness.
They're far from the garbage cans.
I don't blame them.
I volunteered myself after the party to throw away some glass and plastic bottles.
But I didn't see any colorful garbage cans on Kounicova Street in the foreseeable future.
Luckily, on the way to the shaline, I came across the right place.
But the garbage from it was overflowing.
After all, this is still the centre of Brno that perhaps represents the city the most, is it?!
But ecology and some aesthetics are probably not of much interest to the Brno socialists.
They would rather buy the city's hockey extra league, which will embarrass us all over the country than buy a few extra containers and offer sorting of other ingredients for cleaner Brno.
I am glad that I was able to confirm my conjecture with the official statistics after a while of browsing online.
According to data from EKO-KOM, Brno is really the worst in the whole South Moravian Region.
'Paroub' budget took money for pensions and sick leave
After the left added to farmers or officials in the government, the budget does not have to be money for pensions, sick pay or building savings.
But also on interest on the national debt or international lawsuits.
It will add problems to those who will govern in the second half of next year, says Finance Minister Eduard Janota.
When the Social Democrats and Communists advocated the increase for some groups, they relied on sensitive spending, pensions, or sick leave to borrow the government afterwards. "It's just postponing the problems to the future, laying mines," says Janota.
The money borrowed is increasingly paid for interest and has to be returned at some point.
There's not much to choose from to get to do it for the state.
If they do not reduce welfare or costs for the running of the state, they must raise taxes.
To all to whom the left has now added: firefighters, teachers, farmers.
And later, their children.
People don't have to worry about pensions or sick pay, from whose account 1.8 billion have disappeared, they will get them.
But at the cost of the state taking on more debt – so next year's box office will not be missing only $163 billion, but more.
Thus, despite Minister Janota's efforts, the debt will grow faster and more and more interest costs.
The state will need the money to pay for it, and it will no longer be enough to slightly raise VAT or reduce the maternity allowance, as the government did in its anti-idepress (action" package.
To move money in favor of several groups of voters, there will also be five billion to complete highways and railways next year.
These are mainly already tendered and built-up sections that can't be re-designed and possibly discounted.
Preserve at most, which is also not for free.
It means delaying or stopping 30 large structures, the drawing of European money is also at risk, warns the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport Karel Hanzelka.
The CSSD has proposed to solve the loss of money in a sage – to reach into the dividends of CEZ, which the state mostly owns, and from them to pour in the transport fund.
The problem is that the amount of the dividend is never certain, and it is certainly not a bottomless source.
Last year, $18 billion came to the budget from CEZ.
Every year, the dividend pays for the liquidation of environmental damages, which is supplemented by a pension account or serves as a buffer for the forthcoming pension reform.
In addition, this trick, according to EU rules, increases the actual budget deficit to 5.7 percent of GDP.
However, the carnival of the movements do not end there.
Nearly three billion were cut in the budget for various compensation to the victims of communism and crimes, or for litigation expenses, even building savings.
Whether the state will do without this money is uncertain.
It's a lottery.
If we lose any international dispute, we'll have to pay for it anyway, Janota says.
The minister will then have to save money inside the resort or, in the worst case, reach for the government's budget reserve.
One hundred million are also missing for the already run-of-the-mill $2 billion Treasury project to allow online to watch what each authorities are spending.
The first stage will start in January.
If the Chancellor of the Exchequer did not find the money elsewhere, the project would have to be halted, sanctions will come, warns Janota.
Your next smartphone will handle two operating systems
Americans are counting on a mobile phone in the future, on which the user will switch between different operating systems at the touch of a single button.
The unveiled plans sound promising.
Just press one key and from Windows Mobile you will be transferred to Android in a few seconds.
Precisely this option is aimed at the US company VMware, which focuses mainly on the development of virtualization software for computers.
We will allow you to run two user profiles at once on your mobile.
You can switch between them, you can split them into home and business.
Both will work at one and the same time, Srinivas Krishnamurti of VMware suggested in an interview with Computerworld magazine.
It was presented in November last year and was first performed a few days ago.
It will be on the market in 2012.
Virtualization of smartphones is no fiction.
VMware has already successfully demonstrated to journalists a test sample of a smartphone with two operating systems.
It was a modified Nokia N800 with a 128MB RAM memory, on which the Windows Mobile and Android systems were running alongside each other.
The development of new technology for mobile phones is in full swing.
VMware is now working with European and US operators to test smartphone virtualization, and the devices should reach customers during 2012.
The lack of snow in the mountains is bothering the hoteliers
The bare slopes don't just worry about the Krkonoše toilers.
The lack of snow discourages people from ordering ski stays in hotels and boarding houses.
That's why in the Giant Mountains, you can still get available rooms for all winter dates, including Christmas and New Year's Eve.
Attendance on our website is great.
People are going through offers, surveying prices, but so far they are afraid to order in a binding way.
And if they're calling to us, they immediately ask if we think this year's Christmas will be in the snow or on the mud," said the operator of the information portal Spindl.Info Martin Jandura.
Those who want a New Year's Eve stay in Spindleruv Mlyn exactly to their liking should not hesitate to order.
Those who prefer to save money and the quality of accommodation is second to none, they can still try to wait a few days.
Spindleruv hoteliers have so far offered mostly weekly stays on New Year's Eve.
I think they'll try to turn them in for a while, but then they, too, will give up and go for a shorter time.
And then the available rooms will be dwindling quickly," Jandura estimated.
Free beds in all winter dates are still offered by the Ingtours travel agency in Vrchlabí.
What we're most interested in is the Christmas week we're now interested in, which isn't sold out yet.
Even half of the seats in our offer remain free.
That's why we've already prepared some cheaper Christmas stays at the last minute," said Ingtoursu director Petr Schiefert.
New Year's Eve in the Giant Mountains can still be offered by the Vrchlabí travel agency as well, but there are fewer vacancies.
The first fortnight in February also goes well, with the remaining winter dates sold on average.
This year, interest in winter stays is negatively affected by the fact that there is still no snow in the Giant Mountains.
People are waiting to see if he'll think.
No one wants to spend the end of the year in the mountains without snow.
If the slopes are snowy during the week, Christmas will also be sold out," Schiefert says.
On the contrary, it is a little better than last year to occupy the rooms of the Horizont Hotel in Pec pod Snezkou.
We're about five percent better.
On New Year's Eve and for Christmas we have the last few places.
There is great interest in the Polish holidays in January and February is also selling well," said the director of the best kilky hotel, Karel Rada.
Eighty percent of New Year's Eve stays are also booked by the Omnia Hotel at the central parking lot in Janske Lázně.
On the other hand, half of the beds left in the latest Janskolázeň hotel at Christmas.
We were pleasantly surprised by January this year, which we are already booked at this point about sixty per cent.
February is a bit weaker so far, but as soon as the snow falls, interest in stays in the Giant Mountains will definitely rise even further, said the director of the Omnia Hotel, Erik Sporysch.
On a larger snowfall, however, the Krkonoše hoteliers have to let go of their appetite.
It's to be colder on Thursday, if there's any precipitation, it should be snowy on the mountains.
But then the warming is to come again, Jiří Jakubský informed the Hradec workplace of the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute.
USA: Repeat is the mother of wisdom
It is almost comical with what schoolboy's diligence Barack Obama, the president with the reputation of the smartest, is reiterating in the Afghan question the strategy of his predecessor, whom he himself considered the stupidest.
When he finally sweated out his longed-list Afghan doctrine, it turned out that he had copied it over a copycat from Bush's Iraqi script three years ago.
Not only does he use phrase "as he in Iraq" the verbal phrase several times in the text itself, but he did not hesitate to even use the name of the Bush Declaration of January 2007 as the name of his own declaration: "The New Way Forward."
At the same time, he himself criticized Bush's idea three years ago to send fresh military reinforcements to Iraq plagued by the civil war as "irresponsible and in his aftermath of a catastrophic decision."
But the months followed showed that Bush's strategy, based on the recommendations of the field commanders, was the only one possible and highly successful enough that Iraq is not mentioned at all in the intelligence sessions today.
Bush's reputation was unfulfed, but objectively left his successor a much more glaring initial situation than could be expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama hopes for a miracle to be repeated.
He was again asked to increase the military contingent by the field commanders, in particular the commander-in-chief of the Afghan operation, General Stanley McCristal, who even harshly criticized the reluctant White House shooters, despite subordinating custom.
He asked 40,000 men to break the situation for the better.
The president hesitated for three months, but he didn't get any better, so at least he cheated the general for 10,000 soldiers.
He was able to wrestle the promise of another 5,000 from Europe, although he had originally envisaged at least 10.
The most problematic of Obama's entire strategy seems to be his intention to start withdrawing troops from Afghanistan in as little as 18 months and end this process within three years. The entire Obama doctrine raises more questions than it gives answers.
Many doubt that the half-hearted increase will bear the same fruit as the advance in Iraq.
Despite the fratricidal wars of recent years, Iraqi society is relatively well organized, with its leaders honoring the bargain.
The Afghan situation is characterised by the opposite symptom - no one can be relied upon and no agreements are respected.
They are poorly under these conditions prepared by Afghan security forces accustomed to changing the master in every day, depending on how it suits them.
Political institutions, even if formally established, will remain only a Potemkin village, beyond which patriarchal tribal relations will continue to flourish.
The balancing of the interests of different ethnic groups is unusually complex, given the lack of precariousness of circumstances that are even more complicated by Pakistani and Iranian influences.
Even building a "accessor state," which is a minimalist goal of the operation, doesn't seem very real.
The time horizon of Obama's strategy is puzzled by his voluntarism.
Over the past eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only worsened and is now on the brink of an explosion.
To believe that the soldiers sent to the turmoil of war for the purpose of "granting home" will cause a miracle done here, only a truly romantic soul, actually untouched, can be done.
Politically, the setting of the date of troop withdrawal is sheer irresponsible, as the Taliban will see this as an indirect admission of American defeat.
The latest NATO summit showed that Europeans' willingness to participate in combat operations in Afghanistan is curt.
European politicians do not know how, nor do they want to explain to their voters how the security of Germany or Italy is related to the war in the foothills of the Hindu Kush.
Another factor capable of radically intervening in the situation is the development of events surrounding Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and the intensified sanctions do not affect the Iranians, the question of arouses to the United States is drawn to the question of not attempting to solve the problem by military force.
It will need to be answered just as Obama says America will proceed with the victorious withdrawal from Afghanistan.
But any such solution will also mark a dramatic turnaround in the Afghan situation.
The only plaster for Barack Obama is that there are three years left in the presidential election, and so there is still enough time to come up with another strategy if this proves to be a total flop.
Goldman Sachs executives no longer get cash rewards
Senior executives at US Bank Goldman Sachs will not receive cash rewards this year.
This was announced by a firm that responds to harsh criticism of its payroll practices.
Instead of money, the group of 30 leading executives will receive shares that can be sold in five years at the earliest.
In addition, the shares can be taken away from managers if they take excessive risks.
Goldman Sachs is thus at the forefront of efforts to combine Wall Street rewards with long-term performance, according to Reuters.
I think Wall Street is well aware of the broader direction it needs to take, said former JPMorgan investment banker Douglas Elliott.
The problem is in the details, he added.
Goldman Sachs came under criticism after setting aside nearly $17 billion (nearly $300 billion) in rewards for the first three quarters of this year.
The total remuneration in the company for this year, according to Reuters, is likely to exceed $20 billion despite the measure announced today.
High rewards in the banking sector have become a hot political issue in a number of countries with the rise in the financial crisis.
Britain announced on Wednesday that it intends to pay more than £25,000 (roughly $712,000) bonuses to be a one-time tax-free.
Similar steps are being prepared by France.
This year, women won the Nobel Prize in all fields except physics
The record five women in Stockholm today took over from the hands of King Carl XVI of Sweden. Gustafa of this year's Nobel Prize in the professional categories and for literature.
Among them were the four female scientists, the Romanian-born German-born German writer Herta Müller.
The Nobel Prize in Medicine was awarded to two American biologists Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, along with their compatriot Jack Szostak for research in the field of chromosomes.
The chemistry prize went to the Israelis Ada Jonath, along with the Americans Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz, for clarifying the structure and functions of the ribosomes.
The last laureate was awarded to the Nobel Prize in Economics, which was won by American Elinor Ostrom and her compatriot Oliver Williamson for economic administration analysis.
The only professional category to do without the holder this year was physics.
This award was won today by scientists Charles Kao for the Fibre Optical Fitter Research and George Smith with Willard Boyle for the Invention of the CCD chip, which is the basis for all digital cameras, fax machines, or astronomical telescopes.
Each award winner received a degree, a Nobel Medal and a certificate of financial reward.
This amounts to ten million Swedish kronor (roughly $25 million) for each category.
If there are more honorees in each of them, they share the reward between them.
The most traditionally awaited Nobel Peace Prize was received earlier this afternoon in Oslo, Norway, by US President Barack Obama.
In his speech, he acknowledged the controversy of his awards, as he is only at the beginning of his career and, moreover, heads the country that leads two wars - in Iraq and Afghanistan.
But he added in his policy defense that wars are in some situation necessary to fight for peace, even if the price is high for it.
Minister Janota is considering resigning. Klaus invited him to the Castle
On Friday morning, President Václav Klaus will receive Finance Minister Eduardo Janota, who is considering staying in the government because he disagrees with the state budget shape for next year, as approved by the Chamber of Deputies on Wednesday.
It is expected that the budget and perhaps even Janot's stay in the cabinet will be the topics of their meeting on Friday.
The budget is also criticized by Klaus.
According to him, he has too high a deficit, which further exacerbates the public-cash crisis.
The meeting was reported by the president's spokesman, Radim Ochvat.
Janota wants to discuss his continued presence in office with Prime Minister Jan Fischer on Monday.
Under the Budget Act, which will now be given to Klaus for signing, the Czech Republic should manage a deficit of 163 billion crowns.
But the House on Wednesday approved the left's proposals to move money, raising money for salaries for civil servants, to run social services, and direct payments to farmers.
The government blamed the Social Democrat's proposals for covertly increasing the budget deficit.
A sharp domestic political dispute arose between the left on one and the government, Klaus and the right, on the other, over the reason, which is causing a question mark over Fischer's further action of Fischer's clerical cabinet, which was agreed to form in the spring by the ODS, the ČSSD and the Green Party.
Critics argue that the budget as adopted by the House is essentially destroying the package of austerity measures that Fischer's government passed in the fall, which it says is to stop the state's debt.
Klaus, who may or may not sign the state budget bill, said at today's discussion breakfast with businessmen that politicians have been neglecting for a long time the "serious problem" of the "unsustainable deficit" of public finances.
Today, he says, he no longer has a good solution.
Only a strong government could make improvements, and could also be relying on a broader consensus among political parties, the president says.
ODS President Mirek Topolánek said the budget was terrifying and the government should consider continuing to exist.
ODS Vice-President Petr Nečas told ČTK that the concept of a clerical cabinet with the support of the ČSSD, ODS and the Greens clearly no longer works.
In response, Prime Minister Fischer called such words "strong statements."
The head of the ČSSD, Jiří Paroubek, responded to Topolánek by saying that the deficit of the budget, which the former Topolánek government prepared for this year, and which will exceed 200 billion crowns, is frightening.
Already on Wednesday, the ČSSD called the approval of the state budget for next year a success.
Satisfied were also the people.
Mandela was played by Morgan Freeman in Clint Eastwood's new film
South Africans claim that the new Hollywood film Invictus: Undefeated tells the world a lot about the country, its fights and victories, despite some critics, that the lead roles are played by American actors.
The story tells of sports, racial conditions and Nelson Mandela.
The tireless fighter against the racist apartheid regime in South Africa and its first black president, Nelson Mandela, is represented in his life story by Oscar-winning American actor Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said the 91-year-old Mandela asked him if he could portray him in Eastwood's film.
Another important role in it is Matt Damon.
I told him, 'If I play you, I'll have to have access to you.
The 72-year-old actor, who won the award for his role in Eastwood's dramatism from the boxing environment of the Million Dollar Baby boxing, has already portrayed, for example, the leader of the slawbo-relieb movement, which eventually became a slave, a fictional US president, and even a god in Divine Evan, but rarely someone who still lives and is as important to many people as Mandela.
The former South African statesman was 27 years in prison for his active work for ending apartheid in South Africa.
He was released in 1990 and then became president of the country for four years.
He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1993.
Invictus is the Latin word for the undefeated and is the title of a poem by the English author William Ernest Henley, published in 1875.
The challenge was to talk like him
The film is a true story about how Nelson Mandela joined forces with the captain of the South African rugby team, Francois Pienaar, to help unite the country. President-elect Mandela knows that his nation remains racially and economically divided after apartheid.
He believes he can bring his people together through sport, so he decides to unify rugby players who are outsiders on a global scale.
The South African team will eventually advance to the 1995 World Cup.
Freeman worked for several years to get the story of Mandela on the screen.
I had no other goal but to play this role in bringing it as much to the reality as possible, Freeman said.
The biggest challenge, of course, was to speak like him.
The actor said that if he and the world politician were from the same area, he would have tried to meet Mandela, dine with him, be backstage before his speech.
The most important thing was that he wanted to shake Mandela's hand.
I found that when I squeeze your hand, I take over your energy, it's transmitted, and I felt like I knew how you were feeling, he said.
It's important for me to try to become a different person.
Matt Damon is portrayed in François Pienaar's film, the captain of the national rugby team, which was dominated by white players.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for a role in the hard world of rugby.
The big surprise for him in the end was when he first met Pienaar at his house.
I remember ringing the doorbell, he opened the door for me, and the first thing I told François Pia Piaesar in my life was, 'I look much bigger in the film'.
Despite the distinct differences in the actors' characters compared to their actual drafts under Eastwood, Invictus won: Undefeated positive reviews, and there is talk of Oscar ambitions.
The film critic of the Daily Variety, Todd McCarthy, summarized his review in the words: "It was a very good story, a very well-made film."
In film reviews on rottentomatoes.com, Invictus received 76 percent of positive reviews.
The secret of the glow over Norway deciphered: Russians test a racket
Above Norway it was possible to observe a special light effect of unknown origin.
The Russian Defense Ministry only admitted yesterday that it had tested an intercontinental ballistic missile near the Norwegian border.
But the launch was unsuccessful again, and the missile referred to as the "Bulava" that was originally intended to be the pride of the Russian military is slowly becoming the black moth of Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
His repeated presence in the missile's tests did not have the proper effect on the success of the test flights.
The Bulava did not take off at most or was damaged in the air.
In the Russian newspapers, "The Bulava" is already referred to as "a loft that doesn't fly."
A rocket that doesn't fly but shines
This in the ranking of the 13th attempt was at first normal.
It was only at the end of the flight that the apparatus was again in technical damage.
Apparently, the engine exploded in the third stage of the rocket.
This time, "The Battleface" took off from the atomic submarine Dmitry Donsky, which was floating under the White Sea.
This type of rocket allows for the launch of a craft that is both in motion and submerged.
It is therefore likely that the mysterious light over Norway caused by an unspecified flying object was indeed a broken "Bulava."
Indeed, the Norwegians had not doubted from the first moment that it was a Russian missile.
The generals are fighting back this time, arguing that there is no clear talk of failure.
The first two stages of the rocket lasted and the accident affected the third.
In previous cases, the engines broke down in the first stage.
Although there was not a single trial start completely without a mistake, the Defense Ministry's management considers only six of the thirteen to be unsuccessful.
As a result, the nearly 50% success rate is filled with optimism by the generals, and so he still maintains that "Bulava" will one day fly without any problems and that it will even carry up to ten hypersonic nuclear units with a maximum total weight of 1.15 tonnes.
The legendary Fetisov signed a one-year contract at CSKA Moscow at the age of 51.
The legendary defender Vyacheslav Fetisov will once again appear in a professional hockey match at the age of 51.
The former world champion, Olympic champion and Stanley Cup champion will help out in the pitfalls of his CSKA Moscow team and will appear to be in the KHL's draw against St. Petersburg in Friday's KHL match.
Fetisov, who finished his career at the age of 40 in 1998, is currently the president of CSKA.
After Denis Kuljash got injured, we urgently need another defender.
Fetisov trains regularly and has agreed to help the team.
We just need to finish some formal requirements, the AP quoted the coach of Moscow club Sergei Neminov as saying.
It is not yet clear whether the famous hockey player's comeback will only cover one game.
I think Fetisov is one of those who can boost the spirit of the other players, said Germanov.
Fetisov will thus become the oldest Russian professional hockey player in the event of a return to the ice, according to AP.
In the NHL, he played the entire season for Hartford, legendary forward Gordie Howe, scoring 15 goals and 26 assists.
The oldest of the famous five Fetisov, Kasatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov is one of the best and most successful hockey players in history.
In the Soviet Union, he won two Olympic gold medals, seven World Championship titles, and triumphed at the Canada Cup and the Junior World Championships.
In the second part of his career, he also collected successes in the NHL, where he lifted the Stanley Cup twice in a Detroit uniform.
He has been a member of the Hockey Hall of Fame since 2001.
Hyundai complied with the union. Cancels all overtime
The management of the Nošovice automaker Hyundai has agreed with the unions to abolish all overtime.
It was because of the often mandated overtime that the unions declared a strike emergency on Monday.
This was confirmed by Hyundai spokesman Petr Vaněk.
However, the management wants to agree with the union at one more time on this year's shift.
We cannot resign ourselves to our production plan, that is essential, so voluntary overtime was proposed on Saturday 19 December with two shifts, said Vanek.
Seven.cz reported that the company of employees who work Saturday's shift offered a bonus of CZK 400.
This will be given back to people for a working Saturday, November 28.
According to Vanek, the company decided to change the way employees were motivated for the proposed overtime.
Either they get paid extra for overtime or they can take extra leave on December 28th, and thus extend their Christmas holidays by a day, Vaněk said.
In addition, all Saturday shift employees will receive a fare and lunch.
Given that overtime was the most prolific and pressing point in terms of comments and complaints from the trade unionists, as well as the protesting staff who spontaneously stopped production last week, the management decided yesterday afternoon to cancel all overtime for the month of December with immediate effect, Vaněk said.
Until last week, the automaker's employees were forced to work two more hours of overtime work virtually every day after an eight-hour shift.
After signing the agreement, the unions will call off the strike alert
Further talks between the management of the car and the trade unionists are scheduled to take place on Friday morning.
The head of the union, Petr Kuchař, said on Wednesday that if they agree to meet the requirements and sign a joint document, they would be ready to cancel the strike alert.
The situation at the car company escalated last week on Wednesday, when some 400 employees spontaneously went on strike overnight terms.
They also protested against poor pay conditions and alleged bullying.
Management countered that overtime employees had to do overtime to meet the requirements for the supply of cars.
In their strike call for an emergency on Monday, the union also called for the staff who discontinued production to be sanctioned by any sanctions.
In the area of overtime, the company is required to minimise the company's overtime work.
In addition, they want to pay a reward of CZK 5,000 for it this year.
Nošovická automaker Hyundai now employs 2,000 people.
The company started production production last November.
By this September, it had produced some 80,000 cars, with its current production capacity of 200,000 cars per year.
Czech Discovery: a substance that also takes up the 'tursed' HIV viruses
A team of Czech and German scientists is testing new compounds that can slow down the spread of the HIV virus in the body.
The main advantage of the improved substance is that it also works for viruses that have already obtained immunity from the drugs.
This fact outweighs in some cases that the compound does not feel as strong as some of the drugs already available.
AIDS cannot yet be cured.
However, patients can be significantly prolonged by a mixture of drugs that prevent the multiplication of HIV from multiplying in the body.
However, their use is accompanied by a number of side effects.
Moreover, the incomplete suppression of the virus's propagation results in the development of so-called resistant viruses, against which the drugs are no longer inactive.
The work of experts from the three institutes of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, from the University of Chemistry in Prague and the University of Heidelberg opens the way to deal with the resistance of the virus.
They demonstrated that substances called methocarborates act on a protein responsible for multiplying the HIV virus.
Metalocarborates are boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt compounds.
These compounds block the spread of the virus differently than all the drugs used today, and therefore can overcome the problem of resistance.
In their work, scientists come up with new 'enhancements' compounds prepared based on the knowledge of the molecular mechanism of their binding to viral protein.
Metalocarkorkhates have a unique three-dimensional structure: two polyheddron cages made up of the atoms of the boron, hydrogen and carbon are connected by a metal atom, in this case cobalt.
Treacherous and resistant virus
HIV protease is a HIV prote protein that is essential for the life cycle of the virus.
Without HIV protease caused by the fission of HIV, there would not have been mature infectious viral particles.
When we stop HIV protease, we also stop the spread of the virus in the patient's body, the scientists explain in a press release issued by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic.
In a paper published in the scientific journal Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, scientists describe a series of compounds in which two pairs of cages (see table) are linked by a short organic chain, which is further systematically altered.
A little weaker but more reliable
The effect of this series of HIV protease agents was tested in the test tube and also against its resistant (resistant) variants obtained from HIV-infected patients.
The effect of methocarborates on the normal enzyme variant is not as powerful as for clinically used drugs, but it does not lose its effect for resistant options against which the drugs used are often ineffective.
The unique mechanism of action and also their other properties such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of further chemical treatment thus make metocarborates interesting compounds for further research towards the design of effective HIV drugs, renounced Pavlína Řezáčová, head of the Institute of Structural Biology of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry and the Institute of Molecular Genetics of the Academy of Sciences.
An argument over the budget. ODS joked into Fischer, he fights back
The head of the ODS, Mirek Topolánek, called the approved budget for next year "scarious" and the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should consider continuing to exist.
The ODS comments were described by the Prime Minister as strong statements.
He says he's taking his time to analyze.
ODS Vice-President Petr Nečas said the concept of a clerical cabinet with the support of the ČSSD, ODS and the Green Party clearly no longer works.
According to Nečas, the Prime Minister must decide whether he intends to rely in the House on a minority to fight against a growing deficit or care to remain in office with the help of the parliamentary left.
The ODS and social democracy approach to the issue of public deficits is diametrically opposed, Nečas pointed out.
The House on Wednesday adopted the 2010 budget, but with left-wing amendments worth more than 12 billion crowns.
The House has raised money for the salaries of civil servants, the operation of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government's complaint to the Social Democrat proposals was that they were covertly increasing the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic should manage a deficit of 163 billion crowns.
The ODS left the chamber before the vote, granting the government's wish that even the amended budget is a less bad option than a budget makeshift.
Disappointment and futility
Finance Minister Eduard Janota spoke of disappointment and frustration, Prime Minister Jan Fischer said the government would evaluate the current situation.
Nečas is convinced that if Janota were to threaten to seriously resign from office if the amendments were adopted, the situation might have looked different.
According to Czech Television, Janota made an appointment for the prime minister for the government on Monday.
He indicated that he was considering staying in office again.
This is due to his disappointment with the budget negotiations.
If Fischer speaks for another fight with the budget deficit, the GOP nominees, which pushed through the budget changes in the budget, have nothing to do in the government, according to Nečas.
The Prime Minister should also make it clear that he will resign if the House passes further laws to increase the deficit, such as those relating to sick leave, pensions, or an amendment to the Public Servants Act.
Topolánek: ODS nominees not guilty
It is a matter for Prime Minister Fischer and the whole government.
The ODS nominees did nothing wrong, Topolánek stressed in a US text message.
He recalled that in several ministries there were people in the deputy positions who voted against the budget.
Nečas stressed that if Fischer decides to resign to the principle of combating the public deficit, "it is perfectly logical and fair that it will lean on the left-wing majority that is currently in the House."
But then, he said, he could not count on the support and tolerance of the Civic Democrats.
I have not thought about it, and when it is up to it, I will address it, Defence Minister Martin Barták, who was nominated to the government by the Civic Democrats, told reporters in the House.
Prime Minister Fischer flew to Brussels for a meeting of the European Council in the afternoon.
At the request of the Prime Minister, the ODS backed down
At the same time, Nečas stressed that the ODS would probably vote in the House on Wednesday against the amended budget if the prime minister did not explicitly ask the members of the Civic Democrats to allow the adoption of the budget.
We do not feel like orphans, we are not young children, he then responded to the question of whether the ODS was burdened by the absence of the party's president in parliament and the Czech Republic in the political negotiations on the budget.
I didn't notice my voice missing.
Even as I gave up my mandate, I knew that in the months to come it would be primarily about the Bolshevisation of the House and the destruction of all the positive, Topolánek himself responded.
Under the new ČD order, fewer trains will travel for almost the same fare
Czech Railways will cancel or restrict some of the less busy fast trains and locals from 13 December, while other connections will be strengthened.
The overall transport scale will be reduced by two percent from the date of the new timetable compared to today.
Most fares, including basic and customer fares, will not change.
For example, the residents of Ostrava will get more possibilities of connection to the capital, the railways will add one pendolino set to this line.
The speeding, on the other hand, will stop going to Bratislava.
Fewer fast trains will also depart on the line Praha - Písek - České Budějovice, and the direct connections Prague - Letohrad will be substantially reduced.
Of the regions, the railways plan the biggest reduction in transport in the Hradec Králové Region, by a total of eight percent, while the increase can be enjoyed by Prague and the surrounding area.
Two night trains on the Prague - Tábor - České Budějovice route and the operation of several fast trains on the line Praha - Písek - České Budějovice are also cancelled only to some days of the week.
The biggest changes include the introduction of a new direct line from Milovice to Prague, today Milovické must transfer in Lysá nad Labem.
It is the fifteenth line of the Esko suburban system, its opening is possible thanks to the completion of the electrification of the line from Lysá nad Labem to Milovice.
Long-distance services to the capital will end at the destination station Prague Main Station.
ČD will introduce more SC Pendolino connections between Prague and Ostrava and trains to Šumperk/Jeseneník will run at two-hour intervals.
Pendolino to Bratislava will no longer be taken by passengers from 13 December.
This year's regional rail bill: 200 million more
Fast trains are ordered and paid by the Ministry of Transport, in total to pay the so-called provable losses to the railways next year, as it did this year. The locomotives are ordered by the county, with a total of eight billion crowns for them next year, with the state contributing less than three billion to the regions.
This year, regional trains are 200 million more expensive.
For locals and fast trains, the tracks have a newly concluded 10-year contract, so far the contract has always been for one year.
The tracks praise the system, which is why they did not seem to have reached the price hike for the vast majority of tickets.
Changes will only take place for one-day ČD Net network tickets and cheap eLiška internet tickets.
For passengers without a customer card, the price of ČD Net will increase from CZK 450 to CZK 600.
The price of eLiška will be newly based on the distance travelled, so far it has been uniform for the journey between any regional cities and amounted to 160 crowns.
Philippine gunmen still hold over 50 people, Children released
Armed militants kidnapped 75 people in the south of the Philippines today, including several primary school pupils and their teachers.
This was reported by AFP, which initially reported only 65 abductees.
All 17 detained children were released after eight hours, including one teacher.
The abduction took place in the province of Agusan del Sur.
Approximately 19 gunmen are said to be using the hostages as a living shield as fleeing police.
Local negotiators are now trying to agree to issue the remaining hostages.
According to AFP, the militants belong to the New People's Army (NPA), which is the armed arm of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to the AP, police initially chased the kidnapper for the violence that required the settling of scores between the local family's clans.
In the south of the Philippines in the province of Maguindanao, martial law has been declared due to the recent massacre in which 57 people were killed.
Among the victims of the November 23Ning massacre related to the governor's election were 30 journalists.
On suspicion of involvement in the massacre, the governor of this southern Philippine province and his father, Andal Ampatuan, the Patriarch of the influential family of the Ampatuan family, were arrested.
The island of Mindanao is also active in Muslim separatists.
But they resumed peace talks with the Philippine government on Tuesday.
The story of South Africa affects everyone, says Morgan Freeman, aka Mandela
In the coming days, Clint Eastwood's new Hollywood film, Invictus (official Czech, is Invictus: The Undefeated), which chronicles part of the life story of former South African President Nelson Mandela, is coming to theaters.
The role of the world-famous anti-apartheid fighter was played by Morgan Freeman, whom he said he chose Mandela for his portrayal years ago.
The men's supporting roles of the legendary South African rugby champion Francois Pienaar was played by Matt Damon.
With the release of the film, they arise from the feedback from critics and the public
Nelson Mandela
The full name Nelson Rolihlalova Mandela was born in the 18th. July 1918 in the South African Mvez.
He received the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought in 1988, and the Nobel Peace Prize in 1993.
He was president of South Africa from 1994 to 1999.
high expectations, as they come to the public at a time when preparations for the World Cup are both culminating in South Africa, but are also being shaken by the media's worrying news of rising racial hatred and discrimination against the population by the black ruling majority.
According to the AP news agency, the feedback on the new film in South Africa has been mostly positive for the time being, despite numerous reservations about the casting of the main roles by "professional" Hollywood stars.
Nevertheless, Morgan Freeman says he is proud of the new film.
I've been dreaming about the role for years and preparing well for it.
I have also met Nelson Mandela in person many times to - as they say - to draw his energy, he said in an interview after the film's premiere in Los Angeles.
I think it's a good thing to remind the film of Mandela's personality and message.
It is the story of South Africa, but it concerns every person, he added.
In the national team jersey rugby
Based on a book draft by British writer John Carinto, with the loosely translated title In the role of the Enemy: Nelson Mandela and the play that gave rise to the nation, portraying a South African human rights activist during his first presidential term.
So during the film, Morgan Freeman has been trying to coalesce two racial groups and, for years, mutually exclusive groups of the population, and as in 1995 Nelson Mandela, he is also entering the World Cup pitch in South Africa's national rugby jersey.
For entering the turf in a jersey that is seen in South Africa almost as something sacred, Mandela received a big ovation from a predominantly white audience fourteen years ago and earned the recognition of the white population.
The Socceroague Championship may be able to bring people back into one nation, said rugby player Chester Williams, who was the only "black" in the national team in 1995.
Whether the tense situation in South Africa will only become clear.
But White South Africans are skeptical, as rugby fan Christopher Dawson, who fled to Britain from the country, revealed in a recent interview with the LN.
The championship will begin on 11. June 2010.
The transformer burns in Lounsk for tens of millions of crowns
The fire engulfed the transformer of the company Čeps in the morning in a substation at the village of Výškov na Lounsku.
The fire is hitting six units, according to the spokesman for the Ústí Regional Fire Department, Lukáš Marvana.
Originally, firefighters wanted to let the transformer burn out, but later reconsider the view and the fire was re-examined by a mixture of water, foam and special extinguishing substances.
The cause was a technical fault, an internal short circuit of the transformer.
No one was injured, the crash, according to company spokeswoman Pavla Mandátová, does not threaten the safe operation of the transmission system.
The damage is estimated at several tens of millions of crowns, it will be calculated precisely after the fire is over.
The destroyed transformer will need to be replaced by a new one, according to Mandate.
Nothing like this has happened in ten years of the company's tenure, defects of this type are rare, she added.
According to a spokesperson for ČEZ for northern Bohemia, Soni Holinger Hendrychová, the operation of households, authorities and companies were not affected by the fire in the transformer station.
A.s. It works in the Czech Republic as the exclusive operator of the transmission system, the power lines 400 kV and 220 kV.
It maintains, restores and develops 39 substations with 67 transformers converters converting electricity from the transmission to the distribution system and the 4339-kilometre line route.
Jančura files criminal charges for defamation against three ČSSD governors
Student Agency owner Radim Jančura will file a criminal complaint for defamation today against three social-democratic governors.
This was to Michal Hašek from the South Moravian Region, Radko Martínek from the Pardubice Region and the Governor of the Olomouc Region, Martin Tesařík.
Jančura made the announcement in Twenty Minutes to Radiožurnál.
The lawsuit is linked to the firm's efforts to operate regional train services in some regions.
However, all regions eventually signed long-term contracts with Czech Railways.
All three governors are attacking us and talking about choosing raisins, yet we have only made an offer for what they wanted.
He claims that we are more expensive than Czech Railways, which is not true, because we know the prices of Czech Railways that were closed last week.
So we have no choice but to defend ourselves.
It is for defamation against Student Agency, he told Radiožurnálu Jančura.
At the same time, he said he had evidence from all the regions that they had not taken action in accordance with European law.
It is therefore preparing a call for the European Commission.
Hasek sees the filing of the criminal complaint as a further continuation of Mr Jančura's media show, which serves as an unpaid advertisement for his company and his own.
I am, of course, prepared to defend the good name of my region and mine, and to the same, I will also challenge the other generals.
I expect that it will become clear on this occasion that it is Mr Jančura who is manipulating the public about regional rail transport and using false and false arguments, Hasek said.
Jančura announced last week that he would invest several million crowns in advertising to be warned about the disadvantageous move by the regions.
He told Radiožurnálu that he would suspend the campaign after Christmas and continue it after the New Year.
He specified that the campaign would be conducted against corruption as such.
The campaign was launched by Jančura after the regions agreed to operate regional railway connections with Czech Railways and did not tender for the order of around CZK 150 billion.
According to Jančura, such conduct is against the law and contrary to the opinion of the European Court of Justice.
Due to the criticism of train transport in the regions, Jančura was already threatened by the ČSSD MP.
The only threat was that if we didn't stop, we could lose the bus licenses.
He introduced himself as a ČSSD MP, I know who the gentleman is, I will not say his name, he told Radiožurnálu Jančura today.
Pneumococcal vaccination will be free and optional
Vaccination against pneumococci will be demolished from January by established customs.
It is to be the first for families to be free and optional at the same time.
But there are already voices that mandatory vaccination would be more effective.
Preparations for the introduction of free pneumococcal vaccination are at the height.
The drug institute already sets the maximum prices for vaccines paid for by health insurance companies.
Experts are also already clear about the vaccination course.
New vaccination
Free vaccines for August children
From January, children born on August 2 last year and later can be vaccinated against pneumococci free of charge on August 2 last year and later.
The condition is that they have not yet received a single dose of vaccination.
Whoever started vaccinating last year or earlier must also pay for another booing.
The first dose of vaccination must be given between the age of the child and the child.
Last year, a quarter of families voluntarily vaccinated their children against pneumococci.
At the same time, the parents paid CZK 1,600 for one or more benefit.
When vaccinating the youngest children, four doses are needed.
Overall, experts estimate that health insurance companies spend CZK 300 to 450,000 a year on vaccination benefits.
But it will save on the treatment that children would need without vaccination.
So far, the state has given roughly 500,000 a year for all child-wide vaccinations.
The parched vaccination was introduced by the so-called Janot package.
Pneumococcus causes inflammation of the middle ear, but also severe infections including meningitis and blood poisoning.
For pneumococcal infections, up to 28 children under 10 will die in our hospital survey in a year.
In addition to the Czech Republic, they introduced paid-for-grade children's pneumococcal vaccination in about 40 countries.
Will vaccination be mandatory?
At the same time, however, there are suggestions that this vaccination could be made compulsory in the future.
From January, it is to be reimbursed by insurance companies and optional.
The mandatory vaccination was better, suggested, for example, the head of the civic association Nahlas, Rudolf Kalovský.
His association has long promoted pneumococcal vaccines.
The experts at the international conference, which our association participated, were not entirely satisfied with the fact that we had voluntary vaccinations.
It's not ideal.
On the other hand, we are pleased that at least this has been passed.
I think that's the way we have to take now, Kalovský said.
But the Ministry of Health does not want to change the vaccination process against pneumocles.
We are not considering this at the moment, said his spokesman, Vlastimil Sršeň.
Voluntary vaccination has its drawbacks, doctors say
The chairman of the Professional Society of Practical Children's Physicians's Society, Hana Cabrnoch, acknowledges that she has her disadvantages in voluntary vaccination.
If all children were vaccinated, a reduction in the number of booing could be considered "In a situation where this vaccine costs such a large amount, we quite understand the political decision that the vaccination was triggered as voluntary," says Cabrnoch.
Experts expect to have their infants vaccinated against pneumococci from next year by more than 80 percent of new parents.
Vaccination against pneumococcus is also groundbreaking in that it is the first across-the-board vaccination of children to be covered by health insurance companies, not by the state.
Insurance companies should spend money on prevention, saving on further treatment, explains Cabrnoch.
Doctors will have to buy the fabrics themselves
But this is linked to the concerns of general practitioners of children relating to the purchase of vaccines.
According to the original intention, the vaccines were to be purchased by insurance companies, and doctors would receive them in the same way that the state supplies them with substances for other vaccinations.
But some MPs feared that this would allow insurance companies to "get money out of health insurance."
Doctors will therefore have to buy the substances and wait for the insurance companies to reimburse them.
According to estimates, individual practitioner children's practitioners will invest 40,000 a month in vaccines, a significant sum.
It won't be easy at all, says Cabrnoch.
Son of American artist 'stolen at museum'
The son of renowned American creator of the fantastics, Frank Frazetta, has been charged with attempting to rob the $20 million (£12 million) paintings from his father's museum.
Police in Pennsylvania said Alfonso Frank Frazetta was caught loading 90 paintings into his vehicle and trailer.
Appointed Mr. Frazetta and the other man used a backhoe to break into the museum in the Poconco Mountains region.
Mr. Frazetta Sr., aged 81, became famous for creating the characters of Barbara Conan and Tarzan.
At the time of this, the artist was in Florida, as reported by the Associated Press.
AP quoted an unnamed police official as saying that Mr. Frazetta Jr. could have been motivated to act by prolonged family disputes.
In front of the police, Mr. Frazetta, the younger sworn statement, the age of 52, that he had done so at the behest of his father, "to get to the museum in any possible way and move the paintings to the hedgehog," as the agency said.
Mr Frazetta Sr denied granting any such permission, as the Agency said.
Labour resists the planned tax increase
Minithors advocated an increase in taxes and spending cuts announced in the preliminary budget report against criticism from the opposition, business and trade unions.
As Alistair Darling said, the Tories "swasted" the possibility of showing that they were serious about postponing the decision to reduce the deficit until after the election.
The chancellor, too, came under fire for the disability of low- and middle-income workers.
According to his proposal, this is mainly an increase of 0.5% in social insurance and a 1% modification of public payments since 2011.
Distrameness about social insurance
The unions protested that low-income workers had been punished for a recession that they had not brought to their fault and warned in advance of "problems."
Social insurance is increasing - an increase of around £3 trillion a year - outraged the community of entrepreneurs who said it was an employment tax while a focus on the recovery of the economy.
This increase, limited to these incomes of more than £2000 a year, will affect around 10 million workers.
KEY PBR BODY
Social insurance to increase by an additional 0.5% from April 2011
The economic situation will deteriorate more than expected by 4.75% this year
New taxation of 50% of bankers' bonuses
Increase in companies' tax for depreciation at small firms
Tax reduction for electric cars and wind farms
Increasing the assessment of pensions by 2.5
According to an estimate by the state administration, some of the £3,500 income will be reduced by £90 per year and some of the £400 income will be reduced by £190, while some of the £100,000 revenue will increase by £110.
Ministers announced that their target of halving the deficit by 2013 meant "complex decision-making" but insisted that 60% of the special taxes should account for 5% of the highest-income earners.
Treasury Secretary Stephen Timms denied that the proposed increase in taxes and spending restrictions would be a "drip in the ocean" compared to what would have to be done.
"These are big numbers. This will allow us to halve the deficit, which is absolutely the basic requirement for the next four years," he told the BBC.
Mr Timms said that he believed that the economy should grow at the turn of the year.
But making a forecast for future economic growth - which will affect the volume of the necessary loans and how quickly the deficit will be reduced - must be taken into account after the chancellor has been forced to revise the earlier sums.
In the opinion, he said the downturn in the economy this year was 4.75% - far worse than the 3.5% drop, predicted in April - because the loans were 3 trillion higher than previously estimated.
A missed opportunity'
The Conservatives, who launched a new promotional campaign on Thursday, warning of Labour's "rillal debt crisis," have called the planned £789 trillion loan unbearable over the next six years.
The ministers failed to submit a credible plan, as could be paid for, "cynically" postponed this decision until after the election - which must take place by June 2010.
"They have not imposed anything significant in what would be feasible," said Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond. "They had a chance to do it, but they wasted it."
"All the important announcements will be made after the election if we win them"
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Labour insists that schools, hospitals and police will be protected from future cuts, as opposed to Tory proposals, who would like to reduce the deficit more quickly and to a greater extent.
But the Liberal Democrats argue that the money raised by raising taxes and cutting spending should be used to support spending next year and not to reduce the deficit, arguing that the plans are "built on the sand."
The BBC's political commentator Nick Robinson said of the timing of the message - for example, the aforementioned inflation will increase and there will be an inability to pay for benefits in the next April - that this could lead to an accusation by the chancellor in the election campaign if the money was difficult to recover a year later.
But Labour insists insist on providing special assistance if people need it very much and the situation is revised in September 2010.
Suspicious budget'
Although ministers did not disclose details of the post-companying spending, economists said it was clear that reducing public spending would only be the start of medium-term restrictions.
The respected Institute of Budget Studies reported that the chancellor's figures suggest substantial cuts in many areas, potentially involving transport, higher education and defence in the bud.
"It's really painful so far," said its director, Robert Chote.
"All the important statements will come after the election if we win them," added Roger Bootle, economic adviser to the Deloitte's account revirore.
"That was the report of the suspected preliminary budget. The markets are making it."
FBI conducts investigation at 'American Prisons in Pakistan'
The FBI is conducting an investigation at a prison in Pakistan for five Americans suspected of being linked to extremists.
The men were imprisoned for the attack on a house in Sargode, eastern Punjab province, as reported by the BBC in the American Embassy in Pakistan.
The FBI said it was an investigation into the same men who had been declared missing in their last month at their residence in the US state of Virginia.
The U.S. State Department said it was also about getting information about these men.
Three of them are reported to be originally from Pakistan, one of whom has Egyptian ancestry and the others come from Yemen.
"If they were American citizens, we would be very interested in the conditions under which they were detained and under what circumstances they were staying there," spokesman Ian Kelly said.
FBI spokeswoman Katherine Schweit said the agency had been briefed on the imprisonment and had been in contact with the families of the missing students.
"We are working with the Pakistani authorities to determine their identity and the nature of their actions here and whether they are indeed missing students," she said.
The Pakistani embassy in Washgington said the men were arrested at a house belonging to the uncle of one of them.
It said that the house had always been the focus of local police and that charges had not yet been filed against the arrested men.
Secretary of State Hillry Clinton declined to comment on the arrest, Reuters news agency reported, but said the United States must "work much more harshly with Afghanistan and Pakistan in uncovering the infrastructure of terrorism that is being christened in recruiting the recruitment and training of people."
The disappearance of these five students from their home in N.N. Virginia was announced by their families at the end of November.
Rejecting the amnesty for Iranian abusers.
The situation in respect for human rights in Iran is as bad as in the last 20 years, as the Amnesty International team's report says.
The report details the "morons of torture" in the pre- and after the disputed presidential election in June.
One of the men said he was beaten and burned with cigarettes. Another said he was at risk of being raped.
Iran has denied the above-mentioned criticism of this report on respect for human rights.
Officials have described the criticism as politically motivated.
Thousands were imprisoned in Iran and dozens were killed after the contentious election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, leading to the biggest street dismantling since the Islamic Revolution in 1979.
Dozens of them were remanded in custody, and prosecutors sentenced the last five people to death.
The BBC's correspondent in Tehran, John Leyne, who is now in London, said that earlier in protests by Supreme Leader Ayatolah Ali Khomeini, declared the improperity of some of the methods of torture and banned their implementation at the Karizak Correctional Facility.
But since then, almost no criticism of the legal power has been tolerated, as our correspondent said.
False confession'
Amnesty International cited a report by a 26-year-old computer science student, Ibrahim Methari, who said he had been charged with "working with the Facebook network" and protesting the election results.
"I was often beaten in the face," he said in a statement.
"They burned me with cigarettes under my eyes, on my neck, my head... They threatened me with execution and humiliated me."
After five days, he signed a false confession and was released and left in the street, still bleeding and half unconscious, Amnesty said.
In August, defeated presidential candidate Mehdi Charroubi was detained after the election after the protests and was tortured to death in prison and the others were raped.
Iranian senior civil servants denied the allegations of rape, but admitted that the torture took place.
Amnesty also referred to the case of a former prisoner, who said he had been held in a container with 75 other people for more than eight weeks at the Kahrizak prison.
Amnesty acknowledged that the Iranian parliament and the judiciary had set up committees to investigate the post-election unrest and the government's response, but said that the mandates and powers of the authorities had been unclear and the findings of the parliamentary committees of the mrebyla were published.
The group said that at least 90 people have been detained in the last three weeks to prevent further demonstrations.
A ski slope was created in the city park
More than 100 tons of artificial snow were used to turn the monument in Bristol into a downhill track for the race.
The downhill track for the park race attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowborders to compete for the financial prizes.
At the top of the downhill track in Brandon Hill Park, the short ski jump was a 100-metre long downhill track.
Fourth-grade medical student John Hickman said it was a wonderful view from the top of the downhill track, but that it was really dismal.
It was a wonderful view of the blinking lights of the city below.
There were some of the best skiers and snowborders from all over the country - some of them real talent," he added.
The awards were awarded for the best pieces - or manoeuvres on the downhill track.
After Thursday night's race, the snow was left to melt.
Still them and us
Can a Muslim be a Frenchman?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
At a time when Swiss voters were calling for a ban on the construction of minarets and alarmist, there are generally spreading alarmist about the alleged Islamization of Europe, John Bowen, the American academic wrote and informed, wondering whether Muslims could integrate - and whether they were integrating - into one of the continent's most open secular societies.
Some of the readers, after reading this book, became admirers of the author's last work, "Why the French Don't Like Headscarves" (2006), this elegant and discussed study on the contentious issues that have been divided and emptying for 15 years, and the effects of which are still felt today.
Mr. Bowen's latest book has a broader and much more ambitious shot.
As a good anthropologist, he wants to know not only what the politicians and the media said about Islam in France, but what really happened at the ground.
He spent months in mosques, schools and institutes, which now take care of 5 ÷ 6 million of the French Muslims, which Mr. Bowen calls "Islamic spaces."
He is a good listener, reproducing debates between teachers and students about the issues that are most concerned about.
Should a Muslim enter into a marriage marriage at a mosque or City Hall (or both places)?
Should a young Muslim be taught about the development and rights of gays?
Can a Muslim woman marry a man who is not a Muslim?
Does a Muslim have the right to use an interest-oriented banking system if he wants to get a mortgage?
These seemingly worldly contentious issues are being discussed and which are part of everyday life rather than the political dramas that employ the media.
The author identifies a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, among others of well-known people, including Tariko Ramadan, Arab, a Muslim researcher and an academic born in Switzerland.
This new generation is attempting to open up a debate on how to be a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society at the same time.
They have no arguments for all their customs.
The Conservatives are distrustful of the true idei of French or European Islam.
The philosophers and activists interviewed by Mr. Bowen are inclined to the housecreen that this is the opposite of Selafi—the conferences of the purist Sunni Islam, associated in Saudi Arabia— this group is small, but influences European Muslims.
Mr Bowen believes that Muslim values and French secularism are compatible.
But adapting requires compromises on both sides.
He wonders how far French politicians (and the intellectual elite, who so doggedly advocate the lay public) are, in fact, committed to the idea of pluralism.
He is of the opinion that Muslims are probably less experienced in matters of faith than Catholics, Protestants, and Jews, who also had to make historic compromises with secular republicanism.
Rather than developing pragmatism, he found "the touching of scales of values."
Can a Muslim be a Frenchman? After reading this book, someone may be prained to say, "Yes, but not now."
The most deserted prospects in the world
The Arctic is changing faster dramatically than the other planet's environment.
The causating ice melts at an alarming rate, which affects the animals and their survival as nowhere else.
The interests of oil, gas and fishing companies must be focused on new natural water resources, together with diplomats, lawyers and writers in their awakening.
In "On the Thin Ice," Richard Ellis, a writer and illustrator, recounts the natural history of the North icon, the polar bear.
Well acquainted with the complicated history and whaling practices describes the long tradition of the polar explorers who tried to seize the white bear.
Admiral Nelson's meeting with a daring 14-year-old lifeguard who fought only with the collapse of the musket is indeed a myth, but all else is true.
Young bears who swam for the bodies of their just-killed mothers were captured and sent to the zoo and circus.
At the beginning of the 20th century, 75 polar bears performed in a circus tent.
Even today, the zoo's enclosures typically have an area a million times smaller than the area available to adult wilderness. The climate is rarely suitable: the resident polar bear in Singapore has turned green from algae growing within the hollow hairs of its coat.

Mr. Ellis draws on the works of other writers and historians, often returning to the threat of hunters threatening the survival of the species.
Even if hunting is banned in Norway, America and Russia, the killing continues in Greenland and Canada, where they are hunted from helicopters and Indian women on skis, and all armed with powerful attacking rifles to blast their prey.
The irony is that it takes place in water to the north of these two hunting nations, and that the ice will eventually be the biggest.
In his new book, "After Ice" Alun Anderson, the former editor of New Scientist, offers the clear and dismal responsibility of science for the Arctic and an engaging glimpse of how the future can change it.
Not all of this is the answer given to scientists.
Even meteorologists and oceanographers do not have an adequate response to the speed of the changes.
It's for lack of testing.
Fridtjof's research tours at the end of the 19th and early 20th centuries first indicated the motion of the floating ice.
Submarines then mapped the shifting watersheds as they were floored.
Satellite exploration and extensive probe fields in floating glaciers are a useful addition, but many are still being held thanks to the intrepid individuals camping in the winter.
Mr. Anderson peers into the extraordinarily fragile world of the catchment system in the interior of the Arctic ice, created by the trickling of salt water, which shrinks during freezing.
But from the outset of the bear to the microscopic miracles to the microscopic miracles, all doomed as soon as the summer ice moves, which takes place sometime between 2013 and 2050.
In a few months...that's to be us'
6,000 Marines laid wreaths on graves in Arlington
Petty Officer De'Angello Robinson, 19, traveled on a seven-hour bus to lay a simple wreath on the soldier's grave, never met with the deceased.
For him and the other Marines who made the trip from the Johnson camp in Jacksonville, North Carolina, to the Arlington National Cemetery to garnish the graves, that was the day in which they paid tribute to the men and women who once wore the same footwear.
In the few months we board, we could be us, Robinson said of the fallen soldiers.
If this happens to us, I would like someone to do the same for me to show my respect as I am the one I am trying to do.
He was one of more than 6,000 volunteers who gathered that Saturday morning to lay wreaths in the veteran cemetery in several departments at the commute ceremony in Arlington.
In 1992, Morrill Worcester, the owner of the Worcester Funeral Society in Harrington, Maine, began the tradition when he and several others decided to decorate several hundred graves at the commemorative ceremony in Arlington.
It is now an 18-year-old tradition of the 18-year-old tradition of Mr NMorill, with his wife Karen, making this trip every year and stopping in different cities along the way to honour the memory of military and victims of terror.
The Worcestesters are not looking for profit in this, wreaths across America, which they also lay in other states.
That year, volunteers laid more than 16,000 wreaths at Arlington Cemetery, on Pentagon, graves at the Fayetteville National Cemetery in Arkansas, the Battery Park in New York City, and at the commemorative site of flight number 93 United Airlines in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second year running, the Walmart Foundation is donating more than $1,50000 to buy and transport wreaths.
Charleen Hunt, in his 70s, from Westminster, said she made the trip to Arlington in honor of her husband, the deceased member of the armed forces.
Since her husband is not buried in Arlington, Mrs Hunt said it was her journey to return what the victim was doing.
It's a small way for citizens to support our troops, she said.
It's kind of like a visit to the family's grave.
Covered in the coats of warm cloth, the volunteers walked through the cemetery along the surrounding lawns and hills.
Volunteers headed to the older graves of the First and Second World War and the Vietnam War, because these are not visited as often as newer graves
The mood was positive when the children played and held hands together as they carried the young pine tree to the gray tombstones.
Each circular wreath was deep green with a small red arc of the upper part.
There was indeed silence near Section 60, where most of the veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are buried.
The affiliate services organizations donated to 1,000 wreaths to decorate the department, but the gloomy mood of the currently ongoing wars filled the area.
Some wept sincerely, others prayed, and families and friends kept each other in the cold air.
Some read the names, carved into the stones, while others bent to view the small black and white name tags, pushed into the wet mud where the tombstones had not yet been placed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of the many mothers who wiped tears from her son's eye in front of her son's grave.
She drove eight hours from Zanesfield, Ohio, to visit the final resting place of the retreat Sergeant of the Toroconetector's artillery, David Shane Spicer, who died in the battle of July.
No one should ever forget why we are free. . .my son paid for it, she said.
"Even though I've been away for a long time, I want to be the one to remember him."
U.S. government contractor imprisoned by Cuban government officials
The Cuban government has imprisoned a U.S. government contractor who imported mobile phones and laptops into the country, as reported by State Department officials on Saturday.
The contractor, which has not yet been identified, worked for Development Alternatives Inc. based in Bethesda.
The company is working on projects for the US Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
Consular officials, along with the American interest section in Havana, sought access to the detainee who was imprisoned on December 5.
Certain allegations have not been made public, but under Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or a foreigner can be imprisoned for almost anything that is described as "dangerous."
All so-called counter-revolutionary activities, which include mild protests and critical essays, are at risk of imprisonment.
Anti-government graffiti and speech are considered to be serious offences.
In Cuba, there is a young blogging community, led by popular commentator Yoani Sánchez, who often writes about how she and her husband are followed and harassed by government agents.
Ms Sánchez has repeatedly applied for permission to leave the country in order to receive the prizes, but she was refused permission.
Detention of an American supplier may be the result of rising tensions between the communist Castro's brother, ruling in Cuba, and the Obama administration, which was watched as a "reserving tactic" in improving relations with the island.
They were first reported on the imprisonment of the New York Times on Friday night.
The new American policylined that if the Cuban government takes concrete steps, such as the release of political prisoners and creates more space for the opposition, the combined states will take reciprocal steps.
Mobile phones and laptops are allowed in Cuba, though they are new and sought-after commodities in a country where the average wage for a public servant is $15 a month.
The Cuban government has granted ordinary citizens the right to buy mobile phones this year; these are mostly used to send text-links, because a 15-minute phone call would cost more than one day's wages.
The use of the Internet on the island is extremely limited.
It is available in expensive hotels and for their foreign visitors and on some government connections, such as universities.
Cubans, who often want to sign up, have to give their names to the government.
Access to many websites is forbidden.
Detention of an American in Cuba is rare.
Most of the handful of U.S. citizens in a prison in Cuba are behind bars for stressed crimes such as drug smuggling, Gloria Berben, the U.S. Across-Office Section's press clerk in Havana.
Mrs Berben said she could not provide more information about the prison.
The imprisonment and detention were clearly amoral.
Such activities that would be legal in any other open society - let's say free mobile phones - are a criminal offence in Cuba, said Miguel Vivanco, director of the US human rights group's agenda, which recently published an unfavorable report on freedoms in Cuba, called "New Castro, the same Cuba," as a reference to the installation of Raulo Castro as the country's leader and a replacement for the auspensive older brother Fidel.
Vivanco said the defendants were often arrested, tried and imprisoned in one day.
He said that all solutions would be more political, and that the Cuban government often provokes a negative reaction in the United States, just as the two countries are moving towards a more extensive dialogue.
Pakistani civil servants are uncovering a conspiracy to send men to Afghanistan.
Pakistani authorities on Saturday uncovered the alleged leader of a conspiracy involving the deployment of five men from northern Virginia to Afghanistan to kill members of US troops there, and said they hoped the case might help expose a large network of recruiting terrorist recruits that provies online and sought out radicalized young men.
Investigators said they searched for a grey rebel figure, known as Saiflah, who invited these men to Pakistan after first discovering them when one of these men posted a commentary approving the terric attacks by the online video player.
Saifillah took the lead in these men, as soon as they came to Pakistan, he tried to help them get to a remote area of Pakistan in the territory of the indigenous tribes of Pakistan, which is home to al-Qaida and its terrorist training camps.
But a Pakistani intelligence official who filed the report on the case said on Saturday that Saifullah had been unsuccessful in convicting al-Qaida commanders and that the men were not part of the CIA's infiltration attempt to infiltrate the terrorist network.
As a result, they were dropped for several days into the eastern district of Sarghod, far from the menacing mountains in the northwest that had become a refuge for the terrorists.
They were considered a strike force.
Why they were dropped, said the official, who spoke of maintaining anonymity due to the sensitivity of the case.
The official said the men were not intimidated and were still trying to get approval to gain access to the al-Qaida camps when they were arrested for exercising the Pakistani right.
The case of this five - which remained in Pakistan and was questioned by the FBI - highlights the critical role of recruits in identifying potential terrorists, and perhaps, more importantly, determining who is trustworthy.
Since the September 11, 2001, US intelligence service has assigned top priority to attempts to place human resources in al-Qaida.
The organization's recruiters act as guards, eliminating those who are not sufficiently serious in their commitment to the holy war and those who might be spies.
American fake recruits have been subjected to special scrutiny in al-Qaida, analysts said.
But they were also considered extraordinarily interesting in the group because, given their potential approach to American objectives and their promotional value.
But Evan Kohlmann, an older US-based NEFA analyst, said that terrorist groups have also become considerably more cautious in recent years, allowing the kohu to accede to them because US intelligence agencies have recruited experts in their recruitment methods.
If we are trying to break into these groups, is there no better way than to follow their recruitment model, which has already been so tracked? said Mr Kohlmann.
This model is one of those that is much more based on the web.
Tens of thousands protested in Copenhagen, demanding climate 'action'
Tens of thousands of protesters marched the streets this Saturday, demanding more forceful action on the climate from negotiators at the Bella City Convention Center.
Protesters reported the number of many hundreds of thousands of participants in the event, but police are striking that the number was closer to 25,000.
The event was relatively quiet, and a handful of masked activists laid several small explosives near a group of government buildings in the city center.
The day of the minor incident occurred in the climate talks sponsored by the UN, thousands of activists passed through the city, carrying banners with English inscriptions "This is not Planet B" (i.e. secondary) and one in Spanish, who proclaimed "Zuma says 'enjoy'."
The protest was attended by several celebrities, including Danish model and photographer Helena Christensen, who said she had traveled to her mother's birthplace in Peru and provided me with information about the bleak state of the country, in which the influence of climate change, which is still taking place, is involved.
This is a partial reason why we have chosen to join this great march -- to go through the world and appeal to the world's leaders to present a fair, ambitious, and binding agreement, she said.
It is not an easy task, but it must be done, it cannot be avoided at all times.
Police prevented the protesters from approaching the Bella Center and said they had detained 19 people, in the first place because they were either wearing masks or carrying pocket knives.
These activities are prohibited under Danish law during the demonstrations.
According to one of the detached viewers, who does not wish to be identified because he is involved in climate horn, activists masked as athletes and in black suits have laid several charges in the comeogled from Copenhagen's main channel, located near several ministries.
They were agitating at the buildings, he said, opening with flare, but followed by "a few major explosions."
Inside the convention center, people gathered around the TV screens to watch the march during the afternoon.
But the protest probably did not penetrate the consciousness of key officials, such as Su Wei, China's chief climate negotiator.
When asked if the demonstration nevertheless had a constructive impact on the international negotiations, he replied in English "Actually, that is something that I was not aware of" (it is, indeed, something I do not realise).
Then he went on to Chinese and said "Because the scene is extensive, I can't hear what's going on out there."
He watched to see if the march had been painful or helpful depending on everyone's prospects.
You can see the focus of the general public and the various sectors and the object of climate change, he said.
In other words: "It can also be said that this is a violation of the conduct or the freedom of others.
Test data revealed constant persistent racial differences
Last week's federal certificate of maths knowledge achieved was a welcome element of the good news about Columbia's public education.
Though the precinct lags far behind the country's high-performance systems, the certificate has shown greater progress in fourth and eighth-grade students in the last two years than in cities including Atlanta, Chicago, and New York.
But what remains hidden behind the latest Numbation Centre for the Progress of the Teaching National Attestation Centre are the persistent differences in knowledge of the knowledge made between African-American and white students, both locally and nationally.
The average result of the fourth-grade Columbia district of white pupils over the past two years has increased from 267 to 270 points (from a possible 500), but for their African-American peers, the growth was only three points, from 209 to 212.
Indeed, the difference in knowledge gained increased from 53 to 57 points between 2007 and 2009.
Progress with the Aro-Americans in the eighth grade remains essentially even, with a deflect of a statistically insignificant one point from 245 to 245.
The average result for white pupils was not included in the test results because the sample size was not large enough.
The picture over the horizon of six years is not exactly encouraging.
The difference between the fourth-grade white and black pupils in 2003, when the first NAEP in the district was carried out, was 60 points in the scale (262 to 202).
Although the result achieved in children from the two-chus groups improved during this period, the difference was barely close to 58.
Some of the precinct's attorneys for education have said in the last week that the results, hailed by secretary Michelle A. Rhee and Mayor Adrian M. Fentym (D) was more widely stimulated in white students where the results were already high.
That would suggest that we have increased the total support of those at the higher end of the scale, which is problematic and disturbing, said Jeff Smith, D.C. CEO. Voice, a non-profit group that advocates the equality of doing so in the district.
I don't jump up and down for a two- or three-point scattering, said a member of the D.C. committee. Kwame R. Brown (D-At Large), who has a daughter in the fourth grade of Eaton Eaton.
Often criticising the Rhee administration style, Ms Brown said that reporting on the results of the test means secondary education in the city is in a desperate state and requires attention.
Obviously, you always want to see the pros and I respect that.
But what is terrifying is that we have paid almost no time and energy to devote to our secondary education.
Mrs Rhee said the district's aim was to continue to find better ways, focused on the needs of low-certified students.
Thus, for example, some teachers are trained in the use of the new curriculum, the Wilson-based reading system, aimed at upper-class students in primary schools and high school students who have failed to master the basics of reading earlier in their wheel careers lag significantly behind their peers.
The day-to-day math and curriculum of the sixth grade mathematics, highlighting the games and experiences of real life that reached the precinct under former director Clifford Janeyi, can be attributed to the progress of NAEP, which was reported last week.
And I think we should just continue to work and make the best possible interventions for those students who remain below the level of the class, said Mrs Rhee.
Others said the NAEP results clarified the question of whether Mrs Rhee could continue to revisit the overall performance of the system and still provide additional money and funds for low-performance schools, which is necessary to reduce the difference.
It is a certain outspoken dilemma of Mrs. Michell Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, a teaching professor at the University of California, Berkeley where he studies the results of tests in urban areas.
The conventional procedure for redress is to focus the means and administrative reforms on the schools located in the worst parts of the Columbia district.
Thus, the focus can bring political repercussions that are directed against an important agenda.
But the rebuke also belongs to other city directors, who are attempting to maintain a central approach between the whites and the black.
We need to focus on building a system of big schools.
We need to tighten the kinship of our schools so that all families, no matter where they live, can be relied upon to be given excellent public training to their children.
Mr Janey, now the headmaster of schools in Newark, said in an interview earlier this week that the basic element of reducing the difference between the results achieved is the extension of the traditional public school year, currently in the district, to take place the legitimacy of the schools.
You have to get up to 200 days to push for the changes, said Mr. Janey, who signed a contract with his teaching association last year for a school year of 185 days, which he considers a "sign" for seeking a bigger increase next year.
To make higher education part of a better future
The on-track bus entered Gettysburg college with a loud rest.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12, got out and rested for a moment on white columns, brick facades and emerald green lawns.
Graciela's parents barely graduated from college in El Salvador.
So far, Graciela herself, who was born in Silver Spring and lived in Riverdale, never entered the college grounds.
Now she and other eighth grade pupils in the group were exploring Gettysburg, where tuition fees were $8,6699 a year, their position being more enthusiastic than fearful visitors to enthusiastic potential students.
Yes! That's it! exclaimed Graciela, who would have liked to study medicine when the guide offered them to enter the knowledge building.
Wow, really? she said thoughtfully when they were told by the low-level ratio of professors to the students.
The Pennsylvania College was one of the seven they visited on their three-day trip and were now completely intrigued by the future news: The question is not whether you will enter the track.
The question is from.
But this is a bearing issue with the high number of Spanish immigrant births in the US, born of Spanish immigrants who are excluded from colleges or become pregnant as minors, but there are hundreds of thousands of those who receive a college education and thus enter the middle class.
In fact, a fifth of this "dupe generation" of the Spanish college pupils - the remarkable results achieved indicate that many of their immigrant parents, mostly Mexicans and Central American residents, made it to the United States without finishing college.
Their success story is important, the researchers say, because this underscores their point of the way forward for the generation that played a marginal role in the country's workforce.
Those who have achieved a university degree say they had a natural leaning towards the school and innate assertiveness and an effort to succeed.
Many also had parents who set high goals for their children and looked for ways to replace ignorance of American education.
But school programs also play an extraordinary role in helping Gracie and the millions of children who would like to take the dorm - especially if these efforts persist over in time.
Considering that I come from low-income groups whose parents do not have the experience and ability to help them orly to participate in the system, any simple intervention on each individual point will not solve this, says Patricia Gándara, a researcher at the University of California, Davis, where she studied students from the Latin American field.
We have to think about providing these children with a preschool tray in all ways to get into college.
The federal program that funded Gracie's tour of the tracks is a useful example.
Known as GEAR UP (interrogate), it provides more than $300 million a year for local school systems to launch college preparatory programmes that start with students from low-income groups in high schools and continue until these students end up college.
Since 1999, the program has served more than 10 million students, more than% of whom entered the colleges, according to data from the US Department of Education.
Iraqi Ministry of Petroleum Industry Sets Agreement with 10 foreign oil companies
Regardless of concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi government has succeeded in rallying major oil companies to redevelop their sickly infrastructure during the two auctions that took place on Saturday.
Ten agreements were concluded by the Iraqi Ministry of Petroleum Industry with foreign oil companies, suggesting that Chinese, Russian and European oil companies are prepared to play a major role in rebuilding the Iraqi oil industry, crippled by decades of wars and sanctions.
American companies left with a share of just two of the 10 auctioned fields.
Seven U.S. companies paid for their participation in the second auction, which began on Friday.
Only one made the lost offer.
Two U.S. companies reached agreements for the fields auctioned in June.
The shredding participation of the US oil giants in the upright Iraqi oil industry surprised analysts.
Iraq has finally opened its doors after six years of war, and instead of American companies, you have Asian and Europeans on the way in the first place, said Ruba Husari, editor of the Iraq Oil Forum, online news.
That will be long before anything else is for sale in Iraq.
Concerns about security, highlighted by massive coordinated bombings on Tuesday and political instability, as well as the withdrawal of the US military, are likely to discourage American companies from doing much more intensive business in Iraq, which has demonstrably the third largest raw material reserves, say analysts.
American firms have been at a disadvantage in some cases, especially Chinese and other government-controlled energy firms, with noticeably lower operating costs and are more prone to taking risks because they are not accountable to shareholders.
Exxon Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only American companies to make deals with the ministry.
Leading American companies, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which maintained close contacts with the Iraqi Oil Ministry and offered technical assistance in recent years, left empty-handed.
Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were top shareholders in two of the contracts awarded at the end of this week.
The State-based Chinese National Petroleum Corp. participated in the offers for more contracts than all other companies and left with large stakes in contracts for the two main fields.
We all know that China is seeking to become the main economic, as well as the technological force of technology, said the spokesman for the oil industry, Assam Jihad, the Ministry of Petroleum.
We believe that Chinese society will be comparable to the competition and honour its commitments to Iraq.
Companies that were preliminarily selected for the submission of bids, which were then compared by the Ministry according to the price per barrel and the Ministry is willing to pay to strengthen the output above the current levels in each field.
The top-of-the-line al-Qaida planner was apparently killed in Pakistan.
The impact of the U.S. missile at the border between Pakistan and Afghanistan this week appears to have been killed by the top-of-the-range planner for al-Qaida's operations, as reported Friday by U.S. counterterrorism officials.
As confirmed, this could be the second fatal attack on one of the terrorist's leaders.
Saleh al-Somali was one of two Arabs who were killed when several rockets fell quarterly on their car near the city of Miran Śáh in Sevverní Vaziristan province, according to U.S. sources and pact officials in the area.
Local authorities have erupted that the missiles were fired from the aircraft unmanned by the CIA in the IUU zone of the illegal indigenous tribes.
These were induced onto a white car that was heading towards the Afghan border when it was hit, the official, along with the Pakistani Cicilian Researchers Agency, who telephoned from Miran Shah, said.
The official said the local militants rushed to the point and quickly confiscate what was left of the "totally destroyed bodies."
Local authorities were unable to verify the identity of the victims, but two US officials from the Counter Terrorism Unit quoted an unspecified witness who said that Somali was dead.
Somali was cited as a high-ranking planner for al-Qaida military operations, who directed operations by terrorist groups outside the Afghanistan and Pakset regions.
He was involved in the rallying around the world, said a senior official who did not wish to be named, who stated the sensitive nature of US airstrikes on the territory of Pakistan.
If he held such a central position, he was probably involved in attacks against the United States and Europe.
He received instructions from the top leadership of Al-Qaida and planned possible terrorist attacks on the basis of them.
Another US official said that Somali had advanced rapidly in the al-Qaida hierarchy and was well connected to other extremist groups in the region.
He may not have been a well-known person to some Americans, but that he did not humiliate himself in any way to pose before us and our allies, said another official.
When his death was confirmed, Somali should be the second high-ranking leader of al-Qaida or the Taliban who should be killed from September, when Najmudin Jalolov, the leader of the militant faction in the indigenous tribal band, and three other top poverative leaders were killed in a similar attack.
The pace of attacks launched by the CIA with drones has been reduced since the summer from an average of approximately six operations per month to two, according to Long War's records, a website run by a nonprofit group.
The reduction may have a reason in the improved tactics of terrorist groups that have taken steps to reduce their vulnerability by also ruthlessly killing those suspected of being informers, the site said.
The summit delegate of the United Nations in Kabul stepped down.
The top delegate of the United Nations in Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said on Friday that he would like to resign from his post in March, ending a tumultuous term that was marred by accusations of widespread corruption in the election of a president in Afghanistan, supported by the UN.
Eide's departure is happening because the Obama administration has decided to send an additional 300,000 US troops to Afghanistan.
The UN delegate said it supported the increase, but expressed concern that the US timetable for the reduction, which would begin in 18 months, should be a call for other NATO governments to withdraw their forces.
We need to accelerate the building of the Afghan security forces and send the right signal to the Afghans that they should have confidence in the international community, Eide said in a telephone interview from Kabul.
The commitment made must be a long-term one.
The Norwegian diplomat also pressured the United States and other military forces to increase the number of international civilian employees assisting in the political transformation of Afghanistan.
The increase on the side of the armed forces must be copied on the part of the civilians, he said.
Eide said he would not resign, but that he was simply fulfilling the promise he made to his family in March 2008 that he would only spend two years in Kabul.
He said he wanted to report to the UN.
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has now said he would need time to find a replacement.
As I said, it's high time to look for the heir, Eide said.
When I came here, there was a two-month-old vacuum between the departure of my predecessor and my arrival.
According to UN officials, Ban began seeking a replacement.
Officials said the decision was made between Staffan di Mistura, who has a Swedish-Italian origin and previously led the UN mission in Baghdad, and Jean-Maria Guéhenne, the Frenchman who had previously conducted the UN peacekeeping operations.
Eide's position in Afghanistan was tested after his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, who was indicted in September by President Hamid Karzai, who won the country's presidential election election for masking the presence of massive electoral machinations.
Eide denied these allegations, but said that the accusations against Galgraith -- who had been released -- "certainly damaged the mission because there was a high degree of scepticism with regard to the international intervention" in the election.
Eide said he proposed a meeting with the Attorney General to coordinate lightening efforts at the US Force leadership in Afghanistan.
He also urged the leadership of the UN to allow his successor to hire more staff from the United States and other Western countries to lend them for the Afghan mission, so, as he says, he would like to strengthen their confidence that their money is used properly.
Eide expressed disappointment at curtailing its efforts in Afghanistan, Eide said that the UN's cumbersome recruitment regulations undermine its ability to exploit capabilities.
The UN rules are that I have had the opportunity to get only one person since May, he said.
This is a disaster and I cannot continue.
Gates: Iran faces further sanctions
Defence Minister Robert M. Gates said Friday that the world powers will soon impose "more significant sanctions" on Iran because of a lack of engagement in talks on his nuclear ambitions.
Gates, who spoke to a group of about 300 U.S. troops in northern Iraq during a week-long trip to the areas where the war is being fought in Afghanistan and Iraq, downplayed the prospect of armed action against the Islamic Republic.
This is not a good choice for Iran, he said in response to the soldier's inquiry into the likely development. "
One of the things that depends on me is whether I've learned anything from Iraq in the last six years, [that] is the inherent unpredictability in the war.
The Obama administration is making decisions on a package of sanctions that could hit Iran's military and political elite, but Gates has signalled that some of these sanctions could also affect ordinary Iranians.
He said a "package of incentives and inhibitions" would require "to get the Iranian government to actually feel less safe with nuclear weapons" because "its people will suffer extraordinarily" sanctions.
In response to a Friday opinion issued by White House spokesman Robert Gibbs, the administration has involved European leaders in warning that Iran will bear serious consequences if it does not bring its nuclear program into full compliance with the UN Nuclear Safety Committee and its Supervisory Authority, the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Iran insists that it wants to develop its expertise only for peaceful purposes.
In the talks in Geneva 1. He indicated in October that he wanted to return to talks on the curtailment of his nuclear program and agreed to provide a substantial portion of his uranium-enriched enriched stockpile in exchange for the urgently needed fuel for the reactor to conduct medical research.
The administration has pushed for such an agreement as a way of establishing trust between the two parties and to gain time for negotiations.
But since then, it seems, Iran is withdrawing from the interim agreements - partly therefore, the expert says, because the Iraqi leadership is divided on whether to engage with the United States.
Frankly, with regard to the Iranian stubbornness to the international community in the case of some of the proposals that he actually agreed to at the beginning of October, I think it brought in the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese, together on a trip that is not about terminology of additional sanctions against the Iranians, Gates said.
President Obama set a deadline for Iran on December 31 to respond to the proposals before returning to the search for other elections, including surveillance, which Secretary of State Secretary Hillary Rodham Clinton once called "degrading sanctions."
In an opinion issued in New York, the Iranian mission to the United Nations condemned on Thursday what it called "unjustified and unsubstantiated accusations" to some members of the Security Committee on Iran's nuclear activities, stating that it wanted to continue talks with the United States and five other world powers "to reach a proportionate long-term solution.
Gates, who returned to Washington last Friday, met with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki in the morning before flying to a region of Kurdistan, oil-rich, to meet with troops in Kirkuk and Kurdish officials in Irbil.
High tensions remain between the Kurds and the Iraqi Arab majority, mainly because of borders, ownership rights and income distribution.
The Gtes urged both sides to reduce the potentials for the conflicts to prevent US plans to limit the number of US troops from 115,000 to be 10,000 by the end of August.
Gates also tried to dampen Kurdish concerns about the lingering depression. The official posts of the US quoted Gates as saying to Massaoud Barzáani, the president of the Kurdistan regional government: "We want to protect your security, prosperity and autonomy in a united Iraq.
We don't want to leave you."
In an ageing China, a change in course
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters reading that "Mother of the Earth is too exhausted to support more children" and "One, in addition, one child means an extra grave."
Then they learned the lesson that when the official government posts in Shanghai, alarmed by low birthrates and the ageing population in their city, they suddenly changed course this summer and began to encourage young couples, their response was immediate and determined: Never.
We have always devoted all of our time and energy to just one child.
We didn't save anything for others, says Wang, 31, the human resources manager who has an 8-month-old son.
China's more than 30-year-old policy of having only one child was introduced, creating two generations of only notoriously chubby and pampered children, an affectably dubbed "small emperors," the country's population crisis threatens the country.
The average birth rate dropped to 1.8 children per pair compared to six before the Vpolitika came into effect, according to UN figures.
The population-sharing, where the population at the age of 60 and above is predicted to grow throatsdling from 16.7 percent of the population in 2020 to 31.1 percent in 2050. This is far above the overall average of around 20 percent.
The imbalance is of larger, wealthy coastal towns with a higher education population, such as Shanghai.
Last year, people aged 60 and taller accounted for nearly 22 percent of Shanghai-registered residents, while the birth rate was less than one child per pair.
Xie Lingli, director of the Shanghai City Commission for the Population and Family Planning, said many couples must have children to "help the proportions of an ageing population and a reduction in the manpower's numbers in the future."
He says it's about "being an old man, that doesn't mean being rich -- like in developed countries like Japan or Sweden."
Gradual soothing
As it was put into the country's constitution in 1978, China's one-child policy is probably the most controversial mandate to date, established under the Communist Party.
The pair that violated the policy faced immense fines -- up to three times their annual salary in some areas -- and discrimination at work.
Chinese official posts advocated a policy that helped the country prevent critical use of natural resources, while human rights advocates were condemned to promote policy.
In rural areas, some officials forced pregnant women to submit to miscarriages at the other child.
Moreover, many couples had to undergo sexist selective abortions, leading to an unnaturally high proportion of men to women.
In the past years, population officials have been gradually more lenient in their opinion on the one-child policy.
In 2004, they generally allowed a waiver of exceptions - including city dwellers, members of national minorities, and cases where a man and a woman were onlysionless -- and in 2007 they relaxed the diction of their hardline slogans.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the Beijing University's Population Research Institute, said central government officials had previously debated more radical changes, as allowing couples to have two children if one of the partners was an only child.
In June, Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to incitement to more births.
Almost overnight, the posters, urging parents to have only one child, were replaced by copies of the regulation detailing how it would be justified to have a second child and how to apply for a permit.
The city administration sent family planning officials and volunteers to meet couples in their houses and to whip up the fliers under the door.
They also promised to provide emotional and financial advice for those who chose to have more than one child.
The response was cold, family planning officials said.
A purifying response
Even though officials in a rural town around Shanghai have seen an increase in interest in couples who would like to have a second child after the campaign's launch, most of the city's districts did not report changes.
The city's Huinan district with a population of 115,000, for example, still registered four to five cases per month.
Disappointed officials in Shanghai said that despite the campaign, the number of the city born in 2010 is still only expected to be around 165,000 - slightly higher than in 2009, but lower than in 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the family planning committee at the Shanghai Quarter of Caol, said that financial considerations were probably the main reason why people did not want to have more children.
They want to provide the best for the first child, he said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said she would like to have two children and have been legally allowed to do so.
But like many Chinese, who have only inadequate health and life insurance, provided by the government.
Without a docile hampma network, the choice could be irresponsible.
People in the west are treating the one-child policy wrong as the contentious legal issue, says Yang, a civil engineer whose wife is in a union with her first child at the seventh month of pregnancy.
Yes, we were deprived of the chance to have more than one child.
But the problem is not only in politics.
It's about the money.
Other couples cite psychological reasons for hesitation.
Wang, the human resources administrator, says he only wants one child, because she was also an only child: "We were the focus of our families' attention and we were all caring for us.
We were not used to provide care and we didn't really want to take care of others.
Chen Zijian, 42, who made the earmarking translation company, made it much more open.
For two-chairs' middle-class parents who have reduced the birth rate, he said, to be successful means being selfish.
Today's 20 and 30-year-olds, growing up, view parents as the first days of whose Chinese experiment with capitalism and they don't want this kind of living for themselves, he says.
It is one child who places enormous demands on the time of the parents, he says.
A mother must sacrifice at least two years of her social life.
Then there are the contentious issues of the propartment -- "You have to rebuild your apartment" -- and the strategy -- "You need to have a resumé ready at a time when the child is 9 months for a good preschool education.
Most of his friends want to settle for one child, says Che, but not with two.
We are the first generation with higher nurture standards, he says.
We do not want to bring too many casualties.
The UN group outlined a plan to reduce emissions.
The United Nations sponsored climate conference -- characterized by far-reaching unruly positions and mutual recriminations -- turned again on Friday to the release of a document that proposes an ambitious reduction in the amount of greenhouse gases over the next 40 years with industrialized nations bearing most of the burden at the earliest.
The text, which may provide a basis for a final political agreement on the regulation of greenhouse gases, highlights the remaining obstacles as well as illuminating the way forward.
But you could see important progress in the negotiations that took place at the wrong time with the world's more than 100 world leaders coming to Copenhagen next week.
Created by the UN working group on an ad hoc basis, this text subtly states how much money rich countries should provide to those poor to deal with global warming in the short and long term.
And it provides an entire range of choices for key issues, including how to develop and manage incoming economies so that they can limit their carbon output and what the upper limit should be to increase global temperature, which political officials will still be able to tolerate.
This adds a great deal of flexibility to the process, says John Coequyt, the chief executive of the Washington club, Sierra.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who proposed a six-page document, described the 180-page text from the meeting to focus on what a top official on climate issues at the United Nations, Yvo de Boer, described as a "great picture."
It outlines a possible agreement in which industrial nations could jointly limit their emissions to 25 to 45 percent by the year compared to 1990 levels, compared to 1990 levels, while major developing countries could reduce their emissions to between 15 and 30 percent during this period.
Together, the country would reduce emissions by 2050 to between 50 and 95 percent.
The European Union quickly discussed on Friday the promise to provide $3.6 trillion over the next three years to help poorer countries accept climate change adaptation -- from managing floods and droughts to avoiding deforestation.
But he still introduced Friday the same kind of verbal fireworks that outnumbered last week's interviews.
US Special Ambassador for Climate Affairs Todd Stern rejected the speech, calling for a binding reduction in greenhouse gas emissions for industrialised countries compared to the volunteering of the major emerging economies if they were not funded by the developed world.
The shift signaled that the Obama administration had set a tougher line against China by the Bush administration officials just two years ago.
The United States will not accept the treaty without transferring major developing countries and implementing the actions, Stern said, also complaining that the text was not sufficient to secure restrictions and should be vetted by external observers.
Stern made this comment an hour after Chinese Deputy Secretary of State He Yafei told the US chief climate negotiator that either the shortage of "common sense" or "extremely irresponsibility" led earlier in the week to say that the United States would not help financially China to deal with global warming.
With the economic path of the world's major powers at stake, the wrangling has erupted both within the developing world and between the industrial world and emerging economies.
The current fight is mostly about preserving individual economies rather than preserving the planet, between China and the United States, to meet their respective commitments, while the poorer nations point out that the world's two dozen of the world's most influential countries ignore the scientific imperative for conducting more forceful actions.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate to Costa Rica, said it was not surprising that the major powers were fighting over who should bear the cost of curtailing greenhouse gases, while vulnerable countries have become much more aggressive in finding the way to prevent large issuers from taking responsibility in their actions.
It is clearly a game about the new economic hegemony being developed, said Ulate, which also serves as a regional advisor on regional climate change in Mexico and Central America for international conservation.
Some of the countries that are the most vulnerable to climate change have indicated that they would like to continue to push for a legally binding agreement in Copenhagen, but most of the main participants said that the best outcome of the talks would be a political agreement.
The alliance of small island states, which has 43 members, created a 24-page draft agreement last Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, who led the international climate negotiations in favour of the European Commission, said that the promotion by small island nations "carried out a political tutilka in the entire field-hungry process" partly because they are now united and demanding actions from growing economies such as China and India.
The hearing raised a new urgency as soon as the delegates focused on the fact that they had to resolve most of the remaining issues of content before the heads of the governments faced off on the deal.
Highly positioned officials, such as India's Minister of Environmental Protection, Jairam Ramesh, and the Chinese deputy minister, stepped off the planes and ran through the halls of the Bella Center to the closed doors of the meeting and the new conferences, so that they could set out the demands that would be assessed next week.
The total vastness of the rally - with 13,000 people moving from and to the convention center on a daily basis, guitar-playing activists staged at night an ironic spectacle of countries they thought had been sent to, and the drafts were passed from hand to hand on paper rather than by e-mail -- controlled by challenge.
The intensity is only a superstructure: almost all key ministers were present in Copenhagen and earlier on Wednesday 60 heads of state.
We have come to a high category, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, said the Deputy Minister for Global Policy at International Conservation.
Heavy scales are coming.
Britain's first train with a speed of 140 miles an hour redefined his feelings this Monday
at 5:13 a.m. on Monday morning, the whistle cut through the darkness as a sign of the departure of the train, which revolutionised the transport in Britain.
The country's first high-speed passenger train will reach speeds of 140 miles per hour and will fly from Ashford, Kent, to London's St Pancras, covering a distance of 58 miles in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, the Minister of Transport, then joined Mrs Kelly Holmes and boarded the first high-speed passenger set outside of Lendin.
It hopes that the new service will eventually connect Britain with an international network of fast, reliable trains and connect the large agglomerations of Midland, the north and the Scottish with London.
The upright stagnant waters should be shortened by passenger transport and business travel times, and the transition from airplanes and cars to the rail could reduce carbon emissions and eliminate congestion on the roads.
In theory, the three main political parties were allowed to be won for this vision.
But the tens of pounds needed to build a new national rail network, the inevitable fight for projects and concerns about environmental disruption have now hampered the construction of British high-speed lines.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company formed in January to provide a feasible study to the government, forwarded its report to Lord Adonis on December 30, as the Times reported.
It provided him with a detailed map of the routes of the next planned platform of the high-speed network.
London's new route to West Midland was designed to reach five metres in urban areas and neighbourhoods, where it could be problematic to reach the life centre.
In the open countryside, the final route was scheduled for the 25 m.
The HS2 also envisages setting out three options for a large-scale high-speed network heading north.
Lord Adonis will answer in the spring.
The preferred choice is the Y-shaped confinement, with one high-speed line to West Midland.
The line should be divided near Birmingham with one branch, passing from Pennines to Manchester and Scotland and the other, leading to the northeast to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle over Tyne.
One line should lead to Scotland.
"It looks like the most powerful choice has taken place," he said, and the railway expert.
As soon as it's done, the journey times between London and Edinburgh will be reduced to two hours and 40 minutes.
The first stage, which will not be opened before 2025, could allow passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes compared to more than once in the present.
The proposals should allow trains to run at 2250 miles per hour, making the UK's network the fastest in Europe.
The initial line is already proposed to hijack trains of 400 m , which would be able to carry 1100 people.
Up to 18 trains could operate every hour on the London-Bermingham line.
It means that the London Terminal would be able to serve up to 20,000 passengers per hour if needed.
In view of the capital constraints, it is assumed that the existing station would be expanded to designate a high-speed network.
Experts from the rail industry claim that only San Pancras International or Euston offer such potential.
Lord Adonis will announce whether or not he intended to implement this scheme, but extensive public consultations and planning procedures mean that the final decision will not be made before the general election.
Even if it sets the wheels in motion, the network should be built in parts.
Trains should first be put into service not on high-speed lines, but in the existing lines north of Birmingham, and keeping the journey times between London and Scotland over three hours.
This is seen as a crucial point of contact to ensure the switching from aircraft to trains, a landmark for the railway revolution.
Taxpayers have paid a £75,000 mortgage on the Tory Orangement
Alan Duncan, the holder of the Tory's front-running seat bench in the House of Commons, was paid thousands of pounds of the cost by taxpayers last year for the Orangery he had built at his home in the constituency.
The party's prison spokesman, who was demoted by David Cameron for complaining that MPs lived "from rations," increased his mortgage to £75,000 to build an oak-lined extension in his second house in Rutland.
He was allowed to charge a special interest, a total of hundreds of pounds per month to the taxpayer.
The municipal authorities approved the claims in a timely manner and he was not questioned by Sir Thomas Legg who inspected the member expenses. Last night, Mr. Duncan made his demands "it could have been cleaner or easier."
Mr Duncan, one of the richest members of parliament, owns two two-storey houses in the village in his constituency of Rutland and Melton.
The houses are worth approximately one million pounds.
There is a kitchen, living room and a dining room on the ground floor, but the IRS has agreed that Mr. Duncan needs more space.
Last year he added a conservatory to the house, which is labeled "orange" in the plans.
Neighbors describe it as "greach for fun and entertainment."
Mr Duncan was not asked to provide any explanation for the increased loan during the last review by the Municipal Standards and Privorizy Committee in the last mortgage settlement.
The committee told him last month that he had broken the rules, after reviewing his expenses.
In 2004, Mr Duncan changed the purnailary security to a mortgage of £271406 from his estate in London to a house in his constituency, which he bought in 1991, a year before becoming a member of the House of Commons.
Documents released this week showed that Mr Duncan claimed around £1,400 a month in the interest of a mortgage until March last year.
In April, his demands increased to more than £1,800 a month.
The interest in the repayments of Mr Duncan's RBS mortgage could not have changed at this time, suggesting that it was all intended to finance the £75,000 loan.
The standard RBS mortgage repayment variable declined from 7.94 percent to 4 percent in March of this year in December 2007, which it did.
The latest document from the municipal authorities shows that Mr Duncan continued to claim £1250 a month in May this year.
Mr. Duncan left his job as the shadowman of the House in September after a secret newspaper filmed it and said that MPs must survive "admissions" after the spending scandal.
"Basically, it's nationalized, you have to live on rations and treat you like a s**t."
He said, "I've spent the money for my garden and my claim and a small fraction of what it took.
And I could claim the whole damn share, but I won't do it.'
The MP, a millionaire from his former career as an oil trader, was first asked to explain his extradition in May when it became apparent that he had claimed £1,000 for his garden, before the IRS was approved, that it "may be considered excessive."
One of the activists dug a pit in the shape of a pound emblem in Mr. Duncan's lawn in protest after it was revealed that he had claimed £4,000 for three years.
When he was asked last night about the mortgage increase, Mr. Duncan said: "It was because of the capital increase, which was approved by both the IRS and subsequently Legg."
He added: "This is not a contentious issue of hiding and zigzagging or breaking the rules or something else.
It's an absolutely straight downline line, by the rules, justified and that's all.
This would not be able to be cleaner or simpler in many other ways of making it."
Come and see the cottage on the brighton coast with the Advent calendar.
Coastal cottages in Brighton found a new meaning of life in the up-raising months as an interactive Advent calendar.
Beyond, an alternative church group that inspires ducky creativity has invited 24 owners to decorate their cottages for each day in December and to use the Christmas cognac as the theme of this decoration.
The event began on 1 December, allowing visitors to see the last cottage from 17.30 to 6:30 p.m. every day, and with a biscuitic bread and mulled wine, provided free of charge.
The selected carols included I Saw Three Ships, O Come, O Come, Emmanuel and The First Noël, when the cottage represented the work of Janetty Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50, an assistant at television marketing at Hove, is a priest without a scholarship in the Diocese of Chicster and head of Beyon.
He said: "We want to make religion much more important to the people of post-Christian society.
"Why are we, as a church, expected to come to an alien old building? I have a feeling that the church should come to the people and serve in a wakeful.
"The idea Advent Calendar in the cottages was just created as an interview with some friends during the dinner.
Brighton is such a fantastically creative and vibrant place, and we tried to try and present it in a spiritual way."
Strong mobilizations in Copenhagen and the world against climate change.
Tens of thousands of people took to the streets on Saturday demanding a strong and binding agreement to combat global warming, which should be adopted at a conference in Copenhagen, demonstrated around the world and in Copenhagen, where hundreds of people were arrested by police on that occasion.
At least 30,000 people, according to police sources and 100,000, according to organisers, rallied in the cold weather in the Danish capital on the occasion of the United Nations climate conference to adopt an agreement to come into force by Friday on 1 January 2013.
Connie Hedegaard, the Danish president of the climate climate conference said that the growing global mobilization, with the clear evidence of current rallies, had contributed to the "political tax" of any failure in Copenhagen that would be too high.
According to an AFP journalist, incidents occurred in the Danish capital shortly after the parade began, with a group of about 300 demonstrators dressed in black to start dismantling the windows with cobblestones and hammers.
The riot police immediately intervened emphatically.
In total, police announced the arrest of 600 to 700 people, clarifying that they were mainly members of the "Blacks Blocks," ultra-aradical separate groups that had already been manifested in April at the NATO summit in Strasbourg in eastern France.
The Climate Justice Action (CJA) coalition, one of the organizers of the event, condemned the conditions under which hundreds of radicals were arrested "without the difference" and stressed that about a hundred of them were in handcuffs and sitting in the streets on Saturday night ", despite the extreme winter.
After leaving Parliament, the procession calmly made its way to the Bella Center, where the negotiations were taking place.
Demonstrators stopped about 500 metres from the building without trying to penetrate.
A podium was built for the speakers, before which a cleric candlelight meeting took place with the participation of the former South African Archbishop of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu.
Most of the protesters arrived by bus and train from major European cities, and in addition to Africans, there were a large number of participants from Asia, including several Chinese and Koreans.
Nearly 3,000 people, mostly dressed in blue cape, formed their first rallies in Copenhagen in the morning, at the call of the Friends of the Earth group, which wanted to create "blue waves" as a "fair climate."
Today we are taking to the streets to demand a settlement of the ecological debt for the benefit of the South, explained Lidy Nacpil, the Philippine fighter at the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We can't tell ourselves any more: it's time for that, Beninese singer Angelique Kidjo claimed.
In Africa, rivers and watercresses are drying up, we can walk in them today and that was never possible before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, which was born in 1992, with the adoption of a UN convention, the Fighting for a Next World movement approached environmental organizations.
French MEP José Bová, one of the figures in the fight for another world, said he had come to Copenhagen to "connect climate and social justice." "There is currently no difference between the fight against global warming and the fight for another world ".
The first rallies began in the Asia-Pacific region, which find many islands particularly sensitive to climate warming.
In Australia, organizers say, about 50,000 people took to the streets.
Several hundred people marched in Manila, mostly students, in red clothing and with scarves evocative of the importance of solar energy.
In Hong Kong, Jakarta, but also in Canada, several hundred demonstrators took to the streets, demanding strong action against climate change.
In France, the "350" movement's "350" protests were attended by hundreds of people, mainly in Paris, Marseille (south), Lille (north), Bordeaux (west) and Lyon (East).
In Geneva, several dozen people gathered.
Separatist Abkhazia has elected its president, Georgia condemns it as a "farce"
Abkhazia elected its president on Saturday, about a year after Moscow recognized this pro-Russian separatist territory as independent of Georgia, Tbilisi, on the other hand, declares the move a "farce."
About 13100 people were invited to participate in this first election after the Russian-Geearen war in August 2008 for control of South Ossetia, another former Georgian territory recognized by Russia.
The polls closed at 17 hours GMT.
According to officials from the Abchaz election commission, the turnout was 58% a few hours before the polling stations closed.
The first preliminary results should be announced at night from Saturday to Sunday.
All five candidates, including incumbent President Sergey Bagapsh, categorically reject the idea of a merger with Georgia that condemned the election.
These choices are a farce.
On the other hand, Georgian President Mikhetareshashvili "did the Abkhazia has fallen completely into Russian rule," said his spokeswoman, Manana Manjgaladze.
Apart from Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela recognized the independence of the territory with 216,000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world considers it to be part of Georgia, which was illegally occupied by Russian troops.
After separating from Georgia, after the conflict in 1992-1993, which killed several thousand people, Abkhazia is trying to show through the election that she is ready to return to international politics.
This trial is one of the stages of our new life, a new era for our independent state, Kvarčija Svetlanová, a 54-year-old historian who also admitted to voting for President Bagapsh, told AFP.
She was one of those who came to the polling station at a school in the capital, Sukhumi, to a beautiful white building with a few palm trees at the entrance.
The issue of Russian rule is the main issue of the presidential election in this region on the Black Sea, which can boast beautiful nature.
Across this small country of 216,000 people, huge billboards are being placed with Bagapsh alongside Russian President Dmitry Medvedev and Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
In Gaul, in the west of the country, Russian officials who came to oversee the successful conduct of the elections received a warm welcome from the district mayor Beslan Arshba.
"We, the Abkhaz, are grateful "said in a small ceremony, referring to Moscow's support and, in particular, her decision to recognize Abkhaz's independence.
I hope your country will soon be recognized by the United Nations, said Aleksey Ostrovsky, a member of the Russian parliament, and toasted with a glass of vodka.
The opposition, which was represented in the election by former vice-president Raule Khadzhimba and two traders Zaus Ardzinbou and Beslan Boutba, criticized the contracts concluded last year with Moscow, such as a treaty that allows Russia to control the railway network of Abkhazia for a period of 10 years.
Fifth candidate, Vitali Bganba says he supports neither the current government nor the opposition.
To win the election, an absolute majority of 50% plus one vote is required.
If none of the candidates achieves this result, the decisive contest must take place within two weeks.
Climate: World rally, events in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of people took to the streets on Saturday, demanding a strong and binding agreement to combat global warming, which should be adopted at a conference in Copenhagen, demonstrated worldwide and in Copenhagen, where police arrested around 700 people on the occasion.
At least 30,000 people, according to police sources and 100,000, according to organizers, rallied in the afternoon in the cold weather in the Danish capital, hosting delegates from 193 countries until 18 December, on an agreement that could enter into force on 1 January 2013.
After leaving Parliament, the procession calmly made its way to the Bella Center, where the negotiations were taking place.
Demonstrators stopped about 500 metres from the building without trying to penetrate.
A podium was built for the speakers, before which a cleric candlelight meeting took place with the participation of the former South African Archbishop of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu.
According to an AFP journalist, the incidents occurred shortly after the parade left, when a group of several hundred protesters, dressed in black and armed with bricks and hammers, began to smashing windows.
Riot police immediately surrounded them and intervened without waiting, knocking several manifestants to the ground.
In total, police announced the arrest of 600 to 700 people and clarified that they were mainly members of the "Blacks Blocks," ultra-radical separate groups that had already been seen in April at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, in eastern France.
Late in the afternoon, one police officer on the jaws was injured with a cobblestone and four cars were set on fire near the squat near the incidents, which resulted in the detention of about 20 people, according to police sources.
We are focused on extremist groups, police spokesman Henrik Yakobsen warned, while police helicopters flew into the air again.
Most of the protesters who arrived by bus or train from the major German cities, from London, Amsterdam and Milan were of European origin.
But there were also a lot of Asians, including a few Chinese and Koreans or Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, dressed mostly in blue raincoats, formed their first rally in Copenhagen in the morning at the call of Friends of the Earth, which wanted to create "blue waves" as a "fair climate."
Today we are taking to the streets to demand a settlement of the ecological debt for the benefit of the South, explained Lidy Nacpil, the Philippine fighter at the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.

French MEP José Bová, one of the figures in the fight for another world, said he had come to Copenhagen to "connect climate and social justice." "There is currently no difference between the fight against global warming and the fight for another world ".
Oxfam has called in several well-known figures, such as Danish model Helena Christensen or former UN Refugee Commissioner Mary Robinson, to speak to the crowd.
The first rallies began in the Asia-Pacific region, which find many islands particularly sensitive to climate warming.
In Australia, organizers say, about 50,000 people took to the streets.
In Manila, several hundred people were rallied in front of the City Hall of the Philippines, mostly in red-out clothing and scarves evoking the importance of solar energy.
In Hong Kong and Jakarta, several hundred demonstrators also met with a demand for a strong measure against climate change.
In France, the "350" movement's "350" protests were attended by hundreds of people, mainly in Paris, Marseille (south), Lille (north), Bordeaux (west) and Lyon (East).
In Geneva, several dozen people gathered.
Geography and history items will be strengthened as part of the general grammar school reform, Chatel said.
Education Minister Luc Chatel said during an interview with the JDD magazine on Sunday that the subjects of history and geography will be "strengthened" as part of the reform of the general grammar school, even though their teaching will no longer be compulsory in the final year of the grammar school with a focus on exact sciences.
Now all second-grade students will have four hours a week and there will be the same programme from the general culture for everyone, Chatel confirmed.
According to the minister, "it is necessary to stop with hypocrisy" because, according to him, the S specialization is no longer focused on exact sciences" but "basically there are the best students in it."
The EC and L specializations cannot be for the kind of under-specializations, he continues, emphasizing: "I have not heard many historians and intellectuals who would have made it difficult for themselves to learn geography and history in their final year of vocational grammar schools."
A survey by Ifop, published on Saturday by the Humanité newspaper, showed that seven Frenchmen out of ten (69%) disagree with the government's project to abolish compulsory history and geography in the senior year specialty S, which is why many intellectuals and teachers have criticised the abolition, both the left and some members of the right.
The minister, on the other hand, added that he "does not take into account" to abolish the philosophy in the specialization program S graduation.
At the same time, Luc Khatel defended the reform in the education of teachers, while 16 organisations (students and unions) called for participation in Tuesday's mobilization against this project, which they believe will sacrifice the pedagogical education of future grammar school professors.
As part of his Master's degree 2 (M2), he will undergo an entrance exam focused on their field at the beginning of the year and another test at the end of the year to verify their ability to teach, the minister explained.
They will attend professional internships during their second year of master's degree and will perform as a professor-stage as a professor-stage student in their first year.
If you add up all the internships you will be offered to do before the admissions process, you will gain more experience with the pupils, almost 300 hours, he continued .
The minister also announced that he would propose a "personal right to education," which does not yet exist in national education.
He reaffirmed the project to cancel the school map by 2012.
At the elite École normale supérieure University, experts have 15 minutes to convince of the climate.
Fifteen minutes to present the goals of the Copenhagen Summit: this is a challenge announced on Saturday morning by Jean Jouzel, the vice-president of the Intergovernmental Group of Climate Experts for Climate Development (GIEC) at the instigator of the University of Ecole normale supérieure on Ulm Street.
As one AFP journalist reported, Nobel Peace Prize laureate Jean Jouzel opened the first of the "Ernest" conferences, a one-day seminar of 15-minute contributions from experts to be filmed and open to the public.
We wanted to do something to attract people and on the basis of which they would like to learn more, explained on the occasion of the conference 22-year-old Edouard Hannezo, one of the organizers of this seminar, which was named after the fish from the local pool, which was named by the students.
About 20 contributing experts from the various scientific disciplines will be selected, specifying that the selection is based on their charisma.
Climate warming "we can talk for hours, but we can also summarize the basic targets in a few minutes" said AFP Jean Jouzel, who spoke in front of fifty listeners without pre-arranged comments, using graphs.
It is part of our scientific work, he stressed with the hope that the audience would recognize that "the Codan conference relies on a very serious scientific foundation."
Videos shot at these lectures will be placed on the school's website from 15 December.
The next "Ernest" seminar is scheduled for February, and more will follow with regularity every two months.
Paying delays: angry prison guards, planned measures
The union of the prison guards announced a "general mobilisation" on Friday, as they are demanding that they be reimbursed for premiums and overtime by the Christmas holidays, the reimbursement of which was postponed to January for financial reasons.
The Prison FO (2nd unions of the guards) has asked staff who will not be on duty to attend a demonstration on Tuesday morning in front of the prison facilities and to "kick them up" to point out the "stealing of their wages."
The CGT for the Prison Supervisors (the sector's 3rd unions) called on them to "require rallies in individual prisons and start a major mobilization" with the "failure and unacceptable" not to be reimbursed in December for "overnight and holiday pay-off" in December.
The first union of the guards, the Federal Union of Prison Supervisors (Ufap/Unsa), "calls for the overall mobilisation (...) in order to show discontent and indignation."
The Administrative Directorates and the Ministry of Justice explain that the number of overtime increased a lot in 2009 and not all were included in the financial budget, but assure that the amounts due will be paid in January.
The chancellery said at the end of the day that Michèle Alliot-Mari had sent a memo to the prison guards' union assuring them that the payment would be made next month.
I know of the efforts that the prison staff are making to ensure the operation and modernisation of our prison system, the minister writes in her memo.
I have ordered the Administrative Directorate of Prisons to take immediate measures to prevent the situation from being incurred by the poor assessment of the number of overtime in the future, added Minister Alliot-Mari.
The December wage will therefore be low, with the exception of the managers who receive the famous bonuses for performing functions and the fulfilment of their goals, says Ufap/Unsa, and for those "several a place will always be found in the budget."
It is simply a scandal, the FO inter-regional union in Marseille was outraged, announcing its decision to boycott the "all meetings and summons" until further notice.
Workers will not come to work on Sundays or holidays, if the supplements for these days of the month of October are not reimbursed in December, as well as overtime, the FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne is also imminent.
At a time when we are being given more and more work and more tasks without giving us more staff available to us, it is sad to allow the lowest-ranking staff to pay for it, reports the CGT-prison guards in Bordeaux.
According to the unions, the situation is not the same in all regions, some of them are better off than others.
However, in any case, the funds of the jer few, were noted by the Secretary-General of Ufap, Jean-François Forget.
Obama says he's giving "better gifts" at Christmas than the ones he receives
US President Barack Obama, who is preparing for his first Christmas with his family in the White House, confided to Oprah Winfrey's "goddess" of the screen that he has a simple rule as far as gifts is concerned: "I give better gifts than the ones I receive."
The president and his wife, Michelle, spoke in a special edition of the show, which will air on ABC on Sunday night about how they are about to spend the Christmas holidays and the end of the year in their new and prestigious home.
Even Bo, the family's little four-legged companion gets his gifts.
Santa Claus also likes Boa, said Michelle Obama, noting that the dog will also receive a gift "of course," according to excerpts from the show's pre-transport.
And Michelle Obama also objected to her husband's claim on the quality of the gifts she receives: "Surely not, I gave you a fine gift last year," teased the president.
Well, of course, that's true, the president was forced to agree, but immediately afterwards he pointed his finger with humor to the pearl necklace of the first lady: "Who did this give you this?".
In this one-hour, very relaxed show with the famous presenter, who worked hard to support Barack Obama in his presidential campaign, Mr. and Mrs. Together, Mr. and Mrs. Together, they also talked about their unpopular gifts they received as children.
Barack Obama introduced a 10-step gearbox, but also a basketball league given to him for Christmas by his Kenyan father, whom he met very rarely.
I remember seeing my father who came to see us for Christmas and give me the basketball ball, the president told.
It wasn't until a long time after that I realized that he actually gave me the ball.
The first lady was remembering the dollhouse again.
I didn't know how to organize it all in the little house, so I lined up all the furniture along the wall instead of placing it around the fireplace, but I loved the little dollhouse, reminisced Michelle Obama.
Johnny Hally Head-on, RTL says he's in artificial sleep
Johnny Hally delivered re-hears in Los Angeles due to "injury" after a major surgery he underwent in France, but the situation is "under-check" according to his closest, while RTL reported that the singer was in artificial sleep to prevent pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rocker was re-dired on Wednesday night at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles after U.S. doctors noted the "injunction-ridden operation" of the sprawling disc he had in Paris on November 26, his press office told Paris, with these lesions requiring "right surgery."
However, the singer's press office sought to reassure the public and said the situation was "under-control" while announcing that a new medical communiqué would be issued within 48 hours at the latest.
According to RTL, which is the lead partner of the singer's last tour, Johnny Hallyday was put into artificial sleep to avoid "bolege and complications."
In 48 hours, when the patient opens our eyes, we'll be a little more sure, RTL adds.
The press office, when asked by AFP, did not confirm or comment on this information.
RTL also reports that according to "some sources" no drain was placed after the first operation in Paris.
The rocker was operated on at the Parc Monceau International Clinic due to a sprained disc.
The surgery, which had been scheduled for days in advance, was performed by neurosurgeon Stephan Delajoux, a doctor well known in artistic circles.
But the doctor was not available on Thursday to comment on RTL's information.
After the surgery, singer Johnny Hallyday was hospitalized Monday at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles for an infection that occurred after the hit.
Singer Eddy Mitchell, a close friend of Johnny Hallydaye, said on RTL radio on Thursday that his friend was going through a "bad time" but added that he was "not worried about the rocker" because he was a big "fighter."
He called me just before he left for Los Angeles, but I told him he was a stupid thing to do it because spending 12 hours on a plane after such an operation like this is no joke, Eddy Mitchell said.
On Wednesday night, the singer's producer, Jean-Claude Camus, was reassuring the situation, who said that Johnny Hallyday would "react well to antibiotics" and that the infection had been "stopped."
Mr. Camus also said that he had met Laeticia, the singer's wife, and that he had noticed no particular concern.
The singer's health problems have only been around since July, when he was hospitalized for nine days after he fell on his yacht.
Two months later, to everyone's surprise, it was revealed that Johnny Hallyday had been operated on to the "small tumor of the small intestine" and then a weak infection.
At the end of September, the singer returned to his long tour of the "Tower 66" which is presented as his farewell.
But since then, each of his health problems has been highly watched and commented on. Fans and journalists have noticed that the singer has difficulty moving on stage.
In mid-November, his team had to re-encry with the news of the new hospitalization.
Euro-2009/Little Pool: Prime Minister Bousquet in His Favorite Discipline
Frenchman Frédérick Bousquet, a three-time medalist at the 2009 World Championships in a Grand Pool, won the European Championships 2009 in a small swimming pool in a discipline in a specialty: 50m freestyle.
The first day of the Championships, on which the last time the jumpsuits are allowed, only three world records were set, although many more were expected.
One of them was beaten by Hungarian competitor Evelyn Verrasztová in the 200m semi-final and the two remaining men's relay team of the Russian in the 4x50 m semi-final.
A great grief for Bousquet, who took a look at the world record at the 50m freestyle in a free way, which he already holds in the large pool ($20.94).
In one of the two royal swimming disciplines, the 50m freestyle, the 28-year-old Frenchman won with a final time of 20.53 seconds in the final, at which the premiere was started by ten swimmers instead of the normal eight.
Bousquet defeated Croatian Duje Draganja (20.70) and Russian Sergei Fesikov (20.84), but failed to break the world record (20.30), as he had anticipated.
We can always dream of something better, but I said that if the world record is within my reach, I will try to do it.
Like Bousquet, almost all swimmers wore jumpsuits made of polyurethan, which would be banned from January 1.
The jumpsuits have helped to 238 world records since February 2008 and their era ends in Istanbul, which was the first to be hosted at the same competition in 1999.
The use of the coveralls this time did not help the German Paul Biedermann, the two-time world champion in the big pool in the summer in Rome, who had a world record at his fingertips.
The young swimmer failed to break the record he holds in the 400 metres freestyle (3:32.77), but still won with the second fastest time of his career (3:34.55), ahead of Russian racer Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and Dane-based Mads Glaesner (3:36.82)
I didn't give it my all.
I knew I would not break the world record this time, but I managed to defend my title and I did my job.
Lobintsev will be a serious contender for the future, Biedermann explained.
USA: Zola-based Romanesque sarcophagus' record for $1.5 million
A record of a Romanesque sarcophagus that belonged to none other than the French writer Emil Zola was auctioned for US$1.5 million on Thursday, which is significantly more than estimated, said art dealer Sotheby ́s.
The price of this two-metre-long and 63 cm high front desk, dating from the third century A.D. AD, was estimated at between $150,000 and $250,000.
Mramor "representing four Dionýs scenes in an elaborate architectural décor, surrounded by satyrs and bakchants is a rare work, there are very few similar pieces in the world, perhaps four or five," Florent Heintz, Vice-President of the Ancient Roman and Egyptian arts auction at Sotheby's, told AFP on Tuesday.
The work was sold among a hundred others.
The sale is still in progress, but it is the object to which the most bidder was bidding, Sotheby's spokesman, Dan Abernethy, told AFP.
The fact that Emile Zola got this marble was found a few days ago.
The record was in Rome for almost 300 years in Rome in the famous collection of the Borgia family and then gradually appeared with the French actress Cecile Sorelová, who decorated with her in a bathtub at her private hotel in Paris and with Paul Reynaud, the Minister of the Third Republic of France and briefly the President of the Council before the rise to power.
It remained there, shaded for about fifty years.
Florent Heintz discovered while searching the Louvre Museum's database that the record was part of the "sunit of the remains of Emil Zola" opened since 1903, a year after the death of the author "These Raquin" and the frescoes "Rougon-Macquart."
Interrupted attempt to leave President Zelay to go from Honduras to Mexico.
Mexico decided on Thursday that the conditions for the transport of ousted President Honduras, Manuel Zelay, to whom the rebels refused to provide a guarantee of safe departure, were not met.
After a phone conversation I had with President Zelaya last night, all indications are for the time being that there is no way to make this transfer, Mexican Minister of Foreign Affairs, Patricia Espinosa, said.
The Mexican government plane that flew back to El Salvador for President Zelaya on Wednesday, said a source of the Directorate-General for Migration.
The Putsch's government wanted to force President Zelaya to "demisi" and to apply for political asylum abroad, only to give him the chance to safely leave.
But the ousted president rejected those demands because he wanted to go to Mexico as the exile head of state.
The postman's government "did further fail a day when it wanted me to resign my post (...), they wanted me to resign," Zelaya told Globo radio on Thursday, in which he often commented on the political crisis that has been in this Central American country for five months.
I can stay here for ten years, I have my guitar here, the ousted president added, hidden in the Brazilian Embassy in Tegucigalpa for two and a half months and have played a few chords.
The embassy of Mexico has asked us to provide a safe transfer guarantee, but unfortunately we cannot accept that because it does not include an asylum application, the Interior Minister of the Putsch government, Oscar Raul Matute, said on Wednesday to HRN's radio.
I will not seek asylum for any country, Manuel Zelaya said in an interview with Telesur, which is based in Caracas.
If I ever leave Honduras, I will leave as the president of the Honduran people, he stressed.
The rumors of Zelaya's departure were mobilized on Wednesday by supporters of the ousted president who came to gather around the embassy of Brazil, where the military stepped up protection.
Brazilian Foreign Minister, Celso Amorim, criticized the position of the putschist government.
They show their marginal stance on international standards, he added.
Zelaya, who became close to the socialist Venezuelan president Hugo Chávez, was overthrown 28. June, the day he organized a public consultation in preparation for his re-election against the Supreme Court, the military and Congress's recommendations.
He unexpectedly returned from exile in Costa Rica on 21 September and found refuge in the Brazilian embassy.
If he comes out of here, he will be arrested and answerable for the crime of the "high treason" he is charged with, the putschist government says.
The Pučistic President Roberto Micheletti managed to organize the presidential election to replace President Zelay on November 29.
In the controversial election, recognized by the United States but convicted by Latin American countries like Venezuela, Argentina or Brazil, Porfirio Lobo won.
Three days later, Congress voted against President Zelay's return to power until the end of his mandate on January 27.
Wall Street rises, US trade balance encourages optimism
The New York Stock Exchange ended in an increase on Thursday, and the US trade balance results suggest a rise in both the United States and its partners: Dow Jones gained 0.67% and the Nasdaq 0.33%.
According to the final deadline, the Dow Jones Industrial Average improved from 68.78 points to 10.405.83 and the Nasdaq, with a technological dominance from 7.13 points to 2190.06.
The Standard & Poor 500 index improved 0.58% (6.40 points) to 1102.35.
We have good news coming from different parts of the economy, commented Lindsey Piegz of FTN Financial.
But we can't take it too seriously, she added, because the market is concentrated on "a half-full of glass."
For Peter Cardillo of Avalon Partners, investors are focused primarily on US trade balance numbers, "which show that activity improves in the fourth quarter."
The U.S. trade deficit fell by 7.6% in October from September to $32.9 billion.
Analysts, on the other hand, had expected an increase in the deficit.
There have been an increase in both imports and exports.
The big news is the growing volume of trade, especially the export of goods, which reflects the growth of the economies of the United States' main trading partners, said Christopher Cornell of the research firm Economy.com.
However, in the United States last week, unemployment rose against all expectations and the number of jobseekers reached 4474,000.
But in the past four weeks, the average number of new job seekers has fallen "the lowest this year," said Scott Marcouiller of Wells Fargo Advisors.
The securities market has also fallen.
The state treasury proceeds with a view to 10 years increased to 3.482%, up from 3.423% on Tuesday night, and the return to 30 years grew to 4.492%, up from 4.408% the day before.
Cuba : hundreds of regime supporters booed "Ladies in White"
Several hundred supporters of the Cuban regime booed the wives of political prisoners who met in Havana on the occasion of World Human Rights Day on World Human Rights Day on Thursday on Thursday, for which dozens of dissidents were arrested.
About forty "Dam in white," wives or close political prisoners, supporters of the Raulo Castro regime were booed right on the street as they marched toward the center of the capital, demanding the release of political prisoners, the journalist reported.
Down with the Yankees!, "Mencrates!", "The Street belongs to the revolutionaries!", "Long live Fidel and Raul!" the regime's adherents chanted with a raised fist to dissidents.
Dissidents were eventually escorted by plainclothes officers who came to "secure security."
The day before that, there was a similar rally against "I'llad in white" in Havana, but there were no injuries or arrests.
But in Havana's Vedado district, about ten plainclothes police officers were detained as many as they were also preparing to rally on Thursday on World Human Rights Day, AFP journalist reported.
According to this journalist, police loaded dissidents who were bevided by supporters of the government regime into civilian vehicles using force.
The arrest of dissidents in similar conditions lasts only a few hours from the rule.
The winners of the Sakharov European Parliament's 2005 European Parliament Prize, "Ladies in White" organized an unauthorised march for "pracking all of them, according to dissent, about 200 political prisoners," said one of their leaders, Laura Pollan, whose husband Héctor Maceda is serving a 20-year prison sentence.
Mr. Maceda is one of a group of 75 Cuban dissidents arrested in March 2003, 53 of whom remain behind bars.
Cuban authorities see the opponents as "mercenaries" or "agents" paid for by their arch-enemy, the United States.
A miracle done, Cuban television reported on Thursday's rally of supporters of the governing regime against the "oppens of the revolution."
Cuba, with the Communist Party at the head and the one-party government's policies, is regularly accused by European or American NGOs of disregarding human rights and freedoms, including freedom of speech.
A madman's knife-woman killed an 80-year-old man and injured 5 people in Clichy-la-Garenne.
A madman armed with two knives killed an 80-year-old man and injured five other people in the town of Clichy-la-Garenne (Hauts-de-Seine) at peak times on Thursday afternoon.
According to the preliminary results of the investigation, the assailant, aged 28 allegedly attacked an 80-year-old man in or before a pharmacy, 85 on 85 by the Boulevard, such is the version of the police and witnesses.
The severely injured old man, born in 1929, died of his injuries in hospital, according to the Alliance police syndicate.
In this pharmacy or in front of her, the attacker then attacked a pregnant woman and her partner.
The husband, aged in his 30s, began to defend himself and was injured.
The first two seriously injured victims were admitted to the same hospital in which an 80-year-old man died.
The life of the second injured is in danger, according to police sources, the vital organs were apparently hit.
The pregnant woman then collapsed and was taken to the hospital "in shock," a police source said.
The armed man, who appeared to be under the influence of alcohol or drugs, as a police source said, then fled to the street, still on the boulevard Jean Jaurès.
He injured two more people, apparently by accident: a 30-year-old and a forty-year-old man, the other man seriously.
How all this happened is not entirely clear, as it all took place in the evening.
He was armed with two butcher knives, which he carried crosses behind him, the head of the Alliance syndicate at Hauts-de-Seine, Arnaud Pressé, said at the scene.
Several passers-by, including young people, attempted to stop the lunatics and disarm, according to the testimony of the gathered AFP.
I saw a guy in a green jacket of about 30s.
Three young men were trying to catch him.
They failed to do so because he was quite strong, commented Alberto, a waiter from a nearby bar.
He was risen by a crowd, including a city police officer who had broken his wrist in the process, he added.
Still at the Boulevard Jean-Jaures, at the level of number 61, two city police officers, including their commander, attempted to detain an armed man while being wounded by fists, a police source said.
The incident occurred in one of the main streets in the Clichy-la-Garenne, where many shops are located.
Passers-by came to tell me there was an injured person outside.
I went out and saw a 70-year-old man on the ground, put him in a safe place, and noticed a big blow to my stomach, Frederic Allione, a 30-year-old pharmacist, told AFP.
Five minutes later, a second person in his 30s, who was also stabbed with a knife, came in.
A man who did not have his identity documents on him was eventually arrested by the state police.
The public prosecutor at Nanterre referred the matter to the investigative department of the Hauts-de-Seine Regional Police Department (SDPJ 92).
The suspect's attacker was taken to the hospital on Thursday night.
He's in custody awaiting questioning.
A police source did not rule out his placement in a psychiatric hospital.
Another police source said it was needed to handle him to handle him at the police station in Clichy, where he was taken.
He was "completely out of his hands" like "all lunatics of this type, whose strength in action increases tenfold ".
US: Polanski's lawyer again asks for prosecution to be completed
The lawyer for the Polish-French director Roman Polanski reapplied in Los Angeles (California, West of the United States) to halt the prosecution against his client, who is currently in his Swiss residence due to a moral affair that took place 30 years ago.
Chad Hummel, the director's attorney for the film "The Pianist," criticized before three judges of the appeals court of the second district in California, serious errors that occurred at the trial at the time of the events of 1977.
I demand that the prosecution be suspended now and immediately, said the lawyer, Hummel, adding that of the conduct of the judge who was ruling on the matter, Laurence Rittenband "went a chill in the spine."
According to him, the judge (who had already died in between) was allegedly to be in attendance with the prosecutor before the verdict, who told him that Roman Polanski deserved to go to prison – a serious offence against the rule of law.
Information about this interview appeared in the documentary "Roman Polanski: desired and wanted" (Roman Polanski, sought and sought), from the mouth of the public prosecutor himself, David Wells.
But Mr. Wells finally said at the end of September that he had "spoked" the author of the documentary.
If the court refuses to halt the criminal proceedings, the lawyer, Hummel, will demand the conduct of the trial, in which he will be able to produce evidence of his claim.
The prosecutor reiterated what had already been said at the first state, that there would be no serious study of the request to discontinue the prosecution until Roman Polanski appeared before the court.
The 76-year-old director fled the United States in 1978, before the court handed down his sentence in the "unlawful sexual intercourse" with a teenage girl aged 13.
He has never entered the United States again since.
A deputy prosecutor in Los Angeles, Phyllis Asayam, said Roman Polanski "should be there to attend the trial."
In this case, do we want to tell not only Romana Polaski, but also to other defendants that it is possible to escape? asks Mrs. Asayam.
He is of the opinion that the director "requires the court's kindness while contempting for its authority."
One of the three judges now having 90 days to take a decision also stressed "that there are other alternatives to escape."
The lawyer, Hummel, was not alone in asking for the prosecution of Roman Polanski to be discontinued.
The victim's attorney, Samantha Geimer, also again asked for the prosecution to be completed.
She recalled that her client would no longer bear the eternal harassment every time the Polanski case surfaced, adding: 'No one in this room can say that the trial was fair'.
Thirty-two years, that's enough."
Roman Polanski arrested on 26th September in Switzerland on orders from the US
After more than two months behind bars, he was placed under house arrest in his cottage in Gstaad, where he is awaiting possible banishment.
Wall Street ends without direction, hampered by rising dollar
The New York Stock Exchange ended without the odds on Friday, with the market roiling among indicators that are better than expected in the US and rising dollar price: Dow Jones gained +0.63%, but the Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
According to the final deadline, the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced from 65.67 points to 10.471.50 points and Nasdaq, with technological dominance leaving 0.55 points and finishing at 2.190.31.
The Standard & Poor's 500 index increased from 0.37% (4.06 points) to 1.106.41.
Frankly, the market is very calm, said Mace Blick Blicksilver of the Marblehead Asset Management.
It remains in a narrow margin, the volume of trade has decreased very much and I think it will remain so until the end of the year.
This trend was also confirmed by the publication of economic indicators that are better than expected and which "helped to improve the mood in the market in terms of stability of the economic recovery," the Charles Schwab analyte summarised.
In the US, retail sales rose by 1.3% in November for the second consecutive month and far more than expected.
According to a preliminary estimate by the University of Michigan index, US consumer confidence also returned, rising strongly to 73.4 in December against 67.4 in the previous month.
However, the indices were hampered by the new increase in the dollar price against the euro, which is the highest in two months, which "pushes downward sectors sensitive to the economic situation," said Owen Fitzpatrick of Deutsche Bank.
Thus, technology stocks are losing ground.
The securities market has fallen.
The yield on the state treasury with a view to 10 years rose to 3.540% compared to 3.482% on Wednesday night, and with a view to 30 years, increased to 4.497% compared to 4.492% a day earlier.
The Miss World Choice in South Africa again.
After traveling monthly across South Africa with 112 candidates for the Miss World title on Saturday, she is set to cross the target mark to reach her dream: to be voted the most beautiful woman in the world in front of a billion television viewers.
This great beauty celebration was held in the vicinity of Johannesburg for the second year running, and for the time being five candidates have won the semi-finals.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran Acosta of Mexico, Mariatu Kargboo of Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino of Gilbratar and Yanbing Ma of Canada were chosen by Miss Sport or Miss Top Model during their African sojourn.
It was a true whirlwind of events.
It was amazing to visit beautiful cities like Port Elizabeth, Durban or Cape Town.
I've seen a lot of things and I have so many experiences!, she confided in Miss Sierra Leone.
The competition, which takes place in South Africa for the ninth time, will be broadcast live from Midrando, in the north of Johannesburg, from 5 p.m. (f.World Time).
I couldn't dream a more beautiful country in which to put a crown on.
It was a fascinating experience.
I'm happy I could have experienced it twice, confided Miss World World to Ksenia Sukhin, in the hot South Summer.
For young Russia, her second stay in South Africa was in the spirit of numerous meetings with the other candidates and the new discovery of the country and its "rain that is taking the breath away."
After a month of performances, rehearsals, meetings with the press and safari, Miss is now focusing on the competition itself.
Indian Pooja Chopra hopes to go in the steps of Priyanka Chopra, elected in 2000, who is also participating in the election by Aishwarye Rai, the winner of 1994, who both became Bollywood's stars.
Being crowned as the most beautiful woman in the world is every woman's dream, but it's not just about appearance.
We are the ambassadors of my countries and I want to come home with the crown, says Miss Indie with a big smile.
According to the organizers, the 59th edition will be carried in the spirit of music and dance.
The candidates will be presented in traditional costumes and, of course, in a swimsuit.
The show will be presented by Chinese TV presenter Angela Chow, former South African beauty queen Michelle McLean and Miss World Committee chairman Steve Douglas.
South Africa has shown that it can welcome the world with a warmth that is difficult to cope, said Julia Morley, the president of the Miss World Competition.
As last year, the candidates took part in safari, visited the famous town of Soweto, this time by bicycle, and tasted the local cuisine.
The extraordinary event was a meeting with South African President Jacob Zuma, who shook their hands.
Unusual for the president, Miss Sierry Leone noted.
Undoubtedly the most beautiful memory of the draw in Cape Town (in the southwest of the country) for the World Cup, which will be held in June 2010, will remain the most beautiful memory, which helped the country to support the event a little more.
I could have met people I never dreamed of.
I will definitely return to the 2010 World Cup, says the Olympic Day Miss Italy with enthusiasm, Alice Taticchi.
According to son David, reports of Hallyday's condition are "very positive."
The news of Johnny Hallyday's condition is "very positive," as his son David assured us on his arrival at Los Angeles airport on Friday to visit his father, who has been hospitalized for days.
The news is very positive.
It is very strong and everything is going very well, said David Hallyday on his way out of the plane, which he flew from Paris moments after 1 p.m. local time (21pm world time)
The singer's son, who appeared calmly, said he would make the "as quickest" appearance as quickly as possible at the Los Angeles Hospital Cedars-Sinaï, to which Johnny Hallyday was admitted on Monday to an intervertested intervertested operation he underwent in Paris on November 26.
According to a press release, the singer's night in Los Angeles was "left into artificial sleep" for the sake of comfort to prevent pain and facilitate the administration of treatment.
Johnny Hallyday was already put into artificial sleep by the doctors at Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles. The hospitalization was due to an infection after an operation for an out-of-the-boxed intervertebral disc conducted in Paris on November 26.
Due to the serious damage caused by this intervention, the singer had to be operated on again during the night from Wednesday to Thursday.
According to an AFP photographer's information, his wife, Laetitici, attended a school performance of the French Lyceum in Los Angeles on Friday morning, attended by their daughter Jade.
The head of the orthopaedic surgery and trauma department at the hospital la Pitié-Salpêtrière, Yves Catoné, reported that he was flying to the singer in Los Angeles on Monday.
The producer heavily accused Stéphane Delajoux, a neurosurgeon, who operated on the singer on November 26 at the Clinique internationale duc Monceau in Paris.
We were told it was a massacre.
Surgeons from Los Angeles said they were outraged, M. Camus.
I've heard about the possibility of a future trial, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus believes that Johnny Hallyday"to went too quickly to Los Angeles with the permission of his Parisian surgeon."
I spoke to the doctor by phone, who assured me that this trip was no problem, which surprised me greatly, as I myself had already suffered from the short-term disc for the interverted disc, he added.
Moments earlier, he had said on the RTL radio station that the singer had apparently left the marble without a drain after the Paris operation.
Dr Stéphane Delajoux is well known in art circles.
He operated on actress Maria Trintignant in Vilnius a few days before her death at the Neuilly-sur-Seine clinic he was at the time.
In 2007, he also operated on actress Charlotte Gainsbourg when heathooma was removed as a result of a cerebral hemorrhage.
But he is also a dark-havorred doctor, convicted several times in cases of medical forgery, tax evasion and fraud.
The medical association's attorney for the medical chamber, Olivier Metzner, called him a "no scoreless man" who is "regularly" summoned in front of the medical chamber, and who cannot be "far recommended."
After a few days of silence, Dr Stéphane Delajoux commented on the matter through his lawyer, David Koubbi, on Friday.
He announced that the procedure had a "completely good run" and the post-operative examination was "normal."
The operation was not of a hemorrhagic nature, so the introduction of the drain was not necessary," he added.
The singer's health problems have been mounting since this summer, and in any case, his next tour seems to remain with a question mark.
It is clear that the date of the resumption of the planned tour on January 8 (in Amiens) appears too close, Camus said.
UDF is increasing the tone and calls on the Nouveau Centre to take no further advantage.
UDF, controlled by MoDemFrançoise Bayrou, responded to an attempt by Nouveau Centre, Hervé Morin, to take the acronym of the former Giscard Party on Friday, saying that the abbreviation must not be used in any medium under threat of prosecution.
Hervé Morin publicly announced his intention to claim the abbreviation of the UDF, saying that François Bayrou did not deserve to be carried by his heritage after he extended his hand to the left.
The Defence Minister, whose party is a partner of the UMP, planned to confirm the strategy on Saturday before the National Council of the Nouveau Centre (NC).
His move received support from Hervé de Charettt (former za-UMP now for NC), who credits UDF ownership because he first registered it at the National Institute of Industrial Property (l'Institut national de la propriété industrileylielle) in 2004.
But on Friday evening, the UDF Association committee, run by friends of François Bayrou, who have no intention of being expropriated, withdrew from his silence and made a formal request to both the Minister and the MP to stop using the abbreviation and to hand back the ownership of the trade mark, under threat of prosecution.
In recent days, you have increased the disturbing statements about proposing to your political movement +the exchange rate of UDF to take over the acronym +from the Arabic, writes the Association in its letter signed by 19 of the 24 committee members, such as the MoDem's François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez, or Senator Jean Arthuis of the Alliance centriste.
At the same time, you considered it appropriate to place the name+Nouveau centre+ on your promotional material and on the welcome website of your movement, with the slogan +UDF of today+, the letter's signatories also note.
As you know, you have no right to use this abbreviation, explains the UDF Committee, which asks the NC"imovement to remove all references to the name UDF from all promotional material including (his) website."
At the same time, he asks Hervé de Charette 'to hand over the ownership of the trademark to the legitimate owners'.
If you do not do so, we will go to the courts to respect the law and the legitimate rights of the members of the UDF, the signatories point out.
In their letter, they state that UDF "is a full-fledged political movement in 1978 "and recall that Mr. Morin and his friends "listed" leaving in 2007 " to create a competitive movement, as others in 2002 to establish the UMP.
The Nouveau centre movement therefore has no right, according to them, to use the acronym UDF (Union pour la démocratie française).
At the same time, they recall that the last congress of the UDF voted in 2007 to join the MoDem for three years and to create a committee to defend the "moral and material interests" of the association founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As for Hervé de Charette, the committee continues "when he registered the trade mark," he was "for three years as a member of the UDF" but UMP.
He scandalally and fraudulently used the non-existent acronym registration to do so on his own account.
This indiscretality is beginning to be transformed into a criminal offence, they claim, and then make ironic comments on the NC strategy: "It seems to us that both in politics and in everyday life it is more valuable to create a name for yourself than to withdraw from the anonymity by the fraudulent acceptance of a name to which we have no right."
The case of Liliane Bettencourt: François-Marie Banier will be tried for misuse of a state of weakness.
The Nanterre court decided on Friday to try the artist François-Marie Banier and pass on a verdict on whether he had used the 80-year-old billionaire's weakness to deprive her of part of her fortune, which is blamed by her daughter Liliane Bettencourt.
The photographer (62 years), known for his photographs of the famous, will be on trial on 15 and 16 April 2010 for the misuse of a state of weakness, a felony for which a maximum sentence of 3 years and a fine of €375,000.
This decision confirms that there will indeed be a trial in a case that can be described as a family saga of one of the richest families in France in which the mother and daughter are attacked and the management of the cosmetics empire L'Oréal is being challenged.
However, the 15th criminal court also ordered a medical examination of 87-year-old Liliana Bettencourt, to be carried out by a college of three doctors.
The heiress and the main shareholder of L'Oréal have always refused to undergo such an examination, certainly not under the terms offered by the public prosecutor's office in Nanterre during the investigation.
The doctors who will be elected on Friday should produce a report by 10 March 2010 and at the same time submit comments on whether Liliana Bettencourt could have been in a state of weakness and in what period.
I think he'll take it.
I will speak to her about the matter, said Mrs Bettencourt's lawyer, Georges Kiejman, the lawyer.
As for the lawyer, François Bettencourt-Meyers, Olivier Metzner, the court's decision was welcomed.
It's excellent news(...). Expertiso will show that he has manipulated this old lady in need of protection (M. Banier), confirmed.
It is two years since Liliana Bettencourt's only daughter opened criminal proceedings against François-Marie Banier, a photographer and an all-rounder, whom she accused of using her mother's state of weakness for years to get a gift of €1 billion in the form of cheques, life insurance contracts, or paintings by the masters.
Liliane Bettencourt, on the other hand, has always denied being manipulated by the photographer she considers a long-term friend.
While the court had to assess the legitimacy of the lawsuit filed by Mrs Bettencourt-Meyers, the attorneys' courtroom at the time was changed to the family hour of truth.
Liliana Bettencourt's lawyer, he submitted three letters to her client (in 1999, 2003 and 2005), to a notary, in which she expressed her distrust of her husband, Françoisa Bettencourt-Meyers.
In a 2003 letter, Liliane Bettencourt adds, according to the attorney's attorney, "you could explain to my daughter that I wrote to Banier once or twice a day for fifteen years.
Ever since she got married, I've never been able to speak to Françoise."
The public prosecutor's office in Nanterre reunited that the complainant's actions were not justified, all the more so because the guardianship judge had these days rejected her request to initiate the procedure for her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "is quite capable of attending the court, not under protection or custody.
No one else will act for her," confirmed the prosecutor's office, Marie-Christine Daubigney.
The court ultimately decided to comment on Ms Bettencourt-Meyers's legitimacy at the time of the trial.
A management revolution or an end to economic intelligence?
If nothing changes in the management of the major French companies, our fight to develop economic intelligence has been pointless...
For more than a decade, it has been reminding the behaviour of large companies' management towards employees' approach to consumers by companies before the marketing revolution: the issue is for co-workers to identify with the "values" destined for the mountain, as was the case before, when the consumer had to be forced into products that emerged from the ideas of the heads of factory technicians.
By becoming the center of business companies, the marketing revolution has compared the marketing revolution's market-leading strategy in the right direction...though authoritarian efforts to impose products, different from customer preferences, come back on a regular basis!
The employee's passive approach can lead to deadly demoralization.
Suicides in France Telecom, PSA or Renault are just the visible part of a much more widespread general phenomenon that emits predominantly managerial cadres.
This demobilization adversely affects the development of all of the company's intellectual functions, including R&D, and more importantly, economic intelligence.
And indeed, EI "requires from all stakeholders (...) the active approach and the ability to anticipate" and requires employees to make commitments that are completely at odds with the income of authoritarian management.
We are therefore calling for a managerial revolution, which would aim to put workers at the centre of interest of the business as well as the client.
The relative usefulness of internal opinion polls.
Internal opinion polls - as a questionnaire presented to Orange's employees - will contribute to the revolution in managerial practices?
Unfortunately, I'm afraid not.
Mainly because I have already convinced myself that in the face of the new situation, the structure will return after various turns as a priority to... what they have always done!
Furthermore, because authoritarianism, as one of the pathologies of power, is increasing in proportion to the seriousness of its own failures.
Finally, because most of the managers have a simplified view of human behavior.
Because they are graduates of the universities for engineers, they have a mechanical interpretation of psychology.
For reasons of thought convenience, they adopt an old behaviorist theory, now reanimated by "unhearsal" from the US and widely disseminated without much knowledge by the scientific institutes and the media.
With the fact that it is possible to move the "pic" of the managers' involvement, a recent Ipsos survey showed on the website Figaro.fr, which only reinforces the managers in their position of mechanical management, unsuitable for today's world.
Identify and measure the mobility factors.
On the contrary, the managerial revolution necessary for the proper functioning of modern businesses presupposes the adoption of a final vision of human behaviour.
It consists in incorporating a basic observation in all the aims and practices of management: Entitlement obligations to the business will only be possible for employees if they appear to be a clear means of achieving their dreams, ambitions and projects.
Currently, this concept of motivation of employees is only covered by studies Motively functional analysis.
These studies have shown that they evaluate their businesses on the basis of a predetermined doixe that will enable them, through an image that speaks to the business, to evaluate what it offers them to realise their life's goals.
By identifying and measuring these mobility factors, executives can control, anticipate and anticipate their "social performance" and bring their human resource management "on the right path."
In doing so, it creates a breeding ground for the development of solid and effective economic intelligence.
By the Oslo speech: "just war," Obama has earned praise from the right.
The American right on Friday welcomed the speech Barack Obama gave the day before in Oslo, satisfied that the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize Winner defended the concept of a "fair war" against the enemies of the United States.
The Conservatives, who at first mocked the award for the award to Obama 9. October, this time, they applauded the presidential address, including Sarah Palin, the former vice-president's nominee in the 2008 election.
I liked what he said, Palin, the muse of the right-wing Republican wing, told USA Today, adding that she herself had expressed herself on the subject "sometimes necessary" in her memoirs, which are now being published.
Of course, war is the last thing the Americans would like to have to do, but it is necessary.
All terrorists need to be detained there, he believes.
President Obama, who inherited two wars in Afghanistan and Iraq from his predecessor, George W. Bush, on Thursday in Oslo, justified sending forces and used a speech to clarify his decision to send an additional 30,000 troops to Afghanistan nine days before.
Another of Obama's opponents, Newt Gingrich, assessed that the president had done a "very good job" in Oslo.
I think the speech was really very good, congratulated by the former Speaker of the House of Representatives, who particularly appreciated the President's mention of the 'existence of evil in the world'.
In a way, I considered this speech to be entirely historic, Gingrich said during the interview on the radio show "The Takeaway."
The former MP, whom some consider a possible Republican candidate in the 2012 presidential election, was delighted to see the "left-wing president" reminds members of the Nobel Prize committee," that they themselves would not be free to present the Peace Prize award if the use of forces did not exist."
According to Michael Gerson, the former author of speeches, George W. Bush, now the Washington Post editor, Obama gave a "very American speech."
Not only did he introduce himself as a "salt-creature" as he always has, but "he spoke as the American president" and reminded Europeans " that they live in a safe bubble that they did not create themselves, and that they do not do too much to preserve," Gerson assessed.
Among the few right-handed discontent are the Bush era's hawkher, former UN ambassador John Bolton, who called the speech "unseparated, pompous and no inspiration," as he said on the National Review Online website.
To the President's left, Democratic representative Dennis Kucinich is appalled at the sight of Barack Obama justifying the use of forces.
"If we wrap the war in the cover of justice, we can easily justify the massacre of innocent people," he warned.
However, the mid-left press holds a laudatory position against the president.
Although the Los Angeles Times continues to find the Peace Prize award premature to be premature to Obama, it has assessed its output as a "superfitting" even for the speaker known for his talent.
The Oslo speech should serve as a guide to international decisions in conflict resolution, in the fight against poverty and oppression," the California daily reports fervently.
Obama "came to the speech he needed to," the New York Times reviewed, calling the speech "as simple and instructive."
Road carriers: three marathons to deal to rescue the supply of supplies for Christmas.
After three negotiating marathons, the union of the road hauliers and the TLF, the only employers' organisation left until the end, came to an agreement on Friday evening to end, which ended the call for a strike and a threat that hung over the supply of supplies for Christmas.
The Secretary of State for Transport, Dominique Bussereau, expressed "radity" at the signing of the agreement on Friday after several negotiations that began on Wednesday morning.
After the second night of the discussion, the negotiators dispersed early Friday morning with the hope that the text of the agreement would be signed as quickly as possible as quickly as possible at the end of the morning.
This is despite the fact that three employers' organisations (FNTR, Unostra, OTRE) withdrew from the meeting.
But it took another six hours of meeting, which began at 11 a.m. to all agree and sign the agreement at 6 p.m.
This conflict would "wild up very harm" the conflict and "there would be a danger that the holidays would be disrupted at the end of the year," Bussereau said.
The text's text includes a 4% wage increase for the lowest salaries (for local and regional road transport) and 2.9% for the highest salaries (international transport).
The hourly wage for the lowest salaries is rising from €8.72 to €9.06.
It's not much, but there's a lot of effort behind it, Patrice Clos (FO) explained.
Tonight, we're going to give our members an order to avoid blockades, no blockades of supply centers.
But there may be a few more opponents who are not satisfied," he added.
Philippe Grillot, president of the TLF, welcomed the "right agreement," although it was difficult to admit a high-level increase in terms of international competition ".
According to him, there will be an increase of 170 euros per month for the lowest wages and by 100 to 120 euros for the highest ones.
This is an agreement of common sense and respect for employees, CMaxime Dumont (CFDT) said, while Thierry Douine (CFTC) welcomed the "historical agreement."
According to Richard Jaubert (CGT), this is a "acceptable compromise."
The agreement also foresees a revaluation of travel expenses of 3% and a report on the state of road transport situation in the first half of 2010, which will also allow a focus on the issue of 13th salary and the modernisation of the collective agreement.
Bussereau recalled the "reduction of €100 million in taxes on business wages" that was the subject of the government's amendment to the draft Budget Bill 2009 voted on the night of Thursday to Friday by the National Assembly.
The government will ask the Senate for a "sensible" vote.
The signing allows this Agreement to apply first to undertakings that are members of that organisation, later to the entire field, in the event of an extension by the Ministry of Labour.
It will take place "at the earliest possible date," Bussereau assured.
The whole process can only be hampered by the opposition of employers' organisations.
The FNTR talks of "bad trade" as €100 million "already the sector has been offered as part of the carbon tax compensation."
The Secretary of State for Transport forced us to act in an emergency session not as a result of the analysis with the mutual analysis, but to avoid flaring turkeys with the eaters of the time approaching the Christmas holidays, Unostra complained.
For the Otre organization, the agreement threatens to "buil a large number of small and medium-sized enterprises in the field" in the next 12 months.
Suburban trains RER A: traffic interruptions at the weekend, unions dissatisfied with the proposals of the transport company RATP.
The interception of traffic on the RER A commuter line, which is the city's largest public transport line in France, will continue over the weekend, as Friday's talks between the unions and the RATP management did not lead to any specific results in the issue of the premium request for the second day of the strike.
On Saturday and Sunday, the days of an important shopping weekend before Christmas, the trains will only run between 10 a.m. and 8 p.m., every other train will run on the main section (between La Défence and Nation), leaving only one of the four trains, outside this section.
The link with SNCF will be interrupted at Nanterre Préfecture and passengers will be forced to transfer to another train.
Galeries Lafayette's commercial stores, which expect over 200,000 customers every day, welcomed the fact that "the RATP was trying to secure a connection with the big department stores."
The RER A line runs from the west to the east of the Paris agglomeration.
The RATP section is run from Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre to Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, there was one of the two trains in the top of the open, and virtually no train was off-peak during the time, as planned.
As on Thursday, the people of Ile de France arranged differently and there was no confusion on the platforms.
So early in the morning there were far fewer people than usual in the station Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines), among other things because the pupils and students were absent.
Jack Nbakina, engineer, 29 from Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne) explained that he had risen "an hour and a half earlier to be sure he'd arrived on time."
The station of Saint-Lazare was not overcrowded, the state railway SNCF announced, as a larger number of order administrators and vigilantes were predicted.
Suburban RER A trains operated by the SNCF in the direction from or to Cergy-Le-Haut arrived or departed from Saint-Lazare station with a transport to the metro.
The next general meetings of the strikers will be held on Saturday and Sunday to assess the results of Friday's afternoon meeting with the management, which the unions have rated "weakly."
The RER management proposes negotiations on a special protocol for the RER A suburban trains in all respects, the organisation of working hours, career progress, etc.
However, this is not the issue for drivers who are demanding the well-deserved bonus, according to Thierry Garon (Unkempt.
RATP even postponed the bonus proposals for the time being, which was scandalized by the CGT, with the management "not capable of solving the problem, while travelers and SNCFs could do so."
At a new meeting scheduled for Monday, "they will review the conditions of the profession" with closer inspection," the transport undertakings RATP clarified.
Which was the reason why trade unionists think the business is "smoking fun of the weekend's passengers."
In the morning, about 150 drivers were seized by a company committee at his Paris headquarters.
The leadership, which until now has so far refused any discussion during the strike, has therefore decided to meet in order to "reassietify."
There is a danger that the conflict will spread to the RER B line on Tuesday, after Unsa and the Independents announce the strike alert.
The unions are asking for a premium worth of between €120 and €150 (€150 of them, of which €30 of the variables (CGT, FO, CFDT, Sud (South), Indépendants (Independents)) and make it difficult for them to deteriorate working conditions on this route, which carry a million passengers a day.
RER suburban train drivers earn between €2,200 and €7,700 of gross wages and €600 to €650 of premiums for irregular hours and for work on Sundays and holidays.
The Turkish judiciary has dissolved the Kurdish side, and the decision carries severe consequences.
Turkey's Constitutional Court decided on Friday to abolish the country's main pro-Kurdish party. This decision immediately triggered protests in the Kurdish community in the southern-East country and in Istanbul.
This decision can greatly complicate the task of a government that seeks to give the Kurdish community a friendly hand to try to end 25 years of conflict.
The Democratic Society (DTP) party was dissolved because it became "a nest of activities threatening the independence of the state and its indivisible unity," Chief Justice Chief Justice Hasim Kilic told reporters after four days of negotiations.
The decision was taken unanimously by 11 judges, with a majority-seven votes to be dissolved, Kiliç said, adding that 37 party cadres, including its president, Ahmet Türk, and MEP Aysela Tugluk, were banned from participating in political life for five years.
At the same time, the judge announced the lifting of the parliamentary immunity of Mr Türk and Ms Tugluk and the confiscation of the party's assets by the Ministry of Finance.
The DTP has 21 seats in the Parliament (out of 500).
The party leadership had already warned before the verdict that MPs would rather leave Parliament than act as political-affiliated MPs.
The decision is a continuation of the trial initiated in 2007 by the Prosecutor of the Court of Cassation, Abdurrahman Yalcinkay, accusing the DTP of obedience to the "gures" of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which Ankara and many countries consider a terrorist organisation.
Many observers believe that the DTP is a legal political display case for the PKKK rebels.
The party assures that it has no "basic association" with the PKK, but refuses to label it as a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate with it.
The court's verdict comes as the government gives the Kurdish community a friendly hand and offers a series of measures to strengthen their rights and attempt to limit the support of the Kurds against the PKK to end the conflict.
DTP leadership has confirmed that the dissolution of the party could lead to a resumption of tensions in southeastern Anatolia, where many demonstrations have turned to the conditions under which PKK leader Abdullah Öcalan is being held to clashes with the police.
Since the announcement of the justice decision, thousands of demonstrators have gathered outside the DTP headquarters in Diyarbakir, a large city in the south-east inhabited by the predominantly Kurds.
Police used tear grenades and water cannons, and protesters threw Molotov cocktails or shot stones from slingshots.
Also in Istanbul, about a hundred people demonstrated.
After the verdict was reached, Mr Türk said that the decision of the justice would only be "defected by despair."
Turkey cannot resolve this issue with a ban on the party, he said in the press.
The government, formed by a party emerging from the Islamist movement, also condemned the decision.
We are on the groundhog against party disruption.
It solves nothing, said Minister of Energy Taner Yildiz.
This decision is a complete shattering of democratic proposals launched by the government, commented political scientist Ahmet Insel.
Of course, we may see a reaction from the PKK, he added.
On Thursday, the PKK claimed responsibility for one of the most deadly attacks in the north of Turkey, which killed seven soldiers three days earlier.
Snow may come
Pretty crispy winter, that's what Wolfgang Brauburger wants.
Not because he would like to bully citizens, says the head of the FES Technical Services Department of Winter.
But to allow his employees to test and learn how to control all the vehicle technology.
This could happen for the first time this weekend, according to meteorologists.
Over 300 employees and 120 vehicles are ready to take care of the snow and ice.
In doing so, the FES is proceeding according to the exact plan.
As it snows across the board in Frankfurt and temperatures drop below zero, they will go to 20 so-called A sections of the Air Pulgators, Brauburger explains.
These sections include main and transit routes such as Neue Weg and Hanauer Landstraße.
But also arrivals for firefighters, commuter public transport lines, pedestrian areas and descent sections like Atzelbergstraße.
The FES service starts at 3 a.m.
If necessary, it is necessary to sprinkle with damp salt, which is better held, for a maximum of three hours, something like 1040 kilometres.
That's why the FES starts at 3 a.m. at night, "so that the roads are clear when the right to get to work."
It's hard when it only starts to snow at 7:30.
Then we have a problem, says the head of the Winter Technical Services Department, "because no one is willing to make room for the sprinklers."
Only when they do not snow so much are the driveways and interconnection communications, which also include Rat-Beil-Straße.
The last priority is the side and the secondary roads.
Brauburger knows they'll be complaining.
At five o'clock in the morning, the FES foot soldiers will set off, preferably cleaning up dangerous places and crosswalks.
The FES usually can't take care of all the bike paths.
There is a special service in Frankfurt that mainly tracks bridges from 22 to 4.30, says Brauburger.
With ice forming fast on them, the sprinklers start out as soon as the temperature drops below two degrees.
If necessary, they will be called by the police.
Cradle of the dinosaurs
Tawa hallae looked like a lot of other carnivorous dinosaurs: The animal two meters long and 1.50 meters high ran on two thick hind limbs, had a long, short, curved skull with sharp, curved legs, sickle-like clawed and a long tail.
If this species had lived a few million years later, it would have been nothing out of the ordinary.
Sterling Nesbitt of the University of Texas, Austin, and colleagues in Thursday's edition of Science magazine, write that Tawa hallae was one of the first dinosaurs with these bodily features.
The animal lived about 215 million years ago in what is now New Mexico, which was then in the equatorial dry dry area of the supercontinent Pangea.
Tawa opens a new window to the earlier evolution of the dinosaurs, says Nesbitt.
He shows us a lot about family relationships, the extensions and signs of early dinosaurs.
In 2006, Nesbitt and other paleontologists began excavations at Ghost Ranch in the north of New Mexico.
Sometime in one day we found a dozen dinosaur bones, this is unprecedented for the sediments of the Triassic, team member Randall Irmis of the Museum of Natural History in Utah informs.
Some of the bones were quickly identified by scientists as a new species.
During the excavations, they collected the remains from a total of five individuals.
The discovery is confirmed by the theories of the early history of the dinosaurs.
The name "Tawa" comes from the Hopi Indian sun god.
To Sterling Nesbitt, this is an unusual find: "Foids of the dinosaurs from the Triassa are very rare, mostly there are only individual fragments."
Other dinosaur experts do not share this enthusiasm without reservation.
This finding is not particularly sensational, but it confirms some of theories about the early history of dinosaurs, says Martin Sander of the University of Bonn.
In its current scientific opinion, dinosaurs first appeared some 230 million years ago.
But many of the oldest fossils are not complete, so the assignment of pradininaurs is mostly questionable.
Experts discuss, for example, when the lizards split into the three most important development lines: the carnivorous theropods, which later included the Tyrannosaurus rex, Velociraptor, as well as the birds, the "long-dry" four-legged sauropods and their relatives, and the herbivores Ornithischia (birds), which included the likes of Triceratops and Stegosaurus.
Tawa hallae is the original therapy route after the analysis of Nesbitt and his colleagues.
It exhibits an interesting combination of primitive and advanced properties, says Nesbitt.
On the Tawa hallae skull, researchers found evidence of aerial bags, which is also held by offspring of the teropods by birds.
Air sacs make bird breathing more effective than mammals.
At Tawa hallae, the bones of the spine were apparently partly filled with air.
Tawa is the oldest and most primitive theropod with air bags, says Randall Irmis.
As the related line of huge sauropods later also had air bags and light bones, this useful innovation was probably created by the common ancestor of the two groups.
At least three migratory waves to North America
Because the most recent known dinosaurs lived in South America, scientists inferred that the lizers had first appeared there.
According to this, the three evolutionary lines were already divided up early and spread from South America to all the continents that, then as Pangea's super-continent, formed a single earth mass.
It would also be said by the fact that the team, along with Tawa hallae, found the remains of two more, not especially closely related to the theatres.
The three of them can't come from one common, emulated ancestor, the scientists argue.
We believe there have been at least three migratory waves to North America, says Alan Turner of the American Museum of Natural History in New York, co-author of the scientific study.
Of course, there are also contradictions.
One of the older species, Silesaurus, which belongs to a group of the most severe dinosaurs, lived in today's Poland, says Bonn paleontologist Martin Sander.
His conjecture could put together a distorted image, because very many primitive dinosaur fossils have been preserved in South America, with rare times on other continents.
As the dinosaurs proved, that they had evolved from a relatively rare secondary line of the royoxe family to the ruling vertebrates on the ground in the days of the Earth's Middle Ages, it still remains a puzzle.
During the triass, the dinosaurs shared their living space with many other reptiles, such as the ancestors of today's crocodiles and flying lizards and countless other lizards.
Around the end of the triass, the dinosaurs spread around the world and evolved many new species, while the relatives died out and the interface of the Triassa and the Jurassic.
The history of success did not last forever
There are two hypotheses to explain this change, says Martin Sander.
There could have been a mass extinction that the dinosaurs accidentally survived, but the reptiles did not.
Or the dinosaurs had adapted better, so they could have pushed out the competition.
In any case, the history of success did not last forever.
150 million years later, the meteorite's impact helped another group of animals that had also developed into the triasso and had lived in the shade ever since: the mammals.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and the signatories are international.
The list includes professors at the University of Toronto, the University of Cambridge, the University of Vienna, and Berkeley, California.
Associate professors from Naples, Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Bremen joined.
The police evacuation of the occupied casino of Frankfurt's Goethe University has caused a global uproar.
The 278 professors and teachers of the University of Goethe, as well as universities across Germany, Europe, and North and South America, have been solidarised with protesting students at the Westend campus.
In a statement written in German and English, they "did not praise" the presidium-imposed police intervention.
Because the walls and arts were scrawled, the university's president, Werner Müller-Estler, had the building occupied last week by striking students and lecturers cleared.
At the same time, five students were injured.
Damaged things, the signatories say, do not justify the "violent dissolution of self-organized teaching of students and teachers by the police squad."
The eviction represents an "unacceptable intervention" in the freedoms of research and science.
The exclusive focus on vandalism is used to "unlegalize and criminalize the protest" and draw attention to the content.
The presidium avoided the necessary discussion.
The lecturers call for a halt to the prosecution.
It is claimed that most of the strikers did not support the material damage.
A Qualified Protest
The youth of the trade union Verdi and the German trade union are also solidarising with students.
The protest is a legitimate expression of growing concern for one's own future, says the mysterious Earth Youth, Verdi Alexander Klein.
Meanwhile, the Hessian Minister of Science, Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU), has defended the advance of the university president and the police.
We are grateful to the University President.
Destroying and casting are completely unacceptable means, she said at Aktuellen Stunde (Current Hour) at the Wiesbaden Landtag on Thursday.
We are sympathetic to the protest, but we have no sympathy for vandalism, said the member of the Landtag for the CDU, Peter Beuth.
Otherwise, the opposition factions of the SPD, the Greens and Linke saw it.
The CDU takes painted walls to blame for the protest to criminalize the protest, said Janine Wissler (Linke).
Instead of looking at the arguments and demands of the learners, there was a vacancy.
Linke has filed a motion urging the Home Secretary to report on the police deployment.
New Silicon-Valley
For years, it had been in contention for a secret city, inaccessible to visitors from the West.
Zelenograd, one of the ten districts of the capital of Moscow, in the Soviet Union, it was a strictly guarded site where secret weapons research was conducted.
Today, this county with a population of 216,000, 37 kilometres from the Moscow city centre, is considered to be the "Russian Silicon Valley."
There are significant micro- and nanoelectronic research and production centres.
Since September 2008, Green Nazi representatives have made contacts with the Riedberg Science Centre in Frankfurt - with university institutions and the firms of the Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ).
There were several mutual visits and on Wednesday they signed the "Protocol of Close Cooperation" in Frankfurt in Frankfurt Zelengrad.
The Russian delegation was led by Moscow's Vice Mayor Yuri Rosly and the prefect of Zelengrad, Anatoly Smirnov, with the lead planning officer, Edwin Schwarz, who was responsible for Frankfurt.
In 2010, representatives of FIZ and SMEs engaged in science research will go to Zelengrad.
Scientific exchange
This is a continuous scientific exchange.
But it is also about economic relations.
The FIZs will be allowed to catch on the growing Russian market.
In contrast, Russian science firms want to get contracts in Germany.
Zelenograd is the seat of major Russian research institutes and companies.
These include the Moscow Institute of Electronics, the large concerns Sitronics and Rossiyskaya Elektronika.
The district was founded in 1958 as a so-called "socialist planned city" for weapons research.
Zelenograd (literated translation "The Green City") has acquired its name from the wooded hilly landscape in which the research facilities are set.
Stuttgart brake
The Stuttgart 21 dimension is not at all prepared enough.
For the project's supporters, this is quite simply a 'new heart of Europe'.
All right. The S21 is more than the launch of the station, a more than monstrous structure that will plunge the capital of Baden-Württemberg into desperate building chaos for a century.
Stuttgart 21 was made up of the spirit of the 1980s.
The headquarters stations with the tracks that ended up in the city centre were then considered to be 19th-century transport-technical fossils, which act as the brakes of modern rail transport, because it took an enormous amount of time to re-run the locomotives from the rear.
Go, stop for a while, keep going - that's how it should work.
And that's why the head stations are disappearing: Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: the transit station, which lies about halfway down the route of the trans-European railway road between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava - hence the slogan about the "hero of Europe."
Indeed, the S21 is about to start, although the visions of the 1980s are no longer compatible with reality.
The very ambitious designers themselves recognized that in the Hessen and Bavarian cities, the start of construction was almost unfunded.
Since modern shuttle trains have been in place with motor and control vehicles at both ends, the head stations no longer have trouble getting through and leaving.
Still: It starts with Stuttgart 21, including the new ICE to Ulm line.
It was pushed by the country's and municipal politicians.
The tracks cooperate, also because the risks of the largest individual infrastructure project in the country are borne by the taxpayer and not by the state group.
Urbanistically, the project can be excused in some way.
There will be a new urban space that - if we believe the designer's computer images - will contain a lot of greenery.
For the rail transport system, the S21 is harmful.
The passable railway station and the construction of the line are designed for passenger transport, which - typically in the 1980s - was attributed to a tremendous increase.
Back then, there was no competition for cheap flights.
But a modern transport policy must be about strengthening freight transport in the first place, because rail transport is far greener than the lorry on the road.
But the new line is not suitable for freight trains due to the steep climbs.
More seriously, the S21 indirectly touches on a lot of other rail projects.
The Cockroach was to be buried a good six billion euros.
That's the official number.
Experts consider ten to 15 billion to be realistic.
It is clear that in the next decade there will be a shortage of funding for more knot points and bottlenecks in the network.
There are sixty larger projects on the list of the Ministry of Transport.
One of the most important is the construction of the roughly 180-kilometer route through the Rhine valley.
It has been built on this route at a slow pace since 1987.
This would be where you'd need a hard push.
But the S21 will be a brake.
The line through the Rhine valley will become the throat of a bottle of international freight transport: right in the heart of Europe.
Government examines airport ruling
The country's government has left the Wiesbaden Landtag Open to see if it goes against the judgment of the Hessen Administrative Court of Justice (VGH) regarding the ban on night flights and has it revised.
The CDU/FDP coalition has instructed experts to legally assess the more than 400-page VGH ruling, said Economy Minister Dieter Posch (FDP).
VGH in Kassel wrote today on the grounds that the state would have to re-register the night's ban on flights in the event of the planned northwest runway of Frankfurt Airport.
The authorisation of 17 flights between 23 and 5 p.m., as foreseen by the Landtral, does not correspond to the legally mandated protection of the population against night air noise.
The Coalition must decide by 4 January if it will demand a revision of the judgment.
The opposition criticized the delay and lashed out at the government's representatives to renounce the revision of the Federal Administrative Court in Leipzig.
The head of the SPD faction, Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel, called on the CDU and the FDP to return to the promises it had made to ban the night flights it had made before the election. Otherwise, it can be considered as "breaking a given word."
It's bloody hard, if you can keep your word, said the Greens' boss, Tarek Al-Wazir, referring to the FDP's election slogan "We're keeping the word."
Minister Posch rejected the rebuke of Schäfer-Gümbel, the provincial government is trying to get to its night's flight by "overwhelming the law and the tricks."
The exact legal control takes its time.
The Coalition does not want to work on the basis of the "quick first impression."
We need a realistic decision, said Stefan Müller (FDP).
His faction's statements to ban night flights have never been as given by the opposition.
US banks repaying aid
American, crush-shattered big banks are getting rid of state handcuffs.
Bank of America repaid aid from the Tarp banking rescue fund at the same time on Wednesday, totalling $45 billion (around €30 billion).
According to a report by US-based CNBC, Citigroup is also planning to repay state aid.
The Constitution thus wants to get rid of the restrictions that have been made by accepting money - limiting the payment of bonuses to managers and the payment of high fees.
Bank of America has procured well $19 billion in net money from investors thanks to convertible bonds.
She took the rest of the amount from her coffers, which were filled with, among other things, trade union sales.
The bank's chief executive, Kenneth Lewis, specifically thanked the US taxpayer on Wednesday night: The cash injection helped us through the difficult time.
The cash institution was hurt on top of the financial crisis by taking over the investment bank Merrill Lynch.
Citigroup also wants to free itself from its obligations to the state by procuring money in the capital market.
CNBC reported, citing sources, that the US bank could have announced a capital increase of around $20 billion earlier on Thursday.
A Citigroup spokesman would not comment.
In June, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley already repaid their aid.
Quick Choice
It was going faster than expected.
The station introduced a successor to the successor just two weeks after the ZDF board pushed editor-in-chief, Nikolaus Brender, from the office.
Last night, the board wanted to agree on that person.
The favourite was Peter Frey, head of the ZDF studio in the capital in Berlin.
But the station has not confirmed this - officially, not to overtake the process.
But it could also have been a role to play that they did not want to harm ZDF intendant Markus Schächter if the proposal failed with the board.
Frey, Schächter's candidate, needs the support of nine of the 14 members of the board.
The result of the vote was not known before the deadline for this edition.
Two weeks ago, Schächter failed on the board with his proposal to extend his contract with Nikolaus Brender for a further five years.
Only seven members voted for Brender, seven against him. Brender's loss of the mandate was a bitter defeat for Schächter, though it was to be expected.
Indeed, a Union majority on the board had signalled weeks before the election that it did not want to confirm to Brender in office.
The opposition to the editor-in-chief was orchestrated by Hessian Prime Minister Roland Koch.
He refused to remain in the high-geriled editor's office by arguing that the ZDF news broadcasting surveillance quotas had fallen under Brender.
Until shortly before the election, protests were therefore being sharply criticized by political influence on the ZDF.
The last time, even 35 state law lawyers were involved in the debate, who view Koch's action as unconstitutional.
It was no use.
About Person
Peter Frey was born on August 4, 1957 in Bingen.
He studied politics, pedagogy and romanistics.
He then worked for Südwestfunk and Frankfurter Rundschau.
1983 Frey went to ZDF, first to the "heute-journal."
Other stations: 1988 to 1990 personal editor-in-chief; 1991/92 correspondent in Washington; leading and presenter of "Morgenmagazins"; until 2001 head of foreign policy ZDF; then head of ZDF's chief studio.
After being deposed by Brender, who was voted the Medium Magazin journalist of the year by the specialist periodical of the year, the Greens announced that they would file a constitutional lawsuit.
Koch's opponent on the board of directors, Renegade-Falchen-Falc's Prime Minister Kurt Beck, explained last week that the federal states should amend the state treaty with ZDF so that the intendant's personnel proposals could not be blocked by a politically motivated majority.
But Beck also refused to expel party politicians from the ZDF supervisory boards.
Brendner's presumed successor, Peter Frey, was ordered to the board by clever chess tilt - he strongly criticized the board for this immediately after the removal of Brendar.
Thanks to this evidence of journalistic independence, he could nominate him as editor-in-chief without losing his face, so he could be elected by the Board of Directors without getting under suspicion that the party's party had been pushed into office.
In the party arithmetic, Frey is ranked as a left-wing liberal anyway.
Studies get rid of junk
Partial success for students: After a year of striking, the ministers of culture finally went to the Länder on Thursday: At the conference of Ministers of Culture and University Rectors, both sides agreed that there was a will to improve the learning conditions for the bachelor and the masters.
Students should be able to master their studies in the future.
Specifically, they agreed to reduce the load on the exams: Fundamentally, each study module should be completed with one single test.
In addition, the workload of learners should be checked and a 'real and defensible measure' should be guaranteed.
In order to do so, politicians and colleges want to simplify the recognition of exams between universities in Germany and abroad.
The Länder are committed to creating a more flexible, flexible, joint structural award for bachelor's and master's degrees of study.
The country's deviations should cease to exist.
Less tests
Since the start of the student protests in the worm, the culture ministers and the university's chorus rectors had winged words about better study in their mouths.
Now, for the first time, they are filled with concrete content.
The so-called Accreditation Board decided to reduce the number of exams in part drastically: "Each module will generally be completed by one test," the 30-page report reads, which is to partly newly regulate the approval of study fields.
"Significantly lower exam burden," said the chairman of the accreditation council, Reinhold Grimm, to be "at a flawed development that significantly reduced the demands of the study."
To do this, the "triggly of study" in the future is to be a "decisive criterion" in the implementation.
Both modules and contents are "must be hard to recheck" so that "unnecessarily do not restrict learners in the election
seminars."
Students would have a "a step for a space that allows and supports their own initiative."
The rules are to apply when approving new fields of study, but also for the existing study fields after review.
These need to be "re-credited" every five years – but that means it will take until 2015 for all the fields of study to be reviewed.
Responsible for this, there are ten accreditation agencies throughout Germany, which are subject to accreditation boards set up by the Länder.
Culture ministers called on the "strongly" federal states in October to act on the agencies in such a way that the subject matter of the apprenticeship was not too great and the exam regimen was not strict.
In the various Länder, universities and universities have already agreed with the provincial ministries on the appropriate measures.
As the only country so far, the Rhineland-Palatinate has pledged additional funds for the further development of the Bologna Process.
With money, universities should primarily cover consulting programmes and study consultancy, and strengthen the probation and foreign authorities.
That's what countries and colleges want to spend ten million euros.
At the beginning of 2010, the administration wants to submit an amendment to the Higher Education Act to Parliament.
According to her, only one single test should be needed to terminate the study module.
Forming the study should be even more flexible, in order to guarantee the recognition of examinations from other universities and to make it easier to make the master's available.
By the end of next year, the complexity of all fields of study in the country should be re-checked.
The government and the opposition were again arguing about the country's learning conditions on Thursday.
In addition to the praise, criticism of the resolution was also made.
The Federal Board of Directors of Juso's Higher Education Groups called for the creation of education policy not to take place in the future "behind the closed doors" of ministers and university rectors.
At the latest after the strike, "at least a word should speak into this" students as the person concerned.
Future academics also received support from the president of the Conference of Higher Education Rectors (HRK), Margreta Wintermantel: "We need the experience of students," she said Thursday at a meeting with culture ministers with which HRK consulted on a joint reform report.
According to the Education and Science Union (GEW), the Bonn resolutions have not gone far enough: They demand a legal claim that would allow each graduate with a bachelor's degree in master's degree to receive access to the superstructure's master's degree.
Second, the federal states must ensure that for today's Bachelor's students, enough master's degree places are available tomorrow with the best possible study terms, GEW board member Andreas Keller said.
The Lands must employ far more lecturers.
However, the culture ministers did not comment on the free access to the master's programmes.
More than a footnote to Herta Müller
Getting to Germany and out is nice, almost no control..." reads the opening line of one of the poems by the poet Werner Söllner, who, in this ragged language piece, themes the experience of arriving at the time of one dissident who gained his freedom but also lost his linguistic environment.
Werner Söllner was born in 1951 in the Romanian Banat, Romania, working first as a German and English teacher in Bucharest and later as a lecturer in a children's book publishing house, then relocating to Frankfurt am Main in 1982.
Söllner was awarded various literary awards, and he gave poetry to the legendary Goethe University of Frankfurt in 1993, and has been head of the Hesse Literature Forum in Mousonturm in Frankfurt since 2002.
He took care of a considerable extra-literary uproar last Tuesday at a seminar in Munich, which involved "German literature in Romania in a mirror and a broken mirror of its safety act."
The obviously insecure and taken aback Söllner left a statement in which the Romanian Germans, among others, had left himself before fellow writers by the Romanian Germans, among others. Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak and Helmuth Frauendorfer, he admits to the cooperation as a secret informant of the Romanian secret service Securitate.
Together with some of those present, Söllner won the German Language Award in 1989.
Attempts to recruit were said to have begun unobtrusively, at the earliest in 1971.
I am, Söllner continued, "that is, someone who has not resisted enough of the attempted intimidation by the Securitate."
The poet Werner Söllner is undercover agent Walter.
Almost at the same time as the Nobel Prize for the award of the Nobel Prize to Herta Müller and her unparalleled literary dealings with the mechanisms of the dictatorial government, the literary scene, and especially the community of German authors from Romania, is shaken by a case that marks the depths and infamy of a political system that is based on control and spying.
Werner Söllner is not, at least if this can be said according to the current state of knowledge, only the perpetrator, but he is also a victim.
In the Securitate acts, secret agent Walter played a role, Michael Markel said after Söllner's confession, referring to the positive effect on Secret Agent Walter.
"squitted" me at all the points of the essentials to him at the time, says Markel.
It has a moral obligation to make this comment.
Söllner's statement was unexpected in this form and in front of this audience, but absolutely surprising, the former dissident's confession and his cooperation with the Romanian secret service is not.
Herta Müller wrote in July, when she read her own briefs, 914 pages, that Germany was a pleasant reservation for the pricks of the Securitate.
The perpetrators, one might assume, will speculate, and in some cases probably know which name is hiding behind the code name Sorin, Voicu, and so will Walter.
Other than in the domestic, meanwhile, very certain inspecting of the files of the Stazi files, the manipulation of the estate of the Securitate control is still very diffuse.
In recent years, systematic enlightenment has been tampered and curtailed.
One of the Birthler authorities, which corresponds to the National Securitate (CNSAS) Component Processing Council, was only established in 1999, the act's release has been rather lengthy since then.
It has been a law since 2005 that governs the administration of the files.
That the former Securitate members still had a lot of influence in Romania, he documented after the Nobel Prize was published for Herta Müller by an interview in which one of the former Securitate chiefs of Timisoara was dismissive of the award winner.
He is said to have psychosis, after all, she was only questioned once.
The disgrace of power was expressed here quite indiscriminately in the form of freedom of expression.
Of course, there are inevitable questions about the Söllner case, as in the context of the hindered offense.
Why now? Who hurt? The special reaction of the listeners to Söllner's admission is to be expected that the continuation of this chapter will be determined by the desire for knowledge rather than for the indictment of guilt and shame.
To the genesis of Herta Müller's work, who accepted the Nobel Prize yesterday, it is more than a footnote.
Carried deposit Champions League
It was as if a clean-dressed sales rep came from a cute Christmas party at which the sportswear manufacturer of the candy was handing out as he boarded a quarter of an hour after midnight to the summoned C-C-C Mercedes, the new coach, VfBr Christian Gross, accompanied by an orange-colored cashpiece. "
A man with a striking balme had been driven around him in a strange city for him.
Otherwise, he could drive himself - alcohol was not in play, and the 55-year-old was not enough drunk with happiness.
It was a pleasant evening, but work will resume tomorrow.
Or it's just beginning.
In the words of only three days of the committed Swiss: "We have reached the last eight," namely in the Champions League thanks to a 3:1 win over Unirea Urziceni of Romania, "but we must not be dazzled by success: It will be a brutally tough fight against the descent."
"A far more important task" stands before us on Sunday.
It is important to repeat the performance from the royal class in Mainz even on an ordinary league day.
And to avoid the obvious weaknesses again after three quick goals from Maricy (5th), Träsche (8.) and Pogrebnyak (11th).
Drawing
The Champions League eight finals (Match 16./17). + 23./24 February/ replay matches 9./10. + 16/17 March) the draw will be drawn on 18 December in Nyon.
The joy of the feud in the clash of Babbel's successor will therefore be preserved.
Not just for the supposed healer, who gave the insecure Stuttgart professionals their confidence, willingness to be deployed, and the joy of the game in a short time.
I went to the players and told them to focus on their strengths and urged them to be bolder, explained the soul healer Gross so simply-sounding the successful recipe, which, however, under the tenure of the therapist Babbel, showed no more efficacy.
He stirred up a certain magic, Babbel's liaison, Jens Lehmann, admitted, "when a new impetus comes in football, sometimes things happen that you wouldn't think were possible."
And Sami Khedira, who after a multi-week injury break, became the best player on the field because of his dynamics, tried to describe the found "phenomenon" with the proverbial "fresh wind" and the new supervisor's work practices: "He is a man who is radical and demands discipline.
That's what we need in the current situation."
It was clearly missing for Babbel.
VfB Stuttgart not yet saved, warns sports chairman Horst Heldt
VfB Stuttgart needs but more constancy.
Like Gross, the players and managers do not want to overestimate the victory against the weakened substitute and utterly overloaded defence of the Romanian guest.
They would have won in Glasgow before a nasty awakening came after a 0-4 defeat at Leverkusen, Khedira muses.
And the sports chairman, Horst Heldt, recalled that while one goal had been reached in the season, the other was still a long way off.
We're not in the clear yet.
That Heldt did not celebrate on his 40th birthday after his first home victory in three months was due to the weekend's events, which were newly brought to life in the form of a television interview with goalkeeper Jens Lehmann just before the start of the game.
There are decisions that others and not Jens, Heldt responded to the harsh Lehmann's criticism.
He hailed the board of directors of weak management and decided to change coach after pressure from the teenage fans.
Even the fact that he was cancelled on his day off after the matches was marked by Lehmann as a sign of the lack of sovereignty and envy.
Lehmann's statements "formul with pure egoism," Heldt replied, announcing the implications for the goalkeeper.
The two 40-year-olds will probably have no more joy in life.
Anyway, they're one with the others that without the job of a deposed coaching team, it wouldn't be possible to make a player-strong and combative performance.
Babbel and his assistants had a "great share of the success," Heldt and Lehmann say in unison - and the man agrees with the plastic bag.
Battle of the World Heavyweight Championships
Passionate duel in Bern: Challenger Kevin Johnson constantly provoked the words and gestures of world champion Vitaly Klitschko.
However, after 12 hard-line rounds, the Ukrainian defended his heavyweight title of the WBC boxing organisation.
The referees' verdict was unanimous.
Hamburg - Vitaly Klitschko remains the heavyweight boxing world champion.
The 38-year-old WBC defeated the American Kevin Johnson in Berno in Saturday night with points (120:108, 120-108, 119-109).
For Klitschko, this is the third successful title defence since his return in October 2008.
Prior to that, the Ukrainian was twice WBO and WBC world champion.
Unfortunately, it didn't turn out to the point that everyone was expecting.
Klitschko improved his record to 39 victories in 41 professional duels, was beaten twice by injuries.
Challenger Johnson was defeated for the first time in the 24th contest.
In front of some 17,000 spectators in the Bernsk arena, the 2.02-metre-high Klitschko duel was driven by his left-handed match.
The eleven centimeters shorter of Johnson, who had announced the end of the Klitschko era before the duel, was pulling back before the world champion's strokes, so that Klitschko could not strike a decisive blow with his dangerous right.
In all, the passive Johnson did a little to the challenger, and he was just trying to get into the next rounds.
Klitschko was provoked by words and gestures, but his beats rarely hit the world champion.
But it is still only the second boxer after Timo Hoffmann in 2000, who fought Klitschko for a full twelve rounds.
The challenger had taken care of the uproar in the Swiss capital before the duel.
He insulted Klitschko as a "abhorous zombie" that "can't do anything right."
During the eighteague on Friday, the champion was provoked, pulling the sunglasses off Johnson's nose "so he can see his eyes."
Fourth victory after Klitschko's return
Klitschko remained after the fourth contest after his return 11. October 2008 undefeated.
After a nearly four-year break, he defeated Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin and took back the "his" WBC belt, which he had to hand over before without a fight.
He defeated Juan Carlos Gomez of Cuba in defending the title of Juan Carlos Gomez of Cuba and in September by Chris Arreolo of the USA.
I only got one shot in this fight and physically in good form, Klitschko justified a quick return to the ring.
But his dream remains to defend all four important degrees in the family.
Brother Vladimir is the world champion of the WBO and IBF.
But the WBA is worn by Britain's David Haye, after dethroning Nikolai Vualev, the 2.13-metre-high throne in November.
Haye canceled a duel against Klitschko in the summer, scheduled for September.
He is reportedly planning a duel against Klitschko at Wembley Stadium in London.
The Kunduz case
Leading attack from the opposition: The head of the Greens faction, Jürgen Trittin, called Defense Minister Guttenberg a liar about poor information about the Kunduz affair.
The SPD and Linke (Left) are calling on the chancellor to provide an explanation.
Hamburg/Berlin - According to the latest findings on the Kunduz raid, the opposition believes that Defence Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) has committed conscious misleading.
The minister said "consciously untruely untrue" on the deadly bombardment of the two tankers in September, the head of the Greens faction, Jürgen Trittin, said on the ARD news program "Tagesschau" on Saturday's ARD news program.
Call it the usual expression: Lies.
The order for the killing was issued in disregarding the rules of the International Security Forons of the Security Forces in Afghanistan (ISAF).
This is the essence of the NATO report, read by Mr. Guttenberg, Trittin said.
On Friday, it emerged that the attack was not only about destroying the hijacked trucks, but the targeted killing of two Taliban leaders.
The US raid, requested by German commander Kunduz, Colonel Klein, was killed or injured by the US.
The Greens, the SPD and Linke called on Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) on Saturday to immediately comment before the Bundestag and also clarify what Guttenberg really knew about the event.
Mrs Merkel must explain whether the targeted killing strategy is part of the Federal Assembly's Afghan policy - and whether the Office of the Chancellor, the Bundeswehr and the intelligence service approved this new strategy, Jürgen Trittin and Green Party's colleagues Renate Künna called for.
Government spokesman Ulrich Wilhelm firmly rejected the criticism.
The chancellor's office has no influence on the specific deployment of the Bundeswehr in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, there were also outrage questions about the Ministry's trial of the background to the dismissal of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and State Secretary Peter Wichert.
According to SPIEGEL's information, both of them informed the two Guttenberg correctly and completely about the background to the attack on the tankers.
Officially, it was said that they should have denied the existence of NATO reports and withheld the minister's sensitive details.
However, it was said from around the two top officials that they had even alerted the Ministry of Defence to several reports, among them a two-page document by the commanding Colonel Klein and one of the military police reports.
"Frankfurter Allgemeiner Sonntagszeitung" reports that Wichert should have asked in the letter to clarify the situation in the meantime.
It is noted that he has not yet received any response.
The ministry did not comment on the criticisms on Saturday, pointing out that this would be dealt with in the Investigation Committee of the Bundestag, which will be established next Wednesday.
Worlds of Dreams
Some see images in the waking state and hear voices that others can't see and hear.
It is not only for the mentally ill or in the drug intoxication that the boundaries between imagination and reality come together.
As long as it happens in my sleep, everything's fine.
If we lie with our eyes closed in our dark room, we are allowed to surround ourselves with the wildest notions and fantasy delusions.
But those who experience dreamlike states in vigilance see and hear things that others cannot see and hear, in today's Western world, pay mostly for a fool or a drug addict, or at least a weirdo.
However, such images and voices do not only originate in the mentally ill or in the drug intoxication.
Our imagination is to blame: The same neuronal processes that allow us to design houses, paint paintings or write novels take care to see to it that the boundaries between dream, idea and reality will merge now and then.
Dreams of a changed state of consciousness can occur in a variety of forms, in a best case we call them visions, in worse delusions.
Although the initiator and effect may vary, the vision of the mysticism Hildegard von Bingen, the drug experiences of the prophet New-Age Carlos Castaneda, the shamanic states of delirium, psychossees and hallucinations, can be derived from such trials.
Hallucinations or visions arise when the balance of neuronal transmitters of the brain is derailed - mainly dopamine, noradrenaline, serotonin and acetylcholine - and the interaction between different parts of the brain is disturbed.
Comprehensive hallucinations and delusional thoughts occur very often in schizophrenic psychosis.
Gravity doesn't have much of it
The link between delusion and dream has kept philosophers and doctors busy since antiquity.
Aristotle understood hallucinations as a form of waking dream, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychology, noted in 1861 "a great resemblance of raving with dreamlike states," for Sigmund Freud the dream was even a dream of "psychosis, with all nonsense, mirages, deception of the senses."
It's autumn 2001, Henning T. is turning into a comic book character.
His body is two-dimensional and garishly colored.
Gravity has no power over it, it floats at the ceiling of the room.
He feels kicks in.
Behind him, winged devilish figures with blood-red grimaces, censing teeth.
They chase him, kick him with heavy, fiery shoes, throws it against the walls, feels pain all over his body.
Loud, evil voices are threatened from the walls and from the radio.
He can no longer tolerate the voices that scold and insult him.
Henning T. pulls two cables out of the stereo, smokes them in the loop and attaches it to the ceiling hook.
He steps up on one speaker and puts the noose around his neck.
Jicking.
The loop loosens.
Learn lessons, chorus voices ripping his eardrums, "go to the clinic and get treated!"
Today is Henningu T. 40 years old, he experienced six acute psychoses, the last two years ago, the first almost 20 years ago.
LSD was launched.
His diagnosis is a schizoaffective paranoiac psychosis, besides he's manoeuvring, he's taking drugs for depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He's learned to live with his illness, he's married for three years.
In psychosis, I experienced the worst fear and deepest doubt, he says.
Ghosts are a terrible reality
About one percent of people get sick at least once in their lifetime by schizophrenia, in psychiatric clinics it's the second most frequently treated disease after the depression.
In acute schizophrenic psychosis, the disability can no longer distinguish the inner and outer world, they are put in a buoyant state that can lead to hallucinations, size, relationship illusions or the illusion of persecution.
The voices are particularly widespread are the hearings - the voices that command, comment on or conduct dialogues.
Even optical hallucinations are not uncommon.
The sufferer is unable to distinguish the important from the unimportant, the brain cannot filter out the disturbing signals, the consciousness is inundated with impressions.
Like the dream, the psychosis of the floodgate opens up in a flood of thoughts and fantasies that come from the deepest layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychosis is centered on the subject, says Professor Thomas Fuchs, Chief Medical Officer of the General Psychiatrie Clinic of the University Clinic in Heidelberg.
Schizophrenic is located at the center of the action, everything is meaningful to him.
At the same time, he gets into a passive role, becoming, like in a dream, overwhelmed by events and cannot actively shape them.
Schizophrenics therefore often feel threatened, controlled and manipulated.
Comparing reality is not usually possible for them, ghosts are a terrible reality, waking is impossible.
Once in a lifetime, experience a hallucination
Other than in a dream, says Fuchss, "all the sensory and spatial structure of the reality one perceives in psychosis, fundamentally preserved."
Delusional ideas and hallucinations are based on reality, the theft of the experience occurs within the real framework.
The scientist is still faced with a puzzle as to why our brains are making somersum like this.
Exceptional states can lead to each person losing their relationship to reality in the short term, says Fuchs.
But not everyone develops into psychosis.
There appears to be a genetic disposition to schizophrenia, but studies in twins have shown that genes are not the only determinant factor.
Scientists are based on the fact that the people affected have minimal brain damage.
We believe that at the early stage of development there will be damage to the neuronal maturation of the brain, for example by the viral disease of the mother during pregnancy, Fuchs explains.
But it remains a puzzle of how the neural system malfunction occurs, which has not shown up in the process for years.
The influences of the surroundings also play a role - stress or traumatic experiences can be the instigator of psychosis if there is a disposition to it.
Hallucinogenic drugs can also trigger psychosis because they interfere with the transfer system.
When our brains are in the smoky
Crazy is that the psychotronics suffer from their hallucinations, and to get rid of them, swallow expensive medications, others give money for drugs to get it, says psychology professor Erich Kasten of Lübeck.
Whether we see mirages as pleasant or unpleasant is often just a matter of attitude.
Kasten has been collecting reports of hallucinations and delusions for ten years, last year he interpreted his results in the book "Die irreale Welt in unserem Kopf" (The Industrial World in Our Head).
Hallucinations are one of the typical accompanying phenomena of psychoses, but also to surprisingly many other diseases.
In addition to mental disorders such as frontier personality or depression, it is also often illnesses such as migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis or Alzheimer's or brain trauma.
Surprisingly hallucinates under certain conditions the brain of a healthy person himself.
The hallucinations, according to Kasten, consist of content of ideas that are normally suppressed.
They are created when parts of the brain in which sensory perception is processed are too active or too suppressed; if our brains are inunded or when stimulation is lacking.
Drugs can trigger this condition as well as cerebral harm or psychosis.
But also the withdrawal of the stimulus, the stress, the worries of love or other state of emergency.
In more recent studies, up to a third of respondents reported that they had hallucinated at least once in their lives.
In the summer of 2005, Sarah K. For 16 years, he lives in a small town in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania and goes to the Gymnasium there.
A perfectly normal girl, actually.
If there weren't those shapes and voices.
At breaks, she may be approached by a colossus with long, dark hair.
When he answers, her classmates look at her with surprise - no one sees or hears this boy, except for her.
This shy girl considers an uptight dreamer, but she doesn't eat Sarah K.
He's awake, hears and sees the boy, just as he can hear and see the girl sitting next to her in a bench.
He might even feel his presence, at least for a few moments.
It feels good, she likes the boy.
I'm crazy?, he asks.
But he knows that this boy and other delusions are not real and will disappear again.
At night, the appearances are rather depressing
Often the mip are a burden of stress.
When he sits in the classroom, he cannot often watch the lessons, because the teacher in her eyes and ears is just presenting a new classmate, but he explains to all the others audibly and visibly on the board of the mathematical equation.
At night, the appearances are rather dismal.
When he waits in his dark room for sleep, which comes rarely and too late, he often cannot distinguish whether he is awake or whether he is asleep, whether the images he sees, the grimaces, or a girl with bleeding cuts on her hands and feet, arises before her eyes open or closed.
Leave me alone, yells at the characters.
She doesn't tell her parents and friends about it, they'd think she's crazy.
Autumn 2009. Sarah K. is now 20 years old.
She graduated from graduation last year and lives with her boyfriend.
A year ago, the hallucinations stopped.
Ever since she contacted psychologist Kasten online, she knows exactly that she hasn't been crazy.
Plourels are also an art of despair
If someone is socially isolated or taken away by the stimuli, they will very likely have hallucinations, says Kasten.
I believe that the brain does not have enough jobs and takes care of its own fun.
Sarah K., an only child, was a little girl, was afraid of the other children, often playing for herself.
Her hallucinations began when she learned at 13 that the man she called Dad since she was thinking was not her own father.
Because in visual and acoustic hallucinations, the same brain areas that also process real perceptions and sounds are active, it is hard for the disabled as Sarah K. to distinguish delusions and reality from each other. "Every experience," says Kasten, "it takes place in the brain, also the reality is depicted there.
Hallucinations are also images that make the brain, which is why it feels so real."
Night dreams are also evaluated by Casten as a form of hallucinations.
The hallucinations of healthy people are not distinguished as a matter of principle from hallucinations in acute psychosis.
Compared to schizophrenics, mentally healthy people are able to identify their delusions as unrealistic.
Casten therefore advises its patients to assess hallucinations as an extraordinary ability.
Border state between dream and hallucination
Unfortunately, in our world too much to be aware of the imaginary experience, says, Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, a professor at Heidelberg and chief medical officer at the Florence-Nightingale Hospital Psychiatric and Psychotherapy Clinic at Düsseldorf.
Psychosis is a severe, oppressive illness, but it also brings positives, creativity - a mirage is also an art of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard explored the so-called one-irosed form of experience, a strange form of altered consciousness to the dream.
Oneirogue states are highly complex, detailed fictitious dreams that the off-the-ftale phenomenon is considered real and cannot even distinguish them retrospectively from the waking condition.
The oneirogue state of consciousness occurs in extreme situations caused by trauma or disease, such as polyradiular inflammation patients who experience motor paralysis in full consciousness.
When a person is threatened by the loss of the world and one's own, perhaps persistent, with complete inability to move, it replaces life-threatening real situations with one's own, imaginary world that is disconnected from reality, says Schmidt-Degenhard.
Type of borderline at the dream and hallucinations.
As it is not possible to manage a situation in reality, there will be a change of worlds, but the real situation will become more apparent.
Antenatous form of support for the senses and the transfer of the senses in some excruciating situation that allows us people to move on to lose consciousness in an instant.
Everything is real, even later in the memories
The art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen also describes his one-irogue experiences in his book "Herzwechsel" (Heart Exchange) as a life-saving action of the soul.
He was 49 years old when, after surgery on the heart valve with a subsequent heart transplant, his consciousness made its consciousness on a few days' journey, with his body lying motionless in the intensive care unit.
Claussen plunged into the world he had created, visited foreign times and places: He becomes an old man bedridden with a bed, in a train sanatorium, the robot guarding his health.
He lives in the early Middle Ages among the nobles, who make intoxicating substances out of blood.
On a motorcycle, he is kidnapped by the Greek to his homeland, surfs in a hospital bed at a company in the Alps and meets a Korean mobster.
It plummets completely into an imaginary action, everything is real, even later in the memories.
These inner paths are fundamentally different for Claussen from any dream.
A dream is a different condition, describing its experience.
In contrast to dreams, the memories of those mental journeys are clear in the years and in the unimportant details.
Even brighter and more intense than the actual experience.
The intensity of this experience shatters the horizon of our other true experiences, says psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
After all, they show 1irogue states, psychosis, hallucinations, and drug intoxication, how fragile our inner images of external reality are even in a waking state.
Any change in the state of consciousness, the psychologist Kasten summarizes, "can lead to a deformation of what we call reality."
A fact that can also be enriching.
Snow may come
Burda
In 27 to be taken over by the publishing house children
The new publisher Kallen's new publisher is a transitional solution: In the long run, Hubert Burda wants to hand over his business to his two children, he told SPIEGEL.
Holding is also expected to belong to a family 100 percent in the future.
Hamburg - The publisher Hubert Burda has long seen his business in the hands of his children.
Both children will be inherited at the age of 27 and have a firm will to enter the establishment, says the 69-year-old SPIEGEL.
We've handled the details carefully for this.
The question of whether they are also active in the company is asked afterwards.
The question of whether they have the skills to do so.
It is not possible to put their children at the top of the 7,500 staff if they are not sufficiently capable.
That would kill both children and businesses.
Burda announced on Thursday that he was withdrawing from the chairmanship of the board of directors from January, appointing Paul-Bernhard Kallen as his successor.
The 52-year-old Kallen has been a member of the board of directors at Burda since 1999.
First, he was in charge of the technology.
Later, with the Treasure section, the responsibility for the company's assets was added and, after the resignation of Jürgen Todenhöfer, Direct Marketing, Cizina, Tiska and Finance.
For the first time, none of the family members are at the head of the publishing house.
Burd's children are 19 and 17 years old, his son Felix, who would be 42 years old today, died a few years ago.
The appointment of Kallen is also used to "fell 10, 15 years," Burda said.
Holding should continue to belong to a family 100 percent in the future, says Burda.
With regard to the Schickedanz and Schaeffler cases, Burda commented that even the family businesses were not assured of a state of security before the demise: "It has always been touched by companies that have been infected by the desire for capital that they have speculated and thought they could become big players.
That was never my strategy.
He never had "the dreams of world power," Burda says.
I do not see myself as a political preceptor of this country, like Springer, and I do not want to play in the world league with "Time", these deals are too big.
Comprehensive beauty care
Everything you can ask for in the field of beauty and well-being is within reach of your hands.
This was the establishment by El Corte Inglés, which has just launched the Callao (Madrid) shopping centre of more than 1,000 m2, which provides a wide variety of body care services.
The Wellness Department is located on the eighth floor, home to such prestigious companies as the laser depilion Hedonai; Spaxión, the relaxation and aesthetic facilities; the Luis & Tachi peluqueros; the Marina d'Or with a gym or aL'Occitane offering natural cosmetics, and more.
There is also a nutrition department and mainly a tea room offering more than 130 different types of tea.
You can also enjoy relaxation massages with your partner while enjoying the view of the capital, rent a relaxation zone for two hours and provide your own 'beauty party' in the company of up to eight friends, relax in the hot tub, have a massage and a glass of champagne, some of the variants of Spaxion.
These are a total of 2,250 m2 in the form of 12 salons in which the above services are provided, as well as the most modern procedures for the face, body and also hydrotherapy.
As an example, we can cavitations, which are used to combat cellulite, or vibration platforms.
The gym is also equipped with these machines, in addition to virtual trainers, who guard the individual tasks of clients and thus provide completely individual care.
It all starts by placing the personal key in the contact display, which is placed against the machine.
You can then watch the video samples that will show you the correct execution of our exercise report.
Your instructor guarantees that 15 minutes (including heating and stretching) is sufficient to practice all muscles.
And if we feel like going to the hairdresser after the exercise, Luis & Tachi has a space where individual treatments are performed to restore their hair, improve their gloss and nutrition.
Innovation and exceptionalism are the resolutions of this urban wellness centre, which is open every day from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m.
Escotes variados
Christmas is coming and that's when it's a good time to find out what the celebrities wear and adapt their ceremonial wardrobe to it.
The shape of the cut is very important to highlight the figure, which must be noted.
We are making a few proposals.
Singer Fergie chose an extravagant and very complicated cut. We do not recommend it.
Endesa and Barcelona, with an electric car
The Energy Company Endesa, together with Barcelona City Hall, founded the 'Offort LIVE'.
It is a project for the development and promotion of an electric car in the capital of Catalonia.
The LIVE's office (Logistics on the deployment of electric cars) will set out and manage the Roadmap for the deployment of electric cars in the city and will provide mobility agreements, to process, coordinate and submit posters, etc.
It will also develop the projectMOVELE, promote electric cars, collect opinions and results of activities in the sectors involved.
All in all, the purpose is to promote this means of transport of the future.
3 'electric cities'
However, Barcelona is not the only city to participate in the project to introduce electric cars in Spain.
Madrid and Sevilla will also join the project.
These are the three cities that were elected by the government as part of the IOCIA Plan to support the introduction of electric cars.
Energy company Endesa has already signed a framework contract with the Catalan government.
The purpose is to support research and technological development activities in the Catalan Autonomous Region.
This includes energy-related activities and, above all, energy-related efficiency.
This is not the only initiative involving Endesa in terms of promoting electric cars.
The company is represented in the European standardisation teams and actively implements a number of additional projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or PRICE VERDE.
Zapatero predicts's a set of sounding season in the automotive industry.
Prime Minister José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero predicts that the Spanish automotive industry, the state's main export sector, is in for a quiet time."
In the Prime Minister's economic report for 2009, Zapatero summarised the measures that were put in place during the year to support the automotive sector.
"Without the competitive plan for the automotive sector, we would face a state of abandonment today, the closure of some of our main manufacturing companies," the Prime Minister noted.
"Thanks to this plan and the wish of individual brands to continue to operate in Spain in this highly competitive sector, a period of peace with this industry is foreseen in the future, which is our main export sector," he added.
In that sense, he noted that the competing plan, which forms part of the Integrity Plan of the Automotive Sector (PIA), identified 800 million for projects of 19 manufacturers and 137 auxiliary firms that mobilised the investment of more than Euros' 3 billion.
The Prime Minister explained that this investment was intended for the development of new models, for the modernisation of production and existing processes.
Zapatero also stressed the government's measures to support the request and mentioned the 2000E Plan, which is being applied in cooperation with autonomous areas and car brands.
According to the president, the plan allowed the average emission level for new vehicles to be sold on the Spanish market by 6%, and ensured a "significant increase" of entries, namely by "40 percent" in November.
20,000 square metres of classic vehicles
The first International Saloon of Classic Vehicles will be opened in Madrid, a space for the gathering of professionals and amateurs from the world of engines.
This initiative will take place on 5 - 7. February 2010 in the Glass Pavilion of the Cauna de Campo of Madrid.
It is an exhibition area of 20,000 sqm, on which more than 200 domestic and foreign exhibitors will be represented.
Here you will find not only the classic motorcycles and cars, but at ClassicAuto Madrid there will also be products of all kinds related to the world of the engines.
The exhibitors in the pavilion will offer accessories, spare parts, components, textile accessories, accessories, publications, miniatures, etc.
Hundreds of products related to classic motors, real delicacies for collectors and curious.
Among the companies involved will be the following:Clásicos de Mos and Good Old Times, car sales; Juan Lumbreras, restored; Coupe-Francisco Pueche, car sales and renewal; or Cochera Clásicos, a specialist firm called Mercedes Benz.
Effight tests in the exterior
In addition, the commercial activity of this salon will be complemented by parallel activities: the holding of a camp, sporting performances, rehearsals, presentations and auditions.
There will also be tests on the toll of classic cars and motorcycles in a adapted circuit outside the exhibition zone.
Mazda3 i-Stop: Preserving sporty style
Mazda intends to show that environmental friendliness has no negative effect on the sporting style.
And that's why the Mazda3 has a built-in engine stop and start-up system - also baptized as a likei-Stop-, a device that is currently only available with a 2.01 150 horsepower petrol engine.
This second generationMazda3 is characterised by the good characteristics it has achieved as a whole.
Surface finishing, vehicle design, habitability, behaviour, mechanics, i-Stop system...
All of these aspects are excellent at the Mazda3.
The front seats, incl. the driver's seats, have excellent ergonomics and are superbly fixed.
The steering wheel is also extremely subtle.
Using a toolkit and console, we conclude that Mazda continues to develop a futuristic design with many buttons and controllers and a distinctive red and blue color.
This style partly reminds us of the style that is also presented by the Honda Civic.
Therefore, we can say that both the Mazda3 and the Civic, both Japanese, contrast with the soberness of German products and, more specifically, the SVolkswagen Golf, which everyone wants to beat.
As usual, this Japanese compact product is more than enough for four adults who want a very comfortable ride.
In addition, the large luggage compartment and the regular shapes should be mentioned.
The automatic engine stop and start-up system is only available with a two-litre petrol engine and 150 horsepower and a six-speed hand gearbox.
This engine is a real treat. It is very tender, characterised by reduced noise levels, its performance and lower consumption.
Although the most desirable Mazda3 is in the diesel version, all those who do not travel that many miles per year should not rule out this i-Stop with a petrol engine, as it is characterized by greater ride-enabled comfort and reduced consumption.
As for the equipment, the version selected for testing is called Sportive and includes a larger number of serial features.
For serial equipment, it is worth mentioning the lane-tracking system (RVM), which prevents the creation of the blind angle, the stroke and stability control, the speed control, the light-sensitive interior mirror, the on-board computer with a large screen, a parking sensor, a separate air conditioning, a rain and light sensor, a bluetooth audio and wheels made of a 17-inch alloy.
And if the equipment was not sufficient, this version was equipped with the Pack Premium, for an extra fee of €1,500: the adaptable two-xenon light and the BOSE audio system with a CD holder, among other components.
Conclusion
The Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the most compact cars of its category.
It is mainly characterised by the quality of the materials used, its operation and the high level of equipment.
Plus, people who don't drive a larger number of kilometres a year can choose this i-Stop version, which is only with a petrol engine2.0 and 150 horsepower.
The only drawback of this model is its higher price, which is €21,770 for the Luxury version and €23,270 for the tested version -Sportive-.
For this high price, the Mazda3 offers us a great deal of satisfaction for each day.
Luxury 'Premiere'
L. A. has a red carpet, as soft as Penélope Cruz's hands, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.

Our 'Pe', extravagant as usual, chose the dark 'lady'.
FonPeek Slib Slib
Peek is extremely limited, only used to view the post office, without being able to view a certain type of attachments or surf the network.
He enjoyed his five minutes of fame in the US when Time magazine praised him as one of the products of the year.
It's harder to see it out there, but the idea can be interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike smartphones, Peek is characterised by a very low price and monthly payments, less than half the amount that is paid for, for example, the iPhone data plan.
After its success, the company began to offer two new devices: one for Twitter, the other on the basis of a permanently provided free data service, but for which Peek has to be paid six times the amount.
FonPeek, which was presented at the Le Web event yesterday, is a European version of the invention and its third transformation.
It is limited as much as his American counterpart, but it brings surprises.
The monthly maintenance price is around €12 per month and involves roaming across Europe.
People travelling with a smartphone already know what it means to lose data services after crossing the border or impatiently in search of a coffee shop with WiFi (or a Fon connection) to view the mail.
The idea with rooming at a fixed price is incredibly attractive and should have been introduced a long time ago.
Yes, some operators have special contracts and travel plans, but in my experience, one would need a doctorate in physics to understand them, as well as very good glasses to read miniature letters.
The European Commission is constantly calling for a reduction in roaming tariffs to be accessible to the whole of Europe, which still does not have the desired effect.
There is a reasonable fear of using data services outside the home state.
The fact that a device like FonPeek (it is interesting that it continues to be called the Fon when it has no WiFi) will reach this type of tariff means that operators are starting to think differently and are considering different offers to compensate for their data network.
Kindle is another nice example, offering book downloads and other internet searches.
No contracts, no complications.
This device is connected and is paid for when purchased, not months later.
And that is exactly what I expect to see happen someday in the case of the FonPeek, this is the possibility of buying with a permanent approach as Peek has already in place in the US.
Not because I want to buy it.
I'm checking the mail on the phone, thank you.
I expect this, as I think it is the best type in terms of the consumer.
It would be interesting if the same system could be used on a computer.
The color that Michelle adores
Yellow is undoubtedly the popular color of the US First Lady.
To take Barack Obama as US President, she chose a dress and coat in this color, the same color she also chose to do when she accompanied him at the second most important moment of his life: the Nobel Peace Prize award ceremony in Oslo.
Michelle Obama used very similar models in both cases: in addition to being a similar color - yellow-green with glittering effects- both of which were a three-part ensemble - a dress, a jacket, a jacket, and a coat of the same fabric - decorated with a large embroidery or collar.
At first glance, the US First Lady decided to follow in the footsteps of the Asturian princess and wear similar outfits.
The fabric from which the clothing is made is made by the two models in a very different way.
On the occasion of her post, Michelle used a great lace, in Osto the velvet with a print.
It also changes accessories: green shoes with a medium-high trash, now a model, but in gold.
He also has various hairstyles: this time adewol, her hair that had previously melted.
75% of working mothers have work problems related to motherhood.
Discrimination at work has increased in recent years, especially for younger-time women who intend to have a child.
This is the result of the study 'Frequency and Work Career Career for Spanish Women', carried out by CSIC in collaboration with the Women's Institute.
The study involved 9,737 women between the ages of 15 and 75, and the results are straightforward: 75% of mothers working have limited opportunities in the labour market due to motherhood.
The study highlights that at the start of a partnership, there are many differences of opinion about the number of children, depending on whether they work or not, and also by type of employment.
Women who do not work away from home, work part-time or do not have a stable job, start living with a partner earlier, first a child are given birth to a first child and generally have more children.
On the other hand, women with stable employment, especially in the public sector, partnering cohabitation and motherhood are putting offshot, and have fewer offspring.
"Women from 35 to 49 with stable employment have their first child on average 3.7 years since the start of living with a partner. This figure is 4.1 for women who have devoted a greater part of their lives to the maintenance of their stable employment and have therefore had to postpone the cohabitation of the children.
The type of profession also has a strong effect on motherhood, although less influence on the time of initiation of cohabitation with a partner", explains Margarita Delgado, who is research at CSIC.
Another factor influencing the age of women at the time of marriage and impermindies of the offspring is the degree of education.
Research shows that the higher the level of education, the higher the age of women getting married and having their first child.
There are also differences between women of the same generation.
For example, in the 35 to 49 age group, women with primary and higher education gave birth to their first child, aged 25.1 or. 32,1.
"There is another difference between women depending on their level of education.
Women with primary education marry and give birth to their first child before they find a stable job, while women with a secondary or high education move forward prefer to get a stable job, to marry and to enter into a first child," says Delgado.
Diane Kruger is also worth it
L'Oréal Paris has just added a new name to its prestigious list of female leaders: Diane Kruger.
From next year, the German actress will become the face of the brand's various products under the universal slogan 'Because I'm worth it'.
The representative of 'Joyeux Noël', one of the most elegant actresses of the international level, is thus joining other famous personalitiesL'Oréal Paris as e.g. Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and the Spanish Penélope Cruz.
Before her, actresses Evangeline Lilly ('Free') and Freida Pinto ('The Millionaire of the Shop's) entered this selected club.
The men's part of this cosmetics brand is also represented by prominent personalities:Patrick Dempsey ('Grey's anatomy') and Matthew Fox (Evangelin's partner in 'Lost').
Prices of British fashion
The British have a lot to say about fashion matters.
Their most important representatives - designers and models, both earlier and present-came a one-year awards ceremony held in London, the Royal Court of the Judici.
There was no shortage of the meeting.
Former model Jerry Hall and her daughter Georgia May Jagger, who was voted the best model of the year.
Manuela Vicente's Poker
Manuel Vicent is donating in 'Esový poker' (Alfaguara, illustration by Fernando Vicente) to the 30 X-rays of writers he met in his literary life (and, in some cases, in everyday life).
He does not do so in the feared and predictable genres (biographical similarity, life and work), but seeks something similar to the core of a creative personality.
The journey brings excitement, and Vicent spares no disrespect or inspiration.
This book is an excellent reader's perk, even with repeated reading.
Here I present some of the observations.
On Albert Camus: "I found out on the pages of this book that the Mediterranean is not the sea, but a spiritual impulse, almost physical, just like what I feel, but it cannot be named: the indulgence of the anti-osudud, morality without guilt and innocence without any god."
On Samuel Beckett: "The hilist, the allegorical Christian, he wrote according to his own nature and not intellect, something between helplessness and ignorance, with blinding poetic humor, meaningless, as if it were the blade of a knife that almost killed him."
On Graham Green: "Our man has been laid against the passion of this woman for thirteen years, ancient, an assursment, a remorse, a spiritual privilege to achieve heaven by the way of damnation."
On James Joyce: "This was published by the Odyssey in Paris in 1922 in Sylvia Beach. This is one of the eight-thousand-strong peaks in the universal literature that must be surpassed by the north side, often from which the best climbers fall."
On William Faulkner: "He was a strange man.
Of himself, he said of himself as the heir to the landowner from the county, at other times that he was the son of a black woman with a crocodile.
Both were great dreams.'
On Louis-Ferdinand Céline: "This writer captured on the bridge the derangement of this man from Munich to bring his echo into the night of the XXth century in its literary form, fleeing from itself and calling for the future and speaking sharply to the worms."
On Dorothy Parker: "Once she knelt and said, 'Oh my beloved God,go,go let me stop writing as a woman.'
On Joseph Conrad: "In his grave, Spenser's verses were engraved: 'After the effort comes a dream,/after the storm a quiet harbour,/after the war of rest,/after a full life of death."
On Virginia Wolf: "He also carried down his depression in his luggage.
The husband had fully agreed to tell him that Edward VII had followed her between the azaleas or that the birds had been singing in Greek.
Never before has any man been so patient and in love with a neurotic, whose literary talent goes hand in hand with foolishness."
On Pío Baroja: "What was it about Martín Santosovia but to target Joyce on Baroja?
What was the Benet about but to have Faulkner's weapon be executed by Baroja?
What was all about Celo than to be made famous at the expense of the glory of the man?'
Coward token aggression
Last week, my 70-year-old mother walked through our neighborhood, in the district of Fuenlabrada, and a group of young people aged 15 to 18 walked through the wheel and our dog, a cross-ascued hybrid of no more than six kilograms from a shelter, twice kicked and severely injured without a word.
Our indignation is all the greater because we see nothing amusing in such an aggression against a small and defenseless animal, which, moreover, was on a leash.
On top of that, the old lady's shock after this incident, when she met these individuals on a walk, began to worry about her own safety, too, for such a devil-obsessed man who attacked an animal is able to do the same to a woman, a child, an old man, or anyone who is weaker than himself.
It happened at five o'clock in the afternoon, on Tuesdays, in the usually quiet neighborhood.
The dog cried all day.
We have, of course, filed a complaint against the nearest Commissioner, but we doubt that it was of any use, and to avoid raising delicate questions, we note that these cowardly killers were of Spanish nationality.
The outrage prompted us to announce this fact.
We don't understand what's going on with today's youth when they're amused by the fact that they're tormenting a defenseless animal that gives us love, companionship and friendship.
We don't see where the right manners, respect for animals and people, have gone.
Michelin and Fesvial together for using the helm
The manufacturer of tyres Michelin, in cooperation with the Spanish Transport Safety Foundation (Fesvial), has launched a campaign to promote the use of the helm, mainly for younger motorists, as both of them reported today.
The purpose of this initiative is to emphasise the importance of using the helmet, as it is the only means of preventing head injuries or, as the case of an accident, when riding a motorcycle.
Michelin states that this campaign forms part of their transport safety commitments, which "intends more than designing and producing even safer products," and confirmed that it seeks to fulfil this purpose in other ways, i.e. in the form of an instructional and information campaign.
This new campaign to promote the use of the helmet while riding a motorcycle, under the slogan 'To be or be not to be, is the first phase when up to more than 500 motorcycle repairs will be placed out the public to bring to the attention of the widest public.
Finally, Michelin pointed out that the transport safety was "a constant problem" for this company, which is a tyre manufacturer for two-wheel vehicles and whose main objective is to continuously improve product safety.
Increasing sales of light commercial vehicles
Almost two years on, the light commercial vehicle market is beginning to recover.
All 9,425 vehicles registered in Spain in November marked an increase of 12.6% compared to 2008 and, what is more, the first increase after 22 months of sustained bankruptcy, according to figures in the patronising organisation of the manufacturers of Anfac and the sellers Ganvam.
However, the favourable figure is better put into quarantine, as November 2008 is a very poor period for comparisons and marked a 60% reduction compared to the previous year.
As a result, notwithstanding the rise over the last month, the total number of registered vehicles in the last 11 months is 40% less than in the previous accounting year.
Since January, 95,853 vehicles have been sold, which includes all possible vehicles in the category of light commercial vehicles: car derivatives, pick upy, dispensers, smaller trucks and light trucks/riotes.
Nor have the gloom that most damaging the demand is lost, even if it was bought by private individuals, most of the purchases were made by smaller and medium-sized firms, and almost 100% of the time, it is funding through third parties.
To the limitations resulting from the closure of the bank credit source, other factors such as the cessation of activity or the continuation of the poor economic situation should be added.
In the situation, unlike passenger cars, the promotion of the purchase of 2000E did little to help.
In addition to private individuals, it is necessary to mention the goods business of small and medium-sized companies who intend to purchase a light utility vehicle up to 3.5 tonnes with a CO2 emission level not exceeding 160 grams per kilometre, but the number of operations has been confirmed.
Just yesterday from Ganvam they reminded once again that particular attention should be paid to the management of these vehicles, as well as to industrial cars (transports and buses).
The vendor's association projects that the development will be similar to last year in 2010 and, according to calculations, sales for passenger cars and 4x4 will fall by 19%.
The auxiliary system at the handbrake is already a mandatory equipment.
As with the anti-blocking ABS system, this will be the case with the stability control of the ESP, the helpers of the handbrake, all of which will become mandatory equipment for European cars.
In fact, it already forms part of the mandatory fitting of all newly registered passenger cars and light commercial vehicles, while for others there is a deadline for the removal of the shortage, which is February 2011.
The measure in place in the EU aims to increase pedestrian protection, while working so that it can help prevent many collisions.
The auxiliary handbrake system increases the pressure on the brakes in the emergency case, which the system detects after the driver is pressed.
But it can't always hold that pressure until the end.
According to a study conducted by car parts manufacturer Bosch, a third of drivers who have an accident have not braked before the collision, and half of them have not fully exploited the brake strength.
Up to 1,100 accidents
On the contrary, this assistance requires the maximum from the braking system, shortening the braking distance of the vehicle.
According to a study conducted in the EU itself, if all vehicles were fitted with this type of equipment, up to 1 100 fatalities a year related to pedestrians could be avoided.
Reducing this number will be even more striking-depending calculations would prevent one of the four accidents with an impact on the person-after introduction of the so-called smart handbrake systems.
In this case, the vehicles will be equipped with a system that (using the radar or camera) will capture the obstacles and are reported by the driver, except for the light braking.
If the driver responds, it will help him increase the pressure on the pedal if needed.
If the driver does not respond, even if the collision cannot be prevented, the device will act as intensively as possible on the brake and reduce the risk of damage to a minimum.
General Motors postpones plan for Opel until January
Nick Reilly, the new president of General Motors (GM) Europe, Opel's employees in Figueruelas (Zaragoza), that the production of the new Merivo will start in the first week of April - probably on April 8- - as reported by Javier Ortega, the US manufacturer points out that it will need more time to meet the Opel recovery plan.
Nick Reilly, the new president at GM Europe, is trying to get every point of the plan to be first agreed with the party involved.
As a result, it may be that the final document, which will first be submitted to the staff and then to the governments of the individual countries in which the production plants are based, will be issued with a delay in early 2010.
GM, on the other hand, assures that the Saab sale decision should be taken in these days.
No wonder the Swedish government has increased pressure on the US producers to take a decision as soon as possible.
GM allows contacts with some new potential buyers.
One of them could be Geely, who also wishes to acquire a Volvo, but is considering the option of Dutch sports car manufacturer Skyper, which operates under the auspices of the Russian group Converg.
In the event that it is not possible to reach an agreement with any of them, GM could sell some of the Saab assets to the Chinese Baic.
It is still determined to close the Saab at the end of the year if its sale is not made.
Ride with Porsche Boxster Spyder
In developing this splendid model, Porsche engineers used the Boxster S as a base and managed to reduce the weight by 80 kg, so the weight is only 1.275 kg.
Based on the first-row, the automatic retractable roof was in linch-clad design with a manual control, reducing the weight by 21 kg; furthermore, the aluminium doors were used as e.g. GT3, which means an additional 15 kg less; removal of air conditioning, 13; the reduction of the fuel tank from 64 to 54 litres also contributed to a reduction in the weight of another 7 kg; after the sporting seats were fitted, an additional 12 kg, thanks to a lightweight 19-inch collar cobbtled five kilos.
Finally, removing the CDR-30 audio system means another six kilograms less, and replacing the door handles with textile handles means an additional kilogram.
Also offered with a dual-clutch PDK gearbox, one vehicle with a hand-mounted six-speed gauge was tested, mainly on the second-class roads in California, on mountain sections with many intricate bends.
His conduct can only be qualified as untouchable.
The weight reduction does not mean that the vehicle is not pressed against the asphalt.
On the contrary, we have not tested such a small and lightweight model for a long time, which would also transmit such safety when moving around the bend, even at high speeds.
He's a small athlete capable of warming his muscles in a short drive for the time he needs until he's got a sprint, braking, and restoring the engine...
Anything we want. The steering, which is as communicative as accurate, whatever we hint with our hands on the steering wheel is what the car does.
And he'll do it with surgical precision.
The sound of the engine as he will
The V6 boxer sound, 320 horsepower (up 10 more than the Boxster S) is very subdued and can be amplified by the 'sport' and through a system that modifies the sound of the engine previously used by the Panamera.
The capacity of the acceleration is brutal, whether in the suction or recuperation.
The curtains are solid, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The tarmac of the roads through which we drive through the Boxster Spyder was rather damaged, but the car handled the potholes well.
The electronic support was almost unnecessary during the ride; and yet in some corners we came across icing and gravel even in the advanced morning at dawn.
Ultimately, this ultra-light car is one of the most funniest on the market, as it is a little more than a mere modification of the Boxster S.
The car will be released for sale in February 2010 at a price of €70.81.
'Bag Girl'
Karl Lagerfeld's girlfriend, Coco Cocoon-series icon and the occasional 'starlette' at the 'firma' shows', the singer shows off her face of the evil girl as vehemently as her Chanel handbag.
More than 'Bad Girl' or 'It Girl', it's 'Bag Girl'.
Baskonia wins in Israel
The cash register won a brilliant 82-91 victory in its hosting on the complicated Maccabi Electra, despite numerous absences from the Dusk Ivanovice team, and thus came to the top of her group after a big performance by Mirzy Teletovic, who with eight triple points was the best in the squad (29 standings).
The Vitorie squad was able to replace the significant absence of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Mic's great deal of commitment and collective work, though it had to suffer until the end to win the victory.
In addition, the great accuracy from the circuit with 16 triple points participated in the final triumph.
The game started on the front for the blue, who from the start stood on the mark.
That the first four baskets for Vitoria were from a distance indicated that they attacked the Israeli squad very harshly.
English and Teletovic were among the leading scorers in 18-20 at the end of the first period.
The second quarter was similar, but the Alava squad opted for the internal Barac game and the work of Eliyahu, which was received by whistle and applause on his return to his original site to increase the advantage before the break began (34-43).
Teletovic was already beginning to be the best in his team with 13 points, although with a six-without the Sixth's review, it was already suggesting that this would not be the best night for the Brazilians.
But although the match was sharp until the break, the decision was not made in the slightest, and the Maccabeys wanted to remind Vitoria that not everyone on their pitch was winning, and 'the foreman Elías's hand to win.
Eidson and Pnini have certainly contributed to the 'yyy' being back in the limelight (50-49).
More inappropriate
The Ivanovic members, injured but not dead at all, needed several precision games to catch their breath, and then Mirza Teletovic's machine gun appeared, returning the score to a reassuring score (54-67) with the help of Englis and Ribas.
The Alaws had cut their skin in the last leg, and English and San Emeterio (60--75) had already announced that they would not be allowed to be deprived of their deserved results of the first thirty minutes.
However, Pnini and Eidson, the best in their team, did not give up and tried to keep the team alive from the line of three points (70-77).
Despite this and with Split out of the way for a foul with the Ivanovic, they did not hasty and defended well, and although the Israelis approached the final minute (80-85), the match was already the winner and L. Aviv lost for the first time in a season.
Injuries make it impossible to fight Unicaja
Unicaja lost significantly in Greece to Olympiacos, leaving him the lead in the Euroleague in the Euroleague in a match marked by Unicaja, but above all by the indoor game(Freeland, Lima and Archibald), which facilitated the Greek victory.
The Malaga squad did not flinch the environment of the Pavilion of Peace and Friendship or its rival, perhaps one of the sicker in Europe, and with a large budget.
The first-quarter game allowed the Andalusans to dream. Aggressive defense and three triple points in a row, two thanks to Omar Cook and one Guillem Rubio, lit up the pitch with a 12-18 minute.
Olympiacos was surprised by the intensity of the Unicaja , although the arsenal of the locals in the indoor game with Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis, turned the score to 22-20, minute 13, which was the moment when the battle between the backing of USABeverley and Williams meant the exclusion of both players.
The Greek squad began to function and demonstrated its superiority in both zones, where the absence of an English pivot due to injuries to Joel Freeland's injury and two personal errors by Carlos Jiménez burdened the Unicaja squad
Between the inner players and the Lithuanian wing Linas Kleizas with triple points, they increased the advantage to 44-32 minutes of the 19th minute.
Immense remonessments
The third leg was very attacking by Olympiacos, who, despite losing by 19, showed superiority and even managed to match the gap from the match in Malaga, Malaga, a 66-48 minute, which was shaken by the lead in the group.
Unicaja struggled to overcome the absence and last absence of Scottish pivot Robert Archibald, who was injured in the last game.
Despite unichelves, thanks to the lead and triple points, Cook, and Lewis's contribution left some hope for a 66-57 win.
But it was virtually impossible, because Olympiacos, by boosting and predominating in centimetres in its zone, proved to be unstoppable.
Croatian pivot Nikola Vujcic, managed to equaliseketket 81 average-62, a minute 37, and Unicaja wilted and handed the lead to Olympiacos.

Brazil set a date for Zelay's departure
The Brazilian government has set a deadline for Manuel Zelay to remain at its embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The deployed president must leave the diplomatic mission no later than January 27, 2010, when his mandate officially ends.
Francisco Catunda, the chargé d'affaires of the Brazilian embassy in the Honduran capital, confirmed to TV Globo that "Mel" knows he must leave the embassy by that date, where he has been hiding since September 21.
"He is aware that he must leave on 27 January after the end of his mandate and seek another refuge."
The station also quoted a former statesman who confirmed his intention to leave the embassy before the deadline: "I intend to leave as soon as possible, logically under the auspices of the Brazilian government," Zelaya said by telephone.
After the November 29 election (when Porffirio Lobo was elected), Zelaya assured that he would remain at the Brazilian embassy until January.
However, the same week he attempted to take refuge in Brazil.
The operation eventually failed because Zelaya rejected the condition of political asylum sought to be imposed by the government "de facto" chaired by Roberto Micheletti.
Thank you
After days of wine and roses since last spring, when asset inflation was a prevalent mood in the markets, uncertainty has reappeared in the markets, which should not be surprising, as it is already a natural state in an environment where directors take decisions about a future that is in itself uncertain.
The drug used by the central banks to stabilise the market was the realisation of debt by the direct purchase of assets and the indirect release of liquidity at a close zero rate so that financial institutions could purchase the assets to be purchased to a deduction.
Central banks have already confirmed that direct asset purchases have virtually ended, and without questioning their mismatched liquidity policies, are beginning to throw a little sand in the gears, as the Spanish Central Bank did with its auction last year.
Investors are therefore in doubt about the world economy's ability to maintain economic recovery without such heterodox measures, and we are taking part in the return of lowering risk yields.
The exchange's immobility and the differences in the company's bonds have recerved to be scored, although they are still at the far level of the abnormal level they reached at the start of the year.
Countries were forced to socialize private risk, which again affected public debt.
Once again, quality is being pushed for quality, and the US, Japan and Germany have become a haven for the chosen investors, expanding the differentiation of eurozone countries towards Germany.
Spain was hardly affected by this instability, but at that time Standard & Poor's came and threatened to revise the Kingdom of Spain's qualifications.
On the other hand, some uncertainty is not useless to silence the adherents of the moral hazard who have once again sought to weigh down the conscience of those responsible for the world's economic policy to hinder the destructive consequences of limiting crediting to employment, when in fact a new Thanksgiving day would need to be announced.
However, the situation in Dubai represents tribal battles between the emirs of the emiries of restoration of power in the Emirates, and as far as Greece is concerned, we have seen this before.
A government that hides the deficit, the election and the new government is taking over.
Prodi did it in Italy after Berlusconi and Sócrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso.
It makes no sense for Ecofin to bail out Hungary from defaulting on foreign payments at the start of the year and to allow the euro member to default on its commitments.
But what makes sense is for Ecofin to force the Greek government to be transparent and to bind its own citizens to share responsibility in the need for extraordinary measures to maintain the stability of its public finances.
If, as we expect, we find ourselves at a time of normalisation of intermediate risk premiums, after some excesses in the supported positions they would be in anticipation.
In the Spanish case, while our differences in public debt will increase as will the bonds of European companies, we do not have to worry.
If Europe's differences are reduced and ours are further expanded, it would be a typically Spanish risk.
The matter of Standard & Poor's is just an anecdote. When our leading indicators force most of the study services to anticipate their recovery scenarios and revise their 2011 hike scenario, including the OCDE and the European Commission, to return to the Japanese scenario, it does not relish much hope for the Spanish economy to live up to this warning.
Again, it looks like it will be a great opportunity to buy Spanish assets, although for now "cautiously, my friend drivers."

Iberdrola President Ignacio Sánchez Galán was the first to intervene yesterday before the subcommit of the House of Commons, where, as these days, he is discussing Spain's energy strategy in the next two decades.
Following his intervention, followed by speeches by President Gas Natural-Fenos, Rafael Villasecy, Galán gave the press some remarks about the proposal he had made to the sub-committee behind closed doors.
According to President Iberdrol, Spain needs an investment of €50,000 million by 2020 and another 60,000 million from that date until 2030 if the nuclear power plants currently in operation are maintained.
If this is not the case, the necessary investments will not be as much as 60,000 million, but as high as 95,000 million.
Indeed, Iberdrola believes that in the next decade, investment must focus not on increasing production capacity, but on grids and international interconnections
From 2020, the issue will change and performance will need to be increased.
Its supply is focused on gasworks and coal-fired power plants with mechanisms for capturing carbon dioxide and, above all, on renewable energies.
In this case, he believes that a new 18,000 MW is needed, but with other "supporting energies."
The Galán, who believes the women's draft of the Sustainable Economy Act, which was just approved by the government, corresponds to the line the business demanded, did not want to bleed as a royal decree to promote the consumption of national coal, which contravides the policy of combating climate change.
In his view, the "clear long-term bet" in this sense is a "accurately" measure, as President Iberdrola called them.
Be that as it may, Galán believes that investment decisions, although long-term, must be taken into account now, as their maturation is ongoing and a stable tax framework for initiating them is needed.
Ferrovial wins 'handling' Aer Lingus at 10 airports
Ferrovial's subsidiary for airport ground services, the Swiss company Swissport, will play the role of a preferential partner for the Irish airline Aer Lingus for cost services at the 10 European airports where it is present.
Paris, London, Frankfurt or Brussels are among the most important of these.
The agreement, which has not yet been the subject of economic deadlines, has been in force for five years.
Ferrovial, the Junta Castilla-La Mancha and the University of Alcalá de Henares, yesterday signed a cooperation protocol to create a Centre for Innovates of Intelligent Infrastructures
The association projects an investment of 20 million by 2012, of which 50% is Ferrovial.
One of the tasks of the Centre will be to research energy efficiency on motorways and airports.
Acciona seeks first motorway in Australia against Hochtief and Bouygues
Acciona is fighting for its first concession on the motorway in Australia, a market where it already works as an energy and water business.
The building in question is a tunnel estimated at 1,700 million Australian dollars (about €1,047 million).
Its rivals are the French business of Bouygues and Germany's Hochtief.
A 5-kilometer-long tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane on the East Coast became the closest option for her to establish herself as a construction and concession motorway company in the country.
City Hall wishes to have the tunnel completed at the end of 2014
After selecting public-private cooperation (PPP according to the initials in English) for the further development of the project in the business plan sponsored by Erns & Young, the administration already has a final list of candidates for the implementation of the construction and operation of the toll.
Offering offers are expected to be submitted in the month of May, and the projected investment will reach 1,700 million Australian dollars (EUR 1.047 million) and in the last phase of the competition three concerns with a significant presence in European construction.
The group called Transcity is led by Acciona, the only Spanish company in the competition, and its associates are BMD and Ghella.
The first is one of Australia's largest construction companies and the second is one of the largest European underground construction specialists in Italy.
Against the Acciona Group, the Northern Direct Group, with the presence of the British Laing O'Rourke, the Australian infrastructure manager Transfield and the French construction group Bouygues, are in play.
The third and last concern that passed through the siege is called LBRJV and is involved in the Australian capital of Leighton (a subsidiary of the construction company of the German construction company Hochtief, represented here by ACS), also the local Baulderstone (ownership of the German Bilfinger Berger group) and a major firm specialized in the civil construction of Razel.
The Australian infrastructure market promises major construction and privatisation, but entails a clear entry difficulty in a way other than the middle of the acquisition of a local construction company.
The strategy, which was guided by the aforementioned Hochtief or Bilfinger, is still an example for the Spanish giants in the sector, in addition to the Asian references.
ACS acquired a market position through its 30 % stake in Hochtief, the owner of the quoted Leighton.
Million Million Assets
Acciona is betting on a geographical area of greatest importance for the sector, where it already has a significant presence through its activity as an energy supplier and in the desalination trade.
Among other assets, it has the largest wind park in Waubra (192 MW) in Victoria and leads a group of businesses that build and manage the desalination facilities in Adelaide with a budget of 700 million.
Its plan is now to consolidate the two areas and to use the common energy to enter the areas of the construction and operation of infrastructures.
The underground toll road, which is the promoter of the City's Authority, the City's Infrastructure Authority, called the Northern Link (North Link), is to connect the western highway from Toowong with the circular route in Kelvin Grove (see map) in the length of the tunnel. It is the biggest event to reduce Brisbane's congestion.
The calendar set by the local administration is planning awards for the summer of 2010 and the start of work for December next year.
Although this paid transit would open in the last months of 2014, with the full completion of the work planned for 2016.
The tunnel began to be designed in 2005.
It will include two streams in each direction, an electronic toll system and a comprehensive ventilation system.
The Queensland government will provide $500 million Australian dollars (€308 million) to finance it.
Brisbane has already offered this contract to Hochtief
Australia still makes a significant profit for Hochtief as it announced yesterday a contract with the government estimated at 154 million.
The ACS will put the national broadband infrastructure operational through its local Leighton subsidiary with a fibre optic fibre cable.
This situation will allow for speeding access to the internet for 400,000 people and will provide the work of the German company for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company left the 27-story project to build a King George tower in the Australian city of Brisbane. Construction work was yet to begin and Hochtief closed the sale for 129 million.
In the UK, specifically in Manchester, he will be involved with Laing O'Rourke in the construction and operation of two school centres for 25 years.
The initial investment will be €75 million.
FCC was allocated a tunnel in Slovenia for 64 million
The FCC, through its Alpine subsidiary, received the allocation of a construction of a 2.1-kilometre tunnel for a motorway in Slovenia worth €64.5 million.
The company received the contract a few days after the work of the expansion of the tunnel in Bosruck (Austria) for 130 million.
In this way, Alpine strengthens its experience in the construction of tunnels.
Work is scheduled to start in 2010 and the deadline for implementation is 32 months.
Sra. Rushmore wins ad in Renfe
Renfe has added advertising and marketing services to the Sra Agency over the past two years. Rushmore for an approximate sum of €3 million a year, the railway company reported.
The contract includes an extension of 12 months each year. Sra. Rushmore was selected among the 16 agencies presented in the bankruptcy of Renfe, of which four advanced to the final, among them TBWA , which was responsible for creating advertising for the last three years.
From this point on, the Sra will be. Rushmore take care of the design and production of campaigns.
Fined 63 million proFrance Télécom for braking competitors
The regulator's competition authority in France imposed a fine of EUR 63 million lFrance Télécom for anti-competitive conduct in the Caribbean areas belonging to the country.
According to the institution, the operator has restricted competition from fixed and mobile phones by signing exclusive agreements, pricing plans and fidelity programmes with consumers on the margins of regulation.
With this penalty, the former French monopoly and still the state-owned company has piled up more than €560 million in fines since 1994 for imposing obstacles to its competitors.
The fine imposed yesterday was de facto increased because the authority overseeing the competition considers that France Télécom has committed a similar offence as in the past and that there has therefore been a recidivism.
Shop with applications
On the other hand, the French company's mobile branch is still a star among other operators and has opened an online app store to increase revenues that will not come from voice broadcasts.
From the start, the Orange app store will be active in France and the UK.
It will be necessary to wait until 2010 to enter other countries like Spain.
Play in the Champions League brought in Madrid and Barça from the start of the beginning of 476.4 million
The Champions League has become a source of revenue for these clubs since its inception in 1992.
To the extent that Real Madrid and Barcelona have made 476.4 million since then, making them the third and fifth most profitable clubs in the competition.
The charter is led by Manchester United.
The charter is led by Manchester United.
Winning the UEFA Champions League does not only bring glory. It is also one of the main sources of revenue for the big clubs.
To the extent that the competition has distributed €5,366.5 million of €5.362.5 million among the 105 teams (of which 12 of them were Spanish), which had participated in the event since the tournament's creation in the 1992/1993 season, according to UEFA data.
Real Madrid and F. C. Barcelona came out of this division very well.
The White Club was third on the continent with the most money they received for their participation, and the only one, along with AC Milan, who won the top prize three times.
The Catalan current champion and last winner of Europe's defunct 1992 Cup is fifth in the 1992 classification.
The list is led by Manchester United and Munich's Bayern, two teams that also charged the most money to participate in the last-placed Champions League.
Even though she lost both to Barça.
On the other hand, Spain is up to the third country to raise the most money through the Champions, despite having won the most titles of all (five against four for Italy, three for England and two for Germany).
Distribution
This apparent paradox is explained by the complex process of distributing money used by UEFA.
For this accounting year, the body chaired by Michel Platini is planning to earn 1.090 million for the Champions League.
Of this money, UEFA will donate 413.1 million to fixed payments: each of the 20 clubs that took part in the preliminary classification round (including Atlético Madrid) received 2.1 million.
In addition, those who reached the participation received 3.8 million only for their presence, with a further €550,000 for each match in which he participates.
There is also a bonus for winning (€800,000) and a draw (€400,000 for each team). The eight-finalists will receive three million each; eight quarter-finalists3.3 million.
Each of the last four will receive 4 million.
The champion will make 9 million, while the second finalist will earn 5.2 million.
In this way, the club earns a minimum of 7.1 million and a maximum of 31.2 million in fixed payments.
On the other hand, Barça received 2.5 million for winning the European Supercup in August.
In addition, however, there are variable payments, for which 337.8 million is earmarked.
This money is divided according to the relative value of each television market.
Spain is one of the main ones and has four invited places.
The champion from last year will receive 40% of the money being added, the second 30%, the third20% and the fourth 10%.
The second part will be paid according to the number of matches played out this year.
Nueva Rumasa offers €61m for €29.9% Sos
Yesterday, the Nueva Rumasa Group published details of the stock buy-in offering to raise a top job between 25% to CNS's capital.
This percentage shall not commit to making a public offer for the acquisition of all securities (the extra).
In particular, Nueva Rumasa is offering €1.5025 per share to be paid for at the age of ten and for which he would pay interest for this postponement1% per year.
Yesterday, the Sos shares ended trading at €1.85; so Nueva Rumasa's offer rates the company 18% below market value.
According to Nueva Rumasa, the price of €1.50 reflects the fair value of the Sos.
The offer is conditional on the appointment of eight of the 15 members of the council.
The Jerezská Group provides a 15-day deadline for shareholders to announce their interest in selling the shares.
CNMV said it had not been informed of the offer, even though Ruiz Mateos confirmed that it had contacted the regulatory authority.
If the purchase is made, the price would reach 611.7 million, while the capitalisation of the Sos is 254.27 million.
Meanwhile, Sos is further changing the structure of his leadership.
As an attempt to remain on the sidelines of possible offers to buy and settle the court-breaking court swings of his former leaders, the Yeshoush brothers and Jaime Salazara, the election of María Luisa Jordá was announced as the head of the internal audit.
This decision makes her the first woman to occupy a high-ranking job at a food business.
It is a newly created site that will be given directly to the president of the group.
And it is not out of contention, as the business continues to be immersed in the legal battle over the alleged transfer of more than 230 million from the Sos to the Salazar brothers.
De facto, there is no shredding of the possibility that Sos will unveil new fund transfers in the coming months
As for the Salazars' credit, former board members Ildefonso Ortega and Ángel Fernández Noriega (representatives of CCM and Unicaja) testified at the National Court yesterday and confirmed that they had approved the transfer of 212 million without knowing their destination.
CNMV authorises the suspension option of the Paternina in which Inversora Mer participated
Yesterday, the National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) allowed the exclusion in which Inversora Mer is involved in the exclusion against Federico Paternin9. October.
The supervisory authority explained that it authorises this operation as it understands that its conditions comply with the standards in force and considers that the content of the explanatory brochure submitted after the modifications introduced on 2 December is "sufficient" for the explanatory volume.
CNMV stated that the offer was to obtain the acquisition of Federico Paternina's 550.008 shares at a price of EUR 7.65 per share, which represents 8.95% of the company's capital, which is made up of 6,42.786 shares accepted to trade on the Madrid and Bilbao stock exchanges.
He further explained that 5.592,778 million shares were impeded and could not be transferred in any way until the tender specified that the price was set by Federico Paternina in accordance with the provisions of the applicable standards was concluded.
New tools for car pricing
These days, storms and accidents are being made not only by car service.
Each day, thousands of cars that have suffered an insurance claim are towed to the service, where the expert must estimate the damage and the cost of the repair.
No insured event is the same, and calculating the cost of parts and time of the workforce can be a long and complex job.
Calculating manually the cost of repair costs from €20,000 to €30,000, including parts and manpower, can take two or three hours.
However, with the support of new computer tools, this would be a matter of minutes
That's why almost 100% of the connoisseurs use this kind of system.
Suppliers of services and solutions for estimating claims and maintenance dealers are dedicated to collecting the information provided by manufacturers to them to then draw up and offer their customers a useful tool.
In Spain, Audatex, of the American Solera group, is a leading firm; 80% of the ratings are made with its products.
Other firms competing in the field of valuation and information-originographisation tools are GtMotive and Eurotax.
Working with the data provided by manufacturers is not easy at all.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, sales director at Audatex, they work in Spain with 63 producers and importers, each of them providing information in a different format.
In addition, the amount of processing data is still growing as more versions, variations and motoring solutions have been presented in the last five years than in the previous 15 years.
As soon as the new vehicle enters the market, these businesses will start working.
This is a very frantic job, because it is necessary to cathope each of the thousands of parts of the vehicle and set its price.
In addition, for each model, "intelligent" graphic processing is performed" where it is possible to "pick" individual parts of the tourist cars.
When it comes to a model with a massive sale, the job can be done in a week if the process is very fast.
For a minor car, it can take three or four months. At present, Audatex has complete information on 99.2% of cars sold in Spain.
Among the most exclusive models about which they have information are Porsche, but not Ferrari or Lamborghini, for example.
The mobile park in circulation exceeds 99%.
To do the work of documenting and drafting databases, Audatex has eight centres divided around the world (Spain, France, Germany, the US, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan) and each specializes in specific brands.
The national headquarters is in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There, more than a hundred technicians (normally mechanical experts) work with three computer screens.
Audatex invests €90 million a year to develop these databases.
2.5 million data is added up to each month and customers receive updates every two days.
The processing of this immense stream of information enables businesses to use and provide different products.
The most common uses focus on repair and maintenance, but according to countries, there are also tools to manage spare parts or to calculate the car's sales or residual value.
The only undertaking with a guide to informs on the value of the used vehicles in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex doesn't offer them in our country, but in the United States, yes.
In view of the products offered by Audatex, it is easy to get the support that professionals in the sector can benefit from.
The company offers ten different devices, with the stellar product being AudaPlus, a standard cost valuation solution for connoisseurs.
It includes cars, motorcycles and light and heavy industrial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of parts, it also includes the time for the repair time estimated by the manufacturer or paint shop.
This tool is paid for by use for each evaluation.
