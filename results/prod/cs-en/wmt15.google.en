Petr Čech: Last minute transfer?
Everything is possible
Today is the last day when you can still jump through the transfer window and make a big transfer.
Another chance will come in the winter.
Petr Čech, currently Chelsea&#39;s substitute goalkeeper, is now not sitting on a new professional contract in Madrid, Monaco or Paris.
He is sitting in the NH Hotel in Smíchov, talking to Czech journalists and preparing with the Czech national team for a game general with the Americans and subsequently also for a sharp start in qualifying for Euro 2016 against the Netherlands.
In Chelsea&#39;s goal, Thibaut Courtois gets priority in the new season of the Premier League, the Czech Republic got into the position of substitute for the first time in ten years in a London club.
Some time ago, it was speculated that Real Madrid might be interested in the Czech Republic.
At the beginning of the season, he lost the Spanish Super Cup in battles with Atlétik and did not even manage to enter the league season when he lost 2: 4 in San Sebastian.
There was also speculation about the interest of Paris SG.
He spent the season in the French league with two wins and two draws, on Sunday he shot St. Etienne 5: 0.
The AS Monaco club pushes the shoes the most.
He still has a 1-1-2 balance in the league and on the weekend he broke up with Lille amicably 1: 1.
News appeared on tabloid English websites today that they might want Czechs at Queens Park Rangers.
According to English bookmakers, however, Čech&#39;s departure from Chelsea at the last minute is not very likely.
Skybet set a 4: 1 rate for him.
Peter, is it possible that you will change your jersey in the next few hours?
I don&#39;t count on it, but there&#39;s never anything one hundred percent in football.
For example, during the day there will be an offer that cannot be rejected.
What would such an offer have to look like?
(laughs) &quot;Well, I don&#39;t know yet what an offer that can&#39;t be turned down actually looks like.
It would have to be agreed by all parties. Above all, it would depend on Chelsea&#39;s position whether the club would deal with a possible offer or not.
Is it even technically feasible to make such a transfer now that you are in Prague?
Wouldn&#39;t it be necessary for you to sign a possible new contract somewhere in your new place of work?
So I didn&#39;t think about it.
But in such a situation there are a lot of players today, they are all somewhere at national team meetings and there are definitely a lot of transfers to be closed today.
So it would certainly be feasible somehow.
How many clubs are there on the planet that could afford you?
Well, I really don&#39;t know.
So you&#39;re not pushing to leave?
The situation where I did not catch in the first three matches of the new season is new to me after fifteen years of my career.
However, there is no reason to panic, pack up and go somewhere.
I want to continue to take part in the fight for the position of Chelsea goalkeeper and it is up to the coach who will choose what decisions he will make in the coming weeks.
What role does the family play in your decision-making?
I take all factors into account.
Of course, the sports aspect is important for me, but I also look at it from a personal point of view, to which the needs of the family obviously belong.
Is it possible that you would catch another club in England?
This is a question I thought would never concern me.
But in football, anything is possible.
I don&#39;t want to rule anything out.
I do not know the answer.
The Prime Ministers of India and Japan meet in Tokyo
The new Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is in Tokyo to meet his Japanese counterpart Shinzo Abe. He is due to discuss economic and security commitments on his first major visit since winning the election in May.
Modi is on a five-day trip to Japan to strengthen economic ties with the world&#39;s third largest economy.
The list includes, first and foremost, plans for greater cooperation in the field of nuclear energy.
According to reporters, India also hopes that the two nations will agree to cooperate on defense issues.
Police in Karrata arrested a 20-year-old boy after a motorcycle chase
They stopped the motorcycle after rushing 125 km / h through the zone with a maximum allowed speed of 70 km / h and drove into the bush to escape the police.
The patrol traffic police tried to stop a blue motorbike at the curb in the morning when they noticed that it was driving 125 km / h when leaving the gas station on Bathgate Road.
According to police, the driver did not stop and continued along Burgess Road and then turned into the bush, so the police lost sight of him.
A motorcycle and a person who matched the driver&#39;s description were then spotted at a house on Walcott Way in Bulgaria.
Karrath police accused a 20-year-old boy of disobeying a call for a halt and careless driving.
He will appear in court in Karrata on September 23.
The motorcycle was confiscated for three months.
George Webster accused of rape at hotels in Nairn and Pitlochry
The man will be brought to justice on charges of raping women in two hotels.
George Webster, 28, was briefed during a hearing in Glasgow High Court.
He was allegedly raped a woman on June 7, 2013 at Scotland&#39;s Hotel in Pitlochry, Perthshire.
She claimed Webster attacked her while &quot;she was unconscious, asleep, and unable to give her consent.&quot;
Webster is also being prosecuted for raping another woman at the Golf View Hotel in Nairn in the Scottish Highlands on May 4, 2014.
Judge Lady Rae set the date of the trial at 17 November at the High Court in Edinburgh.
Restoring the very American ideal that labor rights are also human rights
Congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis have proposed a law to protect union organizing as a civil right.
&quot;Depending on how the unions work, the jobs for the middle class work,&quot; said Ellison, a Minnesota Democratic senator who is co-chair of the Congressional Committee.
That&#39;s why I&#39;m so proud to be able to introduce an employee empowerment law with John Lewis, a model of occasional rights.
This groundbreaking legislation will give workers the same legal options to combat discrimination in trade union organization as other forms of discrimination - and stop anti-union forces.
It is a right and necessary initiative to amend the law on employment relations so that it allows all employees who face discrimination if they want to join a trade union to go to court in a civil court - and to assess compensation or damages.
But it is certainly not a radical initiative - at least not by American standards.
The best way to understand what Ellison, Lewis, and other proponents of the law put forward is to re-establish the American ideal.
Despite the trade union struggles that have taken place in recent years - in Wisconsin, Michigan and other states - Americans once encouraged countries around the world to adopt, expand and respect labor rights.
There were times, and millions of Americans still remember them, when the country promoted democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and the right to assemble with one breath.
When the United States occupied Japan after World War II, General Douglas MacArthur and his advisers supported the country to adopt a constitution designed to ensure that Hideki Toja&#39;s military autocracy was replaced by democracy.
Convinced that workers and their unions had a role to play in shaping the new Japan, they included language and openly acknowledged that &quot;the right of workers to assemble, bargain collectively and act collectively is guaranteed.&quot;
When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his advisers urged the Germans to create a constitution that would ensure that Adolf Hitler&#39;s fascism was replaced by a strong democracy.
Recognizing that employees would need to organize and promote themselves in the new nation, the Germans included a clause that openly states: “The right to form associations that secure and improve working and economic conditions will be guaranteed to every individual and every occupation or profession.
Arrangements that restrict or seek to infringe this right will be terminated. Measures to achieve such a purpose are illegal.
When former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt chaired the International Commission on Human Rights, which drafted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which was adopted by the United Nations as a global treaty in 1948, the drafters and Roosevelt included a guarantee that &quot;everyone has the right to protection create and join unions. &quot;
Americans for generations have adopted the basic premise that labor rights are human rights.
When the country advised other countries on how to create a civil and democratic society, Americans explained that the right to form labor unions - and their participation in collective bargaining with companies and government agencies as an equal partner - must be protected.
Now that these rights are being challenged in America, it is absolutely necessary to return to the American ideal that working people must have the right to organize and promote themselves in a free and open society.
As Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. said fifty years ago:
History is a great teacher.
Today, everyone knows that the unions have not diminished the power of the nation, but expanded it.
They have raised the living standards of millions of people, created a market for industry and raised production to an unsuspected level.
Those who attack unions forget these simple truths, but history remembers them.
History does not forget, and neither should we.
The formal recognition of labor rights as human - and the extension of civil rights protection to prevent discrimination in the organization of trade unions - is long overdue.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis renew the ideals that lifted America and made it a true promise of democracy.
The judge temporarily blocked a law that could close all abortion clinics in Louisiana
A federal judge on Sunday temporarily blocked a Louisiana law that, according to lawyers, would probably close all five abortion clinics in the state.
An ordinance enacted by Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal in June, due to take effect on September 1, would require abortion practitioners to have the right to admit a patient to a hospital within 30 miles of their practice.
The judge&#39;s resolution means that doctors can temporarily continue to perform legal abortions, and in the meantime they must obtain this permit.
&quot;The proposing party will be able to operate legally and in the meantime will obtain permission,&quot; said a resolution by federal judge John deGravelles.
The hearing will be scheduled within one month so that the judge can issue a more permanent resolution on the law.
Abortion activists welcomed the resolution, the latest in a series of similar measures, saying it would give doctors more time to obtain a permit.
&quot;Today&#39;s decision ensures that women in Louisiana are safe from the insidious law that deprives them of their health and their rights,&quot; said Nancy Northup, president and chief executive of the Center for Reproductive Rights, who sued to block three on behalf of three of the five clinics. of the law.
It was not immediately clear whether the decision also applied to doctors from two clinics who were not among the plaintiffs, and they also applied for such authorization.
Louisiana is among eleven states that have passed similar laws, with the Alabama and Mississippi courts declaring such measures unconstitutional.
A key section of the Texas law that would close most of the remaining clinics in the state was blocked by a federal judge on Friday.
Women&#39;s abortion rights activists, along with the American Obstetricians and Gynecologists Association and the American Medical Association, argue that the need for such a permit imposes medically unnecessary requirements on physicians.
Opponents of abortion opposed the measures aimed at protecting women&#39;s health, and some also welcomed the fact that the measures would close the clinics.
The Center for Reproductive Rights has stated that only one abortion doctor is licensed in Louisiana.
If all doctors in the state were forced to stop performing abortions, the doctor would also stop performing the procedure for fear of his safety, the group said.
In response, the Louisiana authorities said they would not punish doctors who perform abortions while waiting for their rights to be processed.
Due to late diagnosis and poor availability of treatment, ovarian cancer kills more often in rural areas
Angelina Jolie and her brother James released a video in tribute to their late mother, who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
Women in rural Australia are at higher risk of dying from ovarian cancer than their urban counterparts.
Researchers analyzed the medical records of more than 1,100 Australian women diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2005 and found that only 35% lived five years after diagnosis.
Research leader Susan Jordan of QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute said women in rural and remote areas of the state were about 20 percent more likely to die during the study than women in urban areas.
SMALL STUDY: New drugs can slow lung and ovarian cancer
The researchers followed the woman for seven years of treatment.
Dr. Jordan said the chances of survival were affected by the age of the women at the time of diagnosis, the type of ovarian cancer, other existing diseases, and socioeconomic status.
The lowest survival rates occurred in older women who were diagnosed with advanced cancer.
Women in rural and remote areas of the state were about twenty percent more likely to die during the study than women in urban areas.
Although the study was not designed to determine why women living outside the city were more likely to die of ovarian cancer, Dr. Jordan argues that factors may be late diagnosis and poor access to treatment.
&quot;The disease is best treated by gynecoecologists, who usually live in larger cities,&quot; she said.
Despite improvements in distance medical services to overcome the distance barrier, the doctor suggested that it would help strengthen transport services that allow specialists to treat women closer to their homes, and programs to support people who are being treated far from their families and friends.
Dr. Jordan said the study revealed that the long-term survival of women with ovarian cancer is low, regardless of geographical location, highlighting the need for better treatment and prevention programs.
Research funded by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer cancer will be published today by the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2012, at the age of 33, young mother Elisha Neave from the city of Gold Coast was diagnosed with an aggressive form of ovarian cancer.
Garden centers regret reducing the number of homeowners
According to an HTA study published by the Financial Times, the decline associated with the extraordinary loss of homeowners under the age of 35 could lead to garden centers losing up to £ 10 million a year when today&#39;s young generation of gardeners reach the &#39;main age group of gardeners&#39;.
According to the report, people who rent housing spend on their gardens an average of 55% of the amount spent by people living in their own.
Other factors threatening the industry, which earns an estimated £ 5 billion a year, include an increase in the number of people living in highly urbanized areas where there are no gardens, the popularity of paving instead of front gardens used as parking spaces and the shrinking size of gardens.
In the Greater London area, where the share of homeowners has fallen from 61% to 43% in six years, Britain has the lowest spending on gardening products in Britain.
The HTA and the Royal Horticultural Society have stated that subletting or lack of space does not mean that people cannot grow plants.
Guy Barter, chief gardening consultant for RHS, said: &quot;Potting in pots is very popular with tenants - when they move, they can take the plants with them.&quot;
The HTA report revealed that the &quot;golden age&quot; of the horticultural retail sector was between 1997 and 2005 and was the result of a higher share of homeowners and economic prosperity lasting from the 1980s to the mid-1990s.
He also predicted higher sales for this year due to better weather, which came after unfavorable conditions in March and April.
When an Eastern dictator preaches about democracy.
After rattling nuclear weapons at a gathering of his youth organization, which most reminds me of the Hitler Youth, and basically showing everyone that their views are stolen from him, he gave us a lecture on democracy today.
But I have the feeling that the current regime in Russia has many features of a fascist state.
The great nations have one thing in common, and that is that they can be controlled both by tense nationalism and by the fact that they can transform the inferiority complex into imperialist appetites.
Time is probably different in the East than in the West.
While the Western world thought that the era of wars for supremacy over Europe was long gone, in the East they thought they had been overlooked for a long time and needed to regain their international position.
Such mood and frustration prevailed in Germany in the 1930s, just before the Nazis seized power, followed by an outbreak of nationalism unlike today&#39;s situation in Russia.
And then the exact same cult of a strong leader, the beating of journalists, the elimination of uncomfortable political opponents, discrimination against minorities and homosexuals, is quite similar.
Vladimir Putin, and certainly large parts of the Russians, probably miss the time when Russia ruled half the world and the other part trembled before them.
Probably the Western politicians were to blame, maybe they patted Vladimir on the shoulders a little, maybe they didn&#39;t invite him where he wanted and maybe they started to underestimate him and he just behaved like a typical Russian man.
He tidied up at home, pretending he didn&#39;t really want to go anywhere, and sharpened knives at home.
Now he decided to regain his lost position.
It starts slowly, it has time.
He is probably the leader for life, so where would he hurry.
He trampled on the Caucasians, now he trampled on the Ukrainians, then it&#39;s the turn of the Baltic dwarves.
They have been biting the Russian bear in their furs for a long time.
This will certainly be noticed by China, which somehow jumps up a lot and certainly makes a fancy of the Far East.
And the Germans are also pretty annoyed with Vladimír, how they are doing well, and we put that in their asses at 45.
How about doing one new Novorosiya in Karlovy Vary.
That would be the base and there are a lot of ours, and as they oppress them there, they also wanted to demolish many of them.
After all, our veterans still remember how they were in Czechoslovakia.
Well, after all, their Prime Minister Gospodin Sobotka, he is so soft, you can peel like onions and I eat their whole EU.
That would be enough for them to jump on the great Russia.
They need to be reminded where their place is.
And as detonators we will use our cousins who live in their territory.
There are plenty of Russians everywhere, and when it is said that they oppress them there, they simply oppress them there and we will not let that happen, we will protect them.
And again the Russian will rule, for what else is he born for.
After all, Europe is only good as a preposition on which the proud Ivan can dance a Cossack.
Turkey summoned an American diplomat over a spy report
The Turkish foreign minister called the highest US diplomat in the country to explain the report on US and British espionage activity in Turkey.
Deputy Prime Minister Bulent said US charge d&#39;affaires and Turkish government officials discussed the report on Monday.
The German magazine Der Spiegel and the online magazine The Intercept stated that, according to documents provided by a former analyst of the US National Security Agency, Turkey was a priority target for US and British intelligence services.
According to the Turkish media, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan downplayed the importance of the report and said that all major states were watching each other.
An older report, according to which the German intelligence service also focused on Ankara, provoked a more indignant reaction from the Turkish government.
The Game of Thrones series introduced other tricks of the fourth series
The creators of Game of Thrones are currently filming episodes of the fifth order of the cult series.
At the same time, they boasted of how the tricks of the fourth series were created.
The most visible are the computer adaptations of the serial environment and the mass scene, when a group of soldiers becomes a giant army of the famous Daenerys.
Magaluf police chief accused of corruption
On Friday, the complainants presented to the Majority Public Prosecutor&#39;s Office evidence of extortion by police and civil servants in the municipality of Calvia.
The police director in Calvia on the holiday island of Mallorca was arrested after accusations made by businessmen and bar owners in the infamous party district in Magaluf.
Chief Inspector José Antonio Navarro was taken into custody after he was accused of corruption by several businessmen from Punta Ballena, the street where most of Magaluf&#39;s bars and nightclubs are located.
According to the internet newspaper Mallorca Diario, on Friday the complainants presented to the prosecutor of the Mallorca anti-corruption office evidence of extortion by police and state officials of the town hall in the municipality of Calvia.
Two other local police officers have been arrested by the Spanish state police for links to corruption allegations and are questioned by a judge with Navarre.
The Spanish national daily ABC quoted dissatisfied owners of nightclubs as saying that favoring public officials had serious repercussions on their business.
&quot;It&#39;s not about making money for a long time, it&#39;s about survival,&quot; one of the entrepreneurs said in court.
Don&#39;t mess with our livelihood.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf hit the headlines of magazines around the world after a video of an 18-year-old British tourist who showed oral sex to 24 men during a tour of bars appeared on YouTube.
Island authorities have since sought to oversee drunks and rioters at Magaful holiday parties by reducing the number of infamous alcohol bar tours.
In addition, the Playhouse, where the oral sex incident took place, was forced to close for a year and pay a fine of € 55,000 ($ 73,000) with Carnage&#39;s bar tour organizers.
The tourist resort Magaluf, which is especially popular with the British, has also witnessed many accidents under the influence of alcohol, including the fashionable wave known as &quot;balconing&quot;, in which people jump from one balcony to another or from a balcony to the hotel pool.
The first day of spring was marked by rain and storms that affected the flight at Adelaide Airport
SPRING brought an icy surprise to southern South Australia, with heavy rain and strong winds that hit Adelaide Airport hard.
Another 5 mm of precipitation is to occur in the city until nine o&#39;clock in the evening and another 6.6 mm will occur during the night on Sunday.
The last rain was introduced, along with a few brief showers associated with the storm and gusts of wind, which began before eight o&#39;clock in the evening and in almost ten minutes brought almost 4 mm of rainfall.
After several early doses of spring came after the winter last week, temperatures in the city dropped again to just 15.8 ° C on Monday.
The stormy weather is thought to have contributed to the delayed arrival of Virgin Airlines from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The plane was scheduled to land shortly after 7:30 p.m., but was hit a short distance by a change in wind speed or direction and was forced to delay landing.
Gusts of wind at Adelaide Airport at that time reached speeds of around 50 km / h on the ground.
Flight data showed that the plane had to abandon the second landing and finally landed at about 20:40.
The delay subsequently delayed other flights, including Emirates &#39;flight from Dubai and Qantas&#39; flight from Sydney.
It is forecast to reach a maximum of 16 ° C in Adelaide on Tuesday and one or two showers may occur.
Israeli children return to school after the war in Gaza
Thousands of Israeli children from areas near the Gaza Strip returned to school on Monday after spending the summer in bomb shelters, while rockets and mortars attacked their homes during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas. However, schools in Gaza remain closed as the territory recovers from the fighting.
The beginning of the school brought a sense of joy and excitement to the communities in southern Israel marked by the attacks, but signs of fighting are still evident.
In Ashdod, a city in the south of the country, the staff of a kindergarten hit by a rocket removed debris from the wall and slowly awaited the return of the children.
&quot;We&#39;re a little scared, but otherwise we&#39;re looking forward to it,&quot; said Ronit Bart, a Saad kibbutz resident and English teacher at a local school.
Many children in this area really need to return to their daily routine.
Her 11-year-old daughter Shani Bart revealed that &quot;it&#39;s a little weird&quot; to go to school again at once.
&quot;We had some hard times and didn&#39;t leave the house at all,&quot; she said.
Kibbutz near the Gaza border was visited by President Reuven Rivlin to offer his support to the people.
Until the ceasefire ended the war last week, thousands of border residents such as Saad remained inside their homes or fled their homes to safer areas farther from Gaza to escape rockets and mortars.
Many residents of Nachal Oz, a village near the Gaza border where a Palestinian mortar shell killed a four-year-old boy, are hesitant to return.
The Minister of Education stated that about twelve families still had not returned.
Their children were temporarily placed in foster schools.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited a school in Sderot, a city on the Gaza border that was hit hard by Palestinian fire.
He encouraged children to study hard, adding, &quot;We will provide you with education and safety.&quot;
Israel and Hamas agreed last indefinitely last Tuesday.
The ceasefire led to an immediate end to the fighting, but did not resolve key issues such as Hamas&#39;s demand for an end to the Israeli-Egyptian blockade of Gaza and the reopening of Gaza&#39;s airports and ports.
Israel demands the disarmament of Hamas and the return of the bodies of two soldiers killed in the war.
A new round of indirect negotiations is expected to begin later this month in Egypt.
According to estimates by Palestinians and the UN, more than 2,100 Palestinians died in the war, three-quarters of whom were civilians and at least 494 children.
Israel disputes these figures and estimates that at least half of those killed were radicals, although it has no clear evidence for these claims.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians died, including a Thai worker.
Hamas and other radicals from Gaza fired 4,591 rockets and mortar shells during Israeli cities, mainly in the south of the country.
The Israeli army, in turn, carried out more than 5,000 air raids and other attacks.
Israeli attacks have damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in Gaza, and an estimated 250,000 people have taken refuge in hundreds of UN schools, which have been turned into makeshift shelters.
Because of the tens of thousands of people still in hiding and the ongoing fighting, school officials postponed the start of the school year last week.
&quot;I hope that the school will open soon so that we can complete our education, just like the Jewish children and other children in the world,&quot; said Mohammad Amara, a thirteen-year-old boy from a school in Gaza&#39;s largest city.
Willow at the meeting: I stand behind Vácha.
And Lafatu is troubled by the temperature
The Czech national football team met in Prague today before noon before Wednesday&#39;s preparatory match with the USA and the subsequent opening match of the European Championship qualification against the Netherlands.
Spartan striker David Lafata, who suffers from temperature, has problems with the 23-member staff.
David isn&#39;t here yet, but Sparta had some problems last week, there were more players and David probably still has some problems.
But we want him to be here and to be in order as soon as possible, &quot;coach Pavel Vrba told reporters.
&quot;If it will be two or three days, or he will be fit tomorrow, it will be seen according to his health condition, which will be decided by our doctor,&quot; he added.
The other players are fine.
&quot;Of course, someone has some pain, but it&#39;s not like they can&#39;t train or take part in the match on Wednesday with the USA,&quot; said the Czech coach.
On Sunday evening, Vrba called Lukáš Vácha as the last player of the Spartan midfielder.
He admitted that it was not an easy decision, other midfielders were possible.
I decided based on the fact that Lukáš is a promising player who is 25 years old.
The decision was very difficult, but I stand behind it, &quot;said Vrba to Vách.
And what about Shural?
We&#39;ll see what happens to Latata
It is possible that in the event of health problems, the nomination could still change.
Josef Šural from Liberec, for example, shone with a great performance over the weekend, giving a hat-trick.
Of course, there are players who have been showing form lately.
We&#39;ll see how David Lafata does.
In case he will not be able to be available on Wednesday, I am not saying that I cannot nominate any of the players who were interested in the Czech league, &quot;said Vrba.
This afternoon, the national team will be training in Strahov, and on Tuesday the classic pre-match training before the duel with the USA in Letná, which will be open to fans and will be followed by an autograph session.
The match with the Americans will be played on Wednesday from 20:15 and the national team will strive for the premiere victory under Vrba.
He has played two draws in the previous three preparatory matches and lost once.
The qualifying duel with the Netherlands is then on the program on September 9 from 20:45.
The pawn goes to Italy in the Netherlands
Willow is happy to have more time for training, unlike previous meetings.
It&#39;s an advantage when you have players for eight days and you can practice certain things with them that we didn&#39;t have much time for before.
Now we will only be able to focus on preparing for the Netherlands as best we can, &quot;Vrba praised himself.
The Dutch will present themselves in Prague before Thursday&#39;s match in Prague and the duel will be personally watched by former temporary national team coach Josef Pešice.
He will give us information about the match.
But it will not be just about him, we will have the match filmed and we will analyze it.
A new coach is coming to the Netherlands, we will see what changes there will be, &quot;said Vrba to the bronze medalists from the recent world championship.
According to highly monitored statistics, apartment prices have risen the most in the last seven years in the winter.
According to the index of the value of apartments in the Australian capital RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic, housing prices rose by 1.1% in August, the agency said on Monday.
The increase led to an overall increase in June, July and August to 4.2%, the highest increase in the winter months since 2007.
The annual increase in prices climbed to 10.9%, more than double in one year until August 2013, but the profit was not evenly distributed in the country.
DP Data Research Director Tim Lawless said Sydney and Melbourne lead the market.
RP Data figures show that apartment prices in Sydney rose by 16.1% last year, while prices in Melbourne rose by 11.7%.
Other strongest markets included Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin, with price increases averaging between five and six percent.
On the other side of the scale is Canberra, which was damaged by state-imposed spending cuts and where prices rose by only 1.4% during the year.
Lawless said that now that spring has begun, the number of properties for sale will increase in the coming months, which will be a &quot;real test&quot; for the market.
&quot;Given the persistently high level of auction sales, the generally high rate of sales and the low interest rate, it is likely that the value of housing will increase over the next three months,&quot; he said.
Lenny Henry: My father never hugged me.
He never told me &quot;I love you&quot;
Henry was born in 1958 as one of seven children of Jamaican immigrants in Dudley, Midlands.
They had a colder relationship with their father, who died when Henry was 19 and who worked in a factory.
Henry is rehearsing a comedy, Rudy&#39;s Rare Records, which is based in part on an imaginary conversation with his father and which is part of the Radio 4 series.
The soundtrack is a mixture of reggae and rap and the melody is optimistic.
But Henry had to deal with some unpleasant childhood memories.
After his mother&#39;s death, Henry underwent &quot;thorough&quot; therapy and is now thinking about his relationship with his father.
He knew very little about him.
You&#39;ve never seen his face, only heard his voice: &quot;Stop the noise.
Leave your sister alone.
Shut up!
I want to watch cricket.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton - when I was a child they were adults - went to a bar with him and discussed things like the shape of a beer glass or the beauty of a cricket punch.
I&#39;ve never talked to him like that.
Most of my life, he was a serious guy in a corner reading a newspaper.
Henry had recently visited a foundry in Dudley, and although conditions were better than his father&#39;s time, he had an insight into what life must have been like for him.
Today there is a little more light, but it is still a dark, smoky, gloomy labyrinth where flames explode and there is a lot of smoke and soot.
Dad always climbed into the tub and just lay there, then he could hear him slowly singing to himself as he washed the foundry off.
As I walked around, I realized that he had been doing this for years to support his family, and I began to respect him more.
Even so, Henry spent his childhood without parental love.
Dad didn&#39;t hug anyone, didn&#39;t say &quot;I love you.&quot;
It wasn&#39;t until Mom was sick and dying that we started thinking, &quot;I love you, I love you, I love you.&quot;
His daughter Billie, whom he has with Dawn French, allowed him to experience the love he lacked as a child.
Can you stop saying &quot;I love you&quot;?
Don&#39;t hug me all the time!
Dad, I&#39;m 22!
With Dawn French.
Why shouldn&#39;t we be friends?
She&#39;s a great mom
They are still good friends with French, whom he has been married to for 25 years.
Dawn is nice.
Why shouldn&#39;t Dawn and I be friends?
She&#39;s a great mom.
Henry&#39;s own mother had diabetes.
It was one of the things that killed her.
So when I was very, very overweight, and the symptoms of diabetes began to show, the doctor told me, &quot;You have to make a radical change.&quot;
So I started going to a big fitness center and I also had to stick to a drastic diet to get rid of the symptoms.
It&#39;s very difficult.
And tiring.
Nobody wants to eat carrots alone.
The change in the direction of Henry&#39;s career may be reflected in his elegant, short beard.
After receiving critical acclaim for his Othello, he immersed himself in the theater.
This was followed by A Comedy Full of Mistakes and The Fences of August Wilson.
It&#39;s a different experience than the sitcoms and comedies that filled his hectic work life.
He started when he was 16 and worked in a factory.
The DJ noticed him parodying someone on stage and wrote about him in the New Faces talent competition.
His television career began in the mid-1970s: &quot;For a long time, I was the only black impersonator / comedian on television.&quot;
He studied on the march.
In addition to having to be noticed by the public, between 1975 and 1985 I also had to learn how to invent working jokes, be a star and appear on television, and that was really hard.
Lenny in New Faces in 1975
Because his manager owned the rights to the production of The Black and White Minstrel Show, an entertainment program in which the actors disguised themselves as blacks, Henry eventually starred in it with his comedy for five years.
My family was already uneasy about it.
I kind of wish it never happened, but I don&#39;t regret it.
Although it was a strange and awkward position, I worked on big stages and learned how to work with the crowd.
What was &quot;the main product of British television for years and years&quot; was also a &quot;grotesque parody of blacks.&quot;
In the 1980s, Henry worked in alternative comedy circles and introduced characters who both mocked and celebrated British black culture.
The first series, The Lenny Henry Show, began airing in 1984, and in the 1990s he was, among other things, known as Gareth Blacklock in the comedy series Chef !.
The next decade was taken up by commercials, documentaries, TV series and film roles, but after his LennyHenry.tv aired on the BBC in 2008, he said to himself: in one place, or you&#39;re a little out of the way. ”
Next up was a documentary on Radio 4 called What&#39;s So Great About ...? / What&#39;s so great about ...?
The first was Shakespeare.
I was seriously allergic to Shakespeare.
We didn&#39;t really learn it at school and I thought it was something for the white middle class.
So I was scared of it.
Everyone we interviewed on the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench, said, &quot;You should try it.&quot;
Don&#39;t get involved when you don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about.
Try a few words and see why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry delivered twenty lines of Othello&#39;s closing speech for the document, and he was on his way.
It made me feel like I could do it.
As if it gave me courage.
&quot;It&#39;s about it. It&#39;s a serious thing, take it seriously, learn the text, find out something about it.
So the rehearsal was hard and I had read the game for months and months before.
And it was a success.
They seemed to be in trouble, which did not happen.
He soon began acting in a comedy full of mistakes.
Suddenly I was at the National Theater. I could not believe it.
At one point I thought, &quot;You&#39;ve changed.&quot;
There was a technical glitch, and Henry instinctively felt he had to take responsibility for seizing the audience.
&quot;A voice in my head said, &#39;Before you fix a computer, you have to entertain them for ten minutes now.&#39;&quot;
Instead, the theater director announced that the performance would continue once the problem was resolved.
I left the stage and something inside me said, &quot;Um, thank God.&quot;
It&#39;s not my responsibility.
Someone else can handle it for me.
&quot;You&#39;re playing, so stay in the role.&quot;
Henry in Fences at the Duchess Theater
Learning the text of Fences was a challenge.
Panic is pretty good, it adds determination.
The game was also well received, so it&#39;s like God&#39;s sign saying, &quot;You should do this.&quot;
Of course he says it in a REAR voice.
So I stay with it.
I really like it.
I&#39;m happy in the rehearsal room.
Nevertheless, Henry remains the brain of a comedian - he interrupts our conversation all the time with humorous performances, when he enters and leaves the role of imitator.
I decided not to do stand-ups, because having the satisfaction of a room full of strangers is a little dangerous, I would say.
If you&#39;re still looking for something, you can get into a dead end.
Sometimes when I want, I do Live at the Apollo, but I don&#39;t enjoy it as before.
I asked if he would ever organize a stand-up tour again.
The joy of sitting in the same room with a director who helps to outline the beginning, the middle and the end of the journey - I don&#39;t think I would ever give up.
So your new incarnation?
I think yes.
I enjoy acting.
It is fun.
You keep telling stories, which is great.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Kenya registers government officials to shed light on non-existent employees
Kenya has begun biometric registration of all its civil servants to try to remove non-existent employees from the government&#39;s payroll.
According to a government statement, employees who do not register in the next two weeks will stop receiving pay.
The government believes that thousands of people are paid even after leaving the civil service.
After taking office in 2013, President Uhuru Kenyatta promised to prevent corruption in the state administration.
An audit conducted this year showed that the state loses at least one million dollars (£ 700,000) a month in the salaries of non-existent employees and further abuse of power.
The government suspects that salaries continue to be deposited in bank accounts even after the employee&#39;s death or after the employee leaves the state administration, said a BBC reporter from the capital Nairobi, Wanyama Chebusiri.
All civil servants must come to the identification centers within the next two weeks, where their data will be biometrically recorded, the government said in a statement.
He also says that anyone who does not show up without a sufficient apology will be excluded from the payroll.
&quot;By identifying real civil servants, this measure will make a significant contribution to its management and will also be used to clear the payroll at both levels of government, thus solving the problem of non-existent employees,&quot; said Anne Waiguru, secretary of the Ministry of Development and Planning.
Dozens of Turkish police have been arrested for plotting against the government
Local media report that a total of 33 police officers were detained in Turkey on suspicion of a &quot;conspiracy against the government&quot;.
The police authority has not yet commented on the case.
According to Hurriyet Dail News, fourteen high-ranking officials were among those detained.
Some were involved in a December corruption investigation into government officials, including four ministers.
In July, several Turkish police were arrested for allegedly organizing a criminal gang and wiretapping.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (then prime minister) called their actions part of the actions of Islamic cleric Fethullah Gülen against him and other people in power.
Not all children have returned to school in Ukraine
Most schools in Ukraine reopened on Monday (September 1) after the summer holidays.
This day is traditionally important for families, and like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arseniy Yachenuk took his daughter to school.
On this occasion, he told the journalists present that not all schools had reopened, but that he was determined to defend the country for future generations:
Not all schools held the traditional ceremony on September 1.
There is no peace in all of Ukraine.
We must fight for peace.
The whole of Ukraine, the united Ukrainian front, must fight for peace.
Alexan Pastukhov, a teacher at a school in Slavyansk, which Yachenuk&#39;s daughter attends, spoke in Russian.
We hope that peace will finally be achieved here and that children will acquire knowledge that will be useful to them in the future.
The first day of school is traditionally celebrated by children wearing embroidered shirts, bringing balloons and giving flowers to teachers.
In Ron Fairhead, the BBC may have found a boss for hard times
It carries with it clouds of fame from the world of banking, media management and the internal conclave of the Conservative Party.
She herself has experience from the front lines.
She began her career at consulting firm Bain and Co, then continued through Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and into the Pearsons media world.
She was the executive director of the Financial Times for seven years. She resigned when her younger colleague held the top position at Pearson&#39;s parent company.
Her severance pay is said to be close to a million pounds.
Its political portfolio is also extensive.
She was referred to David Cameron by Lord Browne, a former BP director, when Cameron needed private expertise in Whitehall: she became an adviser to the government office.
Her husband is a former member of the city council.
In May, I described the director&#39;s work as a goblet of poison.
Not only is the BBC a large and complex entity at the heart of public life, but there is also an internal paradox in its structure.
The corporation is turning in two directions: inwards to the top layer of the BBC&#39;s own management hierarchy, but also outwards to the voice of the public in times of unrest when things are not working.
It is an almost unsustainable monopoly that requires thorough reform.
But which director would risk coming into a company as complex as the Chinese dynasty, dismantling it and depriving himself of his job.
It is a difficult challenge.
If it weren&#39;t so hard, a lot of people would like to see the BBC shrink - its power, its finances - and its status revised.
As the scope of competition expands and new technology calls into question old certainties, the immediate negotiation of concession fees for the BBC carries great danger.
For a modest £ 145.50 a year, the British public is buying a stake in what is certainly the largest media company in the world.
The BBC tells a good story: it claims that its production reaches 96% of households, each costing only 40 pence a day.
In addition, the popularity of the BBC is clearly rising: to 53% of supporters compared to 31% ten years ago.
BBC service patterns have changed: Today, headlines appear on my mobile phone, and I can watch shows I&#39;ve missed on iPlayer.
But the BBC remains a very beloved and wonderful institution.
She needs an amazing director - I hope she&#39;s found one.
Texas Gov. Perry claims he did not approve the offensive tweet
A tweet from Texas Governor Rick Perry&#39;s official Twitter account, released on Sunday, contained an offensive image of a Democratic prosecutor who initiated Perry&#39;s criminal charges of abuse of power.
The tweet was later deleted and another was posted to Perry&#39;s account, distancing himself from the previous one.
A tweet that was not authorized has left my account.
&quot;I don&#39;t agree with the tweet and I downloaded it,&quot; he said in another post.
Perry&#39;s assistants did not answer questions with questions immediately.
Although the tweets were sent from Perry&#39;s official account, it is not clear who is actually responsible for managing it.
A previous tweet posted an unflattering, humorous picture of Travis County Attorney Rosemary Lehmberg, who was convicted of drunk driving in April 2013.
When she refused to resign, Perry refused to pay funds for her office, which brought Perry, a potential presidential candidate in the 2016 election, ahead of a grand jury in Austin this month.
The tweet caption said, &quot;I don&#39;t always drive with three times my blood alcohol level ... but if I do, I&#39;m suing Governor Perry for holding me accountable.&quot;
I&#39;m the most drunk democrat in Texas.
The investigation against Perry was not led by Lehmberg&#39;s office.
He was in charge of Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor from San Antonio, who was appointed by the Republican judge.
Perry was found innocent and called the accusation a tactical, political maneuver.
His qualified law team asked the case judge to dismiss the charges because using laws to prosecute the longest-serving governor in Texas history is unconstitutional.
Perry suspended $ 7.5 million from the Travis County-based state fund for the Department of Public Advocacy, which is prosecuting corruption in Texas, after Lehmberg refused to resign.
The rejection provoked a formal complaint from a left-wing group of civic activists.
Perry&#39;s official account is active - and sometimes he becomes famous.
After finishing fifth in his party&#39;s committee during his 2012 presidential campaign in 2012, Perry responded to speculation that he might be finished by tweeting with his own photo of running near the lake and saying, &quot;Here I am, South Carolina! &quot;
According to Berkeley, the housing market is returning &quot;to normal&quot;
One of London&#39;s most prominent development companies has warned that the housing market in the South East of England has &quot;returned&quot; to normal activity.
Housing in the capital has been the subject of high demand and rising prices, and widespread fears of a credit bubble have forced the Bank of England to introduce mortgage limits in June.
Tony Pidgley, founder and chairman of Berkeley&#39;s demanding client development company, said on Monday: &quot;Since the beginning of the current fiscal year, the market has returned from normal at 2013 with normal transaction levels.&quot; He added that it provides a &quot;stable operating environment.&quot;
The London housing market did well during the downturn as foreign buyers flooded the capital.
According to the cadastral office, last year alone prices in the city jumped 18.5%, far outpacing the average of 6.7% in England and Wales as a whole.
Average selling prices for private, affordable and student housing from Berkeley rose by about a fifth last year and climbed to 423,000 pounds at the end of April.
However, due to the strengthening pound, London real estate has not been so attractive to foreign buyers in recent months - some have also been intimidated by the introduction of new property taxes and talk of a possible &quot;housing tax&quot; that politicians came up with next May&#39;s parliamentary elections.
The London real estate agency Foxtons warned last week that the April revision of the mortgage market, which introduced stricter rules for loans, will also slow down the growth rate of the market in real estate sales and prices during the second half of the year.
New data from the Bank of England on Monday showed a decline in the number of approved mortgages for the month of July, suggesting that the housing market is calming down.
Hamptons International, another real estate agency, has lowered its 2015 London real estate price growth forecast to 3% as house prices have already begun to fall.
Meanwhile, the volume of transactions has fallen by a quarter each year in London&#39;s most expensive neighborhoods, such as Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington, according to WA Ellis.
Nevertheless, the demand for housing in the capital was a blessing for Berkeley, as it increased cash for forward sales to more than £ 2.2 billion.
Pidgley added: &quot;Demand for the right, good-looking housing in a good location has remained the same, keeping forward sales.&quot;
In June, the company announced that it had sold 3,742 properties between the beginning of the year and the end of April, almost a third more than before the peak of the crisis in 2007.
Annual pre-tax profit rose 40% to £ 380 million, revenue up 18% to £ 1.6 billion.
On Monday ahead of Pidgley&#39;s annual meeting, he said Berkeley&#39;s annual revenues are expected to be in line with current market expectations.
Analysts agree that the annual pre-tax profit will be £ 450 million.
Berkeley shares stopped at £ 23.96 this afternoon on the London Stock Exchange.
The hacker posted photos of naked Jennifer Lawrence on the Internet
Jennifer Lawrence arrives at the 85th Academy Awards.
Photos of Oscar winner Jennifer Lawrence leaked to the Internet due to a hacker who claimed to have a &quot;list&quot; of photos from hundreds of other beginning actresses.
A spokesman for the Hunger Games star confirmed that Lawrence&#39;s photos were genuine and criticized the hacker for &quot;blatant violations of privacy.&quot;
Authorities have already been contacted and will prosecute anyone who publishes Jennifer Lawrence&#39;s stolen photos.
The hacker, which was originally posted on the 4chan image sharing server, allegedly acquired the gap due to a gap in Apple&#39;s iCloud web storage system. The alleged list of photos of hacked victims according to BuzzFeed includes the names of dozens of stars including Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Mary-Kate Olsen.
It is not clear how many photos are authentic, but the star of the film &quot;Scott Pilgrim against the rest of the world&quot; Winstead also criticized the act on Twitter.
&quot;I hope those of you who view the photos your husband and I took years ago in the privacy of your home are happy with you,&quot; Winstead wrote on Twitter.
However, Victoria Justice, known from the Nickolodeon cable TV series &quot;iCarly&quot; and &quot;Victorious&quot;, denied that the photos were real. She said on Twitter, &quot;These alleged nude photos of me are FAIR, people.&quot;
Better cut it off in a rush. intentional pun.
Buzzfeed announced on Sunday evening that a spokeswoman for pop star Ariana Grande had denied that the alleged photos were genuine.
An extraordinary excerpt from Howard Jacobson&#39;s acclaimed new novel about love and the letter &quot;J&quot;
They disintegrated, that&#39;s the best way to describe it, they gradually disintegrated like a cardboard box that someone had left in the rain.
Only from time to time did a woman tell him that he was too serious, complicated, fierce, isolated, and perhaps a little irritable.
And then she shook his hand.
He admitted it angrily.
He could prick, like a hedgehog, yes.
The last victim of his ability was an incipient love affair that more than usual promised to relieve him of the lonely boredom of life and perhaps give him some satisfaction.
Ailinn Solomons was a fragile beauty with a wild mane of hair and a fleeting heart from a village on the North Island that was even more remote and inhospitable than Port Reuben.
She came south with an older companion, whom Kevern thought was her aunt, who had inherited the property in a damp but beautiful valley called, aptly, Paradise Valley.
No one has lived in the house for several years.
The pipes leaked, there were dead spiders in the tubs, the snails slammed on the windows as if they thought the place belonged to them, the garden was overgrown, and the weeds resembled huge heads of cabbage.
The house looked like a cottage from children&#39;s stories, scary and charming at the same time, with a garden full of secrets.
Author profile: Howard Jacobson, whose novel &quot;J&quot; is on the preliminary list of nominations for the Man Booker Prize 2014.
The shortlist will be announced next week.
Kevern and Ailinn sat on sofa chairs in the long grass, holding hands, enjoying an unexpectedly warm spring afternoon, absently tuning in to a public station that supplied the county with comforting music and reassuring news as the sight of her tanned crossed legs reminded him of an old song. a long-forgotten black comedian whom his father liked to listen to with his blinds closed.
Your legs are too big.
Due to their natural aggression, they no longer played such songs on the radio.
They weren&#39;t banned - nothing was really banned - they just weren&#39;t played.
They helped them get to the desuetudo, as did the word desuetudo itself.
Folk taste has accomplished what regulations and outlawings could never do, and just as people choose memoirs in books, in which the poor become rich, cooks, and love novels, so do ballads in music.
Cavern let himself be dragged down and began playing the imaginary piano, singing serenade in Aillina&#39;s big feet in a rough, comical voice.
Ailinn didn&#39;t understand.
&quot;It was a favorite song by jazz pianist Fats Waller,&quot; he said, automatically putting two fingers to his lips.
That&#39;s what his father always did when he wanted to suppress the letter j before it came out of his mouth.
It started as a game when he was little.
His father told him that he also played the game with his father.
When you didn&#39;t put two fingers in front of your mouth for a word that started with j, it cost you a penny.
It wasn&#39;t very funny then and it wasn&#39;t funny now.
He just knew it was expected of him, that was all.
He had to explain what jazz was.
Ailinn had never heard one.
Even jazz, although not directly outlawed, was not played.
Improvisation has gone out of style.
There was only room for one &quot;if&quot; in life.
When she started playing tunes, people wanted to know exactly where they would end.
The same for humor.
His unpredictability annoyed people.
And jazz was humor expressed by the song.
Although he hadn&#39;t heard of Sammy Davis Junior until he was ten, Kevern knew jazz from his father&#39;s semi-secret collection of old CDs.
At least Aillin didn&#39;t have to say that Fats Waller was black.
Due to her age, she could not remember a time when her favorite singers were not black.
Also without laws or coercion.
A permissible society is one in which every part of it agrees with gratitude - with the gratitude of those who have been happily spared - with the principle of group gratitude.
People of Afro-Caribbean descent with temperament and constitution were suitable for fun and athletics, so they sang and ran.
People from the Indian subcontinent, as if naturally gifted with electronics, have taken responsibility for ensuring that no family is without a functioning telephone.
The Poles who remained were plumbers, the Greeks who remained washed the dishes.
Those of the Gulf and Levanta states whose grandparents did not leave the country quickly while WHAT HAPPENED WHEN IT HAPPENED - they were afraid of being accused of putting them on fire were actually afraid of spending the fire next time. is - they opened a restaurant where they sold labneh and smoked hookahs, did not draw attention to themselves, and inactivity slowly consumed them.
To each according to his talent.
Because she listened only to ballads, Ailinn had a hard time understanding how the vulgar words Kavern had just sung to her could make music.
Music was an expression of love.
&quot;They&#39;re not really rude,&quot; Kevern said.
Maybe just for people who have too big legs.
My father never offended anyone, but he liked this song.
He spoke too much, but the neglected garden gave the illusion of safety.
Not a word could escape from behind the soundproof sheets.
Ailinn still didn&#39;t understand.
Why would your father like something like that?
He wanted to say it was a joke, but he was reluctant to put two fingers to his mouth again in her presence.
She already thought he was weird.
&quot;She seemed funny to him,&quot; he said at last.
She shook her head in disbelief and overshadowed Kevern&#39;s view.
All over the wide world was nothing but a tangle of her raven hair.
He didn&#39;t want to see anything else.
&quot;If you think so,&quot; she said doubtfully.
But that still doesn&#39;t explain why you&#39;re singing it to me.
She looked really upset.
Do I have too big legs?
He looked again.
Not your feet at all.
Maybe a little ankles ...
Are you saying you hate me because my ankles are too thick?
I hate?
It is not true.
It&#39;s just a stupid song.
He could have told her &quot;I love you,&quot; but it was too soon.
&quot;I&#39;m just attracted to your fat ankles,&quot; he tried.
I&#39;m a little perverted.
That didn&#39;t work.
He wanted to be funny.
When he wanted to be funny, he often got in trouble because, like his father, he lacked the magic necessary to tame the cruelty lurking in the jokes.
Maybe his father was cruel on purpose.
Maybe Kavern was intentionally cruel.
Despite the kind eyes.
Ailinn Solomons blushed and got up from her couch, dropped the radio, and spilled unfinished wine.
Elderberry wine, so drinking was not to blame.
She seemed to shake in her excitement like palm leaves in a storm.
&quot;I&#39;m perversely attracted to you being a jerk,&quot; she said ...
Except I&#39;m not attracted to it.
She felt sorry for her, both for her unkind words and for the fear in her eyes the moment she stood up to him.
Did she think he would hit her?
She didn&#39;t talk to him about life on the cold northern peninsula where she grew up, but he had no doubt that it was basically the same as it was here.
The same wide and icy ocean crashed against them.
The same confused men, after WHAT HAPPENED, even more reluctant and annoying than their ancestors, smugglers and spoilers, wandered angrily from pub to pub, ready to reach out to any woman who would dare reject them or laugh at them.
Jerk?
If she doesn&#39;t pay attention, they&#39;ll show her their fists!
Cuddle her first - cuddle has become the most common expression for erotic teasing between a man and a woman: the antidote to the faint ballads of love that the radio spewed - first anoint her, then kill her.
In Kevern&#39;s opinion, too much sophistication, because cuddling was in itself an act of violence.
Ailinn Solomons motionlessly motioned for him to leave.
He rose from the couch like an old man.
She felt annoyed herself, but the weight of his sadness surprised her.
It wasn&#39;t the end of the world.
They almost didn&#39;t know each other.
She watched him leave - as if watching him from a upstairs window - a man caught up in what he had caused.
Adam leaving the garden, she thought.
Her heart sank for him and for all the men in general, no matter how many of them beat her.
The man turned away from her, his shoulders drooping, embarrassed, defeated, all militancy left him - why did she seem to know this look well, even though she couldn&#39;t remember a single moment until today that she would ever see it again?
Ailinn Solomons, alone again, looked at her feet.
About twenty years after these events, Esme Nussbaum, an intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year-old researcher working in Ofnow, a non-statutory Public Mood monitoring system, has prepared a short article on the persistence of light and moderate violence in areas where mitigation or outright is most expected. if enough money and energy were spent on its removal.
&quot;Much has been done and much remains to be done,&quot; she wrote, &quot;to calm the innate aggression of people who have fought in many battles and won most of them, especially in hidden, hard-to-reach places in the country where, despite the top of the church spiers protruding above the hedges has seldom been discovered historically by a touch of human kindness. &quot;
However, some things are irreplaceable.
It might seem that the higher the church tower, the lower the instincts.
Residents sigh over sentimental ballads, devour unhappy stories and claim to firmly believe in the value of marriage and family life, but not only is old brutality in rural areas as stubborn as in urban areas, but evidence also shows that at home, in the workplace , roads and even on sports fields, a new and offensive intolerance is emerging.
&quot;Unfortunately, you tend to be too flowery in style,&quot; her supervisor said.
I would suggest you read fewer novels.
Esme Nussbaum bowed her head.
I also have to ask: Are you an atheist?
&quot;I don&#39;t think I have to answer that,&quot; Esme Nussbaum said.
Are you a lesbian
Esme again defended herself with her right to privacy and silence.
Feminist?
Another silence.
&quot;Therefore, I do not ask,&quot; Rabinowitz finally said, &quot;that I have anything against atheists, lesbians or feminists.
We have no prejudices in this workplace.
We serve an unbiased society.
But a certain kind of hypersensitivity, which in itself is perfectly acceptable and praiseworthy, can sometimes distort judgment as you have shown it.
Obviously, you yourself are biased against the church - things you call &quot;cruel&quot; and &quot;brutal&quot; could be interpreted by others as expressing natural strength and energy.
Still dealing with WHAT HAPPENED, IF IT HAPPENED, as if it happened, if it happened yesterday, prepares the country with its basic life force.
As Rabinowitz spoke, Esme Nussbaum looked around.
Behind his head, the recommendation that Ofnow had been sending out to the world for the last quarter century or more flashed pink on the light board.
Smile at a neighbor, take care of your partner, listen to ballads, go to musicals, use your phone, converse, explain, agree, apologize.
To speak is better than to be silent, a sung word is better than written, but there is nothing better than love.
&quot;I fully understand your reservations,&quot; Esme Nussbaum replied softly, as she was sure that her superior had finished, &quot;and I am no longer saying that the wound did not heal as we claim it had healed.
My main concern is that if we are not notified in advance, we will repeat the same mistake that led to WHAT HAPPENED IF IT HAPPENED.
But this time we will not vent our anger and distrust on others.
Luther Rabinowitz joined his fingertips.
That was meant endless patience.
&quot;You go too far,&quot; he said, &quot;when you describe the steps your grandparents may have taken and may not have taken as errors.
You also go too far in talking about venting your &quot;anger&quot; and &quot;distrust&quot; of &quot;others.&quot;
I should not remind anyone in your place that in understanding the past and protecting the present, we are not talking about &quot;us&quot; and &quot;them.&quot;
There was no &quot;we&quot; and there were no &quot;they.&quot;
All we know is that these were chaotic times.
&quot;During which, if we are honest with each other,&quot; Esme mustered courage, &quot;we are not innocent.
I don&#39;t blame anyone.
Whether it was fair or not, what happened happened.
That was before.
There is nothing to add - we agree on this.
And just as there is no guilt that can be attributed to anyone, there are no things that should be corrected, even if the remedy is appropriate and possible.
But what else is the past other than to learn from it -
The past exists to be forgotten.
If there&#39;s anything I can add -
Luther Rabinowitz untied his fingertips.
&quot;I&#39;ll take your report into account,&quot; he said, dismissing it.
The day after, as she went to work as usual, she was knocked down by a motorcyclist, who hit the sidewalk in a way that passers-by described as &quot;brutal and furious.&quot;
Coincidences happen.
The army of the Kingdom of Lesotho claims that no coup is planned - the prime minister remains in South Africa
Military officers in the Kingdom of Lesotho have denied organizing a coup to overthrow the government, claiming they have acted against police suspected of attempting to arm political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane fled the country, saying the military had surrounded his official headquarters and occupied government buildings in the capital, Maser.
After declaring that they were threatening to kill him, the prime minister left with his family for neighboring South Africa.
Army spokesman Major Ntlele Ntoi said it was not really a coup, but a military response to a threat from &quot;political fanatics&quot; the police were trying to arm.
&quot;This morning, the Defense Command of the Kingdom of Lesotho acted after receiving several reports from the intelligence service that there were several groups in the ranks of the police planning to arm some radical, political fanatics who were about to trigger the country,&quot; he told the American Voice.
South African government spokesman Clayson Monyela said the military action looked like an attempt to overthrow the government.
&quot;Although no one has said that he has seized power by force, the actions of the Lesotho defense forces appear to be showing signs of a coup,&quot; he said.
Military officials from the Kingdom of Lesotho said troops had returned to their barracks on Sunday and the capital was quiet.
During Thaban&#39;s absence, Deputy Prime Minister Mothetjo Metsing will be responsible for the government.
Thabane said he believed he was under attack for his efforts to fight corruption in the country.
There have been tensions in Lesotho since June, when Thabane suspended parliamentary sessions due to internal disputes.
He said that despite the opposite claims, his actions did not undermine the government.
Production in the euro area is at a 13-month low
According to a closely watched survey, production growth in the euro area slowed to a 13-month low in August.
The final index of purchasing managers in the euro area (PMI) fell from 51.8 in June to 50.7 in August.
A number higher than 50 indicates expansion.
New orders fell and factories damaged the growing tensions between the EU and Russia over Ukraine.
The figures come from Thursday&#39;s meeting of the European Central Bank (ECB).
Markets will want a clear plan from the bank to deal with the delayed recovery of the eurozone and the threat of deflation with inflation stagnating at 0.3%.
There has been speculation that ECB Director Mario Draghi may have indicated this week that he was considering a quantitative easing of the eurozone, similar to that taken by the United Kingdom and the United States during the financial crisis.
&quot;Although at least some growth is better than no growth, the slowing effect of the growing economy and geopolitical uncertainty on producers is becoming increasingly visible,&quot; said Rob Dobson, chief economist at Markit.
The production PMI of Germany, Russia&#39;s largest trading partner in the EU, fell to an 11-month low of 51.4.
In the zone&#39;s second largest economy, France, the PMI fell to 46.9.
Concerns prevail over France, Italy has again moved from expansion to stagnation.
The signs that the driving force of growth in the most important industrial areas in Germany, Spain and also the Netherlands has disappeared are also not very reassuring, &quot;said Dobson.
The slowdown in the industry is likely to add fuel to the fire for analysts expecting the implementation of additional monetary or tax incentives.
One positive news came from the Republic of Ireland, where the PMI rose to 57.3, the highest level since the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, chief economist at IHS Global Insight, said: &quot;The best that can be said about the purchasing managers&#39; production survey for August is that it shows that the sector is still growing.&quot;
He added: Eurozone producers are currently living a very difficult life, as increasing geopolitical tensions - especially between Russia and Ukraine - add even more uncertainty to the increasingly difficult conditions in many countries.
This growing uncertainty has demonstrably affected business - especially consumer confidence, which is likely to cause some orders to be postponed or even canceled, especially costly ones.
He said it became &quot;even more likely&quot; that the ECB would eventually have to implement some form of quantitative easing, &quot;although we expect it to be limited.&quot;
Ten years of hell for Beslan survivors: Ten years after the horrors of a busy school, children are still suffering
Ten years ago, a thousand people were held hostage by Chechen radicals at a school in Beslan in southern Russia
During the three-day suffering that shocked the world, more than 330 people were killed, more than half of whom were children.
We returned to Beslan to look for some of the victims who escaped death during the atrocities at school
Exactly ten years after the terrible occupation of the school in Beslan, which killed 334 people, including 186 children, the surviving heroes warned last night of a new apocalypse in Ukraine.
When the fanatical terrorists captured and murdered children and parents on September 1, 2004, at the beginning of the new school year, it seemed like the deepest bottom of hell.
Resistance to the tragedy united East and West, leading to action and a future in this catastrophic disaster.
Ten years later, we returned to Beslan in southern Russia to look for some of the victims who escaped death during the atrocities at school.
We have found amazing young people who have resisted the misfortune, even though the memory of the hell caused by the terrorists will live on in them.
What is their biggest wish?
So that the war that is now destroying Ukraine - and in which children like them are dying - is over.
A girl trying to climb back into a ruined school gym
She was captured by leading Russian photographer Dimitri Beliakov trying only to get back in his underwear to a bombed school gym after a bomb exploded.
Confused, Aida desperately searched for her mother, Larissa, now forty.
There were fears that both were dead, but they did survive.
&quot;A woman told me to run and save my life, but I couldn&#39;t,&quot; Aida said at the time.
My legs were covered in blood.
I got up and climbed back to find my mother.
A soldier saved her.
After several surgeries, she thought she had fully recovered, but yesterday she said, &quot;Three months ago, the pain returned.
I&#39;m afraid I&#39;ll have to have another operation.
Pieces of shrapnel remained in my knee.
Her goal is to become a dentist so that she can help people as doctors have helped her.
&quot;This tragedy changed my life, but it certainly didn&#39;t destroy it,&quot; she said firmly.
&quot;It simply happened to me and it can&#39;t be changed.
I go to the gym once a year to remind those who stayed there.
Otherwise, we try not to talk about it with friends.
The pain is too great.
My best friend and future classmate from Gera Gapoeva&#39;s class were killed there.
When we were little, we played together and imagined going to school together.
&quot;I don&#39;t want to get married until I finish school and start a career.
I will think about the family later.
She says she has not forgotten about the captivity, but the memories fade a little every year.
I am glad that so many people around the world still remember what happened, and we are very grateful for the help we have received from Britain and other countries.
When I look at my photo of a school window on the Internet, I tell myself that a lot of people will see it for the first time, understand the catastrophe and prevent it from happening again.
A boy who escaped the rain of bullets and believed that his mother was dead
It was his first day of school (in Russia, children start school at the age of seven) and he survived a three-day siege of school in the arms of his mother Tamara.
At the time, the seven-year-old said, &quot;My mother told me that if there was an explosion, I should lie down and hold her hand.&quot;
After the explosion, he thought his mother was dying.
She told him, &quot;Run.&quot;
Fearing that she was dead, he ran away and saw a crying toddler along the way, grabbed the child&#39;s hand and ran a spray of bullets.
His father Vladimir, who had caught him outside, said, &quot;Damir told me his mother was dead.&quot;
She says, &quot;I couldn&#39;t save her.&quot;
In fact, Tamara stumbled to freedom and lay in the hospital with an injured leg, thinking that her son had died.
After meeting again, she said, &quot;I cried with happiness.
I could not believe it.
He ran inside and hugged me.
Damir then flew to London (according to the defunct News of the World), where he was declared the winner of Bernardo&#39;s Children by then-Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Cherie.
&quot;The horror comes back every day, but I wish I could stop thinking about it,&quot; he said yesterday.
But I can say that the memories are fading.
I remember immediately throwing away all my guns to play with.
But today I can play computer games in which they shoot, and I have no problem with that.
&quot;I&#39;m not afraid to go back to the gym, but I&#39;m not thinking about myself.
I remember the children I played with in the yard and who didn&#39;t get out.
We will never say that they were killed or that they died.
We say they stayed in the gym.
I remember the trip to London well, especially how I could choose whatever I wanted in the toy store and how I drove the convertible.
But now he is worried about places like Ukraine, where he and his friends are suffering because of the war.
The horror comes back every day, but I wish I could stop thinking about it
&quot;I am very sorry for anyone who has to go through such horror,&quot; says Damir, who volunteered at the monastery last week.
I really want to help.
One day I want to work for the police and I hope to be accepted to the academy next year.
His mother, Tamara, 48, says: “They killed 37 children from our neighborhood, can you imagine that?
I remember that silence right after the attack. There were no children anywhere screaming and running here, and the silence lasted several months.
He vividly remembers the journey with Damir to London.
When I told our story in London, people were crying.
Then I realized how people on the other side of the world can understand our feelings and how they can express their support.
She was grateful to Cherie Blair and her foundation for the award and for the opportunity to go to London in the fall of 2004.
I wish I could call Cherie and say in person that even though she&#39;s been ten years old, I still remember meeting her and her husband in London and helping me and Damir.
I remember how Damir had a taste for borscht, so they called all Russian restaurants.
I also remember playing with waiters in a restaurant, Damir shooting at them with a water pistol, and they were running and playing with him.
And it was only a month since that horror.
I was surprised at how the British wanted to share our pain with us and how they supported us.
She said: &quot;I still don&#39;t think the world has changed for the better in those ten years.
Now there is a war in Ukraine, people are dying every day and I think a lot of children have been and will be killed.
They are the same children as ours.
I think for a lot of people, war is just something in the news that they listen to when they&#39;re bored or while they&#39;re doing something else.
I know what these people are going through, what a horror.
I still feel it.
Nothing has changed, people still want to kill each other, it&#39;s so sad.
Damir grew up and is a nice and quiet boy, not aggressive or angry at all.
For example, he doesn&#39;t want revenge, he doesn&#39;t care about that at all.
I know he doesn&#39;t like to remember it, but he&#39;s very close to his six classmates, and from time to time he goes to the gym and lights candles there.
When he was smaller, he had problems with it - I remember sometimes lying down on the couch with his face turned away from us and sometimes lying there for hours.
He did not sleep, his eyes were open.
I also remember throwing away all his guns or other weapons to play with. Damir is 17 today, he is taller than me, handsome, smart and healthy.
I can hardly believe that for several hours I was sure he was dead and I would never see him again.
When I recovered from the explosion and got to my feet, I looked around and saw the hell, pieces of human bodies lay everywhere.
I was absolutely certain that my little boy had no chance of surviving this hell.
&quot;I remember shouting &#39;Damire, run, run!&#39;, But I was convinced he hadn&#39;t heard me.
But he heard her and ran away.
So our life goes unlike others.
Grigory Ilyin, 17
A boy whose photo was taken after the attack became a symbol of horrors in Beslan
Consolation: Beslan survivor Grigory Ilyin with his mother Fatima after the 2004 attack, on the right Grigory today
As he fled for his life after a Chechen terrorist shot his classmates, fear was etched in his bloodied face.
His photo was one of the most shocking symbols of atrocity in Beslan.
His mother Fatima, 54, a doctor, dropped him off at school the first day and hurried to take her older son Vladimir to university.
&quot;I left two minutes before the terrorists broke into the yard, so my little boy was left alone for three days,&quot; she recalled.
Not completely alone, because we had relatives there, but they all died there.
Only my Grigory survived.
As the date approaches, it&#39;s getting harder to think and talk about it.
Not a day goes by that we don&#39;t remember the tragedy.
We don&#39;t think it happened a long time ago, I feel like it was yesterday, some moments keep coming back to me.
I promise no one will ever forget.
Ever-recurring memories: Grigory&#39;s photo (left) was one of the most shocking images of the attack and was immortalized as a statue (right)
I remember Grigory looking forward to school that day, saying he wanted to hug his teacher.
I found out he was alive when I saw him on TV.
There is even a statue of the weeping Grigory in San Marino.
Grigory doesn&#39;t like to look at the photo and we have it hidden in the bookcase at home.
I understand that, but I also think that because of this picture, people all over the world know how much pain we feel.
Today, Grigory says: &quot;It is important that this does not happen again.
&quot;I doubt we will ever know the truth.
Similar tragedies are still being investigated, but no one will ever find out the truth.
They are now investigating the Boeing crash in Ukraine.
Will we ever know what the cause was?
Something very bad is waiting for this world.
&quot;I don&#39;t understand why this is happening, because if you ask people, no one wants a war, so how is that possible?
Ten years is nothing for such pain.
It takes us decades to forget at least a little.
It affected my health, I still feel it.
I had a nightmare attack for three or four years, but then it got better.
When I returned to school in 2004, I was scared every day.
I thought of my friends and classmates they had killed.
That&#39;s why when it&#39;s approaching September 1st, I go to the gym.
I want to honor the memory of my childhood friends.
It&#39;s hard for me to enter that gym, but I have to.
I don&#39;t feel like a victim, this story is a thing of the past.
I will not forget it, but I do not regret it.
My life goes on.
This year I finished school and started studying medicine at the University of Vladikavkaz.
I want to be a heart surgeon.
First I wanted to join the army.
I wanted to be a soldier, but for health I couldn&#39;t.
I wanted to fight for my country, but it wouldn&#39;t work.
Grogorij Farniyev, 20
A boy who survived despite being held at the feet of a murdered terrorist
Miracle: Gregory Farniyev was held at the feet of a murdered terrorist during an attack, but still managed to survive
When the attack was in full swing, he was caught trapped in a gym sitting next to a bomb at the feet of a murdered terrorist.
It&#39;s a real miracle that he survived.
&quot;It feels like yesterday,&quot; said Gregory, who wanted to become a Federal Security Service agent but could not because of the injuries he suffered during the attack.
It&#39;s still with me, it&#39;s not something I threw behind my head.
I&#39;m older now and it is said that children can cope better with bad experiences - I must say that this is not true.
&quot;I went to a psychologist in 2006 and I was a little better then, but I can&#39;t forget.
And I would like to forget.
In 2005 - a year later - it was the first and last time I re-entered the gym.
I fainted.
I will never go there again and please do not ask me to show you where I am sitting in that well-known picture.
Survivor: Gregory Farniev today, on a laptop with his photo taken in the hospital after the attack
The pain is huge and I carry it with me every day.
Friends know that I don&#39;t like to think or talk about it and they never ask me about school.
As for physical health, I&#39;m fine.
I have to be careful about my knee, which I hurt, but I&#39;m already walking normally.
But even so, due to health, I could not enter and study at the FBS Academy in St. Petersburg, as I wanted.
I sent them my documents, including medical reports, and they replied that it was not possible.
My other hobby is animals, so I went to the vet.
I finished there the second year.
They learn how to treat all animals from &quot;cats to cows&quot;.
He said: &quot;I know I will never tell my children about it.
It is not something that children should know about and not something that they should experience.
His mother, Marina, 42, said: &quot;The pain will always be here.
It&#39;s inside and it&#39;s getting worse with the anniversary approaching.
I will attend commemoration ceremonies.
I know Grigory won&#39;t go.
It must be even stronger for him, because unlike me, he was there.
I was waiting for him at home and I couldn&#39;t help him.
I&#39;m so grateful to God he gave it back to me. There are footprints everywhere here in Beslan.
It stays with us.
Gregorij is an adult today, but he continues to bear the horror.
It&#39;s hard to accept when something so terribly unfair happens to you.
He is a boy, he likes sports, but he can&#39;t do it because of his knee.
He has undergone several surgeries, can walk but cannot exercise.
I would say that he has already overcome the horror by 50%, but it is impossible to overcome it completely and forget it.
This terrible experience will always be with us.
They killed a lot of our friends and neighbors during the attack, and that only makes the pain worse.
I lost a lot of people I loved and who were close to me.
My son is with me and this is the greatest gift God could give me, but I suffer the loss of those killed.
I know families where other children were born, but also widows who have not remarried.
It&#39;s hard to accept that life goes on, even if you don&#39;t.
I will never forget how my heart almost jumped out of my chest when I saw him in the hospital.
Now I&#39;m watching what&#39;s going on in the world - wars elsewhere.
What are these people fighting for?
Why do they kill each other?
The war is now approaching our country, which I can hardly believe.
We used to be one friendly country, so how did we get into fighting together now?
People and children are suffering, I am sure that many children in Ukraine have been and will be killed.
If only we could pick up all the rebels and throw them away - as far as we can.
Alyona Tskaeva, 10
A child who was taken to safety by a special commando
Rescued: Alyon Tskaeva is carried to a safe Russian special commando (left).
She is now ten (right) and does not remember the tragedy at all
The world gasped in 2004 when little Alyona was taken out of Beslan captivity by a Russian policeman.
The terrorists released her, but kept her 30-year-old mother, ten-year-old sister Kristina and brother Makhar captive in the school gym.
Makhar, who was three years old at the time, escaped, but Alyon&#39;s mother and sister died in the massacre.
Her brother Ruslan remarried, and he and his new wife, Svetlana, have a baby girl named Kristina after their dead daughter.
Neighbors say Alyona, now ten, does not remember the attack at all and has grown into a bright and happy little girl.
A close friend said that &quot;it&#39;s a big happy family and Alyona and Makhar are great children.&quot;
Ruslan is a great father and wants to keep the children away from the memories that the tenth anniversary commemorates.
You can understand why.
A man accused of knocking down a girl on a crossing sign in the village of Fife
A 78-year-old man was on trial for knocking down a three-year-old girl at a crossing at a sign in Fife.
Gordon Stewart allegedly knocked the girl down at a crossing in Pittenween in East Neuk.
The plaintiffs claim that Stewart did not drive his Audi Q3 with sufficient consideration and attention and injured the girl.
Stewart, 78, of Anstruther, denied the allegations in Dundee court.
Judge Charles Macnair set the date of the hearing in January.
4 tips on how to take better photos and videos underwater
If you are interested in taking photos or shooting underwater, you have a large selection of equipment at your disposal.
The cheapest option is a compact such as the Nikon Coolpix AW120 or the GoPro Hero3 + Silver Edition outdoor camera, which costs around $ 300.
I took these photos at a family celebration with several cameras, all costing less than $ 350.
It doesn&#39;t matter what equipment you use, but there are a few rules for best results.
Check the equipment.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure that the batteries and other parts are tightly closed.
Next, set the camera according to the type of photos or videos you take.
Some cameras and camcorders have a scene or shooting mode that optimizes the exposure for dark underwater environments.
And before you get started, find out how deep you can dive with your equipment.
Some cameras are designed only up to 5 feet, others up to 50 to 60.
Read our guide to buying and evaluating digital cameras in standard and waterproof design.
Always take a few pictures - a lot of them won&#39;t work.
Compact cameras have an LCD to help you compose photos, but outdoor ones don&#39;t.
Even if you have an LCD, it will be difficult to see underwater and the composition of the shot will be unpredictable.
So always take more pictures.
If your camera has a bracketing mode that takes a series of pictures with slightly different exposure scatter, take advantage of this.
Stay close to the surface.
With a deeper immersion the light decreases significantly.
If possible, stay close to the surface when shooting in a pool, lake or sea.
This will also allow you to capture more light in your photos - the deeper you dive, the less color you will see.
Get close to the subject.
This is great advice if you are shooting on land, but underwater it is even more important because of the dimmer light.
This is especially important when shooting with an outdoor camera: Such devices usually have a fixed and wide angle lens, which means that if you want to fill the photo frame, you need to get closer to the subjects.
Andrew Lawson was a man whose strength of personality was able to change things even in an organization as vast as the NHS.
As an anesthesiologist, he dedicated his career to relieving patients from pain caused by disease and treatment.
His wife recalls that one of the people who sought his help was an MI6 officer who had to live with the consequences of torture that crippled him.
Lawson understood that while physicians focused on diagnosis and illness, the vast majority of treated patients were interested in something completely different: pain.
One day in 2007, however, it was he who began to suffer.
&quot;I don&#39;t feel in my skin,&quot; he wrote in May of that year.
I felt without energy.
He struggled with flu symptoms and found himself impatient and embracing his wife Juliet.
He remarked, &quot;I want everything to happen sooner rather than later.&quot;
When Juliet went on a business trip for a week, Lawson was unusually and inexplicably upset.
Something was wrong.
A colleague did an X-ray of his chest.
He had been skiing in the French Alps one or two weeks earlier.
The X-ray results have arrived.
He had mesothelioma, an incurable tumor that affects the pleura or the lining of the lungs.
For most cancers, it is difficult to determine what was causing them.
Although some smokers get lung cancer, not all lung cancer patients smoked.
But mesothelioma is different.
In almost all cases, it is the cause of exposure to asbestos - a building fibrous material that was previously described as &quot;miraculous&quot;, but is now known to be deadly.
It was not difficult for most of us to ignore mesothelioma.
Asbestos, after all, is a thing of the past.
The most dangerous type of asbestos has not been used in Britain since the 1960s, when a ban on the use of asbestos in industry came into force.
Even at the time when asbestos was used, only certain groups of people came into close contact with it, such as insulators, builders, carpenters and shipyard workers.
The toxin used in industry in another era hardly seems to be a cause for concern today.
But such complacency is out of place.
As it turns out, the mesothelioma epidemic is culminating in Britain today.
The number of mesothelioma deaths is higher here than in any other country in the world.
2,500 deaths from the disease per year are twice as many as the number of car accident victims.
The number of deaths from mesothelioma per year since 1980 and estimated future deaths in the UK
The reason why we are only now feeling its effects, even though the use of asbestos has been illegal for years (all types of asbestos were finally banned by law in 1999), is that it usually takes several decades for mesothelioma to develop.
The disaster in the form of mesothelioma is not just affecting construction industry veterans.
Asbestos has been, and in many cases still is, present in the homes in which we live, in the offices where we work, in the schools where we learn, and in the shops where we shop.
Thus, mesothelioma does not respect social class, wealth, occupation or age.
Privileged bastions, from London department stores to public schools, are no shelter.
Parliament is also full of asbestos.
Even the hospitals where we should be treated are repositories of this deadly carcinogen.
Andrew Lawson was not old.
He didn&#39;t even consider isolation.
He tried to figure out where he might come in contact with asbestos.
Then he figured it out.
&quot;It&#39;s possible that a lot of asbestos was in the basement corridors of Guy&#39;s Hospital, where I spent six years practicing,&quot; he wrote.
All - students, nurses, doctors and porters - used the corridors.
The question is, how many of my contemporaries get the same disease?
Unfortunately, that was a question he could partially answer.
&quot;Of the four doctors who practiced at Guy&#39;s Hospital and who then developed mesothelioma in the last five years,&quot; he said in a letter in 2010, &quot;I am the only one still alive.&quot;
How many of us get sick?
Andrew Lawson was diagnosed with mesothelioma when he was 48.
When he died on February 17 this year, he was 55.
It is not common to survive with this diagnosis for so long.
55 percent of people diagnosed with mesothelioma die within eight months of diagnosis.
The disease is always fatal.
So now we can only repeat Lawson&#39;s question: &quot;How many of us will get the same disease?&quot;
According to leading British mesothelioma expert Professor Julian Pete, the best estimate is that between 1970 and 2050, when the asbestos epidemic took place in Britain, some 90,000 people would die.
Most of them currently have no idea that they will die this way.
Asbestos mine in Quebec, Canada
A cursory glance at the court archives, which people with disabilities often turn to and seek compensation, shows how widespread the mesothelioma disaster has spread.
For example, this June, Marks &amp; Spencer admitted to negligently exposing Janice Allen to asbestos.
She worked for the chain for nine years, from 1978 to 1987, when she oversaw the clothing department in two stores - one of the locations was the company&#39;s flagship store on Oxford Street.
Allen was only 18 when she started working for M&amp;S.
Today he has two children, over twenty.
&quot;Before it happened,&quot; he says, &quot;I&#39;ve never heard of mesothelioma before, I barely knew anything about asbestos.
It never occurred to me in a dream that it might affect me in some way.
There aren&#39;t many people who know anything about asbestos.
In fact, asbestos is not a single substance, but a group of six minerals.
It got its name due to its fibrous structure, which gives it strength and flexibility.
Of the six minerals, three were used in construction.
Today, chrysotile, commonly known as white asbestos, is most commonly found in buildings.
It has been used in roof panels, floor tiles, boiler seals and even in brake linings.
It is not as deadly as other forms of asbestos, yet the EU and WHO consider it a &quot;major health risk&quot; that can cause death.
However, brown asbestos (amosite) and blue asbestos (crocidolite) are more dangerous.
Britain was once the world&#39;s largest importer of brown asbestos, and experts say &quot;there is convincing but indirect evidence that this was the main cause of the unusually high incidence of mesothelioma [in the United Kingdom].&quot;
A Marsk &amp; Spencer employee was exposed to asbestos at a flagship store on Oxford Street in London
Janice Allen may not consider herself a typical victim of mesothelioma, but Julian Pete&#39;s work points out that her story is not at all unusual.
His patient study states that &quot;a significant proportion of cases of mesothelioma without known asbestos exposure at work or at home were likely caused by environmental exposure to asbestos.&quot;
Much of this exposure is due to the &quot;normal use and weathering&quot; of buildings.
No one seems to be sure he is safe.
A report by Goddard Consulting, which examined the Palace of Westminster, shows that even people in the center of government may have no idea that they may be exposed to asbestos.
In 2009, Goddard published a report that service elevators and pipelines behind parliamentary committee rooms were contaminated with asbestos, the deadly fibers of which could be broken by something as harmless as &quot;strong air currents.&quot;
Ministers are often accused of caring only for their own interests, but in this case the opposite may be true.
Although Parliament&#39;s Directorate of Services has insisted that the Palace of Westminster receive a &quot;positive medical certificate&quot;, it is now estimated that one million pounds and several years of work will be needed to scrutinize Parliament, modernize electricity and remove asbestos, and that After the 2015 elections, MEPs will be sitting in the Queen Elizabeth II Conference Center, rather than on the green benches in Westminster.
The Goddard report states that &quot;the presence of asbestos is not in accordance with several regulations.&quot;
It is not possible to say whether this discrepancy will cost lives.
Everyone can just wait now.
One person who has never been able to determine when they have been exposed to asbestos is Graham Abbott, a doctor.
Like Andrew Lawson, Abbott, 50, is suspected of being exposed to asbestos while working in hospitals.
&quot;I worked in a hospital where asbestos was detected,&quot; he says, &quot;but in my case I can&#39;t prove it.
It is difficult to remember all the places where he worked and when he worked there.
But he clearly remembers the day at the beginning of December 2009, when he was overcome by something like a cold.
He was 45, he was in the evening and he was in the middle of an operation.
Suddenly I shook.
It came at once.
I was terrible.
I thought I wouldn&#39;t drive home.
Because he was a doctor, he knew that the pain came from the pleura, the lining around the lungs.
But like Janice Allen, he had no reason to believe it was mesothelioma.
He eventually spent a month at home.
Confused doctors did a chest x-ray and inserted a chest catheter to remove the fluid from his lungs, which they sent for analysis.
Nevertheless, they did not determine the diagnosis.
His condition slowly improved and he returned to work.
From time to time, however, his symptoms returned, often after he had exercised and exhaled.
In 2011, one of Abbott&#39;s patients with similar symptoms came to the operating room and was subsequently diagnosed with mesothelioma.
Even then, however, Abbott had nothing to do with his own case.
After all, his patient was several decades older and came into direct contact with asbestos at work.
In this case, the connection was clear.
In September 2011, Abbott&#39;s condition worsened again and his doctor consulted his panel of experts for his CT and X-ray images.
In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbott began to feel unwell, a camera-equipped probe was inserted into the space between the chest lining and his lung lining.
I&#39;m an optimist.
I tend not to take much, &quot;he says.
To be honest, I didn&#39;t worry much about it.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried.
The results of the biopsy arrived between Christmas and New Year: &quot;They told me it was mesothelioma.&quot;
Graham Abbott: diagnosed with mesothelioma
Abbott began dating sisters from the Macmillan charity, and one advised him to contact a lawyer.
At that moment, he realized the extent of the epidemic.
&quot;Asbestos has been shown to be widely used, especially in large public buildings, which often have asbestos thermal insulation in pipes,&quot; he says.
People who have been exposed to asbestos in these buildings are now starting to show the disease.
Thus, mesothelioma is now beginning to affect younger people who do not have high-risk occupations.
The most dangerous asbestos-insulated pipes in hospitals were located in the basement, so they were unlikely to endanger patients.
However, staff members who walked through the basements between the buildings (like Andrew Lawson) or ate in the basement dining rooms (like Graham Abbott often) came in contact with the toxic substance.
As it now turns out, several decades after the war, hospitals were a place where they could save patients&#39; lives, but also a place that could endanger the lives of doctors who treated them.
Asbestos is removed to this day.
Pupils built Bunsen&#39;s torch on asbestos mats
And it&#39;s not just hospitals.
Asbestos has often been used in offices, shops, libraries and town halls due to its excellent insulating and non-flammable properties.
In schools too.
In fact, many people have been exposed to asbestos at school.
Somewhere in countless chemistry classes, students built a Bunsen burner on an asbestos mat.
Websites dealing with the issue of asbestos in schools have been created.
Harmless things like floor tiles or roofs of tool sheds in our homes commonly contained asbestos.
&quot;It&#39;s an industrial poison built into a large number of homes,&quot; notes Andrew Morgan, a lawyer who represented Andrew Lawson in his lawsuit against Guy&#39;s Hospital.
In one case, the only contact with asbestos that a woman with mesothelioma could remember took place in the 1970s during the demolition of a garden house.
So watch out as you demolish the garden house.
Knowing that the disease is incurable, the impact of the diagnosis is enormous.
&quot;It takes a while to figure it out,&quot; says Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and tried to keep going, but I found I couldn&#39;t concentrate on what I was doing.
I was in the operating room for two weeks.
Then I realized I would have to leave and deal with myself.
Well, I won&#39;t live to see another Christmas.
One of the most difficult things was the transition from doctor to patient.
Like the countless patients before him, he remembers how confused he was about the amount of information he had to deal with.
&quot;It was hard to understand,&quot; he says.
&quot;I asked my doctor, &#39;How much time do I have left?&#39;
I was told that twelve months.
I remember thinking, &quot;Well, I won&#39;t live to see another Christmas.
That&#39;s it.&quot;
Mesothelioma is particularly destructive because the very mechanism of what keeps us alive - breathing itself - is what causes the cancer to kill.
Most cases of mesothelioma are caused by asbestos exposure.
Asbestos is made up of small fibers.
When asbestos is broken and the fibers are inhaled, they can settle in the pleura, the lining of the lungs.
Asbestos fibers irritate the pleura and can cause cell mutations.
&quot;The problem is inhaled needle-shaped asbestos fibers,&quot; explains Professor Tom Treasure, a cardiac surgeon who joined Guy&#39;s Hospital in 2001.
To the same hospital where Andrew Lawson was apparently exposed to asbestos and which is paradoxically a leading center in the treatment of mesothelioma.
Treasure Lawson is known and treated for other patients who have been exposed to asbestos, probably during a hospital practice.
Asbestos needles enter the lung tissue, says Treasure, and “breathing itself pushes them to the edge where the lining is located.
It is invasive by nature.
The common treatment options used for other types of cancer do not work so well for mesothelioma.
For example, the effectiveness of the operation is hotly debated.
According to some, it would be worth a try.
Treasure disagrees.
&quot;You can&#39;t remove the pleura,&quot; he says.
You won&#39;t get a scalpel around her.
Cancer &quot;does not respond well to chemotherapy,&quot; which &quot;has some effect&quot; but does not cure.
&quot;Sometimes there&#39;s someone who survives lung cancer,&quot; says Treasure.
But in the end, everyone dies.
Fortunately, some patients live much longer than expected.
Author Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after diagnosis.
Two and a half years after his own diagnosis, Graham Abbott is still struggling.
After finding mesothelioma, Abbott contacted Andrew Lawson, who, four years after his diagnosis, became an individual support and counselor for people with the same disabilities.
As they called, he introduced himself cheerfully, &quot;Hello, you called the Cancer Center.&quot;
&quot;He was very positive,&quot; says Abbott.
He was diagnosed with the disease four years ago and was still very active.
Initially, Abbott was offered six cycles of chemotherapy that lasted four months and would probably only prolong his life by a month.
&quot;I was desperate,&quot; he says.
I wanted to give it up.
But Lawson &quot;was able to show things in a more optimistic light.&quot;
After visiting several doctors, Abbott decided to continue treatment with Professor Loic Lang-Lazduski of the Department of Thoracic Surgery at Guy&#39;s Hospital.
&quot;I had the advantage of not having to wait for me to be sent to him, but I just called and they looked at me,&quot; Graham admits.
A normal patient would have to receive a request and be approved for reimbursement.
In order to get the best treatment available, money is a key issue for mesothelioma patients.
But when various treatments inevitably fail in the end, many patients face additional financial worries - about the future of the family they leave behind.
And that&#39;s why they go to court and want compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgana of Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
&quot;Since 1898, asbestos has been known to be harmful to health,&quot; says Morgan.
In the 1960s, however, it was discovered that even a very small amount could pose a health risk.
And here we encounter the negligence of companies.
Andrew Lawson and Guy&#39;s Hospital eventually settled, but Morgan said it was not a &quot;full settlement,&quot; because Lawson could not conclusively prove that mesothelioma was the result of asbestos exposure at Guy&#39;s Hospital.
However, after investigating the case, a spokesman for Guy&#39;s Hospital confirmed that &quot;asbestos in the incriminated basement was removed in the 1990s.&quot;
It was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How to remove asbestos
Seducing lethal asbestos to one company or place of work - usually decades after it has happened - has proven to be a huge problem for patients with mesothelioma seeking compensation.
Many former workplaces changed owners or went bankrupt.
The insurance record has been lost.
And those who are now resisting the allegations have time on their side, which their prosecutors certainly do not.
In response, important new legislation was passed this year that makes it easier for mesothelioma patients to seek redress, even if their former employer cannot be traced.
The law created a $ 350 million financial reserve paid for by insurance companies for people diagnosed after July 2012 who can prove they have been exposed to asbestos but have no one to sue.
In such a case, the disabled will receive 80% of the amount that the court would normally award them as compensation - approximately £ 120,000.
300 successful applications are expected each year.
Andrew Morgan, like patients with mesothelioma, think £ 350 million is &quot;good work.&quot;
&quot;It&#39;s an agreement written by insurance companies for insurance companies,&quot; he says, pointing out that the sum is a quarter of what insurance companies would have to pay if it didn&#39;t hit time and people with mesothelioma were able to track down former employers and sue them in the normal way.
Even Mike Penning, a former secretary of labor and social affairs, admitted that the law &quot;had gaps.&quot;
But both Penning and Morgan admit that seven deaths each year required swift action.
&quot;People are suffering too much and need help now,&quot; Penning said last December during his second reading of the mesothelioma law.
Graham Abbott was in the care of Professor Loic Lang-Lazdunski for 19 months.
After initial consultations, Lang-Lazdunski recommended an operation which, unlike Tom Treasur, he thought had a positive effect.
The operation was followed by radiotherapy and chemotherapy - a triple treatment in which Lang-Lazdunski boasts a survival rate of five years in up to 40% of patients.
It made Abbott stronger.
&quot;That&#39;s not the most important thing, of course,&quot; says Abbott.
You still see it in patients.
There is something that drives you.
When you give up, your condition can get worse very quickly.
Graham Abbott underwent surgery in March 2012.
At the end of August, he completed the last of six cycles of chemotherapy.
Inspections showed no signs of disease.
I went for another inspection in March [2014].
I had a few stains [cancer] scattered in my chest.
My fiftieth birthday was approaching.
It does not endanger life.
It takes him.
Abbott underwent six cycles of chemotherapy again.
There are currently no traces of tumor in his body.
But it is a physically and emotionally exhausting process.
You have to think about practical things - financial security when I die, or to show a woman how an alarm clock works on a boiler.
When you learn the bad news, you start to be negative.
You have to look ahead.
Like Father Ellie (16) and Tamsin (14), it&#39;s not always easy.
&quot;It&#39;s hard for parents,&quot; he says.
It&#39;s hard to decide what to say and how much to say.
After the diagnosis, I told the girls that my condition meant I would never be old.
Their reaction was different.
Tamsin is very sociable and wild.
She told her friends and suddenly a lot of people started calling us.
Ellie was more reserved.
She didn&#39;t say much.
Such conversations must be faced by all cancer patients.
However, in patients with mesothelioma, such conversations are not relieved by hope or a hint of a chance of survival.
The illness brings with it (and eventually brought Stephen Jay Gould) unhappy security.
As Andrew Morgan says, &quot;mesothelioma is not life-threatening.&quot;
The bodies of embalmed pharaohs are wrapped in asbestos cloth.

He will not pay any compensation.
During World War II, ships were built intensively, and work in shipyards posed the highest risk of asbestos exposure.
Ban on imports of blue asbestos
The Court of Appeal confirms the first successful action for personal injury caused by asbestos exposure in Britain.
World asbestos production is increasing to more than 4,213,000 tonnes per year.
The United Kingdom imports 139,000 tonnes.
The UK Institute for Health and Safety requires that all asbestos suppliers be licensed.
The import and use of blue and brown asbestos is prohibited by law in Britain.
The use of all types of asbestos is banned in Britain.
The Mesothelioma Act enters into force in the United Kingdom.
A 350 million compensation program is launched.
Asbestos is banned in more than 50 countries, but in many parts of the world, white asbestos continues to be used as a cheap building material.
World production is maintained at two million tons per year.
China refuses to give Hong Kong the power to elect a leadership - protesters promise revenge
Despite growing discussions on democratic reform on Sunday, the Chinese parliament decided not to allow voters in Hong Kong to nominate candidates for the 2017 election.
The move is likely to spark long-promised protests in Hong Kong&#39;s business district, as activists began organizing and preparing just hours after the announcement.
The Chinese People&#39;s Congress basically allows communist leaders to disqualify any candidate who is not loyal to Beijing.
&quot;It didn&#39;t surprise us, but it infuriated us,&quot; said Emily Lau, the Democratic Party&#39;s chairwoman.
That is not what Beijing has promised.
They lied to the people of Hong Kong.
And it is clear that we are dealing with an authoritarian regime.
In defense of the Chinese decision, Li Fei, deputy secretary general of the Standing Committee of the National People&#39;s Congress, said that allowing public nominations in the Hong Kong leadership elections would cause &quot;chaos.&quot;
Since 1997, when Britain returned control of Hong Kong to China, Beijing has promised that from 2017 onwards, residents will be able to elect executive power.
Chinese leaders presented Sunday&#39;s decision as a democratic breakthrough because Hong Kong allows direct voting, but the decision also makes it clear that Chinese leaders are firmly in control of the committee&#39;s nomination process, which is tightly controlled by Beijing.
And under the new clause, only candidates who &quot;love the country and Hong Kong&quot; will be allowed.
The decision came after the summer months, which saw some of the largest and most watched protests in Hong Kong in a few years.
Behind most of the pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong is the Central Occupation movement with love and peace, whose organizers have threatened to close the financial district unless Beijing grants them universal suffrage.
On Sunday night, just hours after the announcement, hundreds of Occupation supporters gathered in front of the Hong Kong government headquarters in the rain.
At the demonstration, organizers said their movement was entering a new phase of civil disobedience and would launch a wave of protests in the coming weeks.
However, they did not provide any further details, apparently wanting to avoid problems with the authorities.
In an online statement, the organizers said the movement &quot;considered occupying the Headquarters only as a final step if all possibilities for dialogue were exhausted and no other choice was left.
We must regret to say that today all possibilities for dialogue have been exhausted and that the occupation of the Headquarters is inevitable.
Hong Kong authorities have been preparing for Beijing&#39;s announcement for days, strengthening protection of the government headquarters on Sunday and deploying police and barricades.
According to many Hong Kong residents, inciting unrest is a sign that it is slowly losing control of the city.
The influx of people from the mainland increases competition in products and services.
There are also growing concerns that values such as democracy and freedom of speech are being bent by increasing pressure from Beijing.
Some people criticize the Central Occupation movement and say that their demonstrations threaten trade - Hong Kong&#39;s lifeboat.
&quot;The protest he is talking about could do much more economic damage depending on how many people take part and for how long,&quot; said Regina Ip, a politician who has long criticized the movement.
We do not want fears to spread that Hong Kong is getting out of control.
Such a perception could harm investment.
In recent days, China&#39;s state media has also come up with reports portraying democratic activists in Hong Kong as subversive agents ruled by the West.
In the summer, activists held an unofficial referendum on voting rights, which was attended by 780,000 participants - more than a fifth of voters in Hong Kong.
And in July, tens of thousands of people took part in one of the largest pro-democracy demonstrations in the region&#39;s history.
Pre-election agitation?
The league in Jihlava is named after a political movement
Approximately 1,600 amateur athletes play small football in the regional town of Vysočina.
And their highest competition is renamed Together for Jihlava League.
It was named after one movement that goes to the October municipal elections.
In addition, the head of the small football club in Jihlava, Jan Mráka, is ten on his candidate.
&quot;There was a general meeting where there was no problem with that,&quot; Mráka said.
The lawyers of Jihlava City Hall have already dealt with the situation around the first league of small football and recommended changing the system of distribution of subsidies.
According to the city&#39;s website, the small football won around a million crowns last year.
Even this year, the amount is in the hundreds of thousands.
According to the legal opinion, the procedure of small football is not in conflict with the law or the directives of the municipality.
However, the situation is an incentive for the Office to adjust the rules for allocating grants and subsidies, &quot;said Radek Tulis, a spokesman for the municipality.
It will probably not be possible to draw subsidies from the city and at the same time express support as a small football in the elections of one political party.
A similar demand from politicians has not yet come to Vysočina&#39;s &quot;big&quot; football.
That, for example, the CSSD regional championship, ODS division or KDU-CSL 1 would be created.
And class and similar competitions?
I wouldn&#39;t be in favor.
On the contrary, I would like sponsors from companies to contact us, &quot;remarked Miroslav Vrzáček, chairman of the regional football association.
The head of small football will not let other parties and movements into the name of the league
According to small football players, this sport in Jihlava would deserve its own complex with six playgrounds, changing rooms and sanitary facilities.
&quot;For example, the Na Stoupách playground is not ours, we are renting it there,&quot; pointed out Ondřej Lapeš from the Starlet Jihlava club.
The most suitable location would be Český mlýn.
However, in my opinion, for example, a meaningless complex for skaters will be built there, of which there are about fifty in Jihlava, &quot;Mráka pointed out.
The mayor of Jihlava, Jaroslav Vymazal (ODS), reacted that small football uses a playground with artificial grass in Rošického and Na Stoupách streets, which are owned by the city.
We want to build such playgrounds that have maximum use.
We are planning the modernization or construction of sports grounds at schools, which will be accessible in the afternoon.
I think that a lot of progress has been made for small football in recent years, &quot;added Vymazal.
According to Jan Mráka, other political parties will not appear in the names of the leagues.
We have limitations.
If someone from one field joins us in the partnership, we will not put another in there, &quot;he explained.
&quot;I consider the political movement in the name of the league, at least to be an unfortunate step,&quot; said Karel Voldán, a member of the town hall commission for sport.
&quot;But let the voters evaluate whether Mr. Mráka uses the Malá kopaná Jihlava association and the city subsidies for political purposes or not,&quot; he added.
American tradition permeates university life - freshmen can fly by jet
We are delighted to be able to respond to the demand by launching the first luxury travel service for students in the UK.
In order to leave the best possible impression on arrival at the university, the company also offers transport options, including a private jet or Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Martin or McLaren P1 cars.
Stewart also said the service also has a security page.
The service is an ideal option for students who would otherwise have to drag their belongings across the state in a dangerously loaded car.
We are looking forward to ensuring that with our VIF (very important freshman) variants this year, we will arrive at the university with a minimum of nervousness and a maximum of luxury.
A company spokesman said that since the services had just started, they had no reservations yet, but added: &quot;Students will start making reservations within the next few weeks.&quot;
The company also said that although students pay an annual tuition fee of £ 9,000, it expects the service to find its place in the market.
Compared to students ten, twenty, thirty or forty years ago, today&#39;s students are different in terms of expectations and desires - it is more important than ever to make the right first impression and the VIF program is exactly the right way to do it.
However, the National Students&#39; Union criticized the service as unattainable.
Megan Dunn, vice president of the Union for Higher Education, commented: “Such a project is unattainable for most students.
Many students entering university this month have to deal with the financial crisis before throwing away thousands of pounds for something as simple as getting on campus, because available financial support in the form of loans and grants cannot keep up with rising basic needs. .
Feminists oppose racism and police behavior after the events in Ferguson
Earlier this month, a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri killed an unarmed young man.
Those present waiting for the funeral with their hands up chanting, &quot;Hands up, don&#39;t shoot!&quot;
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Missouri over the shooting of unarmed young man Michael Brown, blogger Miriam Zoila Peréz saw a shift in online discussions of white feminists.
She found that when it comes to promoting reproductive rights and income equality, white feminists prefer gender to race.
With growing tensions in the Midwest, which has attracted the attention of the national press, Perez has noticed that white people&#39;s reactions are 100% race-oriented.
Compared to the reactions of black women soon after the shooting on August 9, personal articles with headlines such as &quot;White woman&#39;s thoughts on Ferguson&quot; or &quot;Feminism is not just about oppressing women&quot; appeared relatively late.
According to Perézová, however, this represents an important change.
&quot;I don&#39;t think there are many people in the feminist movement who talk about race and privileges at such a level,&quot; she said.
People felt they had to comment on what had happened.
This is characteristic of the crisis we are facing, because [the situation in Ferguson] is so racially distinct that they had to point it out.
According to Korith Mitchell, an professor of English at Ohio State University, Ferguson has brought to light the problems that African American women face every day and which are not perceived as &quot;women&#39;s issues&quot; in the cultural sphere.
&quot;I can post funny stories from my life with my partner on Facebook and it gets 150 likes from people around the world,&quot; said Mitchell.
When I write about the fact that people of color are trapped in their own country, it&#39;s silent deafening.
&quot;How is it possible that a woman can talk publicly about relationships, but not about security in a public place?&quot; She asked.
For black women like Mitchell, who have addressed the issue of race, gender, and sexuality in American history, there is no dichotomy between the issues of race and gender.
According to her, black women could not afford the luxury of clearly dividing these problems: they live in this mixed reality every day.
Although white women today share the issue of race and gender in mainstream feminist circles, Angela Hattery, a professor of women&#39;s issues and gender studies at George Mason University, says their predecessors did the opposite.
Between 1865 and 1890, at least 10,000 blacks were lynched, and in almost all cases the reason was the rape of a white woman, ”Hattery said.
You needed the cooperation of white women to justify lynching.
According to Hattery, the split between whites and blacks came when suffrage fighters like Susan B. Anthony explored the terrain in the late 19th century and realized that only one group of people - women or blacks - could have the right to vote.
&quot;They decided to bet cards on women&#39;s voting rights and blacks&#39; right to focus later,&quot; Hattery explained.
When we realize this, we get an important insight into why colored women do not trust white women.
We didn&#39;t do a good job.
We have never helped black women protect their husbands and children.
Even after women gained the right to vote in 1920, it took ten years for them to organize against lynching in the Southern Women&#39;s Association to prevent lynching.
The group was formed 40 years after black women first asked for help.
According to Mitchell, the rise in white feminists&#39; responses to the questions raised in Ferguson - the issue of police behavior, racial discrimination - reflects a time when white feminists had to &quot;catch up&quot; with the issues that black women have faced for generations.
&quot;Wouldn&#39;t it be great if activists in these areas of [traditional feminism] took the right to raise a child as seriously as they took the right to contraception?&quot; Mitchell said.
The second wave of feminists, who have made a career in the fight for reproductive rights and access to contraception, are now finding out what that means.
Prominent feminist activists such as Gloria Steinem took a Facebook attack two weeks after Michael Brown was shot dead, where they published a column by Rebecca Carroll of the Guardian, demanding that white Americans protest more vigorously against racism.
&quot;I hope that women who have different but similar reasons for understanding the dangers in society - and views on race, which differ significantly in opinion polls - will strive for change,&quot; Steinem wrote.
Although Steinem advocates intersectional feminism, which includes both race and gender, her comments on the issue of race in America confuse some people.
American Enterprise Institute expert Christina Sommers, author of &quot;Who Stole Feminism?&quot;, Told She The People that young men in the United States, especially young men of color, are &quot;much more vulnerable than their sisters,&quot; but Steinem&#39;s notes face Ferguson. criticism she had provoked before.
We now have hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but almost none for boys.
But when the White House launched a small My Brother&#39;s Keeper program to help vulnerable young blacks and Hispanics, it provoked an angry reaction from many feminists, including Gloria Steinem.
The police&#39;s relationship with the black community is not the only issue that comes to the forefront of mainstream feminism.
After the U.S. border police detained nearly 63,000 unaccompanied juveniles in the southwest of the country this year, the issue of immigration law reform arose again - this time as a women&#39;s issue.
Andrea Mercad, co-chair of We Belong Together, an organization mobilizing women to reform immigration laws, said that in order to raise the issue as necessary for women, all she had to do was share the stories of immigrant women.
&quot;They speak for themselves,&quot; says Mercado.
Because most work permits are granted to men, the women who come with them find themselves in a position where they are vulnerable to domestic violence and abuse.
&quot;These stories are well received in women&#39;s organizations,&quot; she said.
Pig residence in Ipswich for sale
The real estate agency removed a picture of a house for sale in Suffolk - when it was published, a pig was resting on it in the living room.
A one-bedroom detached house for sale for £ 120,000 is on a private road in Ipswich.
The information photos included a picture of a living room with a pig resting with its head on a sofa.
Connells Real Estate said the pig in the photo was the owners&#39; pet.
&quot;The photo was found there by mistake, so it has already been removed,&quot; said a spokesman for the office.
In real estate information, Connells Real Estate Agency described the former prayer house as &quot;a unique detached one-room cottage.&quot;
Although the office has already removed the photo from its website, it still appears in promotional materials.
The sale of the house aroused interest on social networks, where some asked if the pig was included in the price.
After winning the lottery, Harvey City has a fresh millionaire in the southwest
The Harvey lottery player gets a million.
A new millionaire is being sought in southeast Perth, and one lucky man will take home $ 1.1 million from Saturday&#39;s lottery campaign.
The Harvey newsagents were lucky in the distribution for the second time in five years, the last time in November 2009 was a $ 1 million win.
But the lucky winner has yet to register.
Store owner Steve Forward said the entire city in southwest Perth was talking about winning.
It&#39;s the main topic and everyone is upset.
We thought a similar win was a touch.
Eight winners shared one win in Western Australia last month, ending several happy weeks.
Last weekend, a player in Canning Vale became one of the five millionaires in August, and just a few weeks earlier, a couple in Belmont won an incredible $ 7.5 million.
The winning pair bet for twenty years and said that the win would allow them to travel the world and buy a new house.
The millionaire from Harvey is the 59th only lottery winner in Western Australia this year, winning a total of $ 85 million.
Deutsche Bahn trains do not leave in the evening.
Train drivers want higher wages
In a press release, the GDL described the protest as a warning strike, for which it deliberately chose time outside rush hour traffic.
At the chosen time of the strike, GDL takes into account many people who return from the weekend by rail only during the first working day.
At the same time, we are thinking of people commuting to work during the day, &quot;the union said in a press release on Monday morning to declare a strike.
&quot;Our first strike should primarily affect freight transport, less passengers,&quot; GDL added.
The DB has not yet published an official reaction to the announcement of the strike.
It is also not clear how the protest will affect international rail connections, including with the Czech Republic.
The unions are demanding a five percent increase in train drivers&#39; wages and a reduction in working hours by two hours a week.
At present, the average salary of train drivers varies between 36 thousand and 46 thousand euros (998 thousand and 1.27 million crowns) per year, depending on the years worked.
DB drivers work 39 hours a week.
DB refuses to accept wage growth while reducing working hours.
They emphasize that the remuneration of train drivers must develop in the same way as for other railway staff, for whom DBs do not expect a reduction in the working week.
Krest&#39;s car was in danger of burning.
That&#39;s why he ended up at the Barum Rally
What exactly happened?
It was a material defect.
The car was brand new, so it never occurred to me that something like this could happen.
Was it not possible to temporarily repair the exhaust and continue at a slower pace to the service, where the mechanics would replace it?
If we went straight there, yes.
But we had two more erzets waiting for us and it didn&#39;t work.
It has a high temperature and the risk of the car starting to burn was great.
I can&#39;t afford that.
You passed five special stages at full speed.
How did you feel about them?
Very good.
I felt young.
We were fast, but I didn&#39;t go through the vint.
It was all caused by the fact that we beeped the car for more than half a year to keep it at some level.
The race showed that we succeeded.
You started it so that you could really think about winning.
I prepared myself and the car so that we really had to win.
The work did not go to waste.
On the other hand, the result we could think of did not come.
But that&#39;s Barumka.
Unfortunately, the technology said no.
You were not the only one at the top who resigned prematurely from the fight for the championship.
Foreign favorites Breen, Abbring and Lappi also dropped out.
Were you surprised that so many favorites resigned?
Yes.
It was a pity, especially for the spectators, because the race ended prematurely.
Jaromír Tarabus, for whom you are planning a car, has also been at the top for a long time.
But he paid for the fact that he flew off the track and took almost a two-minute shortage.
How satisfied were you with his performance?
It&#39;s a shame, because he could repeat the podium.
After all, he drove the first two times.
But Mira also confirmed that we prepared the car well.
He drove very fast.
Exactly a year ago, you announced the end of your career, yet you appeared at the start of the Barum Rally.
Can a good driving feeling make you a regular participant in rally races again?
Certainly not at the moment.
Last year I said that Barumka is my last race and I still didn&#39;t keep it.
I decided to go again.
It was my nineteenth start here, and if there&#39;s a chance again in a year, I&#39;ll probably go for it.
But I&#39;m not thinking about anything else.
Lots of people came to the track just because of you.
Did you enjoy it?
To some extent, we started because of them.
A lot of people, known or unknown, kept asking if I was going.
I wanted to make them happy.
What awaits you after Barumka?
The team continues.
Next week we will go to Vyškov, where Robert Adolf will race.
I hope he didn&#39;t damage the car much here.
In addition, he wants to borrow the fabric of Honza Sýkora from us for this race.
Mira and I will have a European double race in Switzerland and Corsica.
To do that, we will have to prepare things for next year.
Can you suggest something already?
No, nothing is decided.
When the Corsican Rally belonged to the World Cup, you reached your maximum in the series in fifth place.
Doesn&#39;t it tempt you to try the local tracks again?
It does not attract.
An oral agreement with the employer can be a problem
Unfortunately, you did not have a doctor&#39;s certificate of incapacity for work issued by you, which serves as proof for the organization that you cannot perform your duties for health reasons.
In addition, you did not immediately report the absence to your employer.
Subsequently, it was agreed that the days would be registered as holidays, but the agreement was made only orally.
Although the Labor Code does not impose an obligation to have the employer&#39;s consent to the use of leave confirmed in writing, in practice this procedure has proved successful.
If only an oral agreement is made, you do not have confirmation of the agreement.
Later, the alleged consent to take leave, as in your case, may be denied and the absence from work may be considered a long-term unexcused absence, therefore a reason for immediate termination of employment under § 53 of the Labor Code.
In the event of a legal dispute over an agreement with the employer, you thus lack provable evidence.
However, the employment relationship with you was not terminated according to § 53, you only have the given days listed in the credit sheet as an unexcused absence.
Unexcused absence in the credit sheet does not have the same consequences as § 53 (eg inability to receive material security in unemployment), yet this makes it more difficult to find a new job.
We recommend that you visit the doctor again and have written confirmation that an accident actually occurred, as a result of which you were unable to work (this is not a so-called &quot;incapacity&quot;, it is only a doctor&#39;s certificate).
When looking for a new job, you can present the document and explain the situation.
In practice, it is advisable not to underestimate both the issuance of a written medical certificate of incapacity for work and early notification to the employer or requesting written consent to take leave.
This avoids possible complications.
Tony Stewart&#39;s accident on his way back
Tony Stewart&#39;s return to the track ended just behind half of the Atlanta Motor Speedway.
Stewart crashed into the fence for the second time after his right front tire burst in lap 172 and the race was over for him.
Stewart brought the damaged car to the garage, did not comment to the reporters, and left.
His team boss Chad Johnston said team car 14 was disappointed, but will now focus on the race in Richmond, Virginia next weekend.
&quot;I want us to have better performance and a better conclusion,&quot; Johnston said.
We will go to Richmond and hope to do more there.
Stewart crashed into the fence for the first time in Sunday night&#39;s race after a collision with Kyle Busch, which required repairing the right side of his car.
&quot;We put our hopes for a good finish in today&#39;s race,&quot; Johnston said, adding: &quot;It just didn&#39;t work out.&quot;
Shortly after the second crash, Stewart&#39;s car was loaded and the team packed up and ready to leave.
After his car hit and killed another driver at a race in New York, Stewart missed three NASCAR Sprint Cup races.
He decided to return this weekend and needed to win either the Atlanta race or the next race in Richmond to catch up on the table.
He returned to racing during the investigation into the tragic accident in which 20-year-old Kevin Ward Jr., who drove into Stewart&#39;s path during the race, died.
Authorities said it would take at least another two weeks to investigate the cause of the accident.
It has not yet been decided whether Stewart will face any charges.
The three-time champion was warmly encouraged before the race.
Stewart started in 12th place, worked his way up to 10th at the beginning of the race and then even to 4th.
Then, at the beginning of the 122nd round, Busch&#39;s car no.
18 got out of control, drove out of the second turn and crashed into Stewart, sending both cars into the fence.
Stewart continued, but withdrew to 21st place.
Prague has chosen new taxi station managers, earning 12.3 million
Prague has completed tenders for new administrators of taxi service stations.
It will receive approximately 12.3 million crowns a year for 103 parking spaces.
Until recently, it collected 150,000 crowns a year for the same places for drivers of taxis.
Councilor Lukáš Manhart (TOP 09) informed about it.
Previously, the city used a lottery to select administrators.
The winner then received a lease for a lump sum of 1000 crowns per year.
But the rules have changed.
At present, the amount of the offer decides.
&quot;One year after the termination of the original lease agreements and the start of tenders, it has been proven that the new rental system is far more advantageous for Prague and generally fairer,&quot; the councilor claims.
The most expensive stain is Na Perštýně
The highest price was offered by those interested in a site in Na Perštýně Street.
He pays 2.1 million crowns a year.
Approximately 1.5 million crowns were paid by the new administrators for places in front of the Municipal House or on Wenceslas Square.
The councilors adopted new rules for renting taxi ranks in the autumn of 2012 and terminated the original lease agreements in the summer of last year.
The selection procedures took place in four waves and 29 sites found a new administrator.
For the second time this year we had to clean the well.
We released it all the time, which created practically the second pond around the cottage.
Then we poured Savo there.
Incredible stench!
Our well in the cellar always provided plenty of beautiful fragrant water.
And it wasn&#39;t done professionally, my grandfather dug it out on his own.
Long time ago.
It was only for three rings and overall quirky, like everything else in the cottage, but as I say.
The water was great.
Until this year.
When we started the season, of course we ran out of water.
When she stood there for many months, she deserved it.
But even then it seemed to us that the water somehow didn&#39;t smell.
We wondered if something had fallen there.
In the place where the pump passed, it was possible with a bit of bad luck, the board didn&#39;t quite fit there, so the hole was sealed with a piece of brick.
Our inspection confirmed that the brick was moving.
Otherwise, nothing could be seen in the water, and we shone it all the way to the bottom.
So we drained it again and cleaned it up.
Of course, we have improved the improvised seal around the pump tube.
But we noticed strange things in the basement.
On the ground lay a glued package with some cubes.
At least that&#39;s what it looked like.
And a little further on.
Now it looked like a drooling mouse.
At the ceiling, where the vents are, Grandpa&#39;s invention, were the remains of a fish!
And hard to drive!
Our cellar is also unique.
Some would say that Grandpa was just digging into the cottage.
And he wouldn&#39;t be so far from the truth.
The walls and floor are just suffocated sand, only the ceiling is broken.
There are mainly ships.
The wheels.
And sunbeds on the beach.
The gates with wide gaps were mostly open as someone walked in one piece.
Several vents already mentioned on the ceiling.
Without a net, so birds usually fly there and build nests on the beams.
There is no need to mention mice.
Grandpa wanted it to air, and he wanted it.
But even the Luft didn&#39;t help now.
The whole cellar smelled.
So we cleaned the whole cellar.
Especially the fish on the beam was nutritious!
We also threw away things that were around: planks, a heraclit board, and so on.
Our cottage remotely welcomed passersby with a disinfectant abrasion.
We wondered who could stretch the disgusting leftovers for us there?
The nearest cat lives two kilometers away in the village.
She would have a hard time coming to eat with us.
Grandpa was attacked by a neighbor who was not quite right.
Didn&#39;t Franta shove the disgust through our vent?
He&#39;s been here practically all year, stupid ideas, that&#39;s what he has.
We decided to watch the cellar and the well and check them regularly.
After a few days, everything was fine.
We started using the water again, so far only for washing and washing, before the tests are done, but it was already good.
Pulling water from a forest well is not something I would like to do for a long time.
Once we heard the terrible barking of our bitch.
Mom looked from the balcony and saw a long thick black hose in the grass beside the porch.
The cutter bounced over her and screamed like crazy.
Mom scolded her because she thought Reza had dug a drain hose out of the sink.
But suddenly the hose partly coiled into a ball and partly straightened.
There was a hiss on the balcony.
Reza had a hysterical fit.
We ran downstairs.
The snake, well over a meter long and as thick as a bull, was about to swallow a huge toad, and Reza prevented it from doing so.
It was not clear if she wanted to save the toad or if she wanted to eat it herself, but it was irrelevant.
When the snake saw the superiority of our entire family, she probably thought we should eat it when we were so hungry, and stretched gracefully through the vent into the cellar.
We flew after her.
She jumped over the well like lightning.
By the way, we noticed another stinking package on her record.
According to the smell, probably a fish.
The day before yesterday she was not there!
Our new security around the pump was a bit of a shaker.
And we locked the cellar during the day.
That...
We went outside and there we all lay in one vent.
We didn&#39;t wait long.
It rattled behind the well.
First, a flat head appeared with yellow moons on its neck.
Then the whole snake swayed into the well.
She wrapped herself around the pump and began to dig inside.
The fired employee took revenge, bought laptops for the company, and sold them
After his dismissal, the disgraced employee bought computers for the company and then sold them.
He managed to spend the money before being detained by the police.
In a short time, the man bought a total of sixteen computers in twelve cases for more than two hundred thousand crowns.
&quot;After the takeover, he took the laptops to Olomouc, where he sold them in bazaars,&quot; said Rostislav Brückner, the chief commissioner of the Šumperk police.
The motive for the fraud was revenge on the employer for dismissal and also for making money.
&quot;During the interrogation, he told us that he used the money to repay the loans,&quot; Brückner said.
Police also found the fraudster to be a pathological gambler who had been repeatedly treated for psychiatry.
The money could also end up in slot machines or video lottery terminals.
&quot;The fact is, we didn&#39;t find any money with him,&quot; the commissioner said.
The fraudster, who has once been punished for theft, now faces up to one to five years in prison.
Police have not yet said whether there is a risk of punishment for bazaars, which bought laptops below cost and resold them.
&quot;It is true that they were taking over completely new goods, which is at least suspicious,&quot; the commissioner said.
However, none of the owners of the bazaar have been charged yet.
Come on, a little bit, you can do it or how I enjoyed We Run Prague
This year, the organizers have prepared several changes for us.
The biggest was the change of route, which brought the destination to the embankment, instead of leading back to Žluté lázně.
I was looking forward to the race together with the rest of the Rungo.cz team, but I was going to experience it a bit from the other side.
The whole team and I decided to personally greet our readers at the stand, where we took photos and shot videos together.
To perfect my view from the other side, I took on the role of a personal guide.
Together with my friend Káťa, we obediently joined the end of the corridor for 60 to 70 minutes just before the start.
We greeted our friends who passed us to the sector for faster runners.
There wasn&#39;t much time left.
A few hops to warm up, turn on sports testers, countdown and start!
Screams of cheers, but instead of a quick start, a cupping to the starting line followed.
After five minutes, we walk to the gate, turn on the measurement, and start at ten o&#39;clock.
We are intertwined with a yellow snake of runners who, like Káťa, run their first race.
So far, they all look fresh, the slowly setting sun in the sky gives the view of Vyšehrad an almost kitschy touch.
The pulsating mass stretching along the waterfront looks as if the whole of Prague is running here.
The embankment between Vyšehrad and the National Theater traditionally begins to show who has how much power.
A light hill on Palackého náměstí forces many runners to slow down or go for a walk.
Just before the transition to the Theater, I see a police escort and right behind him, Vítek Pavlišta flies at an incredible pace to the finish line.
I hear the admiring, snorting sigh of the other runners.
I move to the edge of the track, I encourage him, he is about to slap me, but just before that my leg sprains and our hands just miss.
The passage through Divadelní Street gives a chance for a short rest and breath.
Needlessly, there are places in front of us where the views take my breath away.
The turn on the Mánes Bridge shows Prague in all the beauty of the setting sun.
I don&#39;t breathe and my legs carry me almost alone.
There is a moment of truth behind the first snack.
During the crossing of the road, Káťa stumbles on the curb and performs a jump.
I look to see if she needs help, and I run a series of encouraging words so she doesn&#39;t have time to think about the pain.
It rises and we continue along Kozí ulička, it is one of the narrowest places on the track, in this phase of the race there is no such rush, but it is still necessary to monitor the surroundings well.
I have no idea yet that the term narrowest place will get its true meaning later.
Behind the Powder Gate, tourists and friends of other runners cheer us frantically.
I try to clap with everyone who offers a hand, and I also advise Káta, because ten applauses with fans is like half an energy bar.
It really works, we are accelerating again and although we have fallen quite significantly, now the chase has started.
We overtake dozens of runners as I pass someone especially tired, I try to encourage him with a few words: &quot;Come on, a little more, you can do it!&quot;
Nobody is ahead of us behind the last refreshment, we are accelerating.
So far, we&#39;ve been running for an hour and a quarter, we&#39;re adding, there&#39;s nothing to wait for.
Three kilometers to the finish will hurt, but you really need to soak.
The sun has slowly set and the ending day symbolically slowly ends the race.
The last run to the bridge, a turn and just a straight line to the finish.
The pace at which we run amazes me, where does it come from in that girl?
&quot;Come on, we&#39;re going under less than thirteen, we&#39;re working!&quot; I&#39;m calling.
We try it, we sprint and here is the goal.
An hour of thirteen and six seconds.
Well, what can be done.
The coach set a limit of twenty hours.
So seven minutes under schedule.
Which is a great result.
Just behind the finish, Káta&#39;s legs break, I help her to the railing, where she rests for a while.
You can see exhaustion, but also happiness from a well-executed performance.
After a while, I slowly lead her out of the target area.
Euphoria does not make us think of the crush in the passages to the locker rooms.
Here you can see that Goat Alley was not the narrowest place.
This is the goal behind the floodplain, which is packed to bursting under the onslaught of almost ten thousand runners.
If someone doesn&#39;t like crowds, this is not the place for them.
After a while, I also lose my head and wonder if the beautiful views and the more interesting route compared to previous years were worth what is happening in the finish.
I know from personal experience that organizing a race is no fun.
If you add ten thousand people, a rich accompanying program and the closure of the entire center of Prague for all traffic, it is a huge challenge.
This year&#39;s change of route showed the runners many interesting places, but it also brought some really unpleasant surprises.
The excellent atmosphere pumped in Žluté lázně was transferred among the runners in the race itself.
Organizers around the track and random spectators stepped it up on every meter of the track.
Unfortunately, obstacles that cannot be removed must be taken into account when running through the city center, but I do not consider the goal of a mass race in a place bounded on one side by a wall and on the other by a river to be the best solution.
If I say that the race ended with the finish line, I rate it as very successful.
For the goal, I was a little worried about the health of the participants, but in the end everything turned out well.
Write to us in the discussion if you also liked the route and what you say about the situation at the finish.
Prison guards in Bulgaria are organizing protests
Hundreds of prison staff throughout Bulgaria attended a national protest rally in front of the Ministry of Justice in the capital Sofia.
At a peaceful demonstration, they reiterated their demand for the reintroduction of the original working conditions, which have recently changed.
Higher salaries are also on the list of demands to be discussed with the interim Minister of Justice, Hristo Ivanov.
For a month, guards symbolically protested the new working hours and demanded a return to the original twenty-four-hour shifts.
Although the unions of prison guards and representatives of the Ministry of Justice met, they did not agree, the Bulgarian State Radio (BNR) reported.
&quot;Negotiations are still ongoing,&quot; Rosen Zhelyazkov, head of the General Directorate of the Prison Service, told the BNR.
Members of the Federation of Employees&#39; Trade Unions Federation at the Ministry of the Interior are also expected to join the protests by prison staff.
Why the universe can have more dimensions and we don&#39;t see them
Physicists usually don&#39;t write bestsellers, but Brian Green of Columbia University made a hit in 1999.
His book The Elegant Universe has become the most accessible way for laymen to penetrate the thicket of problems that many theoretical physicists are working on today - trying to unite two well-functioning but incompatible 20th century discoveries: quantum theory and general relativity.
Undoubtedly, one of the reasons for the success of the Elegant Universe is that the search for a unified physical theory is not a boring story.
Physicists have solved the basic problem between two key theories (after all, at the moment our universe is de facto divided into two worlds with different laws) and they are solving so imaginatively that it is worth retelling to lay people.
In addition, Greene handled the complex material so freshly and engagingly that he could not be blamed for how much interesting he did not include in his book.
In addition, he largely corrected his &quot;mistake&quot; in two other books: The Structure of the Universe and Hidden Reality.
Apparently, even the author would not object if his book became obsolete faster, but the fact is that even after 15 years, the Elegant Universe still provides almost everything that an informed layman with an ambition to understand the world should know about this important part of theoretical physics.
It is quite likely that in the coming years it will be a little more lively in this area (perhaps because the LHC accelerator will finally run at &quot;full throttle&quot;), so it is a good time to enter the non-violently open door of the world of modern physics.
How many dimensions can our universe have?
The idea that our universe may have more than three spatial dimensions may certainly sound foolish, fantastic, strange or mystical.
Nevertheless, it is concrete and completely acceptable.
To understand this, let us turn our eyes for a moment from the universe as a whole to something more mundane, namely a long and thin garden watering hose.
Imagine stretching a 100-meter garden hose from one side of the canyon to the other and watching the entire scenery from a half-kilometer distance (as in the picture and on the following page).
From such a distance, you can easily notice a long horizontally stretched hose, but if you do not suffer from foresight, you will hardly recognize the thickness of the hose.
Due to its large distance from the hose, you would think that an ant forced to live on a hose has only one dimension in which it can walk: a left-right dimension along the hose.
When someone asks you where the ant was at the time, you only answer with one indication: the distance of the ant from the left (or right) end of the hose.
All we want to say is that from a half-kilometer distance, a long piece of hose looks like a one-dimensional object.
In the real world, a hose has a thickness.
If we enlarge everything, we suddenly see the second dimension - in the shape of a circle wrapping the hose.
In such an enlarged view, it is clear that the ant can in fact move in two independent dimensions: in the well-known left-right dimension along the length of the hose, but also in the &quot;clockwise / counterclockwise dimension&quot;, i.e. around the circular cross-section of the hose.
You are beginning to understand that to determine the position of a small ant, you must enter two numbers: how far it is from the end of the hose and where the wrapping hose is on the circle.
This reflects the fact that the surface of the hose is two-dimensional (note: Experts will notice that this chapter focuses purely on the failure theory of strings.
Non-fault aspects are discussed in Chapters 12 and 13.).
The surface of the hose is two-dimensional: one long longitudinal dimension is shown by a straight arrow, the dimension in the circumferential direction, indicated by a circular arrow, is short and coiled.
However, there is a clear difference between the two dimensions.
The dimension along the hose is long and easily visible.
The size of the wrapping circumference of the hose is short, &quot;coiled&quot; and less noticeable.
To realize the existence of a circular dimension, we had to examine the hose with significantly better resolution.
This example illustrates an important property of spatial dimensions.
That they are divided into two groups.
They can be either large, large, and therefore directly visible, or, conversely, small, coiled and much less observable.
Of course, in this case, we did not precede ourselves to reveal the &quot;coiled&quot; dimension wrapping around the thickness of the hose.
All you had to do was take the binoculars to help.
But if the hose were thinner - like a hair or a capillary - we would only be able to detect the coiled dimension with great effort.
Kaluza sent his article to Einstein in 1919, in which he came up with the astonishing idea that the spatial geometry of the universe could have more than three dimensions known to us all.
Kaluza justified his radical claim by saying that the additional dimension provides an elegant and convincing framework in which Einstein&#39;s general relativity and Maxwell&#39;s electromagnetic theory can be woven into a single, unified conceptual structure.
The question immediately arises as to how this Kaluz observation goes together with the obvious fact that we see exactly three dimensions of space.
The answer, which Kaluza quietly assumed between the lines and which was clearly stated and specified by the Swedish mathematician Oskar Klein in 1926, stands and falls, arguing that the spatial geometry of our universe can be both large and coiled.
This means that, like the dimensions in the direction of the length of the hose, our universe has three large, vast and easily visible dimensions, the existence of which we are aware of at all times.
But analogous to the circular circumference of a garden hose, the universe can also have additional dimensions, tightly wound into a space so small that they have remained hidden from our most perfect experimental apparatus.
To get a clearer idea of the nature of Kaluz&#39;s remarkable design, let&#39;s stay with the hose for a moment.
Imagine that we draw a relatively dense row of circles on the circumference of the hose in black.
From a distance, the hose still looks like a thin one-dimensional line.
With binoculars, thanks to the drawing, we can now reveal the coiled dimension even easier, because we will see the motif from Figure 2.
We can clearly see that the surface of the hose is two-dimensional, with one dimension large and almost unlimited and with the other short and circular.
Kaluza and Klein came up with the idea that our universe has a similar structure, but in addition to one small circular dimension, it has three large spatial dimensions, together a four-spatial dimension.
It is difficult to draw an object with too many dimensions.
To help our imagination a little, let&#39;s take a look at the illustration in Fig.3; shows two large dimensions and one small circular dimension.
In the picture, we enlarge the view of the geometry of the space in the same way as we enlarged the surface of the hose.
Each subsequent level represents a huge increase in the geometry of space from the previous level.
Our universe can have additional dimensions (we see them at the fourth level of magnification) if they are rolled into a sufficiently small space; this explains that we have not yet observed them directly.
The square grid represents the commonly known &quot;large&quot; dimensions, while the circle represents the new, tiny, and coiled dimensions.
Just like loops of thread in a densely woven carpet, these circles also exist in every place of the usual dimensions - we just drew them only at the intersections in a square network for the sake of clarity.
The background of Figure 4 shows the commonly known structure of space - the ordinary world around us - on such common scales as meters, represented by the side of a small square in a square grid.
In each subsequent image, we will focus on a small area of the previous image; we enlarge it to make it visible.
At first, nothing special happens, as we see at the first few levels of magnification.
However, as we move on to the microscopic properties of the geometry of space further - to the fourth level of magnification in Figure 3 - we suddenly see a new, circularly wound dimension, similar to loops of thread in a densely woven piece of carpet.
Kaluza and Klein came up with the idea that an additional circular dimension exists at each point in the direction of large dimensions, just as a hose has a circular circumference at every point of its length.
For the sake of clarity, we have drawn the circular dimension only at some, regularly spaced points.
Figure 4 summarizes Kaluz&#39;s and Klein&#39;s idea of the microscopic structure of space geometry.
The similarity with the hose is obvious, although we also notice important differences.
First, the universe has three large, far-reaching spatial dimensions (of which we have drawn only two), while the hose has only one large dimension.
An even more important difference is that we are now talking about the spatial geometry of the universe itself, not just some object within the universe, such as our hose.
But the basic idea is the same.
If the additional circularly coiled dimension is extremely miniature, it is much more difficult to recognize it - like the circular circumference of the hose - than to observe the obvious, large and large dimensions.
If the size of the additional dimension is small enough, it will actually reveal it beyond the power of our state-of-the-art magnification tools.
Most importantly, however, the additional dimension is not just a round bump within the normal dimensions, as the two-dimensional illustration erroneously suggests.
The circular dimension is a new dimension that exists at each point of the three common large dimensions.
It is a dimension independent of the other three dimensions as well as top-down, left-right and front-back dimensions independent (and perpendicular) of each other.
A small enough ant could move in all four dimensions, and to determine its position we would need four data, in addition to the three usual positions in the circular dimension; if we also count the time, then the data are five, in any case one more than we would normally expect.

The price for the e-book is CZK 149.
To our surprise, we find that although we are aware of the existence of only three dimensions of space, Kaluz&#39;s and Klein&#39;s reasoning shows that this does not preclude the existence of additional coiled dimensions if they are small enough.
The universe can easily have more dimensions than we can see with the naked eye.
How small should they be?
State-of-the-art technical equipment can recognize structures as large as one billionth of a billionth of a meter.
We can hardly observe smaller coiled dimensions.
In 1926, Klein combined Kaluz&#39;s original idea with several ideas from the nascent quantum mechanics.
His calculations suggested that the additional circular dimension could be about one Planck length, far beyond the resolution of today&#39;s instruments.
Since then, physicists have called the possibility of additional small spatial dimensions the Kaluz-Klein theory.
Wohnout Honza Homola advises how to practice electric guitar: Part 5
The whole essence of the &quot;twelve&quot; lies in the twelve-stroke harmonic form, which you can repeat as you wish.
Those who are interested in music theory will find its principle explained in detail here.
Jan Homola or Honza Homolka Tobolka (1976)
He is educated as a puppeteer and a puppeteer, whose Facebook profile can be viewed here, he has been living as a graphic artist since graduating twenty years ago.
He is the guitarist of the band Wohnout, from which, unfortunately, it is allegedly impossible to leave.
The guitarist is after the father, just like his brother Matěj, the leader of the Wohnoutů.
Start training on one string.
&quot;The rhythm model is up to you, you can come up with anything, just apply it to the harmonic model of the twelve,&quot; advises Honza.
When you add another string, you can change the figure again.
All you have to do is listen and watch Honza, what can be invented with twelve harmonies on two strings and how nice it starts to sound.
If you add a third string, you can already flirt with the melody of a song.
When you finally add the fourth one, watch out for the change of tuning, Honza points out in the video.
Next time, Honza will return to pentatonics and you will try to put it together with just twelve.
So practice her honestly.
You can read the best in an interview with Jan Homola at the first lesson of his electric guitar school here.
Another goal without waiting?
It is not for a big celebration, admits Dvořák from Hradec Králové
We take the point and we are happy for it.
We had more chances in the first half, the second home team, &quot;said the striker, who this time scored from a penalty kick.
Weren&#39;t you nervous playing it, was it accompanied by a huge whistling?
I didn&#39;t notice it in any special way, although on the second goal, where there are home fans, it would probably be worse.
You equalized with the penalty after half an hour, but you also got the goal from the penalty after less than four minutes.
What happened?
We fell asleep at the beginning, we were passive, a corner was created and then a penalty.
You got up after her and the first half you were a better team that had more chances.
Why did that change after the break?
Hard to say.
I agree that we played well until the break after the collected goal.
In the cabin, we thought we wanted to keep up the pace of the game after it, but we couldn&#39;t.
To tell you the truth, I can&#39;t even explain why.
But it is probably also true that the home team said something about their game during the break, they were probably not very happy with it.
You only scored on the opponent&#39;s court for the first time, while at home you may not have even scored a goal.
Why is there such a difference?
I wouldn&#39;t say it&#39;s such a difference, it&#39;s more up to us how we deal with it.
We started well in Brno, but then it was bad of us, Pilsen, that&#39;s a different category.
You waited for four matches for a goal, weren&#39;t you afraid that it could be similar after the last match?
Not at all, but of course we are glad that we don&#39;t have to listen to talk about waiting for the goal since the last match.
Now we have added more without waiting, but there are still only three in six matches, which is not yet for the big celebration.
Iceland - lava flows from a crater a kilometer away.
Lava flying to the surface in the Holuhraun area near the Vatnajökull glacier flows through an underground tunnel from a crater a kilometer away.
It is located under a glacier, as well as part of the aforementioned underground lava tunnel.
This fact now worries scientists the most ...
The situation remains unchanged for the time being.
From yesterday morning (31.8.
2014) still flies out of the crack about the same amount of lava.
However, compared to the original estimates, its amount is lower, not 1000 m3, but &quot;only&quot; 300-400 m3.
Compared to the previous eruption from 29.8.
2014 is up to 50 times larger.
However, scientists fear that the lava tunnel could open even in places where it is under ice.
If this were to happen, moreover, with the same intensity as the current eruption, it would mean huge floods, both on the Jökulsá and Fjöllum rivers and on other rivers.
There is a strong smell of sulfur in the vicinity of the eruption, clouds of steam and gases rise from the crack.
This is definitely not an eruption suitable for tourism, as was the case with the eruption at Fimmvörðuháls in 2010.
This is much bigger and there is also a lot more gas, &quot;says volcanologist Ármann Höskuldsson.
However, the weather has improved considerably since yesterday, in the morning there was almost no wind in the area.
Traces of a sandstorm were washed away by the rain.
Scientists can continue their work.
For air traffic, the orange grade (second highest) applies to Bárðarbunga and the yellow (third) grade to Askja.

Aviation day in Cheb.
On the Boeing Stearman PT-17, aerobatic acrobat Peggy Walentin introduced herself, who climbed out of the cockpit to the crossbar on the upper wing of the biplane and also between the wings.
There it relies only on muscle strength.
The aviation day in Cheb was held for the fifth time this year and the organizers again managed to prepare several interesting aviation pieces.
The premiere at the oldest Czech airport was not only &quot;walking on the wings&quot; performed by German acrobat Peggy Walentinová, but also the legendary P-51 D Mustang fighter or Beechcraft 18 aircraft.
He drew attention to himself with his radiant cover.
The acrobatics called Wingwalking originated in the USA.
After the First World War, many former war pilots tried to establish themselves.
But due to the large number of fatalities, it was banned.
Today, however, he is slowly returning to the program of air days.
After takeoff, Peggy climbs from the cockpit to the upper wing.
There he performs various exercises.
At the end of the performance, she will move to the space between the wings of the aircraft, where her show continues, &quot;described Luděk Matějíček from the Ultralight Club in Cheb and the organizer of the flight day.
The pilot of the Boeing Stearman 75 E is her husband Friedrich.
If Peggy&#39;s performance was the main focus of the program, then the subsequent Mustang performance was the famous icing on the cake.
The legendary fighter rushed to the area with the Grippenes of the Army of the Czech Republic in a sling (so-called numbers).
For the first time, aviation fans could see such a group in the Czech Republic.
Pilot Miroslav Sázavský then showed everyone the breathtaking acrobatics with a 1945 aircraft.
It was made during the war, but probably never participated in it.
He was placed in the army reserves.
From 1963 he worked in the civilian sphere.
Even as a racing aircraft.
Today it has its home hangar at the airport in Munich Hradiště.
At the same place is another pearl of the Cheb Aviation Day, the twin-engine Beechcraft C45H Expeditor.
The huge machine could not be overlooked at the airport.
Its polished aluminum coating shone into the distance.
The Max Holste MH 1521M Broussard machine in the colors of the French Air Force also gained admiration.
A small airliner jumped in behind the renounced Turbolet and brought part of the German delegation to the German Hof for an air show.
In Cheb, the German neighbors showed off with reconstructed Jak 18T aircraft or a three-member formation of Bücker Jungmann biplanes.
Lucie Borhyová: Dramatic return in front of the camera!
At least for tonight, Lucie Borhyová exchanged her parental worries for work ones.
Stress or nervousness - the blonde presenter obviously doesn&#39;t know any of this.
The TV news moderator did well, as if she hadn&#39;t stopped with him for two months at all!
It&#39;s only been two weeks since the blonde&#39;s sixth week ended, during which women experience the greatest stress after giving birth.
However, Lucie will not appear on TV Nova&#39;s main news program on a regular basis.
According to Blesk.cz, a regular return awaits her in a month.
After all, her daughter Linda now needs her more than television viewers.
Lucie Borhyová returned to the TV screen and it was a hit.
An exhibition a year in Prague?
The hall would be sold out, Jágr is planning a farewell party
It would be dignified if such a thing were done during the World Cup.
But it depends on how the union will react to it, &quot;he said in Jihlava after an exhibition called the Golden Match, in which a fascinating Nagano team met again.
Even players who took part in the golden hat trick.
Players should like it, right?
Certainly.
It would simply be good to say goodbye to the golden generation during the championship.
In my opinion, one or two days can be found during the tournament, when it is completely free and where such a match could be mixed.
We will tell Gum (Jiří Šlégr) or Béď Ščerban (organizer of the Jihlava match), who would take care of it ...
The arena would be sold out.
But what if you play with the New Jersey playoffs?
So if I fly like that ...
But you don&#39;t want to play in the national team.
Or did the Jihlava meeting somehow change your decision?
National teams and exhibition matches are two different things, and performances are decisive in the national team.
It&#39;s one thing people would like to see me there, but the performances are crucial, especially at the World Cup.
There should be players who have it, and not because they have a good name.
My decision has not changed.
How did you actually enjoy the Nagano reunion?
Just meeting the players was great.
One revived the stories and had a lot of fun.
It was a great experience not only for the fans, but also for us hockey players.
But the most important was the tribute to Ivan Hlinka.
And it&#39;s good to remember the history of our hockey and the fact that one generation is leaving, which was really worth it.
Slavomír Lener, Vladimír Růžička and Petr Čechmánek on the inverter.
Do you still remember your first national team match?
Such things are not forgotten.
It was against the Calgary Flames and three youngsters: I, Robert Holík and Robert Reichel, started in one threesome.
It was the first national team start for everyone.
But it is impossible to say that we would dominate in any way.
After a long time, Dominik Hašek caught fishing in Jihlava.
What did you say about his performance?
Hashan on the ice will never surprise me.
I wanted to give it back to him with that criticism, but I can&#39;t (Hasek criticized Jagr for the reasons why he decided to end up in the national team). He just caught it very well.
Hnilička also performed well.
He was training with me one night and was leaky there.
And now he was catching famously.
First the USA and then the Netherlands, the footballers&#39; qualification begins
Prominent guests gathered at the NH Hotel in Smíchov on Monday morning.
People could see, for example, goalkeeper Petr Čech from Chelsea, national team coach Pavel Vrbu ...
And there, the character in the black cap, that&#39;s Tomáš Rosický!
Arsenal&#39;s midfielder and national team captain arrived at the meeting around half past ten among the last.
A beautiful match against the Netherlands awaits us.
Who wouldn&#39;t look forward to it? &quot;He said as he appeared in front of the press in the national team.
Program of the Czech national team
Monday, September 1: start of the event, first training
Tuesday, September 2: Training open for fans (18:30, Summer) Autograph session (20:00)
Wednesday 3. September Czechia - USA (20:15, Letná)
Tuesday 9 September Czechia - Netherlands (20:45, Letná) end of the meeting
Rosického et al. fans can support before Wednesday&#39;s match against the USA (20:15).
The national team opened Tuesday&#39;s training for them, which starts at Letná at 6:30 p.m.
And it will be followed by an autograph session, which Rosický and Čech will not miss.
Otherwise, however, this meeting of the national team will be calmer.
Which is praised by coach Vrba, who complained about a number of social events in the spring.
Finally, we will focus on what we want to pursue.
We will now focus on the Netherlands.
It is an advantage when you have players together for eight days.
We will have time to practice things that there has not been so much time for so far, &quot;praised Vrba, who has been officially leading the national team since January.
The Czech national football team will be accompanied by a musketeer image when entering the new qualification cycle.
The national team has three matches under Vrba, all preparatory.
She drew 2: 2 with Norway and Finland and lost 1: 2 to Austria.
However, these results were not yet important.
That until now.
The match with the Netherlands will start the qualification for promotion to the European Championship 2016.
Of course, it would help the Czech team to manage the general against the USA.
The first half of the year was for us to meet.
The results are important now.
We have to think about being successful, &quot;Vrba agreed.
The only player of the twenty-three-member nomination who has health problems is the striker David Lafata.
He suffers from temperature.
If he did not manage to recover until Wednesday&#39;s match against the USA, coach Vrba would call another striker.
Genetic disorders are often misdiagnosed
A woman from Britain describes how, after a misdiagnosis, she thought she would die for many years.
After being diagnosed with another disease, Karin Rodgers spent most of her adolescence, thinking she had only a few years left to live.
In fact, it was Charcot-Marie-Tooth Syndrome (CMT) - a group of inherited disorders that damage nerves outside the brain and spine.
The charity CMT UK said that poor diagnosis is a common problem among people with CMT because very little is known about the disease.
Approximately 23,000 people in the United Kingdom are estimated to suffer from CMT, which can include motor symptoms such as muscle weakness, clumsy gait and twisted toes.
Insensitivity or pain may also occur in those affected, which is incurable and progressive, meaning that the symptoms worsen over time.
When Rodgers was thirteen, she thought she was suffering from Freidreich&#39;s ataxia (FA) - a disease with a very poor prognosis.
She believed that before she celebrated her eighteenth birthday, she would be confined to a wheelchair, and dead before she was thirty.
The mother of two, now 51, says: “As a child, I knew I couldn&#39;t do the same things as others.
I fell every day and everything took longer.
I could never ride roller skates or skateboards with other children, and I was bullied at school because of the way I walked and ran. ”
When Rodgers was thirteen and had several surgeries to loosen her Achilles tendons and straighten her feet, she took advantage of her doctor leaving the room and looked in her file to learn that she was suffering from FA.
&quot;I felt guilty because I was snooping, so I didn&#39;t tell anyone, but when I got home, I looked up information about the disease in the library and wrote to the FA Association,&quot; he says.
When they answered me, I was shocked, I panicked completely.
I thought that before I was eighteen, I would end up in a wheelchair, and before I was twenty-five, I would be dead, and in the meantime I would gradually lose all my abilities.
I was completely alone and I was planning a funeral. &quot;
When she was seventeen, she realized that her ability to walk had not deteriorated as much as she had expected, and she asked her surgeon.
He just stood up, hugged her and said, &quot;Honey, I don&#39;t think you have the disease, or you&#39;ll be in a wheelchair.
I think it will be something much less life-threatening. &quot;
After undergoing several genetic tests, he was found to have CMT.
&quot;When he explained to me what CMT was, I thought I was a child of fortune,&quot; she said.
The charity CMT UK has launched a month of awareness about CMT to raise awareness of the disease.
Entrepreneurs in the Washington area: with the turn of the economy, taxes are rising
A growing economy means more customers, higher sales and new jobs.
And also higher taxes.
According to a new survey released last week, state and local corporate taxation in the country has accelerated slightly last year as the economic recovery accelerated, and companies in Washington were no exception.
Entrepreneurs in Maryland and Virginia together spent $ 27.6 billion in state and local coffers in fiscal 2013, 3.8% more than the $ 26.6 billion collected in 2012.
The tax burden - both state and local - rose 4.3% last year to $ 671 billion compared to 3.9% last year, the third year in a row after 2009 and 2010 when taxes were cut.
According to a study by the professional firm Ernst &amp; Young and the political group Center on State Taxation, state taxes increased faster, by 4.3%, than local levies, by 3.9%.
More than half of the county&#39;s tax revenue, 56%, is from trade tax, and 36% of Maryland&#39;s revenue is from companies.
Virginia, with 28%, has the proportionately small tax revenue from business.
Researchers claim that the majority share of tax revenue growth comes from an increase in the value of real estate belonging to companies, which increased real estate taxes by 3.7% this year after three consecutive years with growth of -1%.
Although most of the profits come from big states like California, New York and Texas, the situation seems to be the same in Washington.
Companies in DC, Maryland and Vrigini paid more than $ 10 billion in state and local property taxes last year, an annual increase of 4.2% from 2012 billion.
However, the apparent increase in property value does not drive up state and local tax revenues so much in Maryland, where property taxes account for less than a fifth of corporate taxation.
For businesses in Virginia and DC, property tax accounts for nearly half of state and local taxation.
&quot;In Maryland, a lot of real estate companies own, especially the tax base around DC, the government or non-profit organizations that don&#39;t pay taxes,&quot; explained Douglas Lindholm, executive director of the Center on State Taxation.
So Maryland is forced to rely much more, for example, on income taxes to pay for the same services that are in other states.
The recent increase in business tax revenues cannot be attributed solely to the recovering real estate market.
According to the data, it seems that business income is also increasing.
Businesses in the region have posted $ 2.3 billion in corporate income tax, up from $ 2.1 billion in 2012.
Maryland has collected $ 1 billion in corporate income taxes, the most in the region.
Although they are moving in the same direction, the local tax burden on businesses is not growing as fast in these three places.
The growth rate in DC was at the national average, at 4.3%, while Maryland&#39;s growth was significantly higher at 4.9%.
In Virginia alone, tax increases were below average, to 4.1%.
Virginia has the lowest corporate income tax of all three districts (all of which have the same taxation), 6%.
The corporate tax rate in Maryland is 8.25%, while the DC average remains relatively high, at 9.975%.
A similar study conducted this year by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce found that Virginia has lower state and local taxation and an overall more favorable tax climate than Maryland.
DC did not evaluate the study.
Despite this advantage, Virginia faces competitive pressure from the south.
North Carolina recently signed a law reducing the corporate tax from 6.9% to 6%, as did Virginia, and next year the tax will be reduced to 5%.
If the state continues to meet its revenue targets in the coming year, the statutory income tax rate could be reduced to 3% in 2017.
According to a recent study, small businesses in Washington are doing better and therefore pay higher state and local taxes.
Trade tax levied by small businesses as a personal income tax - a cost-compensating structure by which most companies are organized - in DC, Maryland and Virginia rose 20% to $ 2.4 billion last year, much faster than other taxes.
The researchers say that the trend and nationwide increase in the trade tax are likely to continue next year, with total sales tax revenues for state and local governments increasing to 6.2% over the same period last year in the first three quarters of 2014.
However, Washington may lag behind others as government spending cuts take its toll on the labor market.
What you missed: the head of Europe will be Tusk, Putin&#39;s Novorussia and Lafat&#39;s scissors
Will a new state emerge in Ukraine?
Putin called for talks on Novorussia
Russian President Vladimir Putin mentioned the possibility of creating a new state in southeastern Ukraine, where government troops have been clashing with pro-Russian insurgents since April.
He also warned European companies that they would have a difficult return to the Russian market after the current regime of anti-Russian sanctions.
According to him, the support provided to the West by the warfare of the Ukrainian army in eastern Ukraine contradicts democratic values.
According to him, the end of the conflict depends on Kiev, so he can not say when the Ukrainian crisis will end.
Further sanctions for Russia?
The Czechia has enforced the right to disagree with some of them
The European Commission, together with diplomats, is to propose a form of further tightening of anti-Russian sanctions within a week, the EU summit decided tonight.
Herman Van Rompuy, the permanent chairman of member country meetings, told reporters.
According to the Czech Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka, specific proposals to shift the form of sanctions should be ready as early as Monday.
Tusk will be the new EU &quot;president&quot;.
He will replace Van Rompuy in December
At the EU summit, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk was elected head of the European Council, the so-called EU president, who chairs the summits of member states.
He will replace Herman Van Rompuy for two and a half years from December.
European Foreign Minister Federica Mogherini will replace Catherine Ashton at the head of European diplomacy.
The Italian, who will thus become Vice-President of the future European Commission, has yet to be confirmed by the European Parliament.
Assisted death is a reality in the Czech Republic, it is just not talked about
To help an incurable and long-term patient with leaving life?
In Czech conditions, where laws do not allow euthanasia, this is not legally possible.
Nevertheless, the statements of the doctors who contacted LN show that they are hearing about such requests.
ALS: The most difficult chapter in neurology, says the doctor about sclerosis
In the Czech Republic, approximately three hundred people suffer from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and 21 patients undergo experimental stem cell therapy in Motol, Prague.
We do not know whether it will be successful.
But if we don&#39;t try, we won&#39;t find out, &quot;says Radim Mazanec, a Motol neurologist.
The CIA manuscript is known in this, they needed a war, Huml writes about shooting down flight MH17
CSSD MP Stanislav Huml is clear about who shot down a Malaysian plane over Ukraine.
According to him, it is clear that &quot;the harsh sanctions, which were announced with regard to the shooting down of a civilian aircraft with almost 300 dead, were intentionally caused by the Ukrainian army.&quot;
According to the legislator, the manuscript of the CIA is also known from this.
Unfulfillable promises.
Elections are approaching and the parties are again offering the impossible
The end of the homeless on the streets, parking for every family and the cable car above Prague.
This is repeated before each election: the parties promise the impossible.
Also now, with the upcoming municipal elections, politicians are vying for who likes the voters more.
The Lidovky.cz server has selected unfulfillable promises from the present and the past.
70 years ago, the Czechoslovaks landed at Dunkirk.
A fierce siege began
It was August 30, 1944, when the Czechoslovak Independent Brigade moved to France.
Its commander Alois Liška constantly asked for the addition of technical equipment and sending to the front.
The British eventually complied and included this ground unit as one of its forces in the siege of the port city of Dunkirk, which remained in the power of German troops.

62,000 volleyball spectators?
The Poles say yes
The introduction of the World Cup of volleyball players in Warsaw set a spectator record.
At the football stadium under a cloudy roof, 62,000 spectators watched the smooth victory of the home team over Serbia.
Tickets were sold out in 100 minutes.
How to survive a return from vacation?
Take your time and get some sleep
The last days of the holidays are ahead of us.
Getting used to returning from a sunny beach or cottage to a normal work pace can be a challenge for many.
It can even be accompanied by depression.
Fortunately, there are proven tips for dealing with a changed situation: not rushing and getting a good night&#39;s sleep.
Joan Rivers family: &quot;We keep our fingers crossed&quot;
Joan Rivers has been unconscious for three days since she was taken to a hospital in New York City, but her daughter said today that she was not losing hope that the 81-year-old comedian would recover.
&quot;Thank you for your greetings and support,&quot; Melissa Rivers said in a statement today.
We keep our fingers crossed for her.
Her mother was brought to Mount Sinai Hospital on Thursday after an emergency call called for cardiac arrest for Yorkshire endoscopy in the Upper East Side, a source said.
Doctors deliberately keep her under the influence of sedatives and under strict supervision until they are sure of her condition, which remains &quot;serious.&quot;
Responses didn&#39;t take long, including incredible online support from celebrities like Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Ripa.
Reality is distorted by the headlines
That the media distorts reality with their headlines is (unfortunately) nothing new.
I know that headlines &quot;sell&quot; newspapers, but unfortunately I also know that there are many so-called &quot;readers&quot; who do not read anything else.
And this is a fact that has been bothering me a lot lately, the word annoys is more apt.
This applies in particular to articles on the conflict between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip.
The headlines &quot;Israel has attacked Gaza&quot; are quite common.
Only in the text will you read that the Israeli &quot;attack&quot; was a reaction to fired rockets from the Gaza Strip, often at the time of the declared ceasefire.
It then appears with the caption &quot;Both sides violated the armistice&quot;.
Is the journalist community aware that by doing so, it is directly involved in the anti-Semitic attitudes that are growing throughout Europe (and not only there)?
Less than sixty years have passed since the end of World War II.
There are still people who survived the Shoah.
When I saw the videos from the Federal Republic of Germany, where the crowd shouted the slogans &quot;Jewish pigs&quot; and similar atrocities, I was stunned.
Does the world want to complete what Hitler failed to do?
Are our journalists aware of the fact that the Slavs were destined for liquidation after the Jews?
Ladies and gentlemen of the press, please pay a little more attention to your work.
You are often referred to as the &quot;watchdogs of democracy&quot;.
So defend her.
As long as he&#39;s here.
And also defend the right of the only truly democratic state in the Middle East to protect its people.
How would you like our government to behave if one of our neighbors decides to liquidate the Czech nation and erase the Czech Republic from the world map?
Maybe you should also realize one more fact.
Almost 20% of Arabs with Israeli citizenship live in the state of Israel.
And they are fine there.
If you ask them why they don&#39;t go to &quot;their&quot;, for example to Gaza, will they answer you, why would they do it?
In Israel, they have work, social security and top-notch health care (I have seen for myself how Arabs usually go to the top private Hadassa Hospital, which is funded by sponsorships from Jews around the world, and are, of course, treated there).
Hamas is also attacking its Arab brothers with its missiles.
The only real help to Gaza, and thus to this troubled region, is to rid it of Hamas and disarm it.
And not to condemn Israel, albeit indirectly in the headlines.
Inform about the practices of Hamas, about its abuse of people as human shields.
Inform that Hamas aims to destroy the state of Israel, at any cost.
Even at the cost of the deaths of innocent Arab children.
Inform that Hamas is on the list of world terrorist organizations.
Report that in nine years of self-government in Gaza, the region may have been thriving with humanitarian aid from around the world.
Even from Israel, which supplies water and electricity there, for which, however, the Gaza administrators do not pay and are even upset that electricity supplies are sometimes interrupted at this time.
If Hamas did not invest money in the construction of underground tunnels to allow suicide bombers to penetrate Israel, but also in the construction of apartment buildings, hospitals and schools, its Arab brothers in Gaza would have lived much better.
Amazon buys Twitch for $ 1.04 billion
AMAZON has just confirmed Monday&#39;s Information claim: An online retailer - a video producer and hundreds of other things - is buying the Twitch video streaming service for $ 1.04 billion (US $ 970 million).
The announcement came as a surprise, not because no one expected Twitch to be bought, but because YouTube was expected to be the buyer.
Three months ago, Twitch&#39;s sales of Google for $ 1 billion seemed certain, and the connection seemed natural.
Twitch, founded by Justin.tv only three years ago, was set to become a widely used video streaming service - a live version of YouTube.
Instead, it quickly became a platform for gamers to stream online gaming - the Business Insider&#39;s &quot;YouTube Live Play&quot;.
Twitch interaction.
&quot;Let&#39;s play&quot; videos are already popular on YouTube, the kind where mudrlants (mostly older ones) give games to Mystery Science Theater.
The fact is that YouTube comes up with a lot when describing Switch, so the news that YouTube is buying Switch didn&#39;t excite anyone much, it was a textbook example of how an established company will pay off possible competition.
The mystery is why the agreement with YouTube did not work out, even though the company was willing to pay the same amount as Amazon.
All we have at our disposal today is a statement from Twitch CEO Emmet Shear: &quot;We chose Amazon because it believes in our company, has the same values and long-term vision, and wants to help us meet it faster.&quot;
Another mystery is - honestly - the incredible success of Twitch.
For snobs like me who claim to do sports rather than watch sports, it&#39;s hard to understand what&#39;s so great about watching games instead of actually playing.
It&#39;s one thing to watch a friend play Resident Evil at three in the morning, and it&#39;s quite another to watch a stranger get twenty blows to the head in Call of Duty.
All the games you could watch right now.
Another problem is that many of today&#39;s, most popular games are from a player&#39;s perspective, so watching their record without being able to control the perspective yourself is a pretty good recipe for getting a headache.
I admit that speed run games in which Rogers Banners of our electronic age will complete the game in record time are fun.
But if someone is not a master of acting or humor, their channel on Twitch will probably not be very interesting.
But what do skeptics like me know about it?
Twitch has 55 million visits a month and is the fourth highest Internet traffic.
How exactly will Amazon use it?
It&#39;s hard to imagine Twitch blending into Amazon Instant Video as elegantly as YouTube could have swallowed it.
But Twitch has something every business would like to attract: hordes of young men that advertisers want.
As Twitch director Shear said, both Amazon and Twitch &quot;believe in the future of gaming,&quot; and the media doesn&#39;t seem reluctant, not even - swallowing.
The second basic lie of creationism.
Another Czech translation by the American atheist vlogger Aaron Ra.
This time on the theme &quot;The scriptures are the word of God.&quot;
The original video is attached.
The second fundamental lie of creationism is the belief that sacred texts were written by God and not by real human authors.
When believers debate one of the many things that are contrary to their religion, they are often faced with the question: Who will you trust?
The alleged word of God, or the word of man?
As if human inquiry were completely insignificant compared to the authority they imagine their doctrine has.
But when they say &quot;human,&quot; they talk about science.
And when they refer to the &quot;word of God,&quot; they refer to myths about God written by men.
If there really is an intelligent s creator for some purpose, then it is he who has created the fossil record that reveals the evolutionary history, and it must be he who invented the genetic patterns that correspond to it, and it must be he who has added the other series. evidence that points exclusively to the evolutionary conclusion down to the last detail.
Why else would all these things exist?
It seems like he&#39;s trying to tell us something!
People couldn&#39;t create any of those things.
But people can tell stories, plot.
And it was the people who wrote all the texts that pretended to be the word of God.
Every supposedly holy teaching of any religion in the world describes itself as written by humans, not gods.
People who were &quot;moved&quot; or &quot;inspired&quot; by their favorite gods, or perhaps listened to the dictates of angels, but those texts were not written by anyone other than mere mortals with a certain degree of imagination, not angels and not gods at all.
If there really was one real god, he would be an integral part of all the gods of all religions, the über-galactic supergenius, the ultimate entity of the entire cosmos.
If a being of this size ever wrote a book, there would be only one such book, the only scripture.
It would be known all over the world, without predecessors, parallels or alternatives in any language, because mere human authors could not compete with such a work.
And people would not have to believe in it blindly, because it would be consistent, supported by verifiable and truthful evidence, and it would reveal a deep morality and wisdom far beyond all human limits.
It would constantly inspire every reader to the unity of the common faith.
If God had written it, we would not have expected anything less.
But what we see instead is the exact opposite.
Instead of a single religion leading to the ultimate truth, we have many different religions without common origin, and they all fall apart into more and more separate denominations, seeking controversial truths, each claiming God&#39;s guidance in some way, regardless of continuing divergence and separation in every direction.
The Jewish Torah, the Christian Gospels, the Islamic Qur&#39;an, the Baha&#39;u&#39;llah&#39;s Kitab-i-Akdas, Zarathustra&#39;s Avestas, the Sikh Adi-Granth, the Mahabharata Bhagavad-Gita, the Book of Mormon, or the Book of Urantia are all considered &quot;absolute truth&quot; and &quot;revealed.&quot; the word of the one true god &quot;and the respective believers of each of them say that the others are misguided.
Probably the only logical explanation is that to some extent everyone is on the move.
None of the above books has any advantage over the others.
None of them have evidence and none can be historically confirmed.
My name is Dr. Paul Maier, and I&#39;m a professor of ancient history at the University of Western Michigan.
I&#39;m not saying I&#39;ve proven that the Bible is reliable and historically accurate.
Of course not.
You still have to have faith.
All of them require faith and also apologies (defenses), because they contain inconsistencies, absurdities and primitive ideas once considered true, which have already been overcome.
So they cannot be said to be proof of divine wisdom.
Many of them promote abominable atrocities instead of morality, and many are said to have been confirmed by the fulfillment of prophecies - with the proviso that each may also contain prophecies that have not been fulfilled.
Leading theologians admit that all the sacred texts of any religion have been written by human hands and are therefore the subject of interpretations, impressions and views of their primitive and often prejudiced politically motivated authors, explaining many of the contradictions and inconsistencies in these books, especially those in the Bible.
I would not call it a contradiction, but rather mutual comments.
We must point out again that we have two different authors here, whose work was somehow mixed together during some editorial review.
He is right that Genesis has more than one author and is certainly not an eyewitness account!
Some experts now distinguish four different sources only for the Pentateuch, ie the five Books of &quot;Moses&quot; and do not attribute the authorship of any of them to Moses because they almost certainly did not exist as described in the Bible.
Experts agree that Genesis was composed (probably by Ezra) of several unrelated oral traditions less than 2,500 years ago.
Other documents have been filtered at the same time and all are attributed to human authors.
The Bible is not as old as its believers think.
The Dead Sea Scrolls are the oldest archaeological finds of texts known for their unfinished foundation of all Western monotheistic beliefs, and yet they are many centuries younger than the roots of Zoroastrianism, Buddhism, Hinduism, Hellenism, Druid cults, Chinese or Egyptian religions.
Christianity began as a Gnostic faith, followed by doctrines and ebionites and their completely different views of Jesus, which were eventually combined into a compromise called orthodoxy.
Other Christian groups, such as the Luciferians, were dispersed and discredited by further revisions of the Bible.
One of these adjustments relates to King Ugarit, who ruled 3,500 years ago.
Because his followers posed a major threat to the young Moses&#39; religion, the New Testament writers decided to ridicule and changed Ba&#39;al Zebula, the &quot;Lord on the Mount,&quot; to Beelzebub, the &quot;Lord of the Flies.&quot;
So the Bible was intentionally and fraudulently altered for both religious and political reasons.
The rest of what happened by the New Testament was canonized in the 4th century AD in a series of commission decisions at the Assembly in Nikaya.
Four gospels were accepted and sixteen others were rejected by a simple handshake, as if the fact of a thing could be accepted or rejected by voting.
The way the canon evolved depended on what was read on Sundays at the then Christian centers.
What was read on the second Sunday after Easter in the Church of Jerusalem?
And what about the Roman Church at the same time?
And gradually they discovered that they were approaching the same gospel stories.
And so the core of the canon thus evolved from the core of the early church.
So the council simply accepted as the gospel any relevant stories that circulated among the uneducated masses at the time.
But they also deliberately removed more than ten books from the Bible, even though the books that were approved referred to them.
Among the rejected items are the writings of both the apostles and the prophets.
Why should the word of God refer us to books that are just the words of some people and / or are no longer available?
Who was the real editor here?
The Bible often mentions human authors.
But how could it be approved in this way if God were the real author of this random mix of rumors, parables, and psalm poetry?
The Bible was certainly written by humans and certainly not by the Enlightenment, quite the contrary!
That is why so much of its content is historically and scientifically completely erroneous, no matter what it is from beginning to end.
We are talking about people who believed that snakes and donkeys could speak, believed in spells, bloody sacrifices, ritual spells, enchanted objects, fire potions, astrology and the five elements of magic.
They thought that using a magic wand to spray someone with blood would cure him of leprosy.
We are talking about people who thought that rabbits were ruminants and bats are birds and whales are fish and that there is an integer.
These people believed that if they showed a pregnant cow striped patterns, they would give birth to striped calves.
How could anyone who knows anything about genetics say that?
Of course, the authors of this book did not know it.
If the Bible were written by a higher being, then it would not contain the mistakes it contains.
If it came from the pen of a truly superior being and was intended as a literal history, then it would not contain anything at all.
As a moral guide, it fails totally because most of the original Hebrew writings were written by uneducated and bigoted savages who ignored or promoted animal cruelty, incest, slavery, slave abuse, family abuse, child abuse, child violence, abortion, looting, murder. , cannibalism, genocide and prejudice against race, nation, religion, gender and sexual orientation.
To defend their inhumanity by claiming to do God&#39;s will.
However, creationists still ignore all this.
Some of their websites admit that if any fact contradicts the Bible, then the fact must be ignored!
And why?
Because if creationists didn&#39;t have their beloved books, they wouldn&#39;t have a god.
In their world, one and the other is the same.
It is ironic that they reject God&#39;s &quot;work&quot; as &quot;the worship of creation instead of the creator.&quot;
But they themselves consider the word of man to be the word of God and of God himself, and even insist that the refutation of their supposedly &quot;holy&quot; books somehow refutes God as such.
Not their version of God but all versions of God.
Creationist Christians think that if the Bible is wrong, then God is lying.
They cannot accept that God could exist and the Bible could be wrong at the same time because they cannot separate doctrine from deity.
So it is a kind of idolatry where believers worship man-made compilations as if these books were God himself because they think they are HIS word.
But God has never written or dictated any of the writings of any religion.
Everything that people have approved or rejected into their supposedly &quot;unchanging word&quot; of any god has been invented, compiled, grouped, translated, interpreted, modified, and often also intentionally altered and distorted by mere erroneous people.

The participant in the bucket challenge dislocated her jaw
As she poured ice water on her head, Isabelle Roberts of the United Kingdom screamed, damaging the structure of her facial bones.
This bucket challenge failed.
The woman was hospitalized after shouting at her bucket call by dislocating her jaw.
As she poured ice water over her head, Isabelle Roberts screamed so hard she damaged the bone structure in her face.
&quot;The water was so cold I had to scream, but my jaw started to stiffen,&quot; she told The Mirror.

The attacker stabbed nine people in a Chinese school, three of whom died
According to the New China agency, a man named Chen broke into the primary school building in the morning and attacked around half past ten local time.
Three of the nine people he stabbed later died in hospital.
Chen later killed himself by jumping from a height, New China said, referring to the regional government.
In recent years, China has experienced a series of similar attacks in schools and against children.
The public is therefore calling for greater security measures and better protection for children in a country where many married couples have only one child in accordance with government policy.
Zeman showed the first-graders in Lány how he had to sit at school
The youngest schoolchildren were taken to their classroom, where they and their teacher waited for the president to arrive.
He then showed the children how he had to sit alone at school.
&quot;We had to sit with our hands behind our backs, fortunately no longer awaits you, you are already free people,&quot; Zeman told the children.
His wife then handed the puzzle to the first-graders as a gift.

&quot;This year I want to connect Czech education more with Czech sport,&quot; he explained one of the reasons why he went to the north of Bohemia on the first day of school.
The school management recently approached him at a hockey match in Litvínov.
&quot;They were the first, so I accepted the invitation to participate in the beginning of the school year,&quot; the minister added.
The Minister of Education Marcel Chládek (ČSSD) started the school year in a private sports school in Litvínov.
115,000 first-graders entered the first classes this year.
A total of over 850,000 children will attend primary schools and over 405,000 students will study at secondary schools, according to the Ministry of Education.
The new art director of Nova&#39;s news is David Fiala
David Fiala has become the new art director of news and journalism at Nova TV since September 1.
He will replace Alan Záruba, who has been leading the creative department of the entire Nova group since June 1.
David Fiala previously worked in the graphic department of the Z1 news television.
For the last two years, under the leadership of Alan Záruba, he has been involved in the implementation of a complete visual transformation of the news programs Televizní noviny, Střepiny, Prásk! and other journalistic programs of TV Nova.
David Fiala masters very well the synergy of communication between the editorial office, studio management and the graphics department, which is the essence of the work of the art director of news.
He has a feeling for typography and clean, elegant design, which is the path we want to take in the visual of Nova&#39;s news, &quot;says Alan Záruba, Nova&#39;s creative director.
Apple iCloud allegedly succumbed to hackers, with nude pictures of celebrities coming to the public
Screenshot of a list of leaked files
So far, an anonymous user on the 4chan server publishes nude and pornographic images of American celebrities, the American server Mashable.com pointed out.
It allegedly gained them through unauthorized access to user accounts on Apple&#39;s servers, where the affected users uploaded them through automatic backup of images from iPhones and iPads.
Apple has not yet commented on the issue.
Some celebrities reject the images as forged, but several of the affected people have already admitted the authenticity of the images.
These include actress Jennifer Lawrence, known from the title role of Katniss in the Hunger Games film series, and Mary Elizabeth Winstead, who starred in Death Trap 4.0, for example.
The goal of the hacker is to use the acquired images and videos for enrichment.
American magazines have reportedly shown interest in the footage, but according to reports on the 4chan server, the hacker prefers money from the community.
According to The Next Web, this is most likely a weakness in iCloud security.
Two days ago, a tool appeared on the GitHub server that made it possible to obtain passwords for user accounts through brute force, ie by automatically repeating login attempts with different passwords.
The tool has been shown to work, but Apple closed the security hole after two days.
What is certain, however, is that potential attackers had plenty of time to gain access to various accounts before the tool was released.
ICloud users should change their Apple ID password for precautionary reasons.
The length of the password is important, not its complexity.
A length of at least 12 characters is suitable.
Leak the nude shots of celebrities as a reminder of the safe use of online services.
Although the servers of companies such as Apple, Google or Microsoft are many times better secured than computers in households or smaller companies, uploading sensitive photos in unprotected form is an unnecessary risk.
If you want to back up explicit photos or any other sensitive content online, encrypt the files before uploading.
It is also reasonable to set the automatic backup of photos from the phone so that it takes place only on wi-fi and after connecting to the charger.
This way you will be able to move sensitive images &quot;to safety&quot; in time, and most importantly you will have the space to delete unsuccessful images, so they will not take up space in the online storage unnecessarily.
We offer instructions on how to encrypt files and communication on the Internet to readers of HN and IHNED.cz in the form of an electronic book by Michal Altair Valášek in PDF format.
A smart way to save on college scripts
With the cost of a college script for many students exceeding $ 1,000 a year, the prospective sophomore came up with a clever way to cut costs.
He devised a system of borrowing books from classmates with an offer of nominal compensation to delay their sale back.
&quot;I got a calculation book that normally costs $ 180 for a semester for ten and for chicken nuggets,&quot; said Schroeder, 19, who is studying at Covenant College in Georgia.
The books required in his last semester would cost $ 430, he says.
Spent 120.
According to the university council, the average student spends more than $ 1,200 a year on textbooks and supplies, but students have a variety of options for managing these expenses.
Online shops and creative solutions such as Schroeder&#39;s are becoming the students&#39; preferred choice.
The lending of textbooks is on the rise, which allows students to use a book for a semester, often at a significant discount than if they bought it.
Neebo Inc., which operates more than 250 bookstores on campus, says book lending has doubled since 2011.
Industry research shows that about a quarter of books in university bookstores were lent last spring, says Neebo vice president Trevor Meyer.
According to the National Association of University Stores, less than half of textbooks are bought in university bookstores.
Here are the 101 best ways to succeed.
Online shopping
The prices of some new books can be up to a third lower on the Internet than in a university bookstore.
The suggested retail price of the ninth edition of Ron Larson, Bruce Edwards, and Robert Hostetler&#39;s &quot;Calculus,&quot; is nearly $ 290, but can be purchased online at Chegg.com, a textbook retailer for $ 239.99.
Buy used
If you don&#39;t mind other people&#39;s remarks or wear and tear and damage, the textbooks used are a good option.
At Chegg.com, &quot;Calculus&quot; sells for $ 93.49.
Matt Casaday, 25, a senior at Brigham Young University, says he paid 42 cents on Amazon.com for a copy of &quot;Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business.&quot;
The new one sold for $ 48.
Ingrid Bracey, head of the University of Massachusetts at Amherst&#39;s College Without Walls, suggests that students check with their teachers to see if older editions are acceptable.
Sometimes changes are not essential for seminar work.
If so, older editions can be sold for a fraction of the price of the latest version.
In addition to Chegg and Amazon, eBay Inc&#39;s Half.com are also a popular alternative to buying used books.
Lending
It is also worth considering borrowing textbooks, if you handle them well, do not forget to return them and do not need to have them even after the seminar.
You can save up to 80% on the cost of a new book.
For example, a student could borrow &quot;Calculus&quot; for about twenty dollars for an entire semester.
Familiarize yourself with the terms and conditions of the store in which you borrow the book, including penalties for notes, highlighting or wear and tear and damage.
Keep in mind: If you do not return the book in time, the fine may be higher than the price of the new book.
E-books
Another option is to get an e-book instead of a normal book.
Sometimes these books are essentially borrowed in the form of an electronic license valid for a period of time from distributors such as Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes &amp; Noble Inc.
Chegg lends &quot;Calculus&quot; for six months for about $ 61.
According to Bracey, literary students can find the best deals, as many classics are now available for free download, while science and technology texts can be very expensive.
In any case, go shopping.
Joe Gault, 29, who will be joining Pepperdine Law School soon, recommends following the ISBN, as this ensures that you are buying the right book.
Before ordering a book online, make sure it is really in stock, Gault advises.
He was convinced of it firsthand.
The book he bought was sold out for four weeks, and he had to pay full price for a book from a university bookstore.
Mud, all mud.
And then they found a torso of a rifle from the end of the war in the well
The well is a short walk from the church of St. Jiří.
We uncovered the vegetation around us and began to pull out an age-old deposit - about a meter and a half of mud and rotten leaves.
As we approached the clay bottom, we came across a barrel, &quot;said Radomil Novák.
We pulled it out, cleaned it, and found that it was a torso of an assault German rifle used by SS units.
The finding is reportedly unusual.
According to my information, such rifles were manufactured until the end of the war.
And there were about three hundred thousand of them, &quot;Novák added.
All wooden construction things have decomposed over time, so it is unusable.
However, her body is well-preserved - she keeps her shape.
How did you find yourself in the well?
There is one explanation.
It may have been thrown there by people who needed to get rid of weapons used by SS units, probably for fear of being expelled.
The fascists on the run probably wouldn&#39;t do that.
They were throwing weapons in the forest, &quot;the finder thinks.
The rifle was the only thing that enthusiasts from the Rainbow Movement found the Jeseníky Mountains in the well.
&quot;There could have been hand grenades, there used to be a lot of them all around, so we slowed down the excavation work, we carefully felt the mud so that no accident would happen, but there was nothing else down there,&quot; Novák said.
The find ends up in the museum&#39;s depository at the chateau in nearby Slezské Rudoltice.
Ukrainian general: I have not yet liberated the captured Czech
An exclusive interview with Aktuálně.cz with Colonel General Volodymyr Ruban, who is releasing Ukrainian soldiers from the captivity of pro-Russian separatists.
Kiev / Prague - &quot;Sorry, I have to take it ... they call me from Donetsk,&quot; Ukrainian Colonel General Volodymyr Ruban, otherwise also the director of the local Prisoner of Liberation Center, apologized perhaps eight times during an exclusive interview with Aktuálně.cz.
Colonel General Volodymyr Ruban in a television debate.
With each such interruption, it was impossible not to hear the names of the people, their numbers, or where they were — or should be — that Ruban specified with his counterpart on the other end of the phone.
&quot;That will be it - go there,&quot; he concluded one of the lightning discussions with Donetsk and again focused on ours.
Volodymyr Ruban is a reserve general, a former fighter pilot and an active participant in anti-government protests on Maidan.
Yesterday - when we arranged the interview - he was in Donetsk.
He dedicates twenty-four hours a day to the liberation of Ukrainian soldiers from the captivity of pro-Russian separatists.
Aktuálně.cz: You may know that the Czechs are also fighting on the side of pro-Russian separatists.
Our counterintelligence estimates their number at thirty.
However, there can be many more.
Have you ever met a Czech prisoner during your negotiations?
Volodymyr Ruban: I have freed already captured Serbs, Dagestanis, Chechens, one Swede, a Georgian ... but not yet a Czech.
But I know who to turn to in Prague if we come across your captured compatriot and can free him.
Ukrainian soldier captured by separatists
A.cz: What advice do you advise Czechs who join pro-Russian separatists and be captured by Ukrainian soldiers?
They should understand that if, like the Czechs, they fight in the Ukrainian battalions of volunteers and the separatists capture them, they will shoot them mercilessly after interrogation, just like any other foreigner.
The separatists consider these men to be mercenaries, and they say they deserve nothing but death.
But if, for example, Ukrainian soldiers capture a group of Donetsk separatists - and among them, for example, a Czech - they will put him behind bars and treat him like a prisoner of war.
The guy simply survives.
The Ukrainian side also behaves like a state in the war.
A.cz: And how many have you managed to save Ukrainian prisoners?
If I understand correctly, in exchange.
Some sources say it has long since exceeded 100 men.
We have long since stopped counting how many people we have helped.
But we just freed them ... they didn&#39;t save them from the war if they decided to continue fighting.
Rescuers are doctors and surgeons at war, but we certainly are not.
That&#39;s it.
And more and more are added every day.
We save someone every day.
Sometimes one, sometimes four or five.
And it doesn&#39;t always have to be an exchange.
Sometimes a mere human request is enough to release prisoners.
A.cz: It is rumored that in a few months you have gained great authority and even trust in pro-Russian separatists ... just like in Ukrainian society.
How did you manage to build the respect of both warring parties?
Difficult question.
One of the officers in Kiev nicknamed me &quot;Mad General with Steel Balls&quot;.
It doesn&#39;t offend me.
And maybe it captures the essence of our work.
As the head of the Ukrainian Officers Corps, I have already gained some authority.
I never catch, I don&#39;t cheat and I always keep my word.
Whatever happens, I act honestly and tell the truth.
Even when it is very unpleasant for the Ukrainian government, or the Donetsk or Luhansk government.
If they torture and kill people?
So I simply tell them that they are torturing and killing them.
And that they are crimes.
At the same time, I often risk my life, I was even captured when exchanging prisoners ... this job can mean the end for me at any time ... I don&#39;t have to go back.
A.cz: How many executions and torture of prisoners do you know?
... (long pause) ... Ukrainians and separatists resort to torture in prisoners during interrogations.
Unfortunately.
And the executions?
These take place only on the Donetsk side.
I have no information that the Ukrainian army is also executing prisoners.
Not even a hint that the Ukrainian army is doing anything similar.
We have an idea of the number of executions, but I cannot and do not want to give numbers.
A.cz: Describe to me the characters and motives of the pro-Russian separatists.
Among them are officers, but also veterans from Afghanistan.
They are striving for independence and perhaps democracy in Donetsk or Luhansk - at least that&#39;s what they say.
They no longer want to play games with Ukrainian oligarchs.
The separatists already have their teeth full of oligarchs and are their irreconcilable opponents - to life and death.
As we say - they ate up to their throats.
By the way, people showed the same dreams and desires on Maidan.
And now I&#39;m speculating a little: Russia supports the separatists and the West supports the Ukrainian state.
I consider one speculation to be great and the other to be small.
But my sentence already conceals an irreconcilable contradiction.
A.cz: How, for example, does one of the toughest leaders of pro-Russian separatists, Igor Bezler, look to you?
Whenever I cross the line of the war front, I am unarmed and show the soldiers or militants outstretched bare hands.
And both sides of the two hundred or three hundred meters always have me on the line of sight or in the optical sight.
I can always see the faces of people pointing at me ... and they can pull the trigger of their weapons at any time.
Paratrooper, an experienced colonel with German and Ukrainian ancestors.
He is considered a Russian officer, but his family - his mother - lives in Ukraine.
He believes that Ukraine should not exist.
And if so, just like a little governor in the great Russian Empire.
In any case, he is constantly talking about it and considers Ukraine to be a kind of misunderstanding.
According to him, such a state should not even exist.
At the same time, he is the implacable enemy of all Ukrainian oligarchs.
A.cz: Speaking of characters - in a Ukrainian TV talk show, you described your Prime Minister Arseniy Yachenuk as a weak, clueless and tired &quot;leader&quot; who would do best if he left quickly.
During those three hundred meters of walking, I always get scared at least five times.
So why should I hide my opinion that Jaceňuk is a very weak prime minister and that he is harming our country?
A.cz: Do you think it has a share in the war in Ukraine?
You may know that Ukrainians call Yachenuk a &quot;rabbit.&quot;
And in the eyes of Ukrainians, the rabbit is not an animal that would be afraid or have the respect and authority of others.
His behavior directly replicates the behavior of a rabbit.
He may be a good economist, but as prime minister he has no right to cry in parliament during the war, beg him, play his intrigues with him, threaten to take office ... he must manage the country, administer it and protect it during the war.
When the country is threatened, the prime minister is not entitled to family, friends, rest and crying emotions.
He is, after all, the first of Ukraine&#39;s ministers.
And Jaceňuk?
She is acting like a teenage girl.
Yes, he is tired, but also weak, because he has never been strong ... he does not fight for Ukraine, he just constantly complains about everything.
He should therefore leave.
The sooner the better for Ukraine.
Why the Guardians of the Galaxy failed to save sales
Sylvester Stallone&#39;s Expendable 3 returned less than $ 30 million from the U.S. $ 90 million budget and Sin City: The woman I would kill for returned only $ 12 million from the $ 70 million budget.
Sex Tape with Cameron Diaz earned only $ 14.6 million during the first weekend, and children&#39;s movies like How to Train Your Dragon 2 were a disappointment to theaters.
According to an article by film critic Robbie Collin in the Telegraph, the quality of children &#39;s films is to blame.
Collin called 2014 the &quot;worst&quot; year of children&#39;s films and called How to Train Your Dragon 2 a mere &quot;functional&quot; sequel.
When it comes to films aimed at a slightly older target group, it seems that the problem does not necessarily have to be in the quality of the films themselves.
In July, Entertainment Weekly compared CinemaScore and Metacritic and their average ratings of summer film premieres aired in at least 2,000 theaters between War Victims&#39; Day and July 20, 2013 and this year.
The results, which take into account the opinion of viewers and film critics alike, suggest that this year&#39;s film harvest is of a similar quality to last year&#39;s hits.
According to some commentators, the change in the viewer&#39;s approach and the higher popularity of Internet servers such as Netflix may be to blame.
Director Jon Favreau, who is currently working on Disney&#39;s adaptation of The Jungle Book, told the Hollywood Reporter, &quot;I think times are changing.&quot;
We must admit it and not try to pursue what has already been done.
In contrast to the current Hollywood blockbuster crisis, Netflix&#39;s profit from Internet services was $ 1.2 billion, almost twice as much as last year&#39;s $ 837 million.
Last summer, director Steven Spielberg criticized the studios for relying too much on comic book rights and predicted the &quot;collapse&quot; of Hollywood.
In light of the current downturn, some commentators claim that there may be something to his catastrophic prophecy.
With the introduction of possible big blockbusters in the summer of 2015, including Avengers: Age of Ultron, Mimoň and Jurassic World, other numbers in the film industry are more optimistic.
X-Men producer Simon Kinberg recently described the decline in sales as simply &quot;cyclical&quot;. He told the Hollywood Reporter: &quot;Next summer will be the biggest blockbusters in history and no one will worry about sales.&quot;
The DPRK is again threatening Seoul, it fired another short-range missile
North Korea fired another short-range missile into the sea, Seoul said.
The alleged missile test took place shortly after the end of joint military maneuvers between the United States and South Korea, which Pyongyang sees as preparation for an invasion.
Chagang Province is located in the northwest of KDLR on the border with China.
A spokesman for the South Korean Ministry of Defense, according to the DPA agency, said that the missiles were fired from a place in the northwest of the DPRK and flew to a distance of about 200 kilometers.
North Korea apparently fired a rocket from Chagang province for the first time, the South Korean media reported, referring to military circles.
The province is said to have an underground launch pad for Scud missiles.
This is another in a series of similar tests conducted by the isolated North Korean regime in recent weeks.
North Korea has conducted an unusually large number of missile and artillery tests this year.
NATO Summit: First protests in Newport and Cardiff
Opponents of the NATO summit in Newport took place over the weekend.
Hundreds of people gathered in downtown Newport on Saturday to take part in a march against NATO.
And on Sunday, about 150 people came to Cardiff City Hall for a meeting described as a counter-summit.
Stephen Fairclough watched the situation over the weekend and spoke to protesters who came from Bridgend to Belgium.
The teenagers had to be airlifted from the Blue Mountains
TWO teenage tourists were picked up by plane and taken to safety after spending the night in the Blue Mountains of New South Wales.
A 16-year-old girl and an 18-year-old man went on a hike to Govetts Leap in Blackheath after noon on Sunday.
When they did not return home, anxious relatives called the police around eight o&#39;clock in the evening.
A search party, including local police and a rescue team, was sent and the couple was found near Bridal Veil Falls around 11 p.m.
The girl injured her knee and the man fell while hitting his head.
Police stayed with them overnight and were picked up on Monday morning.
In a stabilized state, they were transported by ambulance to Blue Mountains Hospital.
Olomouc brought only a point from Opava, Vašíček won on his leg
The 23-year-old forward was able to decide, but failed in the two biggest chances.
The goal was mainly called by a close shot three minutes before the end, but instead of in the net, it ended up with Opava goalkeeper Josef Květoň.
I had it on my leg, I have to give such chances.
I&#39;m mad at myself, &quot;Vašíček poured ashes on his head.
&quot;I guess I should have put it higher under the lid, it got a little cold,&quot; he mused.
Sigma&#39;s defense didn&#39;t allow Opava much, with the exception of Mikul&#39;s raid from the 11th minute, which was covered by goalkeeper Reichl.
Then the Hanáci began to push, but they did not let them into the chances in the block defending the home team, and Květoň caught the bullets from a distance.
We compared for fifteen minutes, then took the initiative.
In the second half we were already better, we had more of the game and Opava threatened us only from standard situations.
But Vašíček did not change the chance, so it ended 0-0, &quot;regret Hanák coach Leoš Kalvod.
Opava also took the point due to absences in the line-up, where in addition to a pair of injured, Petr Vavřík and three-goal shooter Petr Ševčík, who are guests from Sigma in Silesia, were also missing.
Unlike its previous policy, it did not allow them to join.
Substitutes deserve discharge.
Sigma looked more football-like, but we didn&#39;t let her do anything except one standard, &quot;said Slezanů coach Petr Baránek.
There was a lot of emphasis, aggression and combativeness.
The draw is probably deserved, the point is a decent profit for us, &quot;he added.
Sigma drew with four points, which means thirteenth place.
Nothing that could satisfy the head of the club, Josef Lébr, who, after the defeat with Znojmo, conditioned his million-dollar deposit into the box office with diametrically different performances in other matches.
&quot;We were aware of Mr. Lébr&#39;s warning, so there can be no question that the boys would not want to fight,&quot; Kalvoda noticed, adding to the address of the sleeping shooter Vašíček: &quot;I believe that it will come and when he scores a goal, it will start to fall there. .
But after the first shot, I&#39;ll replace him right away to save goals for other matches as well, &quot;Kalvoda laughed.
Al Pacino twice inspired Venice.
The film festival is otherwise experiencing a crisis
After great enthusiasm for the inaugural film Birdman, whose director Alejandro González Iňárritu suddenly became one of the serious candidates for the Golden Lion, the next few days gave the impression that interest in the 71st Venice Film Festival had waned somewhat.
Whether because the number of seats in the largest hall has risen to fourteen hundred, or because Birdman has been followed by critically acclaimed but less appealing films to viewers such as the documentary on the 60&#39;s genocide in Indonesia in the Eye of Silence and other social films from of America&#39;s 99 homes after the Iranian Tales, in short, empty seats remained in cinemas.
Comic book heroes
Even the red carpet in front of the festival palace has not yet been besieged by such crowds as in the past, and it is said to have ceased to be a problem to find a place in a hotel at the last minute.
The crisis is being talked about more in Italy than elsewhere, and it is no wonder that it has affected such respected institutions as the Biennale and the oldest film festival in the world.
Fortunately, the crisis is not manifested by a lack of personalities, but present exclusively in connection with films.
While younger fans longed for autographs of comic book superheroes Michael Shannon and Andrew Garfield, who performed quite dramatic roles in 99 homes, the visit of legendary actor Al Pacino became a major event for all generations.
He also starred in two films.
In Out-of-Competition Insight, starring Oscar-winning Barry Levison based on a novel by Philip Roth, the 70-year-old Pacino has a role close to him: an actor at the height of his fame who suffers from depression from the end of his career and personal life.
But seeing him the next day as the weird owner of a rural hardware store in Manglehorn, directed by David Gordon Green, was a truly unforgettable experience.
The Volpi Cup for Best Actor shouldn&#39;t miss him - but does a Pacin-format artist still need awards?
Perhaps the greatest satisfaction for him is the love of the audience, and the Italian one in particular, because although he was born in New York, Al Pacino proudly declares himself to the country where his grandparents come from.
Points for Italy
After all, it is the Italian film that is doing very well in Venice this year.
Black Souls, directed by Francesco Munzi, became Birdman&#39;s first film rewarded with a long standing ovation.
The Calabrian branch of the mafia is viewed in it by looking at the family relations between the clans, which are fighting for power and money, and the director was able to reconcile all the prerequisites for a good film: quality screenplay, camera, music and actors.
He was also fascinated by the chamber psychothriller Hungry Heart, which was filmed by Saverio Costanzo with Alba Rohrwacher as a woman who almost destroys her own child with her misguided anxiety.
On the contrary, neither the Ransom for Fame nor 3 hearts, both works clinging to the traditional model of consumer films, which are based on the popularity of actors, were warmly received from the French competition films.
But after all, two really great films, Birdman and Black Souls, aren&#39;t so few for the first half of the festival.
And while the festival&#39;s films have mostly depressing themes, Peter Bogdanovich&#39;s new film, She&#39;s Funny That Way, a humorous comedy set in Venice out of competition and shot in the style of American comedies of the 1940s, managed to lift the mood for more than a day.
Police seized four meth producers in Prague, transporting medicines from Poland
&quot;Detectives have recently arrested three men aged 42, 42 and 37 and a 25-year-old woman who produced and sold the drug meth in Prague 9 from last November to this August,&quot; said police spokeswoman Jana Rösslerová.
First, on Tuesday, August 12, the intervention unit in Cihlářská Street caught a forty-two-year-old organizer and dealer in one person and a young woman who figured in the group as a drug buyer in Poland and a benefits seller.
The following day, detectives detained another member of the group, a 37-year-old man, with the prior consent of the prosecutor.
The last of the four police officers was caught on Wednesday morning, August 20, in the area of the Malešice incinerator, &quot;the spokeswoman described.
The woman received a third of the drug for transporting medicines from Poland
The main organizer had a wide field of activity.
In the workshop of the Letna complex, in the garden house in Horoměřice, in an apartment in Koněvova street and elsewhere in Prague 9, he produced meth, provided various aids and chemicals needed for its production and ensured the transport of drugs with pseudoephedrine from the Republic of Poland.
He also weighed the drug produced, distributed it in plastic bags and then sold the meth.
A twenty-five-year-old, unpunished woman helped him with transporting medicines from Poland or selling them to drug addicts.
For that, she received a reward from the organizer in the form of a third of the drug produced, &quot;Rössler added.
On the order of the judge, the forensic scientists also carried out several house searches, where they seized drugs, industrial chemicals, digital scales, salary bags, syringes, hoses and other aids and objects, which according to experts can be considered complete equipment for methamphetamine production.
The dealer has been punished seven times since 1995
&quot;From the available records, the police found that the main organizer had been convicted seven times since 1995 for property crime, and the woman had not been convicted,&quot; the police spokeswoman added.
The last detainee was on parole in 2006 for the crime of sexual abuse, and the 37-year-old car mechanic, who is being prosecuted at large, has been convicted nine times since 2009.
For him, too, it was mostly for property crime.
The investigator accused three men and a woman of committing the crime of illicit production and other handling of narcotic and psychotropic substances and poisons, for which they face up to ten years in prison.
In the end, the investigator also filed a motion for three persons with a motion to impose detention, where the judge eventually placed them, &quot;the spokeswoman said.
The fourth accused, a 37-year-old recidivist, ended up at large.
His position and role in this case were not as crucial as those of the other defendants.
Police are still working with this man.
Ferrari offers chess made of wood and carbon.
As part of its other products, Ferrari offers very interesting things at very &quot;interesting&quot; prices.
A good example is, for example, handmade chess in Italy with a game board measuring 42 x 42 cm.
If you like it, prepare more than 40,000 CZK.
The exact price is CZK 43,405.
The customer will receive a set of wooden black and red lacquered figures stored in a wooden box covered with carbon fibers.

If chess doesn&#39;t seem like a valuable enough gift to you, there is also a Ferrari 500 F2 model made (of course by hand) in a scale of 1: 1.8.
The price of this toy is CZK 318,305.
Disruption of grammar schools and high schools does not make sense.
The Czechia has few generally educated people and statistics also show that high school students have a good job.
The beginning of the school year is here.
Great preparations have been made in schools for the last fortnight.
Most of these are routine matters, such as moving flower pots from the summer store back to the classrooms and crimping chalks.
They will have a little bigger rumble at the Hořice grammar school.
A few days before the start of the season, they search for furniture, computers and other technical equipment and literature in the library.
There was no robbery or embezzlement, the four-year grammar school in Hořice opens and resumes its activities after three years.
Not on a public platform, but on a private platform.
The lack of material equipment is not caused by the founders being so incompetent.
They had to wait to see if the existence of the school would be confirmed by entering it in the register of schools administered by the Ministry of Education.
&quot;The French socialists should shut up and put France in order,&quot; said Francois Hollande&#39;s key ally
Valls calls on the heavily fragmented left to &quot;show its support&quot; for the militant socialist president, whose new division of functions has not met with the consent of the majority of the French.
The president deserves universal respect, he deserves loyalty, he deserves our support.
&quot;It is our duty to stay by his side,&quot; he said, receiving applause.
As a conciliatory gesture, the prime minister insisted that his government would not question France&#39;s controversial 30-hour working week, despite passionate speculation from Emmanuel Macron, the new finance minister, who suggested the rules be relaxed earlier this week.
On Saturday, Hollande asked the Socialists to remain &quot;cohesive&quot; with the government.
However, Christiane Taubir, the Minister of Justice, drew a line over his budget when she appeared at a meeting of rebel Socialist MPs, where she criticized the Socialist Party for &quot;losing faith in the future because of it.&quot;
Marine Le Pen, the leader of the extremely conservative right, laughed at the constant internal strife between the Socialists when she said she did not expect the new Valls government to last more than a few months.
Emperor Francois Hollande is naked and so is Prince Manuel Valls. They were forced to form a new government when the previous one did not last until the end of the summer.
&quot;And the new one won&#39;t last until the end of autumn or winter,&quot; Le Pen told her supporters.
It reiterated its party&#39;s call for the dissolution of Parliament and said it was convinced that the party could win early elections and that it was ready to run the country.
The French ruling party was defeated in the March municipal elections, and in May the extremely conservative right succeeded in the European elections.
According to a poll by the Journal du Dimanche, 76 percent of French people think the Socialist Party runs the risk of splitting into several rival factions before the end of Holland&#39;s term in 2017.
Pascal Perrineau, a political scientist at the University of Sciences Po, warned that the French would soon run out of patience if the new socialist government failed to improve the economy and reduce record unemployment.
&quot;It is a limited space for opportunity, but public opinion must think that the situation is changing,&quot; he warned.
Otherwise, the situation could get worse.
Gambling and street art will no longer limit Prague to elections
Amendments to the relevant decrees should be prepared and approved by the new management of the capital.
Before the municipal elections, other casinos will not disappear from the streets of Prague and the city will not restrict street art.
Dog walking will not be limited either.
Prague will not have time to prepare and approve changes in the relevant decrees in the council by the October elections.
&quot;In addition, the decision on changes should not be made by the current leadership of the city, whose term ends in a few weeks,&quot; said councilor Lukáš Manhart (TOP 09).
In recent weeks, several town halls, such as Prague 5 and 7, have decided to abolish gambling on their territory.
But the casinos will not disappear, the gambling decree will not change yet.
It is the task of the new leadership of the city after the elections.
Now we would not even make it technically due to, for example, deadlines for submitting comments and the like, &quot;Manhart explained.
He added that the last meeting of the current council, which must approve the amendment to the decree, will take place on September 11.
A referendum on a blanket ban on gambling is being prepared on the day of the municipal elections in the Prague 1 and Prague 8 districts.
At present, gambling is prohibited in Prague 2 or Prague 12, for example.
For the same reasons, the decree will not change in the case of street art, so-called busking.
Prague 1 in particular is complaining about this, as it has already sent the municipality a proposal for places by which it would like to expand the current list of prohibited places.
Prague 5 in the vicinity of Anděl also does not want musicians.
The city has been preparing a decree regulating dog walking for several months, it has not yet been completed.
The location of casinos and the issue of busking are addressed by city ordinances.
They can only be issued or edited by the City Council.
City halls only have an advisory vote, they are not allowed to issue decrees themselves.
Last week, he placed the victory at the expense of Scottish independence at his fingertips
The campaign for Scottish independence was in danger of making this mistake for the third time, when it almost placed on billboards across Scotland the question of whether the Scots wanted to be rich.
But you will not reach the hearts of Scottish voters by appealing to their wallets, nor will you gain their respect when you start threatening them.
New Testament morality is still alive in Scotland, although few Scots still go to church today.
Scots have a far greater tendency to expel money changers from the temple than to be dictated by them how to vote.
Scottish nationalist leader Alex Salmond knows this well, so he repeatedly asked his TVist Darling in a television debate if he was willing to respect the &quot;sovereign will of the Scottish people&quot; if Scottish voters voted for independence and to start supporting the single currency for Scotland and for England.
This forced Darling to choose between Scottish civil society and London financiers, and grimace fell into this trap.
Of course, Darling will not support the mandate of Scottish voters.
However, the debate over what kind of currency Scotland will have has been more or less neutralized.
What really motivates Scottish voters is the fairness, job opportunities and defense of public health that citizens have for free.
Darling supported London bankers on the currency and also gave the impression that he would not protest against the privatization of health care.
As Salmond put it, he &quot;climbed into bed with the Conservatives.&quot;
This is a very dangerous position for every Scottish politician.
Every Scottish electorate knows that Scottish businessmen are in bed with conservatives.
This was confirmed by David Cameron, who in Scotland spoke not to the electorate but to the &quot;bosses&quot; association, the Confederation of British Industry.
It is becoming clear that Cameron&#39;s refusal to debate independence with Scottish Prime Minister Salmond was a serious mistake for the Unionist campaign.
Cameron looks like a cowardly absent home.
The Scots would respect him if he came to a debate with the Scottish Prime Minister.
At least Cameron was able to say that Scotland could be a &quot;successful independent country&quot;.
Alistair Darling can&#39;t say anything like that, it almost gives him physical pain.
What he is saying is clear: Scots should not jump out and must accept what they are.
The longest year is 10 months.
Pessimistic beginning of the school according to Miloš Urban
Illustration for the short story The Longest Year
Miloš Urban The longest year
The ending was the best of the holidays, the last week that didn&#39;t go anywhere and we just lounged and talked with the old lady&#39;s summer, silence before the storm, calm before stress.
New clothes, when you could get them from Tuzex, shoes from East Germany.
Reading the Fast Arrows, for the fiftieth time, whistling on a bike up the mountain around the Imperial to the back of Vary, somewhere to the tennis courts, was no longer hot, the sun stroking its back and shoulders, tapping the farewell rays.
In the evening, a little nervous, still on holiday, sleep until half past ten, it will be worse in a week, the moments before falling asleep will stretch from a few minutes to two hours, then get up at half past six in the morning.
It will come Monday.
It usually doesn&#39;t rain, on the contrary, summer smirks maliciously in front of school.
Sneaking in a ghostly light onto the plot and feeling like a plastic figure in a glass paperweight, there is the school, ZDŠ A.
Zápotocký with a monstrous pink plaster, and in front of it old familiar faces and a few new ones, the boys more elongated, the girls busier.
There are bastards over there, avoiding them, just as interesting as how unmistakably they hold together and how early they are here.
And these adult-looking girls, who came screaming, are now laughing hysterically at something, something has probably changed in their lives over the holidays, while everything is the same for me.
And new freshmen, some nervous and some excited, why are they even coming here?
Because they must, through educational warfare.
So inside, the cold dampness of the floor and the light smell of disinfectant, the poisoned janitor with the mop, unfortunately still the same one that supposedly lends the student a key from the tin box, where you can leave textbooks and which are still so few.
For a bottle.
The stench of the locker room remains in the memory, it doesn&#39;t take place now, it&#39;s nicely ventilated, but it will be worse in a week.
Just from that idea, the stomach tightens and the head begins to ache.
A head that makes it even harder to take the curriculum of mathematics, that devilish game for the chosen ones, among whom I do not belong and never will be.
Again, the threes and fours, the godfather of the five, to hide from rehearsals, to fit into the bench and best sublimate, to be there and not to exist, to exist only as a name in the classroom and dream of stories about nicer girls and prettier buildings no one competes with anyone, humiliates anyone, and does not irritate anyone&#39;s leg.
The longest year is ten months.
And it&#39;s only the first day, now like years ago.
She let her born daughters die.
She faces an exceptional punishment - Novinky.cz
The first birth took place in March 2012 in the public toilet cubicle at the bus station in Jihlava.
Without any help, a little girl was born to her, which, after cutting her umbilical cord, wrapped herself in a prepared blanket, hid it under her jacket, and carried her to a roadside feeder, where she laid her in bushes several tens of meters from the road.
She gave birth on the way to school
It came to me about a little earlier.
I was on my way to school.
I needed to go to the toilet on the bus, I gave birth there.
She was born alive, looking at me.
I cut the umbilical cord with the scissors I wore to school, &quot;the defendant described, stating that she was said to be ashamed of her pregnancy.
&quot;The next day she returned to the place, put the child&#39;s body in a backpack and took it away, took the body out of the backpack, packed it in a black plastic bag and hid it and left it under the stairs in her grandmother&#39;s house in Havlíčkův Brod,&quot; he said in the lawsuit. obvious when the newborn died.
It could be in tens of minutes, but also a few hours after birth, suffocation when covered with a blanket or placed under a jacket, hypothermia or bleeding from an untied umbilical cord.
A similar scenario was repeated next spring.
In an unspecified time from February to April 12, when the child&#39;s corpse was found by accidental witnesses under a bush by a pond in the Havlíčkův Brod region, she again gave birth secretly.
This time in the bathroom of an attic apartment in a family house.
Without verifying that she was born alive, without cutting and tying the umbilical cord, which was wrapped around her neck, she put the baby in several plastic containers, including a plastic bag, and left it in the bathroom.
Subsequently, in the afternoon, he and his then partner were taken to the pond.
Finally, a friend gave her in
The father of both children was a friend of the defendant, who allegedly did not know about the partner&#39;s pregnancies.
For this reason, he is not currently on trial, he has only been punished for wrongdoing against the Funeral Services Act.
He was also the one who later turned to the police.
I don&#39;t like that he is not punished as an accomplice.
He manipulated the child against my wishes.
I know that my solution was not right, but it came to me as human at the time, &quot;said the defendant, who was allegedly subject to the man in a relationship and feared him.
During her statement, the young woman spoke relatively evenly.
Tears welled in her eyes until she spoke of her relationship with her parents, from whom she had left when she reached the age of majority.
She didn&#39;t want to kill
&quot;They come to see me every 14 days, they do everything for me, even though I know I don&#39;t deserve it,&quot; she sobbed.
I didn&#39;t buy a outfit because I didn&#39;t want children, I felt young.
I really wanted to put him in the baby box, but I don&#39;t know what happened that I didn&#39;t do.
I can&#39;t explain that to you, &quot;she answered the judge&#39;s question.
However, she refused to act with forethought and intent to kill the newborn.
In addition, according to her, the second child was born dead.
But she did not stop drinking alcohol even during her pregnancy.
However, I limited it.
And she didn&#39;t drink hard.
I also reduced smoking, &quot;she said.
Although her pregnancy was visible in both cases, she told everyone, even after repeated questions, that she had health problems, that she was flooded.
And even to a friend.
The main trial will continue at the Hradec Králové court on Tuesday with the testimony of court experts.
A verdict could already be handed down on Wednesday.
A woman is threatened with a penalty of up to 18 years in prison, or an exceptional sentence.
Norwegian Cruise is nearing a three-billion-dollar buyout from Prestige Cruise
According to sources familiar with the matter, Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. (NCHL.O), the third largest cruise ship operator in the world, has made progress in negotiating the purchase of Prestige Cruises International Inc. for about three billion dollars.
The deal by Norwegian Cruise, a $ 6.8 billion company competing with greater competition from Royal Carrebian Cruises Ltd. (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N), has provided access to luxury Prestige Cruises and a wealth of clients.
The agreement may be announced as early as this week, a source said on Sunday, but warned that the negotiations may still not be successful.
The owner of Prestige Cruises, a private investment company of Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N), also owns a 20% stake in Norwegian Cruise.
Sources did not want to be named because the meetings are not public.
Representatives of Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to requests for comments, Apollo spokesman declined to comment on the situation.
Based in Miami, Norwegian Cruise operates thirteen cruise ships cruising in North America, the Mediterranean and the Baltic Sea, Central America and the Caribbean.

Companies compete to become the preferred choice for these customers when choosing cruises.
Prestige Cruises registered its first public offering with the US regulatory authorities in January 2014.
Apollo has had a majority stake in the company since 2007 since the closing of the $ 850 million deal.

In 2008, Apollo invested $ 1 billion in Norwegian Cruise.
Norwegian Cruise listed its shares in January 2013.
According to the registration with the regulatory authorities at the end of June, Genting owned a capital share of 28%, Apollo 20% and the private investment company TPG Capital LP 8%.

Pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong are provoking the Chinese authorities the day after the vote
Nearby stood a group of people loyal to Beijing waving a Chinese flag.
The Standing Committee of the National People&#39;s Congress on Sunday approved that only two of the three candidates will participate in the 2017 elections in Hong Kong.
All candidates must first receive the support of an appointment committee, which is likely to consist of members loyal to Beijing.
Because of this decision, it is almost impossible for opposition Democrats to get to the polls and get pro-Democratic activists to renew their promise and cripple Hong Kong&#39;s financial center with the occupations of the &quot;Occupation Headquarters&quot; movement.
In Hong Kong, political reform is the main cause of tension, and Chinese leaders fear that the demand for democratization will spread to other cities.
After Beijing released a detailed report outlining China&#39;s official authority in Hong Kong in June, democracy activists held an unofficial referendum on elections in a special official district, and hundreds of thousands marched and occupied the city&#39;s business district.
The press conference, at which Prime Minister Li will speak, is organized by the government in Hong Kong and the Chinese liaison office in Hong Kong.
Zhang Ronghsun, Vice-Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Legislative Commission, and Feng Wei, Deputy Director of the State Council of the Office for Hong Kong and Macau, also spoke at several press conferences.
Student activists said they would gather in front of the Hong Kong government office in the afternoon.
Until the last days of colonial rule 150 years ago, Britain had never mentioned democracy in Hong Kong.
Putin asks Kiev to start talks on &quot;state sovereignty&quot; with eastern Ukraine
According to the description of the events by Russian newspapers, on Sunday Russian President Vladimir Putin asked the Ukrainian government to stop fighting with separatists in the east of the country and immediately begin negotiations on the &quot;state sovereignty&quot; of the breakaway regions.
His spokesman Dmitry Peskov later explained that Putin&#39;s remark did not intend to indicate that separatist-controlled areas of eastern Ukraine would become part of Russia, but that their status within Ukraine should be reconsidered to give the Russian-speaking region the power to protect its rights. and interests.
Putin&#39;s call on the Kiev government to treat pro-Russian insurgents as equals is in line with a clear strategy following the outbreak of unrest five months ago: Help separatists occupy territory and force the Ukrainian government to grant de facto independence to the newly declared Novorussia. could unite with Russia.
In an interview with the first state television channel, Putin condemned Ukrainian military actions to regain the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, which were controlled by separatists in March and April after Moscow annexed the Crimean peninsula belonging to Ukraine on March 18.
The Kremlin and the separatists have recently referred to the occupied territory as &quot;Novorussia&quot; or &quot;New Russia,&quot; a term that refers to the glorious pre-revolutionary days of the Russian Empire.
Russia&#39;s Itar-Tass news agency has said Putin&#39;s words that a &quot;prisoner of illusions&quot; is anyone who believes peace talks are on the horizon as Ukrainian politicians launch campaigns before parliamentary elections on October 26 while government forces attack civilians in controlled areas. separatists.
&quot;In the interests of the people living in these areas, we must immediately start meaningful negotiations, not only on legal matters, but also on the political organization of society and the status of state sovereignty in south-eastern Ukraine,&quot; he said.
Peskov said Putin&#39;s allusion to state sovereignty was meant in the context of a broader autonomy that had been negotiated with the Kiev leadership for several months to alleviate Russian-speaking concerns about threats to cultural and linguistic rights.
Peskov said that only the Ukrainian government could grant the necessary autonomy to the eastern regions.
This is not a matter for discussion between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov said, &quot;because it is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but an internal Ukrainian conflict.&quot;
The Kremlin spokesman&#39;s intervention to correct the &quot;misinterpretation&quot; of Putin&#39;s remarks underscored Russia&#39;s leadership approach to resolving the separatist uprising in the east, which is different from the open occupation of Crimea, where most of the 2 million population belonged to ethnic Russians.
Moscow would also have much more difficulty annexing Donetsk and Luhansk in eastern Ukraine, as most of the 6.5 million people are not Russians and opinion polls conducted before the conflict have shown widespread support for staying in Ukraine.
The autonomy discussed by Russian diplomats in international fora would give regional governments in Ukraine the power to determine their own trade agreements and international relations, essentially giving the Kremlin de facto control over the territory that would connect the Russian mainland with Crimea.
The Black Sea Peninsula, annexed five months ago, is home to Russia&#39;s main naval fleet, maritime trade facilities and historic coastal resorts.
The areas between Rostov and Crimea in Russia are also the center of mines, factories and foundries that produce important components for the Russian army.
During his inaugural address on June 7, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko suggested that Ukrainian lawmakers - after the new elections - consider changes to the constitution that would give diverse regions more control over their finances and language status.
However, this vision of autonomy differs significantly from that of the Kremlin and the separatists. Moscow is accused of arming and inciting violence.
Putin&#39;s latest call for Kiev to treat the separatists as equals followed a further move by insurgents last week after Russian troops and tanks infiltrated eastern Ukraine from a previously quiet area along the Sea of Azov.
Separatists, reinforced by the Russians, have taken control of Novoazovsk with such force that the Ukrainian security authorities fear that it is a campaign to occupy a strategic coastal area as far as Crimea.
This hastened a huge civilian and military effort to fortify Mariupol, a port with metallurgical plants with a population of 500,000, which lies between Novoazovsko and a narrow entrance gate to the Crimean peninsula.
Poroshenko spoke at a meeting of European Union leaders in Brussels on Saturday, calling for action to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, a former Soviet republic that has been independent for the past 23 years.
&quot;We are approaching a point from which there is no return,&quot; Poroshenko warned.
There are now thousands of foreign military units and hundreds of foreign tanks in Ukraine.
The EU summit did not take any definitive steps - leaders call for further sanctions against Russia in the event of an unspecified escalation of the Ukrainian crisis.
Colonel Andriy Lysenko, a spokesman for Ukraine&#39;s National Security and Defense Council, told reporters in Kiev on Saturday that Ukrainian troops had to withdraw from their positions in Ilyaysk after two columns of Russian armored vehicles and 1,000 troops infiltrated the Donetsk region last week to supported the besieged separatists.
The first of 63 reported Ukrainian soldiers captured in Ilovaysk during the Russian invasion were exchanged for 10 Russian paratroopers captured in the interior of Ukraine a week ago, Lysenko said on Sunday.
Australian celebrities and Gabi Grecko are also involved in a scandal with revealed photos
Geoffrey Edelsten expressed his disgust at the hackers who probably stole intimate photos of his fiancée Gabi Grecko and other influential Hollywood stars.
Tinseltown is shocked after a series of explicit photos of nude Jennifer Lawrence hit the Internet in the biggest celebrity hacked scandal.
Hacker claims to have sixty photos with nude Hunger Games star Lawrence and other stars, including Kate Upton and Cary Delevingne, singers Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Ley Michell, and actress Kirsten Dunst.
Due to the escape from iCloud, personal films by Australian actresses Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovski and Melbourne actress Grecko are also reportedly released to the public.
There are 101 celebrities on the list.
Edelsten, who asked Greece for a hand last month, told Confidential magazine: &quot;It&#39;s disgusting.&quot;
All private correspondence and all private images should remain private.
It is a shame that personal information can be stolen and disseminated to the public.
According to reporters, Greece, who is now in New York, told online newspapers that the hacking was &quot;shameless&quot; and that those who became its target &quot;felt humiliated.&quot;
The hacker is believed to have taken thirty pictures of Palmer with his ex-boyfriend Scott Speedman, including two pictures of him lounging upstairs by the pool.
For example, Palmer starred in Love and Honor, where she was Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, TV star Chuck Strahovski and actress from the thriller Sucker Punch Browning did not comment on the stolen images yesterday.
Lawrence&#39;s TMZ spokesman said: &quot;This is a clear violation of privacy.&quot;
Actor Seth Rogen criticized the hacker on his Twitter account: &quot;Posting photos from hacked phones is exactly the same as selling stolen goods.&quot;
From a legal point of view, the publication of stolen images should not be tolerated.
Sigma&#39;s footballers won Léber, even without a win
Olomouc - The thunder and lightning that the co-owner of the Sigma in Olomouc, Josef Lébr, sent to his subordinates last week, seems to be a thing of the past.
Although they came from Opava in the end, they only brought a point for a goalless draw.
With their commitment and fighting spirit, they did reassure the club boss a bit.
Payout money could come to the club soon.
&quot;I&#39;ll keep one more match, as I talked about last week, but I&#39;m far more optimistic,&quot; Lébr confirmed, despite the fact that Sigma did not win, the players convinced him with an improved performance.
The fighting spirit and commitment we played mainly in the second half was exactly what I want to see from the players.
In that case, I am able to forgive for not winning.
If we played like this from the beginning of the season, I am convinced that we have not lost yet, &quot;Lébr thinks.
Sigma withstood the initial pressure of the home team in Opava, then leveled the game and was better in the second half.
After the victory, Kalvod&#39;s charges reached, but they did not reach their goal, so they could not win.
The result is not according to our ideas.
To our complete satisfaction, however, we lacked only one changed chance, &quot;said Lébr, who does not think that the change in the attitude of football players was caused only by his threat.
There were definitely more aspects.
Whether on my part, on the part of the coach or the fans, &quot;said Lébr.
Sigma must take into account the pressure
The players did not want to comment much on last week&#39;s events after the match in Opava.
I&#39;m trying to give these things away.
I tried not to admit it, &quot;the young goalkeeper Michal Reichl shook his head.
The attacker Václav Vašíček, who did not turn Sigma&#39;s biggest opportunity in Saturday&#39;s match, left a question on Lébr&#39;s statement from last week without any comment.
Eventually, however, he talked a little about the pressure.
We will always be under pressure.
Everyone wants to come at us.
Today we showed that if we fight and ride all the fuck, it will work, &quot;he said.
They took the warning to heart
Even coach Leoš Kalvoda did not hide the fact that the preparation for the match was not the easiest due to the atmosphere that prevailed in Olomouc last week.
It was hard enough.
But I think the boys realized it, and today it was clear that they had taken Mr. Lébr&#39;s warning to heart.
Even though it wasn&#39;t about not wanting to fight before, they didn&#39;t let it go, &quot;said the Olomouc coach.
It was similar to the first fifteen minutes today.
It took us a long time to come to terms with the harshness and realize what the second league is about.
That it&#39;s not just about football, but mainly about the fighting spirit, &quot;Kalvoda said.
We can only hope that in the next matches it will work for Sigma from the beginning.
&quot;I would really like to believe that,&quot; he added.
