Inflation in Europe jolled over food
The accelerating inflation measured in the euro area is due to the steady rise in food prices in the forex ago.
November price growth in the 13 euro area countries was above expectations, with annual inflation of 3.1 percent registered after 2.6 percent in October, the Luxembourg Statistical Office of the Union reported.
The official forecast was only 3 percent, Bloomberg reported.
Unlike the US, British and Canadian emission banks, the European Central Bank (ECB) did not lower the base interest rate with the fact that the reduction, along with the co-creation prices of raw materials and falling unemployment, would lead to an inflationary spiral.
The ECB would like to keep the inflation rate below 2 percent, with the sheep in their vicinity.
According to one analyst, the ECB is in an absurd situation: it must radit inflation  for it to do nothing on the matter later.
In Germany, November's 3.3-per-cent record is a 15-year record; in isen, it rose from 3.6 to 4.1 percent in isensko.
Inflation in the eurozone has swung upward due to soaring food and energy prices.
The term prices of the next-of-year price rose by 88 per cent, and the soy rate reached its highest since 1973.
Similarly, in 2007 it was necessary to pay significantly more for edible oil and dairy products.
The price of oil on world markets has risen 52 percent this year, and last month it cost one barrel of black gold to nearly $100.
According to the ECB, inflation will jump from 2.1 percent this year to 2.5, with the year, down to 1.9 in 2009 by the I.A.
Analysts say the 12-month inflation level in the next 3-4 months will remain to be capping at 3 percent, with the average annual rate of 2.1 per cent.
At the same time, they expect the ECB to cut interest rates twice during 2008.
Gallup sees government crisis
The Fidesz supporter's circle has grown significantly since the prolonged stagnation as of early December, and has now had the largest camp since 2002, while in the case of the Socialists the Gallup Institute has never measured the low  13 percent support.
In the case of certain voters of the party, the difference  over the determination of the opposition's voters would be more than a two-third (71per) support for the MSZP's fifth of support.
The MDF and the SZDSZ are below the threshold for entering parliament, according to the survey: their support for the entire population is 2%.
Among certain party voters, supporters of both camps are one percent more.
The public's view of the economy has deteriorated even in view of the previous low  it was never the ratio of those who coin the economic situation of the country in a very bad way, so high  41 percent, whereas according to the other 46 percent, the situation is rather bad.
Families assess the change in their material situation after the spring and summer's promising prospects, now in a more pessimistic.
As for the next year, more of the population counts with a more degraded and only a tenth of it with improvement.
In December, 71 percent of those polled judged the most of the Gallup Institute's surveys so far, that the prime minister is doing his job to the right of well.
Ferenc Gyurcsány is believed or is very much believed by 13 per cent of respondents, while for Viktor Orbán, the proportion of supporters is 38 per cent.
The PM is not trusted by 54 percent, the chairman of the Fidesz movement 27 percent.
One indicator of the development of the political situation is how much of the public believes that dissatisfaction with the prime minister is to be dealt with without a change in the government.
While the government and the prime minister were held to take a steady 35 percent after last October's unleashing riots, the rate is now only 20 percent, which is the relative (33 percent) of the proposal only in the call for new elections.
The interest in the referendum is significant, that 60 per cent of respondents responded to a question about their possible participation, that they would certainly come to the referendum and another 20 per cent say that it would probably come.
By way of comparison, the parliamentary elections held this Sunday, only 55 percent would definitely take part in, and another 15 per cent would have participated in the holding as likely. The success of the referendum would be unmistakable on the basis of the current intention.
olou would be told not 74, doctor's fees 79 and hospital fees 84 percent.
If we look at the same shares only in the circle of people surely promising their participation, then the introduction of the pledges, doctor's fees and hospital fees would be rejected by 81, 84 and 89 percent.
The most expensive is Auchan, almost a fifth underwrher up by Tesco
Hypermarkets in the Budaörs trade triangle maintained last year's 16 percent rise in the price level with the difference this year not to the increase in VAT this year.
article of the Napi Gazdaság
The usual Christmas consumer kg for Napi Gazdaság in the Budaörs trade triangle grew by an average of 16 percent this year, with the oos in all hypermarkets showing a noticeable increase of over a thousand forints.
The prices in the food supermarkets vy flew in the food supermarkets with it which last December, the percentage did not show up due to the high base earlier, and so drastic more expensive.
It is certainly bleak to the consumer, that what they could easily buy last year at a price of under nine thousand forints, he will not now do for ten thousand.
Consumer's Daily Economy in the hypermarkets surveyed exceeded the psychological limit of ten thousand forints by at least 91 forints.
The most higher price for the koch was 10,573 forints.
(In 2003 he cost a consumption kon of 6,800 forints.)
The price of Unica and the hard fish remained almost at last year's level, with the gy breasts, nuts and poppy.
The prices of bread and flour corresponded to the data of the Central Statistical Office, although in Auchan we found a kilogram bread for 139 forints.
Competition did not fence the price of the product under 200 forints.
It was also surprising in this shop, with the price of the 2-litre Coca Cola in the reversible bottle being under 200 forints, so even with the deposit the product cost only 257 forints.
Even so, this year, according to the consumption-dorrar daily Napi Gazdaság, Auchan appeared to be the most expensive, while Cora was the cheapest.
According to their calculations, the prices figure in the Napi Gazdaság consumer, in view of the prices last year, were up by 15th, given the prices at Christmas, while both Tesco and Auchan rose in approximate terms by 18 percent.
When comparing last year's highest, and this year's highest in consumer kenn's, the difference was 12 percent, while the increase between last year's lowest and the year's highest is 21 percent.
In the forintech, the gain averaged 1,480.
The average price increase last year was at 1,206 forints, with prices being affected by the increase in VAT last year.
It was this process that disrupted the trade, the department stores were evidently unable to decide how big the price range they should set for individual products, going to the point of predicting the effect that the change in prices would have on consumption.
(If the trader plans the speed of circulation of the product in question, it may lose a significant profit due to a price range adapted to the intensity of the cycle.)
Last year, the rise in the price of the consumer kíe of Napi Gazdaság was so extremely apparent, the price of the most expensive pricka was 1,720 forints higher than in 2006 at the discount price, while the cheapest price difference was 844 forints.
This year the extreme difference did not show up, the most expensive knah now costing 1,630 more forints less than last year and also the cheapest topping by 1,284 forints.
Comparing the two Christmas seasons, he revealed a disastrous rise in prices, in less that 20 months, the merit of daily consumption in hypermarkets was undercut by more than 30 percent.
(This, among other things, is not entirely absolutely confirmed by the Central Statistical Office's data: it measured, in the case of a few basic foods, prices that numbering 30 per cent over 12 months.
In addition to flour, for example, in the case of eggs.)
In the latter case, according to the consumer kna, according to the consumer horse Day Economy, this seems almost impossible, or the price level of the product, rather expensive last year, showed a price increase of barely above 10 percent, given the base and in the worst case.
The flour suppliers occupy their position according to their strong strong position when the egg suppliers, the drastic increase in the prices they have also managed to promote in international chains.
Hypermarkets in the trade gold triangle do not take a move, still reporting on a good year.
According to their experience, more than one of the customers in the three honoured stores are not interested in the prices.
They buy quantum of it, taking durable food by salvage.
On Wednesday morning, three supermarkets formed long queues at the cash registers, or the number of visitors soared.
As we know, the turnaround is the turning point in the countryside, a number of international chains costing research firms that the sort of thing is lagging behind even their plans, not only in the case of food, but also in the case of durable consumer goods.
In many places, they are waiting on disinfectants
This year, more than 1,000 cases of infection were registered in hospitals before yesterday due to inappropriate use of antibiotic use.
The sanitary conditions of the hospitals, the overcrowding of the bisoches, the overload of staff, are not helped by stopping the disease, says the head of the National Epidemiology Center.
In many places, they also look to disinfectants.
Recently, the trauma department of St. John's Hospital was diagnosed with an MRSA infection.
Anti-total-resistant bacteria were discovered in a man who went to the hospital after a serious traffic accident.
The patient was isolated.
A similar infection occurred at the same site earlier in the year.
The patient injured in a serious car accident was outdone home, he had to return to the MRSA infection with a non-surgery and due to a bacterium located in his body, one important surgery could not yet be performed either.
By this year's 10 December, 1,094 hospital infections caused by multi-resistant disease agents have been reported to the National Nesocomialis Surveillance System, said Karolina Böröcz, chief of the National Epidemiology Center.
This means that so many infections caused by multi-dresistant disease agents have been registered with security in hospitals, the others are not known.
Nearly two-thirds (683) infections were caused by MRSA, or methiciline-oxacillin with resistant golden staphylococ.
Bacteria Staphylococcus aureus (SA) is worn by a third of the people in their noses without a cause of the disease.
Infections caused by SA (e.g. throat inflammation, inflammation of the tonsils, skin infections, early infections) respond well to antibiotics and can be treated well.
If antibiotics are administered to an exaggerated degree or inappropriately, the bacterium well responding to the antibiotics of the bacterium develops, where it is very resistant to antibiotics and which is moving rapidly in inadequate hospital conditions.
Preseams in the event of the temporary or permanently poor functioning of the immune system in patients with a weakened organism, low body weight, or in patients in years, to cause serious hospital infections, such as an early infection or blood poisoning  sepsis.
According to the chief physician of St John's Hospital, there is nothing special about the MRSA infection, a similar infection is one of the daily practice in hospitals.
Inff.Infence must not be confused with the epidemic, MRSA is not only there, declared Tibor Nyulasi, where the presence of the disease agent is not examined. hirly.
Resists antibiotics
We isolate these patients, the elderly staff are sealed in rubber gloves and wearing a mask and we have the necessary antibiotics to be treated, ′olum, ′Nit Nyulasi said.
Patients admitted to the hospital are first trained to see if they are present in their MRSA organism, nor can the infection be avoided in the first.
Sampling is not in vogue
The vastroan of the hospital infections caused by MRSA would be to be possible to prevent, the current situation and conditions in domestic hospitals are not favourable for preventing the emergence and emergence of multi-directed agents of the disease, says Karolina Böröczová.
Jelikoš, this infection is characteristically found in hospitals and homes for the elderly, the hospitals in the reception of patients should be checked and the MRSA carriers are immediately isolated.
The collection of microbiological samples by Io on Hungarian hospitals is not in vogue.
This is also the role played by the National Health Heat Fund's non-funding of these outreheals.
Most cases are thus detected if the patient suffers from a insightful MRSA infection, said the head of the epidemiology centre.
The European Union has strict recommendations for appropriate antibiotics treatment in the field of humane medicine, and there are also domestic directives for the treatment of individual infections, medical records.
It is necessary to strive for antibiotic therapy to be targeted, or microbiological preposures should be carried out to prevent resistance to medicines, and to the hospital does not deliver this to all cases.
The samples of microbiological samples are rare for the basic or outpatient particulars of patients, respectively, said Karolina Böröcz.
etří mes with disinfectants
According to scientific evidence, MRSA is the most likely to be among the patients through medical staff.
That is why it plays a very important role as washing hands and the use of gloves and a mask, and the sheep, too, manifests in serious shortcomings in hospitals.
MRSA is transmitted by droplet infection and touch, and in the conditions of domestic hospitals it is not possible to isolate the infected patients.
The rooms, on the other hand, are often overcrowded, the bals are often very close together, perhaps from an epidemiological point of view patients should be at least 1.5 metres away from each other.
As Karolina Böröcz noted, we could also see the fact that in hospitals, which are in an unfavourable material situation, they are wearing disinfectants, there are few and patients a lot of patients who are getting used to the emergence of infectiousness.
According to Karolina Böröcz, where the necessary protective measures are being maintained, similar infections are demonstrably less or can be stopped by the disease's origination.
Government programme against MRSA
The healing of the MRSA infection poses huge expenses for health insurance companies, so it is being fought against at all.
In England, for example, the government has drafted a programme to prevent the MRSA, or to reduce its occurrence.
The programme appears to be a success, with MRSA infections showing a downward trend in England, according to the data released.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) ranks among its priorities for the prevention of multi-resignental agents (as well as MRSA), or hospital infections caused by these agents of the disease, among their priorities.
The police captain, only to cause a fatal accident, not drunk
The official expert report in the case of the Police Captain XXII of the Circuit, only to cause the fatal accident, is complete.
It can be excluded that the Police Captain of the XXII. district, who killed a pedestrian on Tuesday and who had since resigned from his post, would be driving under the influence of alcohol or narcotics, the spokesman of the General Prosecutor's Office of the Capital City of Attila Morvai reported on Friday after the expert opinion of the case was completed.
The expert report confirmed the result of the initial embiderment, which it was noted that the former police captain had previously, not before, had not been behind the wheel, had not received any alcohol.
The then director of the Police Headquarters of the XXII. district hit his own passenger car in Lajos Kossutha Street in the XXII district while turning the 55-year-old man's turn in front of him while crossing the roadway outside the designated crossing.
(The latter fact that a pedestrian was crossing off the zebra, according to the road rules, is not a mitigating circumstance, a turning car must still give priority.)
After being rushed to the hospital by a pedestrian.
Because of these events, the district police officer resigned from his post and was in a position to be transferred to the service, according to the police statement, therefore, that he was so shaken by the case.
The matter is carried out by the visitation of the Budapest-sovetnížnížnížnížnížníitel Prosecutor's Office.
Attila Morvai mentioned the fact that the former police captain had since the beginning cooperated with the prosecutors performing the posting.
Another €400 million for infrastructure
The agreement on three loan frameworks worth a total of €400 million to support the whole-of-a-secour, transport and environmental infrastructure as well as in energy was signed on Friday in Budapest by Finance Minister János Veres and Marta Gajeck, Vice President of the European Investment Bank (EIB).
In 2006, the European Investment Bank (EIB) approved a framework of €300 million for Hungarian budget funding for transport projects and a more publicity, implemented from the support of the Cohee Fund, with the parties previously concluding a €100 million loan agreement, and the contract now signed concerns the use of the remaining €200 million.
Thus, the budget financing of projects related to the totness of the year is the EUR 150 million loan agreement.
The EIB has approved a total of €300 million for Hungary for these purposes, with the use of the remaining €150 million to be made later, with the split of the loan agreement.
In the area of innovation, the parties signed a €50 million contract that will use the budget for the previous year's research-development project at the University of Debrecen.
The meeting was also mentioned about the 4th metro line.
The parties agreed that, after Hungary has agreed to the EU the details of the financing of the metro, the return to whether and how the original contract needs to be modified.
This, according to János Veres, could happen in the first quarter of 2008.
The EIB has funded a total of €8.4 billion in a total of €13.3 billion in Hungary since 1990.
The interest rate of the loans granted by the EIB with an eight-year waiting period and without a commitment commission is linked to the EURIBOR rate.
Bulgaria is the EU's real estate paradise
The development of the Bulgarian property market is a staggering  Europe's attention is turning to the previously slightly neglected Balkan country.
What, where and who is buying at the still cheapest, the fast-morning EU market in the fast-morning market?
Analysis of the Bulgarian division of Re/Max.
The most sought-after Eastern European destination for property purchases is now undoubtedly Bulgaria, with its cheap skiing apartments and seaside houses.
Of the mountains, the most in the course are the regions of Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitoéa, on the sea coast then Albena, the Golden Sands, the Sunny Coast, the ancient cities of Sozobol and Nesebar, and, by the Ieig more and more, and the ove more and more people are also looking for properties around the Cavarna and Balchak.
According to analysts from Re/Max Bulgaria, the interest of investors and the central part of the country  for example Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna  and more and more interested people are also buying in the vicinity of the cheap city of Ruse.
The capital, Sofia, is also a promise of tempting wiles, with commercial and office space promising the most viability.
Bulgaria is on the best path to turn into one of Europe's most attractive golf paradise, becoming a sought-after destination for travel in the next two seasons alongside the summer and winter seasons.
Predicting investors thus buy it in bulk, for example in the vicinity of Banska.
According to analysts, property buyers in Bulgaria are also trying to change their own life and the life-give style.
Most customers come from England, with frequent buyers coming from France, Belgium, Spanias and, increasingly, Romania.
There are also present Maltese and Cypriot investors, by the Black Sea and in the ski paradise there are traditionally many Russian customers.
Foreign buyers are to be divided into three groups, says Georgij Jankov, regional director at Re/Max Bulgaria.
The people of the residents are buying either renovated properties worth €50-100,000 or dilapidated old houses for €5-15,000, which they then renovate.
They are making good accessibility and the possibleness of communication, important to them is the proximity of the big city, the shops and, as a rule, a local doctor.
The second category is the buyers of the chat (Bulgaria was ranked among the first 10 German holiday destinations in December).
The third group is made up of commercial investors who buy in the hope of a rise in value in the medium or long term.
The increase in real estate in the capital is uninterrupted, or demand is increasingly strong.
While the highest number of real estate prices in the European Union are in Bulgaria, they have grown by 21 percent annually in the last five years.
The outrement to house prices significantly re-escents is in the rise in salaries.
Fodor and Hungarian's more than a percent
According to the information provided by the Minister of the Environment and Water Management, Gábor Fodor, the meetings of experts will be closed on Tuesday and the international climate rehearious reheimon conference will continue with the ministers' meeting after the official opening on Wednesday.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries in the world are discussing the Roadmap from Bali, which is being sought following the period of emissions reduction set out in the Kyoto Protocol in force until 2012.
At the moment, they are underway in a heated debate between developing and developed countries.
The United States, too, has announced that it now does not want to discuss the exact figures, although it is inclined to agree to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25-40 percent by 2020 given the 1990 levels.
The big issue in the conference is whether, in addition to reducing emissions, the developed countries will also accept the provision of both material and technological assistance to the countries reliant on it.
The agreement was also born on subsidies for developing countries.
The subsidy fund, set by the Kyoto Protocol, will be led by a 16-member management board, most than as part of the World Programme for the Protection of the Worsive Environment (GEF) to the United Nations  we can read in the journal Piac és Profit.
Hungarian's more than a percent
Minister of the Environment and Water Management Gábor Fodor, on behalf of Hungary, supports the EU's efforts to maintain a leading role in the global climate protection effort and to help the creation of a new international agreement by 2009.
The minister said that the EU is committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent by 2020 compared to the 1990 level, irrespective of the success of the adoption of the Corance after 2012 no-hitter, and is ready to commit to a 30 percent reduction in the event that other developed regions of the world, or developed countries, will be willing to accept the responsibility and commitments appropriate to their powers.
Gábor Fodor pointed out that the countries that joined the Kyoto Protocol in 1997 set themselves the target of a 5.2 percent reduction rate, with the then 15 EU member states pledging to 8 percent.
Hungary's commitment is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 6 percent compared to 1985-87, what our own will deliver.  is recalled in the press release of the Ministry of the Environment.
There is a lot going on in Bali, or within two years, it is necessary to adopt an international agreement on the long-term policy of climate change, otherwise its entry into force would be moved with certainty and in that case for 2012. In that case, the commitments to the reduction set out by the Kyoto Protocol would not immediately be introduced by a new system of emissions-reducing emissions, its necessity in its latest report also pointed out by the United Nations International Scientific Advisory Council dealing with climate change  IPCC, only that it is the recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize.
This would lead to a delay in emissions reduction and an inevitable increase in average temperature on Earth by more than 2 degrees Celsius, which scientists believe would have extremely serious and irreversible consequences.
British Army recruiting on YouTube
British military units are posting video-sharing recordings of events in Iraq and Afghanistan with them to popularize themselves.
First, YouTube is popular with British air forces (RAF): Special Forces Operating in Afghanistan have been uploading videos of actions against the Taliban since March 2006, the BBC reported.
The recordings, taken by a miniature camera mounted on the helmet, are controlled by the Air Force Command to control the combat operations in the Kandahar area and then be sent on to London, where they are transmitted to the internet.
Political message is inevitable
In this form, 139 recordings of British Air Force soldiers made it to the internet, and their kanálál′com, there were more than 75,000 people.
The British Ministry of Defence registered in the spring of 2007 as defenceheadquartersfielitus and publishes recordings of events in both Iraq and Afghanistan, while the British Foreign Office (Commonwealth Office) and international peacekekeies in Iraq (MNFI) have their own channels on YouTube.
Deployment in Afghanistan
The air forces have released the videos according to their original intention to recruit, and according to the Ministry of Defence, they are also good to meet the "iroliquor public with the real goal of the military's presence abroad."
The promotion published in this form hardly costs anything compared to traditional TV recruitment adverts, Defence expert Gordon Mackenzie told the BBC, swever, necessarily also carries a certain political message, or in a special form confirms the legitimacy of military actions decided by the government.
The Americans made the game
The army is causing the military to worry, in addition to the carefully groomed, censored recordings, also receive amateur videos, capturing, for example, the deaths of soldiers: in a slightly hypocritical, ofic-comfusional promotional film, that officers talk about losses at most, the gout of the fight is not being shown in the bloody form of the fight.
Indeed, many of the videos of the Fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan, which were made in sharp use, were brought to the internet by the British army of sheep, and now.
Americans recruit a little differently  with a shooting game called America's Army, which is free to become a free and in which the player can get straight into the skin of the soldiers through a more or less faithful simulation.
The ministries will have Christmas with raffle and pagáčky
Labor Minister Mónika Lamperth does not seem to be sentimental: instead of a Christmas party, she holds a final working meeting for her co-workers to say goodbye to 2007 with pogs and coffee.
In some ministries there will be a celebration with the music, in others it will conjure up the Christmas atmosphere to the officials with a raffle and a toast.
The party, the Christmas atmosphere, the concerts and the Swedish table  they are so entertained by the powerful.
The state authorities are also preparing for Christmas.
The most costly ministerial Christmas celebration will be held this year by the Ministry of Defence, which is not expecting its staff to do so.
At Christmas of orphans, the children of the fallen soldiers will receive gifts, at the Mission Christmas, the family's associates of soldiers serving currently on foreign missions, but also arrange a reception for journalists.
The resort devotes 25 million to the atmosphere of the year.
The National Development Agency (NFÜ) and the Ministry of Economy and Transport (GKM) will kick off against other ministries.
The GKM party is held in the centre of Jövő Háza, for a total of 4,320 000 forints and an approximate three hundred and fifty guests are expected to make a set of staff from the ministry's staff.
The resort will be to the celebration of Christmas traditions, but there will also be various performances and also draw a raffle.
The NFÜ Christmas cost 4,700,000 forints and was held on Wednesday at the State Justice Council (OIT) building  concerts and dinners were on the agenda.
Renting the hall cost a million forints, the rest was spent on more than four hundred invitees.
It seems that one NFÜ department is invited to our next Christmas celebration: here the company will hold the tender process, the Hungarian Centre for Economic Development (MAG) with EU money.
To this end, they rented the Vígszínház Theatre building.
MAG a. s. did not confirm this information, the driving we were unable to reach the next person.
Suit not needed
The OIT building was hosted not only by NFÜ, but also by the Ministry of Justice and Security, which held the St.
The OIT, in the afternoon, did not want money from him to use its halls.
The Ball was attended by five hundred people.
The party began with the minister's greeting, after dinner it was possible to dance to the accompaniment of the music.
According to the answer to the [origo] portal's question at the ball, the evening's dresses or suit were not required at all.
The Puritan Party is being prepared by the health, work and local governments.
The Ministry of Health is organizing a program and a celebration for staff for 400,000 forints in its own building.
Employment Minister Mónika Lamperth is not even officially invites coworkers to the Christmas party, no aristin's final working meeting.
One hundred and eighty guests are expected to receive only coffee and pagáčeks, according to the press release, so only 350,000 forints will be enough for the party.
Local government minister Gordon Bajnai, he and his co-workers will make a simple toast to the Ministry of Local Government and Regional Development.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) will hold a Christmas reunion, at which it expects 436 staff, in its own large hall.
At the Christmas party, he dedicates 2,500 forints to a guest  the total amount includes the reception with the Swedish tables and a toast.
Since he is Minister János Veres, PM workers have celebrated Christmas in a similar fashion year.
The atmosphere of the party will be absent, the official thing is amplified not only by the ministerial speech, but also by the afternoon time of the event.
The Agriculture Ministry is holding a New Year's reception on 20 January, with no ministerial Christmas.
The reception will take place at Vajdahunyadvár Castle in the Municipal Orchards and, according to the Ministry's memo, there are 1,000 forints per person for 100 guests.
According to the press office, this will be a very simple reception, to which only the more renowned foreign diplomats accredited in Hungary are invited.
These annual receptions begin with a brief minister's greeting and end in a small-scale comfort.
The State Department and the Ministry of Schools and Culture do not hold Christmas parties at all, the current press departments told the portal [origo].
The price of the resort's Christmas celebrations was not disclosed to the cultural environment.
In the case of the event, four hundred people were invited to a party held at the Museum of Applied Arts.
He's in the upswing for the giant strike
The colony of the trade unions of the League, or the National Union of Workers' Councils (MOSZ), will set up its strike commission to coordinate Monday's indefinite strike on Friday.
There is a protest public gathering on Saturday, on Monday  the day of the final vote on the Health Insurance Act – work will be stopped.
The action will certainly cause a significant interruption of traffic, because the rail service will almost stop completely and the Budapest Transport Company (BKV) staff will also strike until 1 p.m.
On Friday afternoon, the League will be briefed together by the National Union of Workers' Councils with details of the jointly organized Monday strike.
There will also be a strike commission of the LIGA  MOSZ, to coordinate Monday's action.
There is a public protest rally on Saturday, and from Monday, unions joining the strike will stop work of the permanent period if there is no agreement with the government.
That is, the deadline for the strike to be completed, which will begin on the day of the parliamentary vote on the Health Insurance Act, has not been set.
Should Parliament ultimately not adopt the Health Insurance Act, the unions will withdraw the call for a strike in an instant.
If, in the absence of a legal regulation, the strike commissions will come together and decide on a delay in the next procedure.
According to Parliament's agenda on Monday, it is also possible that the Health Insurance Act will be put to the vote in the late evening or night.
Because of the start-up strike on Monday, it is possible to count on binding interruptions of traffic: on the railway, the work will be halted for an indefinite period, in the morning a part of Budapest's public transport can be stopped and more than half of the companies called.
At the same time, half of the lane will also be closed in many parts of the country.
The call for the strike was joined by numerous unions and civic organisations, their listing is constantly updated on the website of the League.
Some organizations announced a strike for an indefinite period, while others announced a temporary halt to the work.
By Thursday afternoon, the Hungarian State Railways (MÁV) and the Independent Trade Union of Workers of the Rails (DSZSZSZ) have also failed to agree on sufficient services, yet more and more people are travelling on the start of the Christmas holidays.
According to the announcement so far, from the start of the operation to 13 o'clock it will be on strike at BKV, from 7 a.m. to 9 a.m. at Budapest Airport, a four-hour strike will be held by the LIGA Trade Union of Workers' Oven, the Education Union of Educators and the Democratic Trade Union of Education educators called for a two- and 2--8-hour job stoppage, the Education Union of Educators and the Democratic Trade Union of Educators.
The Union of Hungarian Physicians will strike alternately across the country, the Democratic Union of Health Workers and Social Workers (EDDSZ), belonging to the Trade Union Co-op for Trade Unions (SZEF), is holding a two-hour warning strike.
The most appealing of the four fadies formulated by the League is for the government to withdraw the health insurance reform proposal and to present a new concept for the public debate.
The second-guising is to make the new way of counting pensioners valid from the coming year to be phased in stages.
The third to ensure that early retirement for the renunate working fields should be made more important for the possibility of inclusion in the system before 2010.
The fourth reason for the action is that the Independent Trade Union of Workers' OWD (VDSZSZSZ), under the trade union association of the League, does not accept the offer of the Ministry of Economy and Transport concerning the trade-offies, and expects a different offer.
Political Capital: Hungarian Guard to raise the country's risk
The activities of the Hungarian Guard, founded with the support of the Jobbik Magyarországért movement in August this year, according to the Risk Analysis Division (Risk Analysing Division) of the Institute of Political Capital, have increased the political risk of Hungary and the whole region in several respects.
In wareness of the risk risk insistence produced by the company, it is written: in the context of the activities of the Hungarian Guard, the most political risk poses the most political risk that witstheous by the ever-existing ethnic tension between the Roma and the non-Romani population of Hungary, it may also be the occurrence of violent ethnic clashesomines in a short time.
The main reason for this is that the Hungarian Guard's political strategy is probably aimed at proving such an action  is supplied by the research institute.
As you write, this can be explained by one of the most negligent of the most negligent of the Hungarian political leaders: the public discussion on the Roma issue was left to the representatives of the radical and extremist political groupings who could have built a political strategy, f.
This deepens the problem, it makes it impossible to engage in normal dialogue, strengthens the extremists and adjusts the likelihood of violent conflicts  the institute reckons.
In addition, the activities of the Hungarian Guard, according to the research institute, due to the great attention of domestic and foreign media , largely spoiled the image of Hungary abroad, in the foreup to the faith in the stability of the country and its democratic maturityom.
The institute recalls: part of the reorganisation of the Hungarian radical and ultra-right groups, which have been receiving ever more publicity and vehemence since the autumn of 2006, it is that several organisations have formed in Hungary since the summer of 2007, which are called National milobrany-homies associations.
The common feature of these clusters is that they define themselves as civil associates, while openly preaching  and armed  the readiness of their members to perform defensive tasks (in the case of disassembling, assaulting the country, disturbing order), moreover, citing the incompetence of the police, the military, or the state, adds.
He goes on to note: this is done in a way that is sought to wrap up various political efforts built on society's opposition to politics and parties to civilian robes.
The emphasis on civility and the form of the association, therefore, in the case of these groupings, do not merely serve to avoid the legal pitfalls of judicial registration, which is also a political strategy.
According to the analysis, the activities of the Hungarian Guard are a factor of the habitual risk also in terms of neighbourly relations.
In recent months, they have pointed to the Hungarian Guard in several neighbouring states as a potential source of danger, the ultra-nationalist political leaders of some neighbouring countries, citing the emergence of the Hungarian Guard, want to excuse their own anti-Hungarian policies.
This should have an impact on the political stability of the region, he adds.
According to the research institute, the creation of the Hungarian Guard in Central and Eastern Europe is not an isolated phenomenon, so the political risks to the region as a whole have increased.
As you write, the activity of the Hungarian Guard is similar, for example, to the activities of the Bulgarian National Guard, which was announced in August 2007 by the ultra-right Bulgarian National Union (BNU).
The backdrop to the creation of the Bulgarian Guard is the mass Romani unrest that broke out in one of the Sofia districts (Krasna Poljana).
The BNU used this to establish the Guard with the aim of the organisation being National milobranaoming.
For the past 17 years, according to her, the former was the cican terror in Bulgaria, the state remained inactive and indifferent to the state, recalls the institute of Political Capital.
It adds that the initiative has sparked a heated debate in the Bulgarian public.
As you go on to write, the increase in the risk of ethnic clashes is signaled by the announcement of some Bulgarian Roma organisations to create their own guard as a sign of resistance.
Jeliko-drow the Hungarian Guard's activity to date shows similarities to the activity of the Bulgarian National Guard, it is not out of the question that even the Hungarian Roma will react to the threat in a similar way, by establishing their own militia, we can read in the risk warning drawn up by the Political Capital Institute.
When asked by the press office, Attila Juhász, research director at the institute of Political Capital, said: the risk analysis was one of the activities of the research institute.
As he said, they issue a risk analysis for a year and if they find out something that could affect the change in risk, they report public opinion, as in this case by issuing a risk warning.
Holidays are not all free
In Hungary, the days off are precisely laid down by law and has become a general practice for working days to move around the holidays, which is expected to be less than a few times in the next year.
In the European Union or in America, the holidays are not uniform.
The Hungarian legal system distinguish national and national holidays and the days of the state's work.
No-working dines with a larger, much-weighted ecclesiastical holiday season or important historical events.
We also celebrate the New Year's Day: the last day of the old and first day of the new year is a work day off  New Year's Day is to be able to take a break for people to relax after New Year's Eve.
During the year, we otherwise have a total of eleven free holidays.
The National Day is 15 March, celebrating the 1848 revolution and 23 October, the commemorative day of the 1956 Revolution.
On August 20, we celebrate the founding of the state, work on 1st and 2nd November we remember the deceased relatives and friends.
In addition, we have two days of Easter, Pentecon and Christmas.
Jeliko-swig, national or religious holidays, according to the calendar, rarely fall for the weekend, it has become a practice of moving a working day in cases that we would only work one day before or after a holiday.
The price for the long weekends is the one that we stay on the previous Saturdays on the job and the school.
We will work off the day that the holiday immediately precedes or is followed by the day that the Minister of Labour has been governed for years in a special decree by the Minister of Labour.
The legislation applies equally to the employer and the workers employed by them, to the public employees and to those in the public service.
It does not cover the I.
This year, the working rules will be changed by the days of the end of the year: from 24 December, the life of the country will almost stop, or, according to the experience so far, more people are working the days between Christmas and New Year's Eve beforehand curses the time of the I.
In the next year, several of their holidays fall to the middle, respectively, for the end of the week, so the reschants of the working day will be less than this year.
For the first time, the calendar is transformed around the Labor Day so that the workers can then stay at home for four days of taste.
Saturday, April 26, will be a working day so that Friday, 2 May, can be a day of rest.
The move is linked to the holiday of 23 October: work will be done on Saturday, October 18, instead of Friday, October 24.
The end of the year by the next year will be fully to be theth of the holidays, because from December 24 they will have almost a non-stop holiday anyway, that New Year's Eve falls on Wednesday.
est deterring the little things you can use to get your colleagues
The e-mails we forget to send, voice messages that we will never make, the innocent lench, which we almost don't even know: it spoil the eccentic days on the work.
The question is whether you get used to these minor inconveniences or put on your gloves and you will deliberately avoid the vague situations that others may upset.
Tips.
Sorry, I forgot to tell you that you were wanted from the marketing department, you'll be notified by a colleague.
Aren't you having a meeting for that?
In a better case, he regrets it and tries to correct it, or calls the marketing department and says he forgot to pass the message (that's less common proposing).
Most often, a thing solved by one apology is.
Before, if it would be an embarrassing excuse, it's a good idea to think about what you might be able to prepare awkward moments for your colleagues, and consciously trying to prevent it.
Are you borrowing something you're not?
There's nothing unpleasant about it when you reach out for a document or an office job or your phone, and they're not there.
Do you remember that you half-half the table on the table yesterday, but it's gone by morning?
Or did you discover on the table of one of your colleagues your pen, which you were seditious for the lost?
Don't take anything from your colleagues without permission, or they'll be rightly angry with you for going to be in their affairs.
Don't take envelopes or sticky papers from the office, because it's a mover to be uncomfortable when you'll run out of premature, and you'll need them in a moment.
Gossip about the private counterparts' privates?
There is no good talk to stop the more-witssing tales.
Who, with whom, what did he do?
Where and why?
You don't know about your report (hisdom) about your personal news about your colleagues' private life!
When one of them will share his innermost secrets with you, do not take away his trust!
Lock in what you have heard, and in his absence, don't discuss it with your colleagues, even when others know about his things.
You're rightfully reporting your absence?
If you call the office and, citing a strong headache, you report your absence because you are unwell, or you think you'd rather rest today, think about the job, the urgent tasks and the work that have a certain term, someone else will have to do for you.
Have a respect for your colleagues!
If you know in advance that you're not going to work the next day, or something that you'll have to stay for at home can happen, report back to your colleagues and managers not being confronted with your absence and the next day.
Stab, giggle, phone calls
You've been immersed in work, from it, you're in a rude drenched by a colleague's giggle?
Did you, in an owes, witness a telephone conversation that would have been better not to have even seen?
Don't disturb your coworkers by humming, chanting, loud talk (to them overhead), or stomping, incessant curtting, loud discontent.
It's for the best to be a rueful even when they're not being taken into any project (writing, planning, organization).
Do you blame the mistakes of the second?
If something is not on time or you have forgotten to send an emphatrably letter or message, do not blame others for your forgetfulness!
Do not appeal to the possible chaos in the office and the noisy colleagues!
Admit it, if you've made mistakes and someone's paid for it, and correct the damage!
Ask how you could put things right, correct the negligence!
Do you feel at home in your office?
Sweaters and slippers: comfortable clothes at home, wear on the office are not suitable!
Do not wear leisure clothes, even if the profession allows it!
Don't be sloppy, honor your colleagues and yourself by coming to the office in the runner's daymates, you'll  and if your profession is making it up, nicely and gracefully!
When a person wants to suit, you stop being interesting
A tilting in the usual morning traffic jam.
From the radio, there's a special tune: the sound of the violin, with electronic effects joining.
Adding volume.
Music changes the pace and the previous one's tin stained bass is added to the previous one's tin, then the congregation is joined as a real jewel.
On mr2 station is a song by the band Zagar called Wings of Love.
The domestic musical, long, did not motht-tight us with high-quality electronic pop.
Suddenly, however, the constipation looks quite different, because you are listening to the new Zagaru album.
The revelations of Yonderboie, a few new and interesting productions from the domestic digital underground slowly change the overall picture, and although it is back in vogue for guarrant with its guitar-bubbiting, even the home-grown electropop proves that something new is under the sun.
Balázs Zságer started in the Five-Temoric and he also played in Yonderboi's band, and in the end he did  he may be  two bagpubs can't fit into one of the chasers's chair - he went his own way.
With his project (Zagar) and music, which combines elements of jazz, electronic dance styles and pop, he began to break through, and when he was invited to compose film soundtracks (e.g.
the film Ferenc Török Szezonomit2).
His formation, playing in the early days of the smaller clubs, was recognized by its audience after wan2 magazine ranked their first album from 2002 among the fifty-length home records, and declared Zagar at Yonderboie to be almost the only domestic developers that could be saleable in the West.
Zagar and his band are without a doubt v course in classom, though of course they were not asked if they were satisfied with this label.
The band responded to how it was: they made a new, better album.
The now released album, Cannot Walk Fly The Instead, can open up new avenues for them, although the title itself is trying to create a sequel with the initial flights in the Five-Catter.
This is one of the verses from the track of the old band Balázse Zságer.
The reference to the etheric, flying would be in order, and besides the ethereal tinge of this music, it has now appeared  in accordance with the spirit, the trend of the time  the loudly guitar, the influence of rock and roll.
In these songs, the album's premiere in Millenáris Park was presented by the singer György Ligeti, currently working in England with The Puzzle.
The album was also produced by a real radio hit, thanks to the song mr2 Petőfi, playing popular music late from morning to evening, began to be wobled by the sweeping melodies of Wings of Love, recorded with six-six home singers (Underground Divasamed).
So all right (?).
Hvg.hu interviewed Balázs Zságer.
hvg.hu: In the context of this new hit, the question of how much does it remain what you play with marginal music?
Balázs Zságer: The definition of fringe music means nothing much to me.
To me, there are two different castes of light music; not mainstream and underground, not alternative and pop, but commercial and sincere.
Even the so-called alternative, underground music can be flat, they don't say anything, and it's just as much to be created just to sell it what makes it commercial.
Ill about a good pop piece to be free of a sincere inner need.
In this spirit, the attitude of how it is adopted works, independently of the language and the national borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see any difference in the openness of the Hungarian and foreign audiences to your music?
Zs.: In foreign, the day before us to the west, the light music has a bigger tradition.
It is not only teenagers and people in their twenties who go to concerts there, but also older.
They watch much more on the changes in the light music surrounding them, because they also command it as part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What is the role of the audience in your work?
Do you do on who, where, and in how much, listens to your music?
B. Zs.: Of course, it feels good to have more and more people coming to see our concerts.
But we've never made music for the market.
In our country, music is not born with a goal, but for some reason.
The roles of the audience can be seen in concerts where mutual influence works, but it is hidden only in the elffretied changes of the moment.
Still, I've been told that when you want to suit the audience, you've stopped being interesting from that moment on.
hvg.hu: How much are you going to follow the example of Yonderboia?
He works solo and he built his career asleep from us to the west.
B. Zs.: We don't actually go his way, regardless of how he does so, he sometimes tries to explain music.
We're sleeping team players who rely on the musical presence of another and let it develop.
At first, of course, it was no choice to avoid comparing our work to Yonderboie's songs, and since a few of us separated from his band and took a different path.
hvg.hu: In the topp toaster of mr2 Petőfi station, the track Wings of Love came first.
Many heard the name Zagar for the first time in connection with this song.
Popularly in style, you consciously opened up to the layers?
B.Zs.: We didn't plan to write a hit to sell the record.
There's more to that song.
We woosed it up as the album's final, which we tried to release the previous sound orgy and the essay themes.
hvg.hu: How did you choose the six singers?
Why is  what was the main principle?
B.Zs.: The idea was to create such a gospel choir.
Then he came up with the idea to put together this choir from the soloists of the domestic music scene with a good voice.
So the hooked mansion came together, that is, Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judia Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enikő Hodosi [Neo], Juci Németh - which we then rechristen the Underground Divas.
hvg.hu: Exactly that's how you mingled the song, or did the girls make a transform?
B.Zs.: The composition of it existed for a long time in an instrumental version, when the material was taken to the board, we thought that this song would be needed for this song.
A sequence of chords tempted him to be joined by a singing part.
I sang a tune on him that day at night, which was later taught by the girls.
It came out almost the first time and very spontaneously.
I remember how it was astoned, but of course it took the Diva.
With my voice, it wouldn't work that forcefully.
hvg.hu: Both on the record, it seemed like the girls in the background.
They don't have a solo (except for Judy Jay), they don't have a role of their own, they sing together, and they're not loud when the music is just not accompanied by their singing.
They were also standing at the back of the stage.
That's on purpose?
B.Zs.: That, which they were standing in the back, was only due to technical problems.
The fact that we didn't want to divide solo roles is, on the contrary, intentional.
Even the piece is about forgetting a little bit about our ego, where is who, where it belongs, and to just let ourselves be wings of the wings of love elevate.
I wished that this euphoric state that we felt when the song was born felt by others.
hvg.hu: With whom was the most work?
B.Zs.: During the music's composing, not even one, the most of the pieces were experienced when mixing.
For example, Dorian Grayls Inthels, in which I play the concert wing, or Rock(singer's Rock hasn't been asient to The Girls, where he has long not wanted to function groove, then all nicely slowly has come to his place in a jigsaw puzzle.
hvg.hu: Which song from the new record is your favorite?
B.Zs.: This is always changed by the concert and the fact that I have released the  record here in ′Itomor.
Now it's Prophet Is A Fool, Escape From The Earth and Never The Same.
The treacherous broker took a chance to make billions of inferiority
A treacherous embezzlement.
That is how the former employee of Jerome Kerviel is described by the French banking giant Société Générale, the owner of the domestic Komerční banka.
It lost nearly five billion euros to his cause.
But it seems more like Kerviel was just a big player who wanted to match his colleagues and certainly not incompetent.
Unlike all major banking houses, he recognized the crisis in the US mortgage market in the timely.
"He's mentally weaker," came the mouths of his superiors, who had sent him to the police.
But, as Kerviel's testimony, carried out by the French media, such as Le Monde, was a man who made €1.6 billion in profits from his deals at the end of last year.
Crises not only in America
"All I wanted was to make money for my bank," he says in his statement.
In the summer, he managed to make half a billion euros in the US crisis.
He sensed the opportunity at the beginning of the year.
In February, reports began to emerge that so-called sub-prime mortgages, provided to low-income clients or those who have had problems with repayment in the past, would be in trouble.
But the whole economy was not to be affected in this crisis.
Kerviel didn't believe it and bet right.
At the end of the year, its profit then climbed to €1.6 billion.
"Even when I made the first half-billion, I didn't know how to announce it," Kerviel admits, adding that he certainly didn't keep anything to himself.
Throughout the interrogation, he admits that he falsified the records so that he would not be found.
He even managed to fool the bosses, even though he became interested in his business by the Eurex stock exchange.
Risk was profit
He was afraid he'd come to him?
More like no.
"I thought that the simple fact that I made $1.6 billion for the bank would satisfy them."
Where did he take so much risk?
He had to work his way up to his position.
He joined Société Générale in 2000 just after graduating from the University of Lyon.
His annual salary was about $51,000.
Two years later, he was an assistant broker, and in 2005 he became a self-employed broker with an annual salary of $90,000.
Still, he knew he would never make as much as the others.
"I knew at my first interview in 2005 that I was being seen.
Because of my education and also for my professional and personal development," Kerviel described to the investigators.
But shortly after the onset came the first great success.
Thanks to the shares, Alllianz made a profit, as it was betting half a billion euros on the decline in the title in the bombings of London.
And that was the trigger mechanism - he wanted more.
As long as you make money, we'll let you go
"It's like a snowball," he told the cops.
But the bosses knew, or rather suspected, of everything.
"As far as I made the money, they were closing their eyes."
But then came the blow at the beginning of this year.
He lost a billion euros in a single day.
After the weekend in mid-January, he wanted to cover it up.
When he came to work on Monday, he no longer worked at the bank.
And the bank reported a few days later that it had lost five billion euros to it.
And how did they find him?
He became a suspect because of his vacation.
"I've only chosen four days in the past year.
A broker who is not on leave is a broker who does not want to be peered into his records," Kerviel concluded.
Czech Republic has a chance to raise 365 billion
Yesterday, Czech government ministers signed a total of nine operational programmes with representatives of the European Commission, of which the Czech Republic can receive 14 billion euros (approximately 365 billion crowns) in the coming years.
This is about half of the total amount that the Czech Republic can receive from Brussels between 2007 and 2013.
Approximately CZK 125 billion will go from seven operational programmes to the regions.
Czech companies will be able to receive around 100 billion crowns from the Enterprise and Innovation programme.
Most of the money, up to $150 billion, will be channeling into transport.
The Transport Programme is the largest operational programme and represents up to 22 percent of the funds that the Czech Republic can receive from the funds.
This money will be increased by the budget of the State Fund for Transport Infrastructure, which will manage the amount of CZK 90.8 billion next year.
The Enterprise and Innovation Programme is intended to serve entrepreneurs and businesses to raise funds for innovative entrepreneurship.
Companies should raise funding to introduce new technologies, for industrial research, but also for the implementation of more effective organisational methods.
In the current absorption of money from EU funds, the Czech Republic is still among the least successful in the newly admitted countries.
20-year sentence for ex-president Nicaragua confirmed by court
The Court of Appeal in Nicaragua on Thursday upheld the 20-year sentence for the country's former president, Arnold Aleman, to whom he was sentenced in 2003 for financial fraud of $100 million (nearly $1.8 billion).
However, he was later released from prison and lived under house arrest at his hacienda, near the Nicaraguan metropolis.
Whether the former head of this Central American state from 1997 to 2002 will return to the bars is unclear at the moment, according to the AP.
According to the president of the appeals court, Ileana Pérez, it will now be up to the prison officials to have Aleman served his sentence at home or go to prison.
The court proved to Alemán four years ago that he regularly moved the government's money to the accounts of foreign businesses in Panama.
These companies were fictitious, and the accounts were in fact his relatives and closest supporters.
Some of this money then ended up in the fund that Alemán based on financing his 2001 election campaign.
So they approved the budget
It is so.
The state budget was adopted.
What makes this budget special?
It is the first budget drawn up by this government and adopted by the coalition majority without the support of the opposition.
He passed this year for this year with the support of the ČSSD, because it was prepared by Minister Sobotka and the ČSSD could not afford to accept it.
Unlike the bustling debate before the vote of no confidence in the government, nothing dramatic was happening this time.
The Chamber of Deputies has calmly passed this traditionally overlooked, even most influential, law.
It's a paradox.
Every reign begins and ends with individual chapters and budget items, whether someone likes it or not.
The budget is an essential part of politics, but it is behind the government's power rivalry with the opposition.
This is more media-grateful and therefore pays much more attention to it in the media.
The guessing of politicians is much more interesting to the public than the austere figures.
State budgets in past social democratic governments have suffered from three ails that the 2008 one is unable to resolve at once:
The first is a high proportion of the statutory, so-called mandatory expenditure, which are not only pensions, but also social benefits, which were approved by the tacit "coalition" of the ČSSD and KSČM in the past year before the elections.
The second is deficit management as a result of the alau of the first.
The third limit is public deficit, i.e. the deficit of the budgets of cities and municipalities.
The biggest risk, however, is not the state budget deficit.
This is public and relatively under control.
The time bomb, however, is the budget deficit of towns and municipalities.
Many mayors, in order to get additional resources for investment in addition to tax, fees, and loans from banks, to often reluxately issue bonds to take inappropriately into debt to their town halls.
In recent years, they have managed to repay these debts by mass selling of shares in energy and other grids they received from the state in privatisations.
Now they no longer have this source.
If we stick to official and verifiable facts, we find that:
Our economy has been going through a growth phase for several years, as has the rest of the world, which is what the CSSD is constantly boasting about.
This was a unique opportunity for her governments to put public finances in order.
Instead, they were increasingly in debt to the state.
Other countries, with a few exceptions such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, were farmed much more wisely than our republic.
It is a huge embarrassment that falls primarily on past governments.
We are among the countries that, on a global scale, are least at risk of poverty.
There is therefore no need for massive social programs, which, unfortunately, have, in recent years, quite unnecessarily swelled to gigantic proportions.
Even if some of the nonsensical populist spending approved before the election this year has been cancelled, if there is no movement of the retirement line and pension reform in the near term, then in fact any policy in this country will come to an end, and whoever governs it will be just being held.
It is with little exaggeration to say that the ruling politicians will become officials, mechanically dividing most of the taxed money for pensions and social benefits.
That is why this year's budget cannot be revolutionary, but it can only suspend the push of normal spending by discretionary.
The planned deficit of 70 billion for 2008 would be utterly pointless if past governments did not do their best in the last decade.
If we do not really want the ruling politicians to become mere officials, then we must be patient and give this not-so-strong coalition government that realises that the state can only issue as much as it can obtain in taxes and fees, to be calm about drafting further reform laws.
Only these will allow for the gradual achievement of a balanced state budget.

Banks to Crisis to Solve
The Federal Federal Reserve Bank, the European Central Bank and the central banks of Britain, Switzerland and Canada have decided to fight the crisis in the financial markets together.
This will bring more than $100 billion to the currency markets through auctions.
In these auctions, the banks are auctioning an interest rate at which they are willing to borrow money.
The US Fed, for example, will send $40 billion to the auction, and make the next twenty-four available to the European and Swiss central banks.
This is the first time following the attacks of the 11th of September that national central banks have agreed to take such coordinated action to prevent or reduce the consequences of the financial crisis.
"This move is to address the economy's biggest difficulties, a growing lack of free capital that banks could lend," Bernard Baumohl of the consultancy Economic Outlook Group wrote to his clients in his report.
"The coordinated action of central banks reduced the likelihood of recession in the United States from 65 percent to about fifty percent," Baumohl added in his report.
Banks have already lost $60 billion over non-performing loans, mainly in the United States.
Analysts expect even more billions in losses.
"Central banks must really be afraid of what else may follow when they opted for this course of action," said ABN's chief economist, Amro Kieran Davies.
"It seems like the situation is really bad," he added.
Central banks are concerned that if banks themselves have difficult access to the loans, they will also lend a groin to their customers.
This would reduce consumption and send the US economy into recession with the potential effects on the economic growth of the world.
The central banks thus decided, after failing to reduce the so-called LIBOR rate, the London interbank rate, which is used for borrowing money in the interbank market.
This meant that the banks were still concerned about borrowing each other, even though the US, Canadian, and Britain's central banks had cut their interest rates several times during the fall.
"It will have the same effect as a further drop in interest rates," Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting told Reuters.
Some analysts do not believe that central banks' move will help with the crisis a sparse, because it does not solve the underlying problem, and that is the collapse of the US property market.
Klaus: Environmentalist debates are incredible
Global climate change is most likely to be damaged by developing countries.
President Václav Klaus again commented on the issue of global warming.
Criticism has now been brought down to the UN International Conference on climate change in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book Blue, Not the Green Planet, he said that the debates of the environmentalists were unbelievable.
According to Klaus, not only is the structure of the conference, which consists of a strange mix of representatives of governments and NGOs, but also the fundamental difference between the rhetoric that accompanies it and reality.
"The debate there is completely unstructured, it's just a fireworks of words that are a substitute for solving the current problems," Klaus said.
The Czech president, when presenting his book, stressed that its topic was very important to him and therefore is so involved for them.
He also expressed satisfaction that the book also appears in German translation, because, as he said, "I often encounter only caricatures of my views."
So now those interested can read his undistorted positions.
Klaus recalled that while he is not a climatologist, he does, in his opinion, have ample prerequisites to write such a book.
He is an academic, able to monitor and assess scholar the treatises, has experience in statistics and is also a national economic.
He cited the thesis that the climate is constantly changing as the main findings of the book, and its changes are therefore normal, that there is no identical view of all scientists to warm the planet, that the consequences of the current changes are not very large and serious and therefore do not pose a threat, and that efforts to influence climate development are unnecessary, ineffective, and unacceptably costly.
Moreover, as a man with experience with totalitarianism, he sees it as unacceptable for the imposition of unproven opinions on others, which he feels is as a dangerous restriction of freedom.
Asked by those present, he repeatedly explained that he was not against "reasonable protection of the environment, but against militant environmentalism, which does not take into account the relationship between costs and their utility."
Klaus spoke on the same subject in Vienna two months ago at the Hayek Institute.
Driver's license failed to be exchanged by 600,000 people
Six hundred thousand drivers have missed the deadline and failed to exchange an old driving licence, which expires at the end of the year.
Today is the last day for people to apply for the exchange for the authorities to still be able to issue a new pass to them by the end of the year.
But the ministry is not afraid that hundreds of thousands of drivers would travel on the road after the New Year without a valid authorisation.
Authorities say the card was not exchanged mainly by those who don't even want to drive anymore.
While municipalities report a downsing for interest in driver's license replacement, the authorities in the metropolis are overwhelmed with applications and interest in the exchange of the licence increased this week.
The city's magistrate is averting around 2,000 clients a day.
Queecks are expected to be around half an hour.
In Prague, some 140,000 drivers have not yet changed their driving licence.
The new card takes 20 days to exhibit.
However, it is possible to request an extradition within a shortened period of five days.
In this case, however, the driver will pay five hundred crowns.
Motorists who do not make the mandatory exchange of a licence by the end of the year and take to the road without a valid licence will face a fine from January.
The guilty man will pay a maximum of CZK 2,000.
But a police officer can also handle the offence by arrangement.
In the case of an administrative offence, the fine will be CZK 2,500.
According to earlier information, a man who was not going anywhere could have been fined by City Hall.
He was reportedly able to pay CZK 30,000.
The ministry previously called on the authorities to be mild and impose a maximum $1,000 fine.
According to the spokesman for the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka, however, no one is in danger of tens of thousands of dollars in fines.
According to him, the driving licence is a document for which people can decide whether they want it or not.
It's not the ID card that every person has to have valid.
People who don't want to drive anymore should give up their driving licence.
Just take it or send it by registered post to the relevant municipal office.
With the end of the year, they will stop paying the IDs issued between 1964 and 1993.
But motorists must gradually exchange other types of driving licences.
People with documents from 1994 to 2000 have three more years to replace them.
The validity of the cards issued between 2001 and 2004 will expire in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, it is about 2.6 million additional documents.
Court cuts sentences for detectives in association with Berdych
Former police officers Josef Opava and Petr Koňařík, who are accused of criminal association with the David Berdych gang, will go to prison for thirteen and ten years.
This was finally decided by the Prague High Court, which reduced their sentences, one by a year and the other by two years.
Originally, detectives at the Prague Department for Combating Organised Crime were at risk of 14 and 12 years.
Today's decision can no longer be appealed, only an appeal to the Supreme Court is possible.
While Berdych is also indicted in this case, he is only awaiting the first-instance verdict.
In other trials, however, he has already received sentences in the sum of more than 16 years.
That's all he can get.
In January, the Regional Court found 19 people guilty of participating in robbery in particular, the High Court today dealing with the appeal of 16 of them.
Most of the accused dismissed the prosecution from the start of the investigation, saying it was a fabricated case.
According to the Central Bohemian Senate, police officers, in agreement with Berdych, among other things, passed information to criminals from police sources, covered up individual robbery and helped gang members avoid criminal liability.
The gang handed in 30 percent for the loot for Opava and Koňařík.
The indictment is a gang's criminal activity from 1999 to 2001.
In particular, robberies, whose victims have often suffered serious personal injuries, but also about abusing the authority of a public official and illegal firearms.
In fact, in search of house searches, police discovered illegally held pistols, steel-core missiles, a laser sight, or a submachine gun.
The gang, according to the charges, cost tens of millions of crowns by the robberies.
In addition to the nearly 20 men in this trial, the courts have already found guilty of other Berdych robberies and a number of other people.
Other men from around Berdych are still pleaded guilty in court in another trial, some cases have not yet been pending before the courts.
The main trial has so far been avoided by Tomas Půt and Maroš Šulej, who are staying in Irish custody, awaiting a final decision on their extradition to the Czech Republic.
Child substitution bill: 12 million
For the substitution of children in the maternity ward, the lawyer for the injured families, Igor Veleba, wants to be compensated by CZK 12 million for the hospital in the Matter, plus court costs.
For each of the mothers, three million each, two million for their fathers, and a million for the children.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200,000 for each parent.
The hospital's attorney, Ondřej Dostál, therefore strongly disagrees with Veleba's proposal.
"We reject such a request, it is very high," Dostál said after today's meeting.
"But to make up our minds about the counter-in-the-bending one, however, we need an expert opinion commissioned by the opposing party.
We'll see if it has any of the anov-sovic value.
But we remain in the opinion that it will be in the hundreds of thousands for all," pointed out Dostál.
The amount, according to him, should be between 100.000 and 200,000 CZK for each of the four parents.
At the beginning of the case, the family from Jabloňov wanted one million crowns for each month when they did not raise their biological daughter.
Veleba served as the basis for the negotiation of the compensation expert opinion, which was prepared for him by the University Hospital in Prague-Motole.
The children's parents, according to psychology experts and psychiatrist, suffered psychological damage and stress at different levels and depths.
The stress situation was better tolerated by the men, although they were grave with reproach that they had not prevented the mix-up of the newborns.
Women, in turn, find it harder to cope with the news of the trauma experience, and the Veleba content has been summed up by what's happening right now.
Veronica and Nikola were replaced by nurses at the Perth maternity ward on December 9 last year.
Last week, the children returned to their biological parents - Nikola to Čermáková to Přibyslavic and Veronika to Libor Brož and Jaros Trojanová to Jabloňovo.
The Highland Commissioner, Miloš Vystrčil, handed each of the families CZK 100,000 in late October to reimburse the expenses they incurred by the fault of the Třebíč hospital being set up by the region.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are legally insured for liability for the damage.
In the event of misconduct, they must reach into the reserve fund, exceptionally they can apply for the assistance of the promoter.
The courts have so far awarded people relatively low compensation, with sums calculated according to the tables in the hundreds of thousands, exceptionally millions of crowns.
Polívka loses Wallachian Kingdom
Bolek Polívka lost the case against the brand of the Wallachian Kingdom.
According to the judge of the Ostrava Regional Court, the designation of the Wallachian King used the designation for the first time, the project was built by a long-term work by a team around Tomáš Harabiš, who collaborated with the actor.
Polívka did not attend the meeting today.
According to his lawyer, however, the case is unlikely to end and the client will appeal.
"The dispute is that Mr. Harabiš and his team are parasitic in the popularity of Bolek Polívka," Polívek's lawyer said after the trial.
According to him, everyone, at the words of the Wallachian Kingdom, recalls the actors and the comedian.
Harabiš has the same opinion.
"We're almost ten years behind us.
Getting money and inventing actions," he said.
According to him, the cause of the dispute is money.
"After years, they realized that the project was a success and could get something out of it.
They want to be a parasite on our work," he added.
Lucrative business
According to the court, the designation of the Wallachian king was first used by Polívka on his television show.
It was crowned by actor Radoslav Brzobohatý in 1993.
But it was unrelated to the intention to build a fictional kingdom at the time.
A few years later, Harabiš came up with the idea of issuing Wallachian passports.
The original recessionary action turned out to be a business and a lucrative business activity, which Harabiš then followed by the founding of the Wallachian Kingdom.
In 1997, Polívka agreed to give his name and signature in her passports and even offered their holders a discount on a visit to his farm and theatrical performances.
Who will take the throne?
The judge also said today that Harabiš merely took advantage of the bare idea Polívka published in a ring for his business plan.
"The popularity of Boleslav Polívka certainly helped the Wallachian Kingdom project," the judge said.
But she added that the soul of the project was Harabiš and his team, who devoted himself to it intensively.
The cooperation of the now-freveled parties continued until 2000, when Harabiš organized an official coronation for Polívka for Polívka.
Since then, however, divisions began to pile up between Polívka and Harabiš, culminating in the removal of the "King of Bolesław I elected for all time."
The leading role in the kingdom was then taken up at the instigation of Harabiš by the singer Jarmila Šuláková as the Queen Mother.
Then, in 2002, Polívka filed a lawsuit against Harabiš and his company, which was dismissed by the court today.
Clarity could bring to the dispute with Harabiš's forthcoming race for the throne and half of the princess.
A new king should come out of it.
Details and the deadline he did not want to reveal.
"We don't want to rush into anything.
It should be like the King's Ride in Slovácko.
The king should be elected for a period of time.
Even Mr. Soup can sign up," Harabiš added.
Test Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi: vorising prejudices
As a fact, I've never been a fan of the Peugeot 206 very much.
Its driving characteristics were not much, the quality of the gearing, the steering, and also the production could be described as sometimes below average.
But the market is now the successor to the Peugeot 207, and it's a lot better.
And the estate called SW is a little further along, and I have no choice but to think better.
When I tested the classic Peugeot 207 hatchback, I complained about the head space on the back seats, for example.
This is the end of the complaints here, because the estate's body means that even two-metre tallers will not suffer from in this direction.
Flying the world
I'll cross the interior very quickly so I don't do much of a repeat.
This is a fairly good design, where the only rebuke I have is for the poor centre tunnel.
Here I would appreciate a little more designer invention, now that the car looks so elegant.
The seats are comfortable, and there are times when we could complain about short seat cushioners or backrests.
The lateral line also improved significantly against the 206.
As far as the space is in the space, there is a sense of increase in the dimensions of the bodywork.
In the estate, the aforementioned lack of space overhead disappears.
Suitcases in the trunk
The main thing about this car, then, is his luggage compartment.
I have to evaluate this as very well accessible (e.e. also thanks to the tilting back window) and as a decently storable.
The deaf places are equipped with restraint rubbers, which are the ideal compromise.
They don't show, it can be stretch out, and it can be held up by heavier objects in the process.
But let's pause to consider the volume together.
This, according to the tables, is 428 l in the basic layout, which is more of an average value against the competition.
However, not against the best-selling car of this class in the Czech Republic - the Škoda Fabia Combi.
Compare 207 SW with the new generation of the teenager's product, then we find that Peugeot is lagging behind by a much noticeable 52 litres.
For a holiday abroad or when a pram is loaded, this value is even critical.
But if I had to highlight the positives, I still have to mention the floor completely straight down the second row backrest or very low threshold.
120 horsepower in four rows
Our tested car was equipped with a 1.6-litre spark-fruit 4-cylinder with an output of 88 kW.
And to tell you the truth, this is what a 16-year-old is going to look like, which drives the family hatchback.
It is quiet, has little consumption and, above all, it is pulling.
If I compare it to the damage equivalent that sometimes feels like it's stuffed with a rag in the exhaust, I can only be thrilled with it.
Price list will tell
The price of the car is not folk.
However, we must remember that we tested a nicely equipped car with a spacious interior and a very good engine.
The base price of the car with a fourteen-hour pm with a four-priced fourteen for CZK 329,900 will still be out.
Our aggregate costs from £410,900, which is quite a bit already.
The tested Premium equipment will then throw in the equipment for an additional £80,000 on top.
But we still had head airbags, automatic air conditioning, automatic wiper start-up, electric rear window controls...
Simply the car costs everything 51,900 CZK.
It's a lot, but count on the additional kit at the Fabia and you'll come to a very similar number.
So there's no choice but to decide on the brand.
Integration of Slovak pupils at British schools fails
There are more children from Eastern European countries in British schools, raising concerns among local residents about the further development of local education.
The integration of Eastern Europeans, meanwhile, has been hitting a number of obstacles.
British schools even register cases where disputes between immigrants and children of indigenous people turn violent.
The problem of integrating children from Eastern Europe at British schools is well illustrated by the case in northern Kent, where disputes between local residents and Slovak immigrants are beginning to escalate.
Arguments, bullying and brawls between pupils were also carried into parent-to-parent relationships.
The situation went so far that in Chatham, police detained a Slovak woman who beat a 10-year-old pupil with an iron bar.
The guilty defends that the boy insulted her with racist abuse.
Police also had to intervene after the attack by two teenage girls on a Slovak immigrant.
The girls allegedly made racist remarks and threw rocks at him.
"When we went home, a boy climbed to the bus stop and started spitting on us.
When I told him to stop, he lasheated at us with apples and pears, and then exposed his buttocks," the mother of Slovak pupils described another unpleasant incident for The Times.
There are complaints from both sides.
One of the local settlers even called the disputes with immigrants from Eastern Europe a fight for survival.
The above-mentioned cases suggest that the atmosphere in British schools between local and immigrants is starting to be tense.
There are 70,000 Slovaks registered in Britain who headed here for work.
Roughly 30,000 Slovak pupils attend British schools.
Cuba the most beautiful island of the Caribbean
For visitors, it really is an island of freedom.
Anything you expect from your holiday, it can come true if you choose correctly.
Golden and white-like beaches, high wool, or sea, calm as a pond.
Palmmas and all inclusive with waiters offering pizza, ice cream and heady cocktails on the beach.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the islands in the Caribbean Sea, you'll find this in a complete and richer list.
But you'll find much more on one island alone, and that island is Cuba, the biggest and prettiest of the Great Antilles.
Under the Spaniards, Cuba used to be a bastion of their conquest of America.
Columbus called it the most beautiful place the human eye had ever seen.
Havana became a warehouse and a treasury of treasures that the Spanish in America had embroiled and transported to Europe.
And then came the American era.
Hotel Nacional grew up in the very late 1920s.
It was built by one of the heads of the American mafia, Lucky Luciano, because everything that was a crime in the US (especially for Prohibition) was welcomed and supported in Cuba by drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Among his guests were among them.
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
High-rise houses were built up in Havana, with cars driving on wide boulevards that were among the cult symbols of the 1950s.
Ernest Hemingway bought a homestead in San Francisco de Paulo, a short walk from Havana, and had his yacht in Cojímar.
On the walls of Bodeguity del Medio, showbusiness stars and politicians from all over America left their signatures.
What about today?
On the walls in Bodeguit, Havana, you can also leave your autograph.
The bar of the expensive Hotel Nacional will mix you a cocktail as you wish.
And those cult cars from the 1950s are still driving around Havana, because the once-imported jigs and the Fiat have rotated in the salt and damp air.
Although Havana, especially its oldest part, is quite dilapidated, there are not as many beautiful colonial monuments anywhere in the area as there.
Other places are also transformed into beauty, like Trinidad.
As tourism brings much-needed money, its development is green.
Over the past fifteen years, new hotels have sprung up not only in Havana, but especially on Varader, on the coast of Holguín Province, as well as on islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba offers one more indulgence, which is unique in the world and is particularly appreciated by the trainers.
The twig of the vast plantations were taken to the sugar marshands on narrow tracks by steam and motorized trains.
Their fleet has not been restored many of them for decades, so there are working machines to be seen, with the peers of which are elsewhere only in museums.
Where to go?
The most famous places most visitors to Cuba miss.
And so there's not much to write about Varader, or about Havana.
Perhaps just to remind you that there is a museum in the aforementioned Hemingway estate and those who like this writer should not miss the visit.
The Viňales Valley One of the most picturesque corners of Cuba is the Viňales Valley in the west of the island.
Bujná vegetation grows from limestone bedrock.
Mogots, limestone homoes and rocks rise steeply from the bottom of the valley, and fertile earth has taken hold in their hollows, which also makes the weathered rocks covered with dense foliage.
The valley is where perhaps the highest quality Cuban tobacco is grown.
You can find its final appearance if you visit one of the Havana cigar factories.
Perhaps some find it interesting that the Chilean work of Major Zeman was shot there.
Trinidad
An ancient city that was founded not long after the Spaniards colonized the island.
The glory and wealth was brought to him by the slave and sugar trade.
Wealth was reincarnated into the beauty and display of a small city.
Colonial Spanish architecture, significantly influenced by later French settlers, has barely changed in four centuries.
Trinidad, between the sea and the Escambray Mountains, is a place so remote that as recently as the 1950s, there was no road that would connect the region to the rest of the country.
The isolation helped him stay away.
Nothing was built there, and that's why there was no shuffle, everyone was happy to have a roof over their heads.
If a person has more time than one afternoon at Trinidad, it is worth looking at interesting places in the vicinity, such as the beach of Playa Ancón, or the Sugar Valley.
In the evening it is to go to the Casa de la Música, which comes to life after dark and the music in it dwindle in the morning.
Baracoa
A town in the very east of Cuba is described by some as the prettiest on the island.
Certainly such an opinion is influenced by the journey itself.
The two roads that lead there from Guantánamo must cross tall and rugged mountains and pass through a nature that has hardly been marked by human activity.
The eastern outpost of Cuba was inscribed by UNESCO on the World Heritage List thanks to its undebland nature.
They make the best chocolate there, they have the Columbus Cross in the church (it was actually created about a century after the Columbus cruise) and from the hill, where the former castle and today's El Castillo are to be seen, the most famous of which is the El Yunque.
About coffee, rum, cigars, the Sierra Maestra Mountains, the Bay of Pigs and the Isla de Pinos Island, the Tropicana cabaret, the shrine of the Cuban patron of Caridad del Cobre, the sanerietia, the African religions espoused by the descendants of the former slaves, many pages could be described.
But, as they say, see better once.
Allies in Afghanistan are passive, Americans say
Few troops and the lack of necessary equipment are influencing the mission's progress in Afghanistan, according to the United States.
According to Defense Minister Robert Gates, NATO should outline a concrete plan for the years ahead.
The mission in Afghanistan is not under the view, agreed in Edinburgh, Scotland, the leaders of the countries that have troops in the southern part of the country.
In addition to the growing resistance from the Taliban movement, eight participating states are also discussing further plans and coordination of the allies today.
While the United States this week, through Defense Minister Robert Gates, called on NATO forces to become more active, the UK sees a priority in strengthening the authority of the Afghan government and boosting development aid.
"The development in Afghanistan is palpable, but military strength can only be one part of the solution.
The next is to allow the residents to kick-start the further development of the economy and security," British Defence Secretary Des Browne told the BBC.
Ninety percent
The activity of the Afghan rebels is the highest in five years, according to US military figures.
The number of violent actions has risen by 27 percent compared to last year, and by 60 percent in the southern province of Helmand.
NATO countries have roughly 40,000 troops in Afghanistan, roughly a quarter of them in the southern territory.
But according to the United States, the Allies have reached the very limit in the organization and the equipment of the units.
Specifically, they are asking for more helicopters, soldiers and experts to train Afghan troops.
"We will have to think seriously about the specific goals for the coming time and the ways to achieve them," Gates said.
NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop also spoke in a similar sense today.
"I'm not happy with what we have on the ground and in the air in Afghanistan.
We have about ninety percent of the troops and the equipment we would need, and that's not enough," De Hoop told Reuters at the end of the three-day talks with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who is passive
There has also been controversy among the participating countries in recent months about whether all allies are doing their best in Afghanistan.
Germany, for example, was criticised for passivity.
"The Germans have a relatively large presence in Afghanistan.
But they are deployed in areas where there is minimal violence and the combat demands on them are not as high as they are to us in the southern and eastern parts of the country," Gates said.
The British tabloid Sun this week called the German soldiers lench.
"Afghan loungs revealed: the Germans are playing while our boys fight," Sun wrote in the material, accompanied by pictures of German soldiers playing table tennis.
Germany's Bild went on the counter-attack and printed a picture of the British troops in a rugby match in the southern part of Afghanistan.
National debt to go up to trillion in 2009
For every Czech, the national debt is over CZK 84,000.
The total debt rose to CZK 842.7 billion at the end of September.
The government planned to borrow CZK 159.2 billion this year.
At the beginning of December, however, the ministry reduced the plan to CZK 152.8 billion thanks to better development of the state budget.
The national debt of the Czech Republic rose to CZK 842.7 billion at the end of September.
In the nine months of this year, it increased by CZK 40.2 billion.
Since June, however, it has fallen by 13.4 billion crowns.
The Ministry of Finance thus confirmed its data on the national debt in early October today.
For every Czech, the debt is over CZK 84,000.
For the whole of last year, the state was in debt by more than 111 billion crowns.
"For the time being, it seems that, thanks to the lower deficit for next year, we could only surpass the trillion crowns mark in 2009.
Next year, the debt should be between 900 billion and a trillion crowns," Patria Finance analyst David Marek told iHNed.cz.
Next Finance analyst Vladimír Pikora sees it similarly: "We could get to the top one trillion to exceed in the course of 2009.
Exactly when it will depend on the next budget, which we do not yet know.
If the situation on the political scene turned out to change, politicians would be willing to save more, it could be postponed to 2010.
But I do not anticipate this change," he said.
Dises rise
The national debt is the debts of the central government and is created primarily by the accumulation of state budget deficits.
The national debt is financed by Treasury bills, sovereign bonds, direct loans or, for example, loans from the European Investment Bank.
The state's internal debt has risen by 38.5 billion so far this year to CZK 719.4 billion.
The state's foreign debt has grown by CZK 1.7 billion to CZK 123.3 billion so far this year.
The so-called marketable national debt reached CZK 803.3 billion at the end of September and has fallen by CZK 13.7 billion since June.
The average maturity of the national debt increased to 6.5 years.
"The total debt year-on-year for the first to third quarters rose by 13 percent, which is really a lot for how the economy is doing.
Interestingly, the increase is generated mainly for bonds, where the increase is 20 percent.
It's wrong that the debt is growing, but on the other hand it shows that it will do what it deals with when the pension reform is here," Pikora commented on the data.
Better than expected
The 2007 strategy for financing and managing the national debt shows that the government planned to borrow CZK 159.2 billion this year.
At the beginning of December, however, the ministry reduced the plan to CZK 152.8 billion thanks to better development of the state budget.
The amount is mainly due to the state budget deficit, which will probably reach CZK 76 billion this year instead of the projected CZK 91.3 billion.
They are also planned maximum resources for the Czech consolidating agency of CZK 13.3 billion, a CZK 10 billion reserve for the disbursement of pensions, the financing of government bonds for CZK 43 billion and the repayment of loans from the European Investment Bank of CZK 1.8 billion.
A woman is due to appear at the court in Khartoum today for giving a name to a teddy bear
The British teacher, on trial in Sudan for insulting Islam, was sentenced to 15 days in prison on Thursday evening by a Khartoum tribune and expelled, as her lawyer said.
The British woman was accused of having herd to seven-year-old pupils named Mohamed to the teddy bear, despite the fact that any depiction of the prophet of Islam is forbidden.
She was punished with a whip.
This 54-year-old teacher, who was at Unity High School in Khartoum, Sudan, was arrested at her home on Sunday and accused of insulting Islam and rebellion, in accordance with Article 125 of the Sudanese Penal Code, after the parents of several pupils filed a complaint with the Sudanese Ministry of Education.
Our story begins in reality in the month of September, when the teacher in question asks her six to seven-year-old pupils to choose the name for the class teddy bear.
"Five names will be heard from the children's mouth, including Hasan, Abdullah and Mohamed," the school's director, Robert Boulos, tells the homegrowth.
After voting takes place in the class, 20 of the 23 children will eventually be chosen as the most popular name by Mohammed.
Of course Muhammad is the name of a Muslim prophet, but above all, it is a very widespread first name in Sudan.
The children then created a book for their classroom with a photo of the bear accompanied by the caption: "My Name is Mohamed."
The bear himself had no label on him with that name, but the difficulty is in the portrayal of the prophet himself considered an insult to Islam.
One of the Muslim Muslim colleagues, Gillian Gibbons, who teaches at the same school in Sudan, clarified that he knew her well and that she would never do anything that could be offensive to any religious beliefs: "I merely regret asked the children to vote for a name," he said, it was merely "innocent misconduct."
This is also shared by many pupils of the teachers, who describe it as "very attentive to their pupils" and add that"ever in the classroom they do not talk about religion."
Recall that the first name Muhammad is also the second most frequently awarded first name in the UK, with 14 different in English.
This first name often chosen by Muslim families is a way of honoring the prophet (often being given to the firstborn).
But what are the rules relating to the use of this first name?
For example, is it possible to put a toy?
Sure, it's a question of interpretation.
At the last round of negotiations this Wednesday in Vienna, they did not reach an agreement on the future status of the province.
In the end, failure.
Serbs and Kosovo Albanians ended the sixth round of talks in Baden, Austria, on Wednesday morning, without overcoming the different views of the future status of the separatist province.
"It is regrettable that both sides were unable to reach a status agreement," European negotiator Wolfgang Ischinger said during a press conference in Vienna.
His American counterpart, Frank Wisner, stressed that peace in the area was "at stake" and appealed to Belgrade and Pristina to heed their commitments to keep to the peace and to be ready for dialogue even after the negotiations.
"We do not expect violence in the near future, but we are entering a challenging period," he added, noting that "it is evident that the situation is tense."
Negotiations end on 10 December
The negotiaters of the Troika, made up of representatives of the European Union, the United States and Russia, will make the last appearance for Kosovo on Monday.
The future of the province, where 90 percent of Albanian-speaking populations, could be shown in a clearer light on December 10, when Ischinger, Wisner and Russian negotiator Alexander Bocan-Charchenko, are to hand over their report to the UN Security Council.
The talks in Baden, near Vienna, represent the sixth and final round of negotiations since the UN, in August of this year, commissioned the Troika to renegotiate.
The Americans and Europeans are counting on the talks to be concluded on December 10.
The Russians, who had earlier blocked Kosovo's independence from the UN Security Council, insist that the negotiations continue after this deadline.
"Russia has been and remains in favour of a solution negotiated, a compromise solution," said Bocan-Charchenko.
A unilateral declaration of independence?
After eight years of governance of the international community, the West sees Kosovo's independence under EU-enervoused as one viable solution.
Pristina declares that if the Security Council does not decide in its favour, it is prepared to declare independence unilaterally.
Belgrade insists on extended autonomy.
"Unfortunately, we have not reached any agreement," announced the president of the Kosovo Authority, Fatmir Sejdiu, at the Baden hotel where this "last chance" was taking place since Monday.
Hashim Thaçi, a former rebel commander of Kosovo's Albanians and the provincial's future prime minister, expressed regret.
He added, however, that the autonomy plan presented by Belgrade "is the history that led to the murders and the deportations."
"Domin effect"
Serbian President Boris Tadić, on the other hand, believes that the compromise still comes into play, warning the Albanian majority in Kosovo against the consequences of the province's possible unilaterally declared independence.
Belgrade is said to be particularly concerned about the "dominium effect" in an area that is still unstable as a result of the wars of independence in the 1990s.
"However, this does not mean to Serbia," he said, "that the compromise is impossible."
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation insisted that all decisions belong exclusively to the Security Council, in which its Russian ally has a veto power.
"The Kosov Parliament will have the last word"
"Ons for Serbia is acceptable only to a solution from the Security Council," said Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Koštunica.
"These negotiations lasted two years.
It must end as it began: on the Security Council."
To journalists, Fatmir Sedjiu replied that "the last word on status will be given to the Kosovo Parliament" and added that if there was a unilateral declaration of independence by the Albanian-speaking people, it would be "an agreement" with the West.
Bush won a deal on Israelis and Palestinians
At the opening of the International Peace Conference in Annapolis, Maryland, convened at his instigation, US President George Bush announced that the Israelis and the Palestinians had finally agreed to a joint statement.
He specified that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmud Abbas had agreed to immediately begin negotiations with the intention of resolving the 60-year-long dispute between the two nations once and for all.
In the presence of the two men, Bush promised to do whatever it takes to help them conclude a "peace treaty" before the end of 2008.
Meanwhile, Palestinians must destroy "terrorist infrastructures" and Israel must put an end to colonial activities, Bush said, recalling the obligations under both sides' "roadmap to peace, adopted in 2003.
The White House official stressed that the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority led by Abbas aimed at "toughetering a peace treaty that would resolve all hitherto undecided issues without exception, including central issues."
This statement includes three issues at the heart of the dispute between Israelis and the Palestinians: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem, and the fate of the Arab refugees banned from their homes in the 1948 conflict in the territory of the present-day state of Israel.
Abbas took the floor for the American president, emphasizing that the subsequent negotiations were "total and thorough" and to touch on all aspects of the solution, mentioning "Jerusalem, refugees, the border, colonies, the water, the safety, among other things."
Then Olmert spoke to the stands, expressing his view that the subsequent negotiations should be "direct and continuous" and that it was necessary to "add the way to make it closed during the course of 2008."
Bush identified the end of 2008 as a date for the realization of his "vision of two states," Palestinian and Israeli, the existence of a side-by-side vision.
Saudi Arabia has revealed that it made a commitment from Bush to this effect before deciding to attend the conference.
Saudi Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is a success for Washington, initiated a proposal adopted by all Arab countries that offers peace to Israel in exchange for abandoning all Arab territories seized during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis means "a crossroads in the history of the Middle East, especially because it is fighting the roots of the conflict and its central aspects," Prince Saud reckons in an interview he gave to an Arabic-speaking diary with the beamed Saudi capital.
According to the prosecutor, the police officers are not responsible.
What happened on Sunday, exactly?
As is always the case with such small messages from the black chronicle, the official versions do not match what is said to be among the people.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first results of an investigation by the General Inspectorate of the French State Police (Inspection générale de la police nationale), the police car was passing through the Louise-Michel street in the village of Villiers-le-Bel shortly after 5 p.m. on Sunday.
"The vehicle was not in the intervention mode, but it was on patrol and was passing at 40 to 50 km/h, while the side lights were not on," the police source explains.
The green Kawasaki motorcycle, "unregistered and therefore without authorization to ride on public roads" (read below), driven by two young men without a helmet, was passing through "very high speed."
"The man-hitt rammed the police car from the left side after he did not give way to the right," one police officer clarified.
A blood alcohol test on the vehicle's crew was negative.
The condition of the car (procured front, shattered windshield, broken bumpers) is indicative of the violence of the impact.
The prosecutor of the Republic of Pontois (République de Pontoise) Marie-Thérèse de Givry reacted very quickly and announced yesterday morning that IGPN had commissioned investigating "unsignal killing and failing to render no help to persons at risk," who is also taken by the direction départementale de la sûreté publishedlique du Val-d'Oise (respectations of the Val d'Oise Regional Police).
On the occasion of the afternoon press conference, the prosecutor said the IGPN-led investigations were ruling out, at this stage, the responsibility of the officers for the accident.
Three witnesses to the accident, who were interviewed on Sunday evening, confirmed "a police officer's version, that the mini-father approached them quite quickly from the left."
A groove, no doubt caused by the friction of the cliphesen on the ground, showed yesterday that both vehicles remained wedged until the police car was able to brake.
The vehicles were secured and will be through technical expertise.
An autopsy was performed on the bodies of the two victims yesterday.
What happened, right after that?
Yesterday, in Villiers-le-Bel, talk of being quickly spread among the people that officers were to leave the scene of the crime quickly without giving the two young men first aid.
The IGPN should have, in all cautioned, also ruled out "any serious wrongdoing" at this point.
"It is a more challenging aspect of the investigation, which requires more searches and with which you need to be very careful," the police source said.
The daily "Libération" met an eyewitness for the few moments that followed the accident.
One of his windows runs right where the accident took place.
"Immediately, along with my cousin, who is a nurse in the hospital, we rushed down to try to resurrect them," the witness tells us.
We couldn't do anything."
Then he saw "the limping, a completely terrified policeman.
Two others were trying to resurrect one of the young men, and the fourth spoke on the phone.'
In the face of the rapidly mounting tension and the certainty of the youngsters' situation that the situation of the youngsters was hopeless, the officers were taken by the car of a colleague who had arrived at the scene in the meantime.
According to the same witness, the ambulance arrived "about twenty minutes after the officers left."
They also performed CPR, but to no avail.
"Let no one say that the police authorities did not help the youths.
These young men were given first aid.
Firefighters arrived at once.
Everything was done to save them," the prosecutor pointed out.
Tensions rise in Pakistan
On Monday, Pakistani police suppressed the first demonstrations since the declaration of exceptional condition by General Musharraf, two days before.
In the city of Lahor, in the east of the country, about 2,000 lawyers demonstrating against measures taken as part of an exceptional state, tear gas grenades were injured, which witnesses say used by the riot police.
The latter responded with stones, injuring several police officers.
At least 350 lawyers have been summoned.
Similar scenarios to scenarios in Karachi and Rawalpindi, where officers attacked and injured lawyers.
Several were to be summoned.
In Islamabad, Supreme Court attorneys called for a general strike and announced demonstrations, as a result of a wave of about 500 arrests of opponents, human rights activists and lawyers over the weekend.
Access streets to the Supreme Court were barricades barricades on Monday morning to prevent a rally.
Other demonstrations were to take place in Multan (centre) and Pesharov (Northwest).
On Monday, the movement of lawyers received the support of religious parties grouped in the politically strong Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal alliance, whose president "fear the population to send flowers to the judges who oppose the exceptional state of affairs, and the garbage to those who were sworn in from Musharraf."
"Musharaf's promise doesn't apply"
Pakistan's Supreme Court is the direct target of an emergency measure announced Saturday night.
In the coming days, he was to comment on the legality of President Musharraf's re-election in the indirect presidential election on 6 October.
The president of the court, Iftikhhar Mohammad Chaudhry, was removed and replaced.
"All we are seeing is unlawful, unconstitutional and against Supreme Court rulings," the official said in The News.
Pervez Musharraf's promise to resign the leadership of the army and become a civilian president," he is not)plated" after the introduction of the exceptional state, Deputy Information Minister Tariq Azeem said on Monday.
He was expected to be re-encouped by November 15, when his first presidential mandate was ending.
The Deputy Minister of Information also confirmed that the January elections could be postponed.
The Pakistani government has otherwise also refuted speculation in the country that the deputy head of the army should have ordered President Musharraf to be grounded.
More than a third of pregnancy is still made up of pregnancy
This calculation includes pregnancy unworavable (24%) as well as misman-planned or occurred in an unexpected manner.
More than one pregnancy out of three (36%) is still unexpected today, reveals a study led by the French National Institut national d'études démographiques (Ined)- the State Institute of Demographic Studies, forty years after the adoption of the so-called Neuwirth Act, which enacted contraception in France.
This calculation includes pregnancy unworavable (24%) as well as misman-planned or occurred in an unexpected manner.
Different methods of contraception, such as hormonal contraceptives or sterilization, still show a rate of 5% to 6% of the failure rate, Ined estimates.
The introduction of contraception allowed for better "fatal control," the institute argues, noting that the rate of use of hormonal contraceptives in women between the ages of 20 and 44 was from 5% in 1970 to 60% today.
Finally, eight of the births out of ten are now well planned.
One pair in five even have a birth calculated to be accurately and preferably in the spring, which is considered the most pleasant time of year for the birth of a child.
Remistable repair of space station
For more than seven hours of work in space, astronaut Scott Parazynski and members of his crew from the International Space Station (ISS) needed to repair the torn solar panel, necessary for the station's further scientific work.
It was a risky space climb that racked up records in terms of duration, the distance from the living-developers, the speed with which the "cute" was planned, and the "cute" rate the astronauts had spent on the repair.
Trouble arose on Tuesday, while the astronauts from the ship Discovery unloaded the Harmony module, a large cylindrical formation designed to install a European and Japanese science laboratory (see box).
This module is a kind of landing pier for the modules-laboratory.
However, these need to be supplied with electricity.
The crew's second task, therefore, was to move the 17-and-a-half-tonne module producing electricity using solar panels, which was already on the ISS, so as to anchor at its final post.
After moving it, the crew began to lay out the module's sixty-seven-sear solar panels.
And in that, one of the panels, decomposing like a tractor-touration harmonica, as a result of the cable's seals, was damaged on the surface of nearly one metre.
The decomposing was suspended to prevent further damage to the panel.
The astronauts who were originally scheduled to perform a control ascent of the ship Discovery, and then go to repair another solar panel whose rotation system was malfunctioning, were forced to devote themselves to the damaged panel.
And it was Scott Parazynski who was chosen to go fly to the end of the ship's robotic arm, which was charged to the station's shoulder, and it was repaired.
He is one of the best "spacewalkers" (space walker) of the Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).
Tall, sturdy, very dexterous, has a very elaborate chest and long arms.
At the age of 46, this original profession was commissioned by the doctor to "operate" the "pork-sat" solar panel.
After examining the damage in detail, he cut off the faulty cable and fastened a "lead" to the damaged areas.
He was assisted by a second "spacewalker" who remained near the compensation chamber, as well as from the inside, by the other astronauts, among them Peggy Witson, the crew commander.
The instruments he used, a mini-hockey-weary denser encapitated with an insulating device to prevent an electroshock on solar panels producing several hundred volts, invention and "after the houtillul" made by astronauts on board the station.
After the surgery, Scott Parazynski waited until the panel was completely laid out and then zinventarized his tools and returned to the interior of the station.
Yesterday afternoon, the astronauts enjoyed a half-day rest before today, when seven astronauts return to the ship Discovery to return to Earth on Wednesday, as scheduled are scheduled to return to Earth.
EADS shares weaken
EADS shares are losing appreciably on the Paris Stock Exchange, after the company operating in the Aeronautc and Defence industry announced that it would have to spend between €1.2 and €1.4 billion to face a delay in the A400M.
EADS lost 4% and is now on the Paris Stock Exchange at 21.96 euros.
The financial group was forced to re-evaluate its projected production results for 2007 as a result of delays arising from the slow progression of the advance of the development of the A400M engine, which is a precondition for the inaugural flight.
The price for easing delays in the supply of a military cargo aircraft, announced in October, was valued "to €1.2 to €1.4 billion, of which more than a billion for Airbus," the parent company of the European designer EADS announced.
Because of these costs, EADS, next Thursday, at the presentation of its quarterly results, will be forced to announce a new profit outlook before interest and tax deduction (EBIT) was required to announce a new profit outlook (EBIT).
The group also revealed that the new cost estimate would be six months late.
Recall that EADS's production results in 2006 fell by 86% mainly due to the costs associated with the delay of another programme, the giant A380 aircraft.
Initially, the group had expected to provide the first delivery of the A400M to the French military in October 2009.
Decision for status quo
Sunday's election will take place without a tight expectation: the Russians will overwhelmingly elect the party of President Putin, the United Russia.
Confirming so, after the end of the very few free election campaigns, their gravitate towards stability, even to authoritarianism.
Today, three days before the House of Commons elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin will tell voters on public-law stations a pre-declare TV message, the content of which is being kept secret.
It is the leader of the United Russia, the pro-Kremlin party, which is expected to celebrate a landslide victory.
When he received the ambassadors of foreign states yesterday, the president let nothing out of him and contented himself with another attack on the West accused of meddling - his favorite topic during the campaign.
"We know the price of true democracy and want an honest, as transparent and open election as possible, an election without the slightest flaw in the beauty," he added.
In the eyes of the opposition, this is not nearly so.
They condemn the campaign marked by various pressures.
Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov says that "never passed such a dirty election, even under Yelcino."
After the repression accompanying the demonstrations of last weekend, former world chess champion Garry Kasparov, sentenced to five days in prison for an illegal demonstration, according to his a fouement, he continues to be banned from visiting.
"Rusov remained with homo sovietica mentality"
In the background of these parliamentary elections of simple tense anticipation, two far more open questions are profiled:
"Who will become Putin's successor in the presidency?
The official paper yesterday published the date of the first round of the presidential election, 2 March 2008; the candidates may present themselves to the public by 23 December.
Vladimir Putin, elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, cannot seek a third mandate in a row.
But no follower appears.
- "What role will Putin play after March?"
Will he be prime minister?
Or the head of the parliamentary majority and the almighty United Russia party that chooses the government and the president?
Either way, the outgoing ruling power will win the entire line in the parliamentary elections, as will the presidential election.
It's a tradition.
"The Russians have been left with the homo sovietica mentita, he does not feel like the masters of his fate," believes sociologist Lev Gudkov, director of the independent center of Levada.
Historian Nikolai Koharya, of the State University of Sankt-Petěrburg, notices more temporally distant connections: civil society has picked up, Christian-Christian five centuries across Europe in this country, a delay; the famous common spirit has delayed the shaping of individualism.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, "Putin followed up on the paternalistic model of the state, perfectly accepted by the population, all the more so because this new paternalism did not accompany terror, but a certain economic welfare," believes Maria Lipman of the Carnegie Foundation.
The Russians are today "voluntarily relinquished personal responsibility" that they briefly demonstrated after the collapse of the USSR.
"Wheel to think?"
This phenomenon applies to all social classes, including the business world.
Even the clerical elite intends to maintain the status quo: 65 governors (from a total of 85 heads of the Russian regions) run the local candidates of the United Russia.
New freedoms taken from the West are often, as in the 1990s, synonymous with chaos.
Public opinion prefers stability.
Also in the name of stability, the Russians will not vote for extremists.
Conclusion by Tamara Čerednchenko, a 54-year-old professor: "Why think about it?
Those in power aren't so bad, so why change them?"
Loaned memory
After more than sixty years in a confidential regime, the Nazi archives of Bad Arolsen, which depict the fates of the 17.5 million victims of Hitler's regime, are being opened to the public.
The 47 million archive documents stored for a period of 27 km in the length of 27 km in Bad Arolsen (Hesse) were, until this time, accessible only to the "humanitarian" purpose, that is to say, individually and in name, upon request of the former victim or its authorized persons.
Eleven states in charge of the archives - including Germany, France, Israel, and the United States - agreed in May to open them to scientists and historians.
As the process of ratifying this agreement by all states is over, the opening took effect yesterday.
Sensitive information
The free access of historians to Bad Arolsen will allow the exploration of "especially the movement of prisoners, the population of camps and the state of the forcibly working," explains Reto Meistern, director of these archives, directed by the International Committee of the Red Cross (Comité international de la Croix-rouge).
Until recently, several states, among them Germany, were against making these nominal documents available to the public, because of the sensitive nature of some of the information.
What are the presumed homosexuality or mental disability of some victims of deportation.
The registries of concentration camps or the arrest warrants drawn up by the Gestapo were collected after the war for the practical purpose of finding deported or forced labour subjected to civic citizens, to provide them with evidence of their confinement to open the way for their compensation.
Even today, more than 300 permanent staff in Bad Arolsen are engaged in tens of thousands of individual applications.
However, for part of the scientific community, access to Bad Arolsen represents only a limited contribution.
"We cannot expect anything fundamentally new from these documents," said Prof. Wolfgang Benz, director of the Centre for the Study of Anti-Semitism in Berlin's Technische Universität, in 2006.
EU and India to reach free trade agreement in 2008
At present, bilateral trade between Europe and India is already spending nearly €60 billion a year.
The EU is India's first trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The European Union and India are awaiting the signing of a free trade treaty in 2008, announced European Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart Kamal Nath.
In April last year, EU foreign ministers gave the green light to the European Commission to begin negotiations to sign the Caucms de libre échange, ALE with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean). Bilateral trade between Europe and India is already spending nearly €60 billion a year.
The EU is India's first trading partner and represents 18% of its foreign trade.
The EU is also its first foreign investor, but India is, according to the European Commission, up to the ninth EU trading partner.
"The FTA will give a tremendous boost to both economies" and "India will gain better market access to the market of 450 million prosperous Europeans," said Peter Mandelson.
Europe is the first or second market for each of the first ten products exported by India, the European Commissioner clarified. The Asian and European giants exchange "47 billion euros in goods" and "ten billion euros in service" a year, said this week Danièle Smadja, head of the European Commission's delegation in New Delhi, regretting that bilateral trade "is not the full potential of it." The EU and India will meet on Friday at the eighth joint diplomatic summit in New Delhi, attended by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and European Commission President José Manuel Durao Barroso.

Bank of England takes note of fears and offered £10bn in a five-week auction
The Bank of England signaled on Thursday that it intends to alleviate the current fears that the credit market conditions would deteriorate again and announced an offer of £10 billion in a five-week-week auction at a base rate of 5.75%, an offer valid for an unusually long time.
"In an attempt to ease concerns that conditions in the financial markets will be very unfavourable at the end of the year and give banks more certainty about the way in which to secure their cash position for this period, the Bank intends to offer a significant part of its planned reserve during the maintenance period, which will start on 6 December in the form of a five-week open market operation," the Bank announced in a communiqué.
The Bank specifies that £10 billion (€14 billion) will be placed on the financial market on 6 December at 12.15 GMT until 10 January, at the base rate.
This seems to be the first time the BOE has been pumping cash into the financial market in a five-week open-market operation.
Normally, they last a week.
The BOE adds in its communiqué that it "stays ready to take further measures to maintain the interest rates on a day's basis" of interchange-based loans at the same level with its base rate.
The inter-dimatroch rate was 5.829% on Wednesday.
The three-month interest rate was set at 6.6%, the highest figure since September 18.
Since the start of the summer financial crisis, the sums placed on the financial market by the English Bank, coupled with the fee rates that discerounced the banks from using this offer.
According to some speculation reinforced by the evolution of the pound's exchange rate against the euro, many preferred to opt for the sums placed on the financial market by the European Central Bank at lower rates and more guaranteed discretion.
UMP (Union pour un mouvement populaire, the Union for the Popular Movement) and NC (Nouveau Centre, New Centre) refuse to address the Socialists' (PA) proposals for the purchase of
The UMP and Nouveau Centre refused to discuss the various paragraphs of the Socialist draft law on the purchase, which amounts to the rejection of the text.
The text of the bill was on the agenda under the so-called socialist "runner" (measured by the individual MP) and included a dozen measures adopted on Tuesday by the presidency of the PA, which included an increase in the employment premium by 50%, the renewal of fluctuating TIPP, the transport cheque or the rent regulation.
As the UMP and NC voted against the debate of the various paragraphs (180 votes against 115), the session was concluded after a general debate that became an opportunity to exchange opinion, sometimes more lively, between the majority and the opposition, a few hours before Nicolas Sarkozy's televised appearance.
PS deputy leader Jean-Marc Ayrault announced that his club would re-submend these proposals in their entirety in the form of amendments to the Finance Amendment Bill to be debated by the House next week.
The new festival is being born
As a result of much speculation that C3 Presents is setting up a new festival in Philadelphia, this promoter/producer of the Vineland Festival in New Jersey has announced in collaboration with Fester Republic by British organizer Melvin Benn.
"It is an honour for our company to work with a person who has inspired the current festival movement in America without exaggeration," revealed to C3's Charlie Jones from Billboard.com.
C3 produces the Lollapalooza and Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, New Jersey, is a summer destination for campers.
The festival is expected to take place from 8 to 10 August at a private 500-acre farm, about 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
The director of the Republic festival, formerly known as Mean Fiddler, one of the world's most respected festival organizers.
In 1989, he took the helm of the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom, which attracts 80,000 people each year.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added to his Leeds Festival portfolio, and in 2006 the Festival Republic founded the Latitude Festival in Henham Park in Suffolk.
Starting in 2002, Melvin Benn, as a co-owner, is also in charge of the production, licenses and organizing tasks at the Glastonbury Festival, which today has a capacity of up to 177,500 people.
Charlie Jones of the C3 calls Glastonbury the "most inspiring event" he has ever seen and says that his firm and Melvin Benna's company are working simultaneously to give the region a European-style festival event.
"Originally, we chose Philadelphia as the market, and the Fairmount Parks Commission worked hard to set up a festival in the center of Philadelphia," says Charlie Jones.
"We were in negotiations with the city and the Commission was motivated and excited about the project.
Unfortunately, however, we got bogged in for the city's current leadership, adds Charlie Jones.
"Fortunately, we had the opportunity to discuss Melvin Benn and we are about to set up a great festival in an exceptional venue that will ultimately serve the people of Philadelphia."
C3 Presents resurrected the Lollapalooza Festival in Grant Park, Chicago, in 2005, after being excreed on the festival stage by the Austin City Limits Music Festival in 2002.
The gross sales of both events for 2007 amounted to $9.8M and $11.3M.
Both of these festivals take place in the urban environment.
"The European model of the Melvin Benn festival takes place in the countryside, while our festivals take place more in green spaces in the cities," says Charlie Jones.
Our goal is to combine the two concepts in a certain way to create both the impression of a rural festival in Europe, as well as urban after the American."
Vineland is located about halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
"The Vineeland, including the mayor, is enthusiastically supporting the realization of this event," says Charlie Jones.
The latter refuses to reveal the terms of the agreement, but says "that they are sufficiently advantageous to allow for an event to be invested in such an event and to welcome the festival, which will hopefully have a long lasting."
Charlie Jones says the capacity of this festival is "very high," similar to the capacity of the Tennessee Bonnaroo Music Festival, which holds 80,000 people.
He says that invitations have already been sent to the groups, but nothing can be confirmed at the moment the program is yet to be press.
"Vineland will have a rock feel, but the music will be varied there to attract a wide range of viewers as far as possible," says Carlie Jones.
The partners of C3, which received the Top Independent Promoter Award in the final Billboard Touring Awards, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal faces Terminator
It's not easy to attract Hollywood film studios to Montreal when the Terminator himself ops against it...
This persuasion mission is one of the tasks of the delegate.
But his mandate is "politically challenging" because the governor of the Californian, Arnold Schwarzenegger, is condemning "runaway productions."
Is it difficult to fall into the "Guvernator" claws?
"You need to be careful, it's the industry that decides where it goes.
If he finds the conditions in Montreal that he'll be favorable, he'll go there.
Our role is to offer those that they will consider the best," he said.
Chasing festivals
For the moment, however, the priority for the moment is Denis Turcotte's promotion of the local film.
The hunt for the Oscars has already begun.
At all West Coast festivals, be they're festivals at Sundance, Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, it will be about presenting, highlighting the Quebec films and making sure that the raver's interviews.
The Age of Darkness was in good publicity at the 30th annual Mill Valley Film Festival a few weeks ago.
It will be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
The Shake hands with the Devil is on offer in Santa Monica and will be presented in November for the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival.
This month, Québec also presented four short and four feature films at the American Film Institute Fest.
Will the marathon run to the market at the end of the year? Experts divided by 'subprime' crisis
Less than five weeks to go until the end of the administrative year, and the investors are already rubbing their hands with me in anticipation of the traditional marathon at the end of the year.
This year, however, the experts are not so sure that it will happen.
Banif believes that "in a statistical point of view, the month of December takes a positive run on the stock exchange."
However, it is not appropriate to produce forecasts solely on the basis of statistics, especially as markets offer, at least in the short term, some doubts about it."
These experts do not expect the stock market to get moving in the last weeks of the year, stating that "the stock market is maintained by the existence of liquidity that is ready to invest given the lack of alternatives with guarantees, especially of a solid income effect influenced by the turnaround effect to high-quality securities, both in long and short periods."
Therefore, they believe that the stock exchange will have a rather calm run, not without volatility, "especially because the impact of the likely fall in FED (Federal Reserve) rates is not known, given the high level of oil prices and the risk of incentives to inflationary pressures."
Javier Barrio, the head of the BPI Bank's sales manager in Spain, agrees that this is not the time for the bold statements that there will be a marathon.
"There is little reason to rejoice," assures this expert.
Ibex lost almost 4% of the maximum levels recorded on 8 November, when the index closed at 15,945.7 points.
Yet all experts do not have such a negative view.
Juan Solana, an analyst at Intermoney, believes that Ibex 35 could end the year a little closer to 16,000 points thanks to the re-buying of portfolios and the traditional contributions to the supplementary pension that occurs each year at that time.
But this expert suggests that things will be a little different this year, as he believes the marathon will happen earlier, in the second week of December after the long weekend of the Constitution.
The analyst in question does not believe that volatility is influenced by the direction of the market.
At the same time, Federico Olucha, an analyst at Inversis Banco, estimates that we are approaching technical levels and "that is why we could see the reflection of the index, triggered by reports from the US about the effects of the credit market crisis."
The analyst believes these consequences will be positive.
Analysts agree on a selection of titles to make it possible to bring Ibex to the new maximum caps.
Solana of Intermoney confirms that "this year is the turn of strong titles."
This expert would include both big banks and some construction firms in the portfolio, "because when this period comes, the energy sector will be very expensive."
Federico Olucha of Inversis Banco, on the other hand, assures that the increases will go hand in hand with the banking and industry sector.
Construction firms will also be able to enrich themselves at this marathon if it happens.
"ACS has been re-leab to re-exorc, and we hope that other construction companies, such as Ferrovial and the FCC, will go the same way," the expert explains.
Cyclail consumption will be at the forefront in the last part of the year thanks to an increase in sales during the Christmas sales period.
This expert, on the other hand, believes that the technologies will also do very well, even if they are not very represented in this field in the Spanish market.
Five times in seven years
In the last seven years, December has been a month of downs in only two cases.
The real marathon at the end of the year was held in the 2003 financial year, when stock markets ended the crisis triggered by the bursting of the technology bubble.
This year, when Ibex 35 recovered 28.17%, with a 6.68% increase in December.
We will see if 2007 will be the fifth profitable year in the ranking (so far Ibex has increased by 8.36% since January) and whether it will be able to have its marathon at the end of the year.
Two hundred branches of the Popular Bank will be open 12 hours from Friday to Saturday
Popular Bank decided to modernize most of its branches.
A total of two hundred, located in the most commercial parts of Spain.
These branches operated under the Popular Max brand are a major change for the bank.
Likewise for other Spanish entities, as it is the first group to decide to make such a jump and bet on the continuous opening hours of their branches until 8:30 p.m. and open on Saturdays from 10 a.m. to 8:30 p.m.
BBVA, another group that also assured several times that it wanted to extend the opening hours of its branches, has not yet taken a decision on this step.
In the meantime, it intends to conclude an agreement with the unions to cancel the opening hours of 75% of its branches on Saturday in exchange for an extension of opening hours by one in the afternoon, though not for the public.
The results of this experience by Popular Bank will be decisive for other players to join or not to join this initiative, which supports the opening hours of trade.
That is precisely the aim of the project set out by the Bank Popular.
To acquire individual clients who go to these places for their purchases, smaller and medium-sized companies, business owners and shops from selected streets where branches will be opened.
The Bank wants to open 200 of these branches throughout Spain within about 18 months, as this is not about opening new branches, but only an adjustment to the existing ones.
For this reason, the bank will modernise the branches it already has in its commercial zones by adapting them to the profile of clients on the different streets.
This is complemented by an extension of the opening hours by a further conception of the branch space and a new, more up-to-date, more light-coloured design.
The bank's commercial director, Ángel Rivera, assures that this restructuring will not mean a major investment, but a larger recruitment, as it passes from six employees to a branch to an eight to nine.
The branches will even be equipped with premises for meetings of small and medium-sized companies and will also sell non-financial products.
Positive experience for the group.
Popular has already tested the initiative in three Madrid branches.
And it was a positive experience, as Ángel Rivera explains.
The branches in Madrid's streets of Bravo Murillo, O'Donnell and Grana were selected, and according to Rivera, it seems to have been a happy choice.
Popular Bank currently has 2,500 branches.
And the other 60 specialized in immigrants, which are run under the Mundocredit brand, also have very long opening hours and open even on Sundays and holidays.

Telecinco doubles the value of its rival Antena 3 on the stock exchange for the first time
We did it.
In this sentence, Paolo Vasile, the executive chairman of Telecinco, yesterday expressed his satisfaction at the end of the trading, when he noted that the television he was managing had doubled the value of its rival Antena 3.
Only one thing spoiled his joy: 'What I regret is that it didn't happen because we grew more, but because we fell less down,' he said.
And yet he stressed that thanks to the weak market, 'we have fallen less'.
Telecinco stopped trading yesterday by moving 2.54%.
This profit has pushed their loss for the past part of the year to 15.66%.
The stock market value of this firm, controlled by Mediaset (with 52 % capital), with the participation of Vocent (another 13%) thus amounts to EUR 4 488.88 million, according to Bloomberg data.
Its competitor, Antena 3, which fell by 1.52% yesterday and has overall fallen by 40.5% since January, is half of 2 193.46 million.
The value of the other telecoms firms that have been valued is 3.571 billion in the case of Sogecable, Prisa 2 518.53 million (Pinco Días) and Vocento 1.779 billion.
According to Vasile, the comparison with Antena 3 is offered as we talk about two similar companies.
The relative fact is how much we are able to do in the same market, at what cost and how we assess it in the ratings'.
Telecinco announced last week that it expects to become the first television channel by surpassing a billion gross advertising revenue, as assured by Giuseppe Tringali, the executive chairman of Telecinco and Publiespaña, a branch that advertises the group.
Indeed, if the forecast data were to be made, this TV channel would see a 3.6% rise in advertising turnover this year, up from 965.4 million in 2006.
At the same time, Antenena's net turnover increased by 1.6% in the first nine months of the year (and thus reached 734.4 million), while this broadcaster's net revenue rose by 0.7% (630.4 million).
One of the factors that analysts are targeting for Telecinco's best relative developments on the stock exchange is the increased pay out it has maintained so far: in 2006, the company, chaired by Alejandro Echevarría, split 100% of its profits among its shareholders.
Vasile assures that even if it is early to decide, this coefficient could change after the purchase of 33% of Endemol together with its parent company, Mediaset.
'We have an official commitment to give at least 50%, although we have always announced much more.
This year, I hope we will be able to satisfy our shareholders, who we have already increased the value of 33% of Endemol'.
According to analysts, the market is showing some fatigue at these times.
Lehman Brothers recently downgraded its Telecinco earnings estimates of 4% in 2008 and 7% in 2009.
This is due to the fact that the projected growth in revenue has stopped from 0.5% to 8.4% in 2008 and from 5.5% to 5.1% in 2009.
The same company reduced Antena's projected profit of 3, at 4.5% in 2008 and 7.5% in 2009.

Congress approves transposing of MiFID in force from 1 November
In parallel with the parliamentary negotiations that were concluded today by the Congressional vote on the amendments incorporated by the Senate into the bill, the government has subjected the public hearing to the regulations that develop the new law, with a view to both coming into force before the end of the year.
Party leaders have consistently highlighted the efforts of MPs and senators to negotiate and agree the best standard to guarantee investor protection and detailed regulation of the activities of the operators needed for the effective functioning of the markets.
The MiFID Directive, which is governed by the Securities Trading Act, envisages the modernisation of financial markets while strengthening investor protection, improving the supervisory powers of the State Securities Market Commission (CNMV) and promoting cooperation between the various supervisory authorities of the European Union.
This new regulation will make it possible to provide financial advice services to both specialized firms and to natural or legal persons, and creates a new type of financial services (ESIS) firms, financial consultancy (AFI) that joins in securities, brokering offices and portfolio management companies.
In addition, the number of systems for the performance of operations with financial instruments is being expanded by adding to regulated secondary markets multilateral trading systems and command internalisation systems to compete with current stock exchange brokers.
Furthermore, the law obliges investment service firms to disseminate information on the market of key aspects of their business profile, risk exposure and the ways of coping with risk, and requires a statement of all operations performed to facilitate supervision by the CNMV.
During the hearing in the Trade Chamber of Congress, several modifications were included, among which the claim securitised should be considered a "complex" financial instrument, given the high risk to the investor, which was demonstrated by what occurred in the US with high-risk mortgage debts (subprime).
In addition, the trans-conciliation of the directive was used to legally set out the functions that can be held by bachelorists in the field of eco-comedy and corporate management 30 years after the Royal Decree was approved in 1977 to set out the professional roles reserved for economists.
At the same time, the Senate has included the creation of new professions in the financial sector, such as the intermediary to work externally, will not require permission from the CNMV and will be able to provide services for trading in products and customer sourcing for various investment firms at the same time.
The harmonised ISC increased by five-tenths to 4.1% in November
This indicator, which is later used by Eurostat to calculate the European Union inflation index, provides preliminary information on how prices in Spain developed during the month of November.
Its publication corresponds to the policy of Eurostat and the Central European Bank (CEB) to provide data at times and quality comparable to those achieved in the United States.
This preliminary indicator is calculated using the same process as used for the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices, but using different statistical modeling methods for the estimation of information not yet available at the time of publication.
The Spanish INE (State Institute for Statistics) recalled that the information provided by this provisional indicator is only indicative and therefore does not necessarily coincide with the final figure, which will become known on 14 December of this year.
"The ISC will continue to be maintained at a relatively high level"
Second Deputy Prime Minister and Economy Minister Pedro Solbes said that the November increase of the ISC to 4.1% was a "sign of temporary," but he also predicted that the price index would continue to be at a relatively "high level" in the coming months.
In any case, Solbes clarified to Congress in the congressional halls that "even if it is not a favourable figure," the inflationary differential of Spain vis-à-vis the monetary union has been "more or less" the same in the last two years.
He also explained that November "was less surprising" than the previous month, when the government had not anticipated such a high increase.
"We expected a value of around 4%," the Economy Minister said on the data presented today.
Virgin plans to make €42 billion with Northern Rock over three years
Since Northern Rock went into crisis in mid-September and had to resort to an emergency loan from the Bank of England, its deposits have plummeted by more than 50% to £12 billion (€16.8 billion).
At the time, the Bank managed record deposits worth more than £25 billion, which gradually fell during the two-and-a-half-month distrust of clients despite the government offering a 100 per cent guarantee for that money and extending it until the end of the crisis.
Virgin, which will replace the entity's name with its business-leaf Virgin Money, needs to raise around a quarter of the revenue invested in British banks in the next three years to raise the remaining £18 billion to reach the target of £30 billion.
The tycoon Richard Branson's group, known in the UK for his striking advertising campaigns, is planning to spend £50 million (about €70 million) a year on advertising and marketing to make her resolution.
Northern Rock this week marked the offer of the Virgin consortium, which consists of three other companies, the one that would prefer to save them from bankruptcy.
Mayor of Totany arrested for alleged corruption practices in construction
In the early hours of this morning, the Civilian Guard detained the current mayor of the Murcian city of Totana (from the People's Party) for his alleged involvement in the corrupt practices in the construction that were unveiled this week.
One of the town hall's secretaries and the head of the local police were also arrested.
José Martínez Andreo replaced Juan Morales, the current People's Party MP, in May of this year, and until then the mayor of the municipality, who, according to investigative sources contacted by Cadena SER, could have been the 'high' of the entire enterprise.
Officers continue to monitor the town hall buildings and the Construction Commission and no further arrests are being decided in the coming hours.
In addition, the lawyer for Juan Morales, the main suspect in the construction corrupt practices that were uncovered earlier this week, has been charged.
As Cadena SER reported yesterday, the lawyer for the 'fanchovec' MP Juan Morales, who was being investigated, was arrested as he left Morales' residence with important documents linked to corruption.
In addition, according to investigative sources, Morales's alleged collection of commissions for signing a construction agreement with a Galician construction company that has been reclassified by 200 hectares of land are being investigated.
Eight people are currently detained.
Bono accepted the offer to lead the PSOE's toled Candidate and, if they win, chair Congress
Former Defence Minister José Bono accepted the offer of Prime Minister and Socialist Secretary General Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapater to head the PSOE (Spanish Workers' Socialist Party) in Toledo in the next general election, and became the chairman of Congress if the Socialists win the general election.
So, at a press conference, the PSOE secretary for the organization Jose Blanco, and Bono himself announced this, after a meeting with Zapatero at noon today at the party's federal headquarters.
The executive's chief of executive justified the offer to the former minister on the grounds that in political life "it is important to count on the best" and Bono "is among the best."
He further noted that "yes, it appears" that this politician from La Mancha will be the Socialist Party's candidate for the presidency of Congress if the Socialists win the next election.
Bono would replace Manuel Marín as chairman of Congress, who unveiled his decision not to run in the next general election and leave his active political career on November 15 to pursue the fight against climate change in university education.
The former minister admitted that the Prime Minister kept urging him to return to the top politics he had left two years earlier.
He went further to say that, as citizens knew who the deputy minister of the economy would be, if the PSOE wins the election, his party wanted to announce who would preside over the congress in a "transparent form."
If Bono wins this job, he hopes to transform the House into a "gate of respect and not swearing or shouting" and will make it "more and more like the citizens."
"Sometimes, unfortunately, it seems that the only place in Madrid where it is not easy to speak in peace and quiet is the Congress, the Prime Minister in the Senate was interrupted 26 times on one occasion."
He also spoke of the laudatory words to the current chairman, Manuel Marín, and "food work of his own," and did not want to imagine himself in his place at the same ground, so as he said, what his opponents might consider "great-great."
Climate propaganda
Given that the anti-climate change movement subjects to merciless persecution both to those who view his predictions as well as those who prefer other political and social struggles, they must demonstrate solid cohesion.
Moreover, to have a movement leader who is the prime minister like Zapatero and believes that this fight is more important than the fight against Islamic terrorism and even intends to sign a "new treaty with the planet."
This proposal compels him to explain why his government's actions or inaction have made a significant contribution to Spain leading Spain in the European Union in non-resonance of the Kyoto Protocol.
Who is responsible for this non-contouring, in which sectors this is happening and why his government, the government of the treaties, did not prevent it.
Moreover, it forces him to explain as clearly as possible to the Spaniards what measures he intends to take to hampen climate change.
Which firms will be harmed by this, which population habits will have to be changed, what energy savings, individual and collective ones, we will have to accept and what the economic consequences will be.
In other words, who will sacrifice and who will pay to save the planet.
But we have not received such explanations, nor will we see.
Precisely because it is necessary to sacrifice and pay.
Measures against climate change, genuine measures, are unpopular.
Expensive, inconvenient and threatening corporate and private accounts.
Even one centim of the petrol price, the proposed PSOE (Spanish Workers' Socialist Party), seemed so risky in terms of the election that he hastened to reject it.
In other words, this is about saving the planet in a way that does not cost anything, pure propaganda, slogans lacking any real meaning.
With impressive phrases, commissions, committees, protocols and new posts.
And treaties with the planet; this gentleman is so useful for election campaigns that neither speak, accuse, demands anything, but is an ornament of the rents of the meetings and inspires tenderness.
If it is limited to being just a virtual contractor and does not ask for us to ride a bike and coo to cool ourselves with a flare.
Mayor and local police chief Totany detained on suspicion of corrupt construction practices
As investigative sources reported, the Civzan Guard arrested the mayor of the Murcian city of Totana, "the people's" Jose Martínez Andreo, the head of the local police, the secretary of the town hall and one hospitality businessman, on suspicion of committing the crimes of construction.
The mayor was arrested at his residence and taken to the town hall, in whose premises he is now located with a number of police officers who also attended the Construction Commission and the Municipal Enterprise for the management of industrial land and flats.
These three arrests were added to the six that took place last Monday in Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, in an operation linked to the reclassification of more than 2 million hectares of agricultural land into land suitable for the construction, so that the Galician firm Nuaria, after paying illegal commissions during the last parliamentary term, could build 4,000 houses there.
In addition, two other persons were not arrested, but are charged in summary proceedings in the court of the first instance of Totana.
The six first arrested were handed over to the court today.
According to information sources, the previous mayor of Totany and today a member of the Autonomous Parliament for the People's Party (PP), Juan Morales, is under investigation.
He was also charged with his ex-wife, a real estate agent registered today in Totana, as well as his current girlfriend, who lives in Murcia, the autonomous region's capital.
Manuel N.A., the director and owner of the Nuaria group, a lawyer and businessman from Vigo, was arrested in Nigen (Phittarovra province), as well as Pablo José M. G., director of Suelo de Inmonuar, which belonged to the group and through which bribes were handed out.
The investigation is carried out by the Crime Group under the Conducting Operational Central Unit of the Civil Guard, whose members, in addition to the arrest, also carried out eleven searches, mostly in companies related to those arrested, based in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedře, Las Rozas (province Madrid) and Totana.
Only one person was imprisoned in Totana at the time, in the area of a very well-known owner of a poultry meat product company who could have served as a broker.
The Nuaria Group was tasked with the construction of the largest residential complex of the Murcian city of Totany, which would represent the construction of more than 5,000 houses, a golf course and two "spa" hotels.
The company received 2.2 million square metres of land in Totana, which was reclassified and its project was intended to double the settlement of the municipality, which has a population of 25,000.
The Nuaria Group consists of companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar, which are dedicated to supporting the real estate market, Conycase, which manages the parking in the streets of Coruňa, Venezuela and Fernando el Católico in the city of Vigo, Hogartel, which focuses on the promotion, sale and assembly of building elements.

Our Finnish correspondent sends us this comment from yesterday's edition of the most important Finnish newspaper Helsingin Sanomat (incidentally at the start of the PISA report on the level of education in the world), which refers to what the newspapers printed on 18 November, on the same day that a critique of Blackburn's book coincidentally appeared there:
"The content of the subject of philosophy has penetrated public discussions in connection with the tragedhyme at the Jokela school.
The victim's assassin, a high school student, quoted Plato and Nietzsche's work in his messages.
Pekka E, the councillor for the education responsible for the subject of philosophy, demanded on the website of the Helsingin Sanomat newspaper that the professors take a critical stand on Platoon, arguing that it was not necessary to discuss Nietzsche in the mandatory basic philosophy course in secondary schools."

One colleague reports on the introduction of the offence of downloading from the internet to the Penal Code:
A. A downloading one song would be a crime with a rate of six months to one year.
By contrast, if you are to be the price of a board in a shop worth less than €400, this is considered a mere offence (Section 623.1).
B. If you steal up to €1,000 from a shop, theft is already a criminal offence, but the penalty is lower than for the withdrawal (Section 234 of the Penal Code).
C. If you steal a car and return it after 40 hours, the penalty is still lower than for the download (Section 244.1)
D. It is less serious to participate in a brawl than the shifts of the compacts.
Participating in a riot is to be held at a rate of three months to one year (Section 154 of the Penal Code) and for the replacement of compacts would be a rate of between six months and two years
(§ 270 of the Penal Code).
Sexual harassment at work is considered to be less serious under Section 184.2 of the Penal Code than the download of a film on DVD.
F. The unauthorized distribution of copyrighted films is more punished than the provision of pornographic material to minors (§ 186).
So if my colleague is right, someone's arm has gone, and he's got away with it.

My attending physician is sticking one of his articles on strange research called "Money causes brain activation, especially if others get less."
Or the feelings that a month's paychecks are made by employees' paychecks depends on how much the colleagues make.
The research was conducted at the University of Bonn University using magnetic resonance imaging at the CAT scan and the results are published in the latest issue of Science.
According to Bernd Weber, author of the study and leader of the Life&Brain Institute's depiction of the neurocognition group: "The biggest activation was when the research participant responded correctly and his colleague was wrong wrong."
Researchers observed that if they both succeeded, they received the same salary, the activation was modest, but when one got double that, the activation was higher.
I really don't know if this conclusion required so much science.
Applicant to the Balkans
The Carla del Ponte has been ruthlessly chasing the Balkan war criminals from the State Prosecutor's Office of the Court of Justice in The Hague for eight years.
Her mandate expires at the end of the year and Carla will leave with mixed feelings, as the main culprits of the Srebrenica massacre that killed 8,000 Bosnian Muslims, former General Ratko Mladic and former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, are still at large.
Their names are on the list, from which the Swiss director Marcel Schüpbach's documentary film "Karina seznam"(2006' in Spain) was taken over, which follows the work of the Swiss prosecutor's work at the pace of the detective thriller from Belgrade to New York in the pursuit of fugitive criminals and pressure the states to pull the network.
What insurance is appropriate for me?
Insurance for a car that protects the driver in the event of an accident. represents a substantial expense that depends on various factors, such as age, condition, gender, driving licence time, type of vehicle to be insured or used, etc.
Having a car is just the beginning.
Choosing suitable car insurance is even more difficult than choosing a car model.
First of all, we need to figure out what we're talking about.
Car insurance is an agreement between the insurance company and the insured.
This commitment takes the form of an insurance contract stipulating that the insurance company receives an agreed insured amount of a certain amount for taking responsibility for paying the damages in the event of an insured event.
The insurance is the cost of the insurance, which is determined with regard to various factors such as age, condition, gender, duration of possession of the driving licence, the type of vehicle insured or used, etc.
Insurance companies set their prices on the basis of statistics, so the more likely there is a crash, the higher the premium rate.
For this reason, both those over 25 years of age or women have to pay lower premiums, as statistics show that they have a lower risk index due to their caution.
In the same way, on the basis of the checks, the insurance companies concluded that those living in the marriage tend to have fewer accidents than single drivers.
The way the vehicle is used will affect the frequency of the journeys and thus the likelihood of having an accident.
The growth in the frequency of the journeys increases the likelihood.
There are many variables that insurance companies consider when setting the cost of premiums.
Therefore, the driver must study the situation well to choose the kind of insurance that best matches his profile of the insured person.
We will show ourselves the most important variables for the selection of this type of insurance or another, which, in addition to the fact that it meets the type of insured person, will also be at a reasonable price.
People under the age of 25 experience various drawbacks, such as little driving experience and short possession of a driving licence when they want to take out premiums at an affordable price.
Although the ideal for good coverage is insurance against all risks, there are also cheaper options.
The most cautious drivers can choose insurance against all risks at a premium discount to obtain the insurance coverage of all risks, but at a more affordable price.
This type of contract would presuppose a client's co-financing in the event of a claim.
"Part of the payment of the insurance claim provided by the client will be set in advance when determining the price of the premium, which will be the higher, which would be the lower, the co-payment," explains Luis Noguera, the senior head of First Europe in Spain, an online insurance intermediary.
Another option is insurance extended to other traffic participants by insuring the client against the damage caused to other persons, but not against damage to his own car.
In addition, he would be insured against theft, fire and vehicle loss.
Recommendations.
If you are under the age of twenty-five, try to be attentive and avoid accidents as possible, as this will affect your bonus and make it possible to reduce premiums in the future.
The bonus is a reduction in the basic rate that the insurance company has.
By contrast, malus is an increase in that basic rate.
"The Bonus and malus will depend on the insurance company and its profit.
If the insurance company had a good year, it will be able to afford to increase the bonus," Noguera explains.
After crossing the twenty-five-year mark, it is easier for drivers to take out insurance, as the client's risk index is reduced, thanks to their experience.
For this reason, it is most recommended to take out insurance against all risks at a discount.
"Young people are usually unable to take advantage of the experience gained in advance when the accident is made, nor in the process of driving," assures the director of a European company in Spain, adding that most of the accidents occur in the second year of proceedings, when the 'fear of the newcomer's has already been overcome.
However, if the client is married but has no children yet, it is better to take out insurance against all risks, if his economic situation allows it.
Families with children are considered by insurance companies to be a clientele with the lowest risk index and thus their surprings will be lower.
In this case, the best insurance would be insurance against all risks at the discount of the premium (which could be €300) or, in the case of a high bonus, insurance extended to other operators, starting from the third year after the purchase of the vehicle.
"Their proceedings are calmer and their purchaseability is higher, so they can afford the luxury of getting the highest discount," notes Luis Noguera.
Pensioners are advised to insure against all risks at a discounted premium (which is €150) or insurance extended to other participants in the operation if a high bonus has been achieved.
It has to be said that car insurance is something important not only because it protects the driver in the event of an accident, but also because it represents a considerable expense, which is a valid reason to study the possibilities of insurance that would suit us best in view of our personal situation.
Celtic are trying to earn a point at AC Milan, which means the last eight
AC Milan and Celtic will measure their strength this Tuesday at the San Siro Stadium in an attempt to earn a point they lack to achieve their respective goals at the end of the "Champions" league, as it would mean being the first for the Italians to be the first and for the Scots it would decide the placement.
The Italians have ten points and have already secured promotion in their fifth game with a draw in Portugal, while Celtic have nine points, but need one more to be sure that Shakhour will not get ahead of him with six points to play Benfika, who has four.
These two Group D matches will be played a week before the sixth round is over, as AC Milan must play in the Intercontinental Cup in Japan, where they will make their first consecutive consecutive consecutive consecutive semi-final, in an attempt to advance to the final of the 16th.
So this group will be closed before the others and a tie-winning result at the Giuseppe Meazzy Stadium seems to be the most likely, although both teams will try to compete for the win, as the Italians will not want to be tactical on home soil and Celtic know that after the win he would be the first and would secure a better place in the last eight.
The Gordon Strachan team could even be the way to advance if Shakhťor does not win, but he cannot rely on that, as the Ukrainians, who lost in Glasgow (2-1) last week, will advance to the first straight game (2-0) but won in the first straight game (2-0).
So the AC Milan players will try to spoil the evening for the Scots, who are confident of reaching the semi-finals in the reorganised Champions League for the second time, just as they were beaten in the same match in last year's match by Kaká's goal in extra time (1-0) after 0-0 in the playing time.
The hope that they will win the "rossoneri" will be Shakhtar, for whom he has the prize of victory, only if Celtic lost, both to advance to the last eight and to stay in UEFA.
Benfica, although it is the last and does not have the possibility to continue in the top European competition, could reach third place with one victory, so it would play in UEFA.
The first concert as part of the Spice Girls tour was attended by 20,000 people in Vancouver
The Spice Girls began their first tour in Vancouver (Canada) in front of 20,000 spectators since they broke up in 2000.
"Posh Spice" (Victoria Beckham), "Scary Spice" (Melanie Brown), "Baby Spice" (Emma Bunton), "Sports Spice" (Melanie Chisholm) and "Ginger Spice" (Geri Halliwell) shortly before they opened their concert at the GM Place Stadium in Vancouver, they said that the reunion of their group was "great."
About 20,000 people bought out tickets to be present at the concert, which also included a video that depicts the history of the group, which triggered a sensation in the late 1990s.
The return and the world tour take place at the same time as a new album, which is being released in Spain by EMI, which brings a selection of their main successful tracks, as well as two new songs, "Headlines" and "Voodoo."
The five Spice Girls appeared on stage decorated with bracelets given to them by their husband "Posh Spice," British footballer David Beckham.
This athlete was in the audience that flooded GM Place, even though a nervous Victoria banned him from it a few days ago.
Prior to the start of the performance, Victoria Beckham said of the British star that he "didn't see our costumes at all, so I'm nervous about what she thinks about the show."
"Sports Spice," whose departure from the group in 1998 "because of the contradictions between us" caused the dissolution of the five-man group two years later, also showed her nervousness in meeting with the press two hours before the start of the performance.
"I was scared.
I was nervous, but I saw that world public opinion had changed, the view of the Spice Girls had changed.
And I thought, why not, so I'm glad I made a decision," Chisholm said of the reunion of the group she had disbanded nine years earlier.
The singer also noted that over time, "the things have been settled and we all like to be very happy."
However, a lot of things have changed since the Spice Girls last performed together in 1998.
So at the start, according to CTV, the group flew to Vancouver on the Virgin Airlines special.
On arrival, they were expected at the airport by the army of nannies.
The five have a total of 7 children.
After the Vancouver concert, the band will perform in California (USA), San José (on December 4), and Los Angeles (on December 5 and 7).
He will perform in Madrid on 23 December.
Fears of a new gas quarrel between Russia and Ukraine
A dispute is currently underway between Russia and Ukraine over the prices of natural gas, and so the risk of Russian supplying to Western Europe of this fuel is increasing.
Most of the Russian fuel exported to the European Union (EU) is driven by a pipeline through Ukraine and any dispute between the two countries is being closely watched.
Kiev has warned that if Moscow raises gas prices for Ukraine, it will charge Russia higher transit fees.
The previous dispute between the two reduced supplies to EU states last year.
The latest dispute between Kiev and Moscow comes as the Ukrainian government and Russia's state-owned gas monopoly, Gazprom, try to agree on how much Ukraine will have to pay for Russian gas in 2008.
Gazprom says it will have to charge more for Ukraine, as it has agreed to pay up to 50% more for the gas it receives from neighbouring Turkmenistan.
Analysts say this could mean that Ukraine will have to pay 40% more for its deliveries from Gazprom.
"It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important gas transit states during the negotiations," Ukrainian Economics Minister Anatoly Kinach told Reuters.
"Gas in gas prices should undoubtedly be linked to our arguments regarding the level of transit charges (to Western Europe) through Ukraine."
The latest major dispute between Moscow and Kiev was caused by a reduction in supplies from Gazprom to Ukraine in January 2006.
This has caused an overwhelming fall in exports to Western Europe, raising prices sharply.
Russian gas accounts for one quarter of the European Union's supply.
Russia has the largest gas reserves in the world, but a large proportion of them remain underused.
As a result, Gazprom is supplementing its own deliveries with gas from Turkmenistan and other former Soviet Central Asian republics.
NHS 'must control of foreign employees'
The inspector said the Scottish NHS chambers must improve the control of criminal records for non-European staff.
The recommendation from the president of the Supreme Audit Office, Robert Blac, came after a foreign doctor working in Scotland was linked to the attacks on Glasgow Airport in June.
Mr. Black is also concerned that the Scottish NHS has no exact picture of the number of foreign staff it employs.
But his report emphasized that the other key checks were done in order for a sample of five health authorities.
The President of the Supreme Audit Office was of interest to the staff obtained from countries outside the European Economic Area in the post in the post in June following the Glasgow airport attacks.
Twenty-eight-year-old Bilal Abdullah, an Iraqi doctor at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was detained at the airport after someone drove a Jeep into the door of the main terminal building.
He was one of three doctors who appeared in the Central Criminal Court using video-told charges of links to attempted bombings in the UK.
The NHS chambers are expected to check foreign staff in terms of skills, experience and authorization for work in the UK before their employment.
Although the Scottish Health Commissions use Disclosure Scotland for the control of criminal records, the agency has no power to obtain such information outside of Britain.
The report by the President of the Supreme Audit Office says, among other recommendations that the commissions should be guided by the Criminal Records Bureau directives, which help employers with inspections in several countries.
"Although we have found that some of the staff's records contained evidence of these checks, they are not carried out regularly," the report reported.
Mr. Black said that the Scottish NHS agrees in many ways with its own pre-employee vetes policy, but also added: "Our report highlights the areas in which the system could be improved to ensure the availability of accurate information about the amount of foreign staff."
BMA Scottsko President Dr. Peter Terry said it was "very unlikely" to identify potential NHS employees who might commit an act of terrorism in the future.
"The report suggests that the current pre-employee controls at the Scottish NHS are working well and it is not clear what additional value the comments will bring," he said.
The Scottish health authorities reported that they currently have 1,161 foreign workers, the vast majority of whom are doctors and nurses.
However, the president of the Supreme Audit Office pointed out that these figures would probably be higher, too, because the commissions had trouble identifying staff with a residence permit.
The survey also found that the procedures for inspections established for the NHS authorities in the regions of Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire and Lothian are to a large extent carried out.
They included checks on passports, work permits and qualifications.
The Scottish Government is currently reworking the policy and pre-employee inspection guidelines for NHS foreign workers.
Health Minister Nicola Sturgeon said: "I wanted to do this work immediately after the terrorist attack on Glasgow Airport."
It also added that the Scottish Government, in line with the health commissions, would consider the recommendations of the report and would ensure that the best procedures were to be found in the updated pre-employee guidelines of all staff - including the foreign one - planned to be issued next month.
Joy Division dominates the film awards
Control, a biographical film about the late Joy Division singer Ian Curtis, has collected five awards at the British Independent Film Awards, including Best Film Awards.
The awards were also won by star Sam Riley, who worked in the warehouse, director Anton Corbijn, and in the supporting role of Toby Kebell until the role of Curtis.
Lady Judi Dench was named Best Actress for the thriller The Notebooks of the Scandal.
And Bond star Daniel Craig won a Variety Award for getting a British film on the world stage.
The awards were ceremonially presented at Roundhouse, London.
Control describes Curtis's journey to fame with Joy Division until his suicide in 1980 at the age of 23.
This black-and-white film - whose soundtrack includes The Killers, David Bowie and New Order - cost just £3 million.
But it won two awards for Dutch photographer Corbijn, formerly known for the iconic cover of the U2 album Joshua Tree, for Best Director and Best debuting director.
Rock music was the focus of another award-winning - as the film by Julien Templ about Clash singer Joe Strummer won the Best Documentary Award.
The Best Actor's Plack was won by Viggo Mortensen for his role as the driver of the Russian mob boss in the London thriller David Croenberg Eastern Promises.
Ray Winston, who has a reputation based on the roles of hard-core men, won the Richard Harris Award for his extraordinary contribution to British film.
This 50-year-old, whose films include Scum, Nil By Mouth and Sexy Beast, is now filming another episode of Indiana Jones - the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.
Winstone said he was proud of the award, which is named after the star of the films Camelot and Harry Potter Harris, who died in 2002.
"People like Richard Harris and Albert Finney have opened the door for people like me," he added.
"I was lucky enough to meet Richard Harris several times.
He's my man, a great actor of his time, I'm very honoured."
Independent film awards, known as Bify, are awarded by a jury featured in which the filmmakers, actors and festival organisers sit.
Bif proponents and patrons include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal, and Michael Winterbottom.
Saudi Arabia arrests 208 people over terrorist plot
Saudi Arabia announced yesterday that it has arrested 208 militants for membership in cells preparing an immediate attack on the oil facility, as well as on the clerics and security forces.
State broadcaster, the oil's largest exporter, said one of the cells wanted to smuggle missiles into the ground.
Al Qaeda's sympathizers have campaigned against the monarchy, allied with the United States, since 2003, since the invasion of Iraq.
A television reportage reported that a cell of eight militants led by a foreigner planned to attack an oil-furnished plant in Ash-Sharqiyah Province.
Saudi Arabia is building a 35,000 rapid response unit to defend the facility since al-Qaeda's failed attack on the world's largest oil processing plant in the Abqaiq in 2006.
The report quoted the ministry's internal statement: 18 of those arrested belonged to a cell conducted by a "missile launch expert" that slipped into the ground.
She also said that the militants had planned to smuggle eight missiles into the kingdom.
22 detainees were to prepare the murders of clergy and security personnel.
The government urged clerics to do more to prevent the Saudis from leaving for Iraq to join the al-Qaeda militants fighting allied troops and the Shiite US-backed Shiite government, whom the conservative Sunni Saudis consider he heretic.
The Al-Qaeda militants believe the authorities co-opted many cadres in Saudi Arabia to support the royal family that controls the government.
Militants - supported by the challenges of al-Qaeda leader Saud Osama bin Laden to focus on the pro-Western Saudi government - have focused on foreign residential complexes, government buildings and power equipment.
"This war has been a tremendous effort by the security forces in the past... five months," an internal ministry spokesman told state television.
Also arrested was a 16-member "media cell" in Medina, which aimed to promote "Ssuch as the thinking of "Ssuch asis" - an ideology of Sunni Muslim radicals that promotes violence against Muslims labeled unbelieving and renegades.
Among those arrested were also 32 people charged with providing financial support to militants.
The climate on Venus is perhaps a look at the Earth's future
Scientists reported yesterday that Venus might once have been a pleasant place to live.
Data from the orbiting European station show that the planet is even more like the willful twin of Earth than previously thought.
Venus is Earth's closest planetary neighbor.
These two worlds are roughly the same size and orbiting similar pathways, but Venus is a little closer to the sun.
Scientists now believe that billions of years ago, conditions were similar to those on Earth on Venus and could have been habitable.
But the fleddled greenhouse effect caused by carbon dioxide, the atmospheric erosion of solar radiation and the lower rate of rotation sent Venus along a very different path of development.
Today, the planet is without water, the temperature on the surface is hot enough to melt lead, and it is ravaged by storms and hurricane-force winds.
The findings from the European Space Agency's Venus Express probe, which studied the planet for a year, offer a sober glimpse of how the Earth could develop in the event of catastrophic climate change.
Professor Fred Taylor of the University of Oxford physics department and one of the leading Venus Express mission said: "It is becoming increasingly clear why the climate on Venus is so different from Earth, even if the planets themselves are otherwise quite similar.
"Our new data makes it possible to build a scenario in which Venus began as well as Earth, perhaps with a habitable environment, billions of years ago."
Police detain "enriccused uranium"
A pile of radioactive material, allegedly enriched with uranium, was detained by Slovak and Hungarian police yesterday.
A police spokesman said three people had been detained and the material was being examined.
He did not confirm that it was enriched uranium, but he said the substance could be sold for $1 million (£480 000).
Still wide-arre
Mitt Romney said it was not dignified for the presidential candidates to answer questions from a snowman.
Despite this, Republican presidential candidates eventually agreed to a debate on YouTube in which ordinary voters uploaded their questions to the video and passed them on to the candidates for broadcasts.
None of the questions aired on Wednesday, November 28, were as comical as the snowman who asked Democrats about global warming in the other side's YouTube debate.
But the questions and answers this time reflected a lot about the state of the Republican Party leading to next year's election.
It is unclear exactly how the CNN producers, one of the debit sponsors, selected clips, which were then shown to aspiring candidates.
But the first half-hour of debate, the longest time devoted to a single topic, was focused on immigration.
This theme is one of the most powerful Republican issues.
CNN asked a panel of undecided voters to turn the puck around when they heard something pleasing: the broadcaster noted the heights of the approval of the candidates talking about a hard-hitting approach at the border.
The toughest and longest exchange of views took place between Rudy Giuliani, the national nominee, and Mr. Romney, who poke forward in key early votes in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Mr. Giuliani is trying to shake off the reputation of a man who, as Mayor of New York, was soft on illegal immigrants.
He attacked Mr. Romney, accusing the former governor of Massachusetts of hiring illegal immigrants to work at his home.
These two struggled particularly fiercely when questioners asked if any of the candidates would support "amnesty" (give to illegal immigrants a normal status and the possibility of citizenship).
Secondary candidates, like Duncan Hunter, California congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a congressman from Colorado, managed to throw their way into the mill on the subject.
None of the two have a chance to be nominated, but both remain in the game for perhaps starting to sound the alarm about immigration earlier and more strongly than the others.
At least for immigration, the candidates have roughly the same view: greater severity at the border, no tolerance for illegal migrants.
This issue, with fears of poisonous toys from China and other worries with the outside world, helps Republicans forget or minimise the contradiction between libertines and Christian conservatives.
But the debate became very unpleasant when it came to other topics.
Mr Giuliani was asked why he supported the possession of firearms in the past.
John McCain and Mr. Romney discussed whether the simulated heating technique should be considered torture.
One questioner asked if the candidates believed in every word from the Bible.
Mr. Giuliani stumbled through it to the view that, even though the Bible was his favorite book, he probably didn't believe literally the story of Jonah and the whale.
Another questioner asked if Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee - who is now against all odds in the first place in a recent survey in Iowa thanks to his long-term Christian conservatism - said the death penalty was unpleasant but necessary.
Under pressure to decide whether Jesus would agree, he said that Jesus was too smart to run, earning him laughter.
The contest remains unusually open.
Mr. Huckabee's rise in Iowa coincides with recent successes in raising money and the loud cheerfulness of Ron Paul at Wednesday's debate.
These two have bounced back because both of the party's wings still cannot agree on more well-known and more traditional candidates.
In 1980 and 2000, one of the candidates united the party very soon and convincingly with the winning news of American Size on his lips, winking at both wings of the party.
This time the party is divided and the result is far from ambiguous.
Pain of the Labour
Once again, Gordon Brown found a trap to fall into; his way out remains the same.
Although it is customary for British political scandals, this is not particularly spicy.
There don't seem to be any orders sold, no accounts at the Paris hotel have been mysteriously paid for, no extramarital little fingers have been sucked.
But the barricaded Gordon Brown could do without being discovered that a wealthy businessman had masked the contributions of the ruling Labour Party for four years under the names of other people, and that the party had not announced it.
Two months ago, when the prime minister avoided calling an election and insulted British intelligence by claiming that the decision had not been influenced by the polls, there was hope of providing a resilient and effective government.
Instead of being formulated by the increasingly hilarious acting president of the Liberal Democrats, the once-gared Mr. Brown changed from Stalin to Mr. Bean.
The hunk uprooted rescue of the troubled Northern Rock bank showed weaknesses in the proceedings and poor judgment under fire.
Poorly thought-out proposals to amend the tax code brought companies together against the government.
The loss of personal data in 25 million people revealed unimaginable administrative bungrawm.
The retired three of the generals set off in a parlour in the Lords' House; they protested against cuts in military spending, claiming that being commander of the armed forces was part-time work.
Now there are multi-eason gifts from David Abrahams; Peter Watt, the general secretary of Labour (and their former internal discipline watchdog), has already resigned.
None of this means that Mr. Brown is inescurately heading for his end.
Despite this, governments can reach a tipping point, which they find to be difficult for governing.
The people don't trust politicians and don't like them, but they usually put away their distrust when a new bunch takes over.
When it seems clear that some prime minister is unlikely to improve, nor may he be in office for long, this is a relegation being gone: the civil service is becoming leaky, ministers start making briefings, the press looking for bad news, and the government is becoming unfocused and defensive.
In one way, Mr Brown's position is particularly difficult, as he cannot take the position of a new broom, compared to other political leaders.
As much as he would like to distance himself from Tony Blair, he was his first officer.
For example, the problems with Northern Rock and the IRS records are linked to the decisions Mr Brown made as finance minister.
And while he was not directly involved in Bordov's trouble, such as the long investigation into the financing of political parties caused by "fitour for money," voters may well conclude that he was.
Still, Mr Brown's predicament is not as bad as they look.
The overreacts aren't as gruesome as the Conservatives do.
As for Mr. Bean, no one died or was downright deceived.
And the treatment, painful as it may be, is to provide what Mr Brown's Stalinist tendencies have always promised: a reliable, firm, and slightly brutal government.
The latest uproar over political gifts is a good example.
Garboid Mr. Abrahams, who compares his donations with the charity, says he did not want any publicity for his charity.
That may be true, but the decision was not up to him.
The laws against the anonymity of the big political donors are clear and exist for a simple reason: the public has the right to know who might buy access to those who govern the country.
Mr. Watt, who said he knew about Mr. Abrahams's progress but didn't know he was illegal, would be thoroughly questioned; so would Jon Mendlesohn, the main Labour money-seeded of the tricky gifts in October.
But Mr. Brown is not involved yet; there is nothing to suggest that he knew about these plots, although the bulk of the payments took place after he took office in June.
The Prime Minister has done half the work so far.
He very quickly condemned this violation of the laws by his own party, but diluted his resolve by reaches for a proven instrument, a commission to investigate the matter - conducted in addition by a retired bishop and a judge.
In this case, the lessons are not complicated.
If the law has been broken, it is a matter of the police.
In addition, there are also other things that Mr Brown must do, such as finding the permanent chairman of the Independent Committee on Standards in Public Life, which has had none for six months, and to cede with a real reform of the funding of political parties.
This would require Labour, who are in a bind, to cooperate with the Conservatives and perhaps to give up their special financial relationship with the unions - the bitter pill for a devoted party member like Mr Brown.
But he should face a few simple facts.
The Conservatives now have a good start in the polls; he has two years to win back voters; and the only way to score victories is to unimpeatable integrity and high competence.
Card sharks
Does the sub-pricing mortgage crisis affect the US credit card market?
When there's blood in the water, naturally, the dorsal fins start to pass around excitedly.
Now that the US real estate market is withering, predators have focused on the credit card market there.
Analysts at Goldman Sachs say that credit card losses, if other consumer credit options were contracted to be in the way from subprime mortgages, could reach $99 billion.
The signs of tension are clear.
There is a growing number of default cases (for more than 30-day payment delays) and written-off accounts (crimes that the provider considers to be unenforceable).
HSBC reported last month that it had lost $1.4 billion in the US consumer credit market - also because of non-olvency credit card loans.
But it is too early to panic.
The accounts written off and the inability to repay are still short.
According to the Moody's rating agency, the 3.89% default rate in the third quarter was almost the full percentage point below the average.
The deteriorating rates can be partly explained by technical reasons.
The 2005 change in the US Personal Bankruptcy Act led to a sharp decline in the number of reported bankruptcies that do a large part of credit card losses; the number of reports (and thus the number of depreciation depreciation) would therefore rise, regardless of whether the general conditions for borrowers deteriorated.
The sector also shows a good maturity rate that shows how much consumers repay a month from their debts.
And trust in the securities of secured credit cards is solid, despite the paralysis in other corners of the structured finance sector.
Mr Dennis Moroney of the research firm TowerGroup predicts that their emissions volumes for 2007 will be 25% larger than last year.
There are certainly commonerous ways to spread infection between the sub-prime mortgage crisis and the credit card market: when real estate equity loans are drying out, consumers are more likely to go into debt through credit cards.
Credit card issuers, however, look more at cash flow than on the value of the guarantor items, so the falling home prices do not necessarily mean a change in the credibility of the borrowers.
They may even be advantageous for the lenders.
Consumer mortgage lending to repay is falling when the value of their assets falls below the loan value; as a result, card debt is moved upwards on the list of priorities for repayment.
Card issuers can also respond more quickly and more flexibly to stormier conditions than mortgage lenders by changing interest rates or debt limits.
This should theoretically reduce the risks of a rapid change in the price of guarithements.
"It's not going to happen that we're just rethinking all the loans one beautiful morning," says Gary Perlin, financial manager at Capital One.
While the risk of an underwaturmous mortgage-style explosion is low, the danger of gradual weakening is far more real.
If lower house prices and debt-reduction push America into recession, the credit card industry will be ahead of a darker future.
Watch out for the dorsal fins.
British bankers plead guilty in Enron case
Three British bankers who were to be tried for their roles in the fraud associated with former Enron financial manager Andrew Fastow changed their testimony on Wednesday and pleaded guilty.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby, and Gary Mulgrew had originally pleaded guilty on seven charges of fraud, having participated in financial fraud together with Fastow in 2000 -- to be enriched at the expense of their employers -- denied.
They were due to stand trial in January.
However, during a court appearance before U.S. District Judge Ewing Werlein Jr., each pleaded guilty to a fraud.
The case of the three former Greenwich NatWest executives, a Royal Bank of Scotland Group's unit, was on the front pages for the full two years of the extradition procedure.
In the United States, their case is one of the unclaonshoiled part of an investigation into the begun after the collapse of Enron in 2001.
The allegations against them in 2002 alerted Mr. Fastow that the government's investigation into the collapse of Enron had been the target of the government's investigation.
The indictment against the bankers -- who earned the nickname "NatWest Three" -- claiming to have come to Houston in 2000 to consecut deception with Fastow and his former chief aide, Michael Kopper.
Greenwich NatWest invested in a partnering subsidiary of Enron, controlled by Fastow, which was the architect of a lot of enronic fraud that pushed Enron through a spiral toward declaring bankruptcy.
At the beginning of 2002, the bank valued its stake in this branch with a zero, but our three Britons knew it was in fact of considerable value.
Under Kopper's control, the company bought the bank's stake in that branch for $1 million.
The incriminating bankers paid Kopper $250,000 for a stake in the company.
According to the indictment, Fastow misleadingly informed Enron that the energy company would pay $20 million for its stake in that subsidiary to Greenwich NatWest.
But the 20 million were actually for British bankers, Fastow and others.
The bankers received $7.3 million, according to the indictment, and Fastow, Kopper, and others were up by about $12.3 million.
In January 2004, Fastow pleaded guilty in two instances of a conspiracy to play in the collapse of Enron.
The British trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow is currently serving a six-year sentence at the Louisiana Federal Prison.
Kopper is serving a sentence of three years and one months at a facility in Texarkana.
All three Britons were on the loose on bail of $1 million, which ordered them to remain in the United States for the upcoming trial.
Enron, the country's seventh-largest company, went bankrupt in December 2001 after years of accounting tricks could no longer hide billions in debt or report failing speculation as profitable.
The collapse cut thousands of jobs, more than $60 billion in market values and more than $2 billion in pension insurance.
Enron founder Kenneth Lay and former senior senior senior executive Jeffrey Skilling were convicted of their roles in the company's downfall last year.
Skilling is in the execution of more than 24 years of punishment.
Judgments over Laya for conspiracy, fraud and other charges were deleted after he died of heart disease last year.
Moscow's non-powerlessness
The price of the Gulfstream G550, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and with a sufficient fuel volume for nonstop flight from Moscow to Los Angeles, starts at $54 million.
For some of the Russian rich, however, it is the change for the return.
"It can carry up to 18 passengers," says Dan Firer, a Gulfstream representative.
"But none of them are interested in that many jobs, because it's for a close family or a corporate president."
Mr. Firer was sitting in the Gulfstream stand last Friday at the Millionaire Exhibition, a four-day orgy of a spectacular consumerist in the mammoth showroom on the outskirts of the capital.
In addition to the Gulfstream, over 200 other luxury suppliers built their stalls, hoping that the newly-naked Russians would lure the newly-naked Russians to all of the mahogany-encrusted yachts to diamond-encrusted car bulkheads that would not be ashamed of even 50 Cent.
Mr. Firer looked cautiously at the bright orange Porsche in the next stand.
"That's a nice car, but against us it's the dimes and dimes," he said.
"After the United States, Russia is the second largest private aircraft market."
Money flocks to the Russian capital on the waves of oil to the Russian capital as it did when Dallas had its days.
"We went through the same stage in the 1980s when some Americans got immensely rich and dragged to Europe, where they were looked at as materialists," said Marshall Goldman, a fourth-year listener at the Davis Center of the Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard.
Like the Saudi spendthripe of the 1970s and the Japanese in the 1990s, the Russians are becoming the world's most prominent spenders.
The most exclusive luxury brands are looking for a piece on this Klondik.
At another site in Moscow this week, the luxury industry conference of Donatell Versace, Tom Ford and Bernardo Arnault, the chairman of the LVMH group, drew on ideas about how to sell expensive goods at markets like the Russian one.
(The conference is organised by The International Herald Tribune, which is owned by The New York Times Company.)
Russia, according to the list of the richest people, has 53 billionaires with a total fortune of $282 billion.
In addition, the local main institute in the Center for Economic and Financial Research published a report on the development of personal wealth in the former Soviet Union, according to which there are 103,000 "secrate" millionaires in Russia, with a total of $670 billion in assets.
(The World Bank reports that in 2005 15.8% of Russians lived below the subsistence level.)
"There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow -- and that's why we're all here," said Nicole Marais, the sales and marketing representative of the London jewelry store, David Morris.
It was at the fair for the first time, together with the Russian distributor of the brand, the Soho Jewelry Group.
"All women are impeccably groomed, and the men are all for a fortune."
As they walked in the evening dresses on Sunday night with the halls, 21-year-old Evgenia Yumatova, and Svetlana Turovcov, five years her senior, called herself and her clients millionaires.
"I was looking at the cars and I can't decide between Infiniti, Mercedes and Porsche," said Miss Yumatova, who was wrapped in designer clothes like a red carpet veteran next to whom Joan Rivers looks like a home-grown hittarian.
The fair seemed to be focused primarily on the fresh upstarts, designer-driven Russian shoppers who are willing to sit out for a few hours in the road traffic to walk around the warehouse, which the garishly mixing Cadillacy Escalade, the platinum fish, the Mövenpick ice cream, the metallic tables to measure, the apartments in Dubai, the Gund plushers and the draughts.
Members of the simple public could buy tickets for 30 euros ($44.57.
"The Russians are interested in which brand is the most expensive and the best," said Mr Gijrath, who patriotically occupied the stall of the Dutch porcelain producer Royal Delft before reproducing Rembrandt's painting from hand-painted blue tiled in size.
"Of course the Russians are more interested in the facade."
Indeed, the shopkeepers here say that the Russians with their old money (according to the Russian standards it is 10 to 15 years old), have moved from the gleamy logos to the little-known brands of limited editions that would never have shown up at the shopping fair.
Even so, several thousand people, whether millionaires, millionaires, or simple tourists, flooded the fair halls day after day.
And some of them were shopping.
On the first day of the show, last Thursday, Roman Ershov, the local general manager of the King Koil bed, said he had sold two mattress sets of silk, cashmere and cotton, laced with gold threads, after $70,000 each.
Also on the first day, Mikhail Lyubimov, sales manager of A1 Moto, told the company that equips high-end cars with high-end alarms that his company sold the bright orange Porsche for $17,70,000 to a Russian millionaire.
On Sunday afternoon, Andrey Karapetian, the president of L.A. Connection, which, on request, is adjusting luxury cars, said three bars to cars in the style of connected chain bracelets for the Rolls-Royce Phantoms for $55,000 each.
He showed the reporter the car's bike designed for the casino's Russian owner, which had a fuse coated with Swarovsky crystals in a way that looked like roulette.
Price: $22,000 for four of those.
"The Russian millionaire who wants lamb's leather bikes or a portrait of his cubic zirconium wife doesn't have to ride on those bikes yet," said Mr. Karapetian.
"They'll put them in their garage of thirty to forty cars."
While many of his Russian clients are wealthy, Mr. Karapetian said, the phrase "Russian millionaire" is not much exclusive at the moment, given the large increase in the prices of the local properties.
"If you bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, you're probably already millionaires, at least on paper, if not in cash," he said.
"There are more of them than you think."
Those who are not millionaires could at least feign wealth at a booth run by the Russian company Alliance Continental, which is engaged in asset management.
The company erected four red British-style phone booths stuffed in a column of fake banknotes worth a million dollars.
Azad Karryev, the company's marketing manager, said his team had printed out 500,000 fake banknotes for the Millionaires' Trade Fair.
Passers-by stopped by to throw around a bunch of money, or to have friends' pictures taken with their mobile phones, resting in the middle of a spare richer richer, or simply stuffed a pocket for a few million.
"You see, in Moscow, anyone can feel like a millionaire," Mr. Karryev said.
Death in New Jersey possibly caused by corrupt surgery
It was the day before Thanksgiving when Roland Livingston looked out of the big windows of the local O restaurant a little more healthily and watched an ambulance that had come to a white New England house two houses from West Scott Avenue.
Soon a police patrol car joined in.
And then another one.
"Then I saw the medical examiner's van arrive," said Mr. Livingston, the restaurant inspector.
"At that moment, I knew someone had died."
Authorities learned that the dead woman was Olga Arroya, 41, the executive assistant to the director of the New Ark Police Department.
Now, investigators are trying to determine if she died because of a procedure performed by an unencicapped plastic surgeon, whose identity the police refused to provide, who worked at house number 212 on West Scott Avenue.
Authorities have yet to determine what caused Miss Arroyo's death, and they hope that the toxicology tests, the results of which may not be known for weeks, will help resolve the mysterious death that sent the NewGarian police leadership of the New Arms Police Department.
Miss Arroy had been an assistant to the police director, Garry F. McCarthy, since September of 2006, and her voice has been known to many in the department.
"She was loyal, tough, and worked hard," Mr. McCarthy said of Miss Arroye in a phone call on Wednesday.
"She was my shield.
She would protect me."
Mr McCarthy said that Ms. Arroyo was the wife of Jimmy Arroyo, a former NewGraeli police officer who works for the Alcoholic Beverage Inspeva Agency, and that she left behind two sons, aged 14 and 11, and her stepdaughter.
Eileen Walsh, spokeswoman for the District Attorney General of the Union, Theodora J. Romankow, said detectives were trying to determine if Miss Arroy died from an unencenaised surgical surgery.
"It's one possibility," said Miss Walsh.
"The investigation is still ongoing."
Authorities said they arrived at the house at about 3 p.m.
November and found Miss Arroy on the sofa.
She was pronounced dead at the scene.
More than a week later, the authorities still said little of their investigation or the owner of the house, which is allegedly Flor Margarita Castro.
Miss Walsh did not say if the authorities had interviewed Miss Castro.
Investigators are trying to determine if part of the house was used as a surgery.
On Wednesday at Miss Castro's house, with a damaged pink bush in the front yard and a Dalmatine barking in the back, no one answered
Next to the door that led to the basement, a blue barrel with the inscription "Ethyl Vanillin" was sitting in the open garage - a substance used as a substitute for vanilla in food and cosmetics.
On the hooks on one side hung two mountain bikes.
Mr. McCarthy recalled that when he first arrived in New York City Police Department in Newark for the 25 years, Ms. Arroyo had given him invaluable help chewing through the intolerant and harsh political culture of his new city.
"She said, 'You'd better be careful about this or this,'" he said.
"She'd always be here when I came in, and she'd always be here when I left.
It was embarrassing."
Hopes that Fed to cut interest rates lead to world stock exchanges boost
Stock prices on both sides of the Atlantic jumped yesterday after the market's hopes that the Federal Bank would try to ease lending terms by further lowering interest rates were reinforced by the reassuring remarks of the Vice-President of the US Federal Reserve.
The stock markets jumped in London, New York and across Europe after Donald Kohn, second in line behind Ben Bernanke, the Fed chairman, said that responding to continued pressure in the financial markets must be "flexible and pragmatic" management.
As a showman's attempt to soothe the exasperated markets amid signs of a hint of a resurfusion of credit effort, Mr Kohn said that the recent excitement "partially reversed some improvements in the functioning of the markets at the end of September and in October."
He also said that if increased instability persists, the possibility of households and businesses becoming worse in financial conditions will increase.
Investors view these statements as a signal that the Fed is prepared to deliver more fresh capital benefits to US markets, and perhaps further interest-rate cuts to the US markets, to stabilize credit terms.
These remarks also helped reassure Wall Street amid more bad news about the US economy, when housing sales were at record low in October.
The consequences of the financial swirling were underlined by the announcement by the investment bank Bear Stearns to cut 650 jobs, 4% of its world's workforce, in order to reduce costs to compensate for the heavy losses caused by the failed bet on providing inferior home loans in America.
Only 20 of these posts are expected to be cancelled in London, where the bank employs 1,500 people.
In New York, the Dow Jones industry index grew by 331 points, or 2.55 percent, to close at 13,289.40, while the more used S&P 500 rose 2.65 percent.
London's FTSE 100 was up 165.5 points, or 2.7 percent, closing to 6,306.2, with the value of British blue-chips rising by more than £39 billion.
Germany's Dax index rose 2.6 percent, with France's CAC40 up 2.3 percent.
Some time ago, credit tensions in the markets proved to be in full force after the European Central Bank's three-month cash-on cash package auction were lent to European commercial banks at 4.7%, the highest since April 2001.
The pressure on the English Bank to follow the Fed and the ECB and launch above-standard money on the London money markets has been increased, with the rates of three-month British interbanking loans "Libor" rising to their maximum since the end of September - 6.59 per cent after uninterrupted growth from 12 November.
England must decide: Owais Shah, or Ravi Bopara?
We have two dilemmas, one almost as heavy as the other.
Who will be number six at bat for England this weekend in Kandy, Owais Shah, or Ravi Bopara?
And, in a broader context, no less relevant than the first Test against Sri Lanka, who is to make this decision?
The second question is therefore relevant because David Graveney, chairman of the selection board, who holds for the post at best in the borrowed time, has Peter Moores, the head coach, and Michael Vaughan, the captain, the decision-making to help, and as Hugh Morris's desk, the England team's chief executive, begins to perform with applications for the post of national collector, albeit not necessarily full-time.
Whoever is not put up in sixth place at bat will be unhappy, but life is often not fair and sport is certainly not at all.
It is not easy to find what one gets to the top of his profession, while someone else never gets past a lower level, sometimes because of lack of happiness rather than abilities.
It is not only in cricket that the selection is challenging and requires a report that always has to be subjective in the end.
Is it right time for Bopara to move up?
It's fair to Shah if he is?
The same we could ask about the same in another area, let's say that here: John Edwards or "Tubby" Banerjee, both smart young executives with a good education and overview in the field, should be promoted to the commission - a place is only for one.
Who's to say which level is right for cricketers if you can't help but drop or swim to the next one?
Naturally, the numbers have a big impact on decision-making, but so do the opportunities.
In the team, a cricketer has to capture the captain's view at the right time to see if he should take the wicket, and the batter needs regular chances at starting positions, if he should ever make an impression as a one-day cricketer.
Captaining the collector's view is more complicated.
For example, there were many better ones last season that James Anderson, whose place in the first Test seems certain, even if Stephen Harmison declared himself healthy and pitchered as a gunner.
Anderson took 32 wickets in the first class at 33 over-releals for each.
Chris Tremlett took only 29 at the same scorpable average, but both had their moments at the highest level and are hoping for more.
Whether he will play at the Asgiriya Shah stadium or Bopara can only be a matter of opinion.
The choice can start or reach the careers of both, or it may not have much of an impact.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka, Gareth played Batty in every Test and performed well in the first grade, five wickets and 40 vacation runs, but it was Paul Collingwood, who at the same time was fighting for his job, who eventually became a stable Test cricketer who is also, despite scoring twice a hundred points in Australia against Australia, perhaps still underestimated.
It is more likely that Graveney, Vaughan and Moores, after one more discussion in the wake of today's training session at the Asirgiya Stadium, will be followed by their conservative instincts and prefer Shah's greater experience to Bopar's youthful buoyancy.
There are arguments for both of them.
For Shah, his sparkling and valuable debut Test shifts speak at 88 points in Mumbai and 32 hundred in the first class, compared to the six Bopar, who is, at 22, seven years younger and has excellent statistics against spin pities.
However, in two shifts in May against the Caribbean in Test at Lord's, his home playground in Middlesex, only ten runs, and that, together with the immediate refusal of the collectors, when Vaughan wanted to reapit him for the next game, his launch seems to have taken something of the vigor that was so evident in Bombaji.
The Espsex Aller, on the other hand, has joie de vivre in his bones.
Nothing befels at the cricket field, and his behaviour off the pitch is symbolized by a recently overturned four-wheel-drive car on the exhibition day of the English team's car sponsor, Volkswagen.
He escaped with minor injuries and probably shock, but the first thing he did was to pull out his Vodafone (also sponsored, of course) and called Alastair Cook, his teammate, who watched from a distance to ask him excitedly, "Did you see it?"
Bopara is definitely better in the field, his mid-fast shear pitch on the local playgrounds, which seem to suit him, gives out effectively and batches with confidence and skill.
Choosing the right person is one thing, choosing the right time is another.
Perhaps it is the real art of choice.
Personally, I'm inclined to get Bopara's chance now, which I don't want to say is that Shah won't excel if, as the Ceylon tea leaves suggest, it's he who's going to play here next weekend.
Buses bring refugees back to work - and to fight al-Qaida
The first buses full of Iraqi refugees from Syria began arriving in Baghdad yesterday, spitting out refugees who had run out of money or expired, and others who hoped the city was returning to a normal life.
Some even returned to fight the militants who had driven them from their homes.
The Mansour bus station was already before 800 people arrived from Damascus in an official government convoy of a dozen buses, filled with refugees from Syria and Jordan, who returned by private transport.
"I decided to go to Syria after many doctors were killed in Baghdad," said Sabah al-Qubai, a Sunni doctor.
"Today I came back because of what I saw on TV and what I read in the newspapers about, because of what was happening in Baghdad and how safe it is now.
"They say the Mahdi army has stopped killing people," he said, referring to the Shiite militant cleric Muktad al-Sadra, who temporarily ordered his people to stop the fight.
Kassim al-Atwani, a 38-year-old Shiite teacher from the predominantly Sunni region of Amaria, returned with his two children because he could no longer renew his Syrian visa and because the regime there did not allow the Iraqis to work.
His Shiite neighbors in Amari called to him, saying that the local militia, with the support of the U.S. military, had helped push al-Qaida out of its positions in the west of the capital, and urged him to return.
One of the new-owner of Jordan is the leader of the Sunni and Shiite tribe, who was driven out of his home in Sleikh, northern Baghdad, after urging his fellow citizens to rise up against al-Qaida.
He came back to fight.
"A couple of friends called me the day before yesterday and told me that he was launching a militias against al-Qaeda in Sleikh, and that he needed me and the support of my boys.
That's why I came back today," said Sabaah Alu Obeidi, 62, to Sabaah.
Many spoke of the attraction of reassurance in the capital, following the strengthening of the US military presence and the growth of local "group of biased citizens" who, with a gun in their hand, defending their neighborhoods at the US military's side.
But there was more to say that they were prompted to return by obstruction around visas and the loss of money in Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis have fled in recent years.
Salaam al-Samarraj, a 51-year-old father of three, voiced the suspicion shared among the refugees that Núri al-Maliki, the Shi'ite prime minister, had asked the Syrian government to impose restrictions on the refugee visas and to force them to return.
According to the available data, more than two and a half million people fled Iraqi sectarian killers.
"Everything was fine before al-Maliki visited Syria and pressured the government to stop giving the Iraqis visas to have to go back to Iraq," the Sunni pensioner said.
"I can't trust a government that supports the criminals who burned my house after I left."
The partial reason for weakening the violence is that Sunnis have been forced out of the Shiite regions and vice versa, which reduces tensions in many places.
There are fears that the sudden influx of refugees will once again fuel sectarian tensions and lead to further fighting.
The Malist Sarsko, a good education
The smallest federal state of Germany plays a leading role in vocational training, excelling even by the international focus of its universities.
Only in one educational field is Sara's concern the same shortcomitage as the rest of Germany.
"I explained to a man who does not come from Sara yesterday for the fiftieth time that we are not French" - this self-ironic slogan appears in the Sarask posters on the 50th anniversary of the birthday of this smallest federal state.
At the same time, France and Luxembourg play a big role in the training system of the Cologne Institute for Economic Research (IW) in the training monitoring of the training of the Cologne Institute in fifth place.
Universities have traditionally co-operating closely with the surrounding countries.
The University of Saarbrücken was founded in 1948 by the French.
To this day, students can finish their studies with a double or even triple degree.
Which is the proportion of a high proportion of foreign students, which is 15.6%.
After all, the above-average number of sárské children are admitted to a college - many of them without studying at the grammar school.
"A professional education system is being used in Sársk," says Axel Plünnecke, IW's educational expert.
By earwwifens more than one in five juveniles are licensed to study in a vocational school, Sara is more than 7% above the German average.
Compared to the rest of Germany, there are rich opportunities in Sara to combine practical and academic education.
The opportunities to study two disciplines are the second best in the whole of Germany with regard to the population.
Despite virtually oriented education and rising demand, the number of engineering graduates has fallen by a third in recent years.
That is why the Ministry of Education has now ordered universities to create a promotional campaign for the engineering sector.
"After the first study by Pisa, we have conducted several reforms in general education schools," says a spokesperson for the Ministry of Education.
The government has therefore introduced comparative tests throughout Germany.
For children to start learning as soon as possible, the last year of the nursery school is a free one - a model taken over by other Länder.
If the pupils' results improve significantly, future comparative studies will show.
In conducting the Pisa study in 2003, the proportion of at-risk pupils decreased from 29 to 20%.
In total, however, the Arabic did not improve by as much as other Länder.
The Bavarians can count better.
And to the disappointment of Sara, the Pisa study does not compare the knowledge of foreign languages - otherwise, Sársko could score in this area.
The language of the neighbours is compulsory in grammar schools - even if the people of Sársko are not French.
Chávez moves the clock
The clock in Venezuela will go differently than in the rest of the world.
On December 9, President Hugo Chávez will have the clock moved back in this South American country by half an hour.
In Spain, meanwhile, Chávez becomes a ridiculous figurehead.
The official Venezuelan newspaper reported that the clock would shift by minus four and a half hours under the new law compared to world time.
The South American state will be taking this step in a time zone that does not exist in any other country in the world.
Chávez, the enemy of the US, justified his decision by, among other things, for the United States fordating the time-bands to the world over the hours.
In addition, on Wednesday, local time, Chavéz announced that he was severing relations with neighboring Colombia over the hostage case.
This left-wing nationalist has said that as long as the conservative Alvaro Uribe is president of Colombia, he will not maintain any relations with him or with the Colombian government.
"I can't help but for my self-esteem," said Chávez, who advocates reform of the constitution that the citizens of this oil country must vote on in Sunday's referendum.
With this reform, Chávez would significantly strengthen his power in the country.
The argument was sparked by Uribe's decision to withdraw Chávez's mandate to negotiate with the Marxist rebels in Colombia for the release of the hostages.
Uribe's decision to "spit in the face" of Venezuela, criticizing Uribe Chávez on Sunday.
In Spain, too, everyone talks about Chávez.
The new mobile ringtone has caused a stir here: "Por qué no te callas" (Why aren't you already quiet?) - that's the line the line that more than half a million people have already downloaded from the internet.
It was made out by King Juan Carlos of Spain, who was so upset by the vocal remarks made by this left-wing populist at the recent Ibero-American summit to silence him in this way.
Germans face lower payouts in 2007
According to the forecast, this year German employees are at risk of lowering their real wages despite a strong boom.
Experts justified their pessimistic forecast with a number of reasons.
According to estimates by the Hans Böckler Foundation, in 2007 employed people can realistically expect to receive a lower wage than last year.
"The blame lies with a small salary increase, an increase in value added tax and an increase in food and energy prices," Gustav Horn of the IMK Research Institute (Institut für Makroökonomie und Konjunkturforschung) told Bild.
New charges for employees may also be in the area of unemployment insurance.
Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück told newspaper Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung that the planned reduction of the unemployment insurance contributions to 3.3% was in this situation for the new year.
However, the Federal Labour Agency would no longer be allowed to fall into such difficulties in order to require loans or contributions from the Federal Mint, the newspaper of this social-democratic politician has been quoted as saying.
On Tuesday, it was disclosed that a price explosion in food and petroleum products drove inflation to its highest level in thirteen years.
Overall, prices rose three percent in the year.
Venus is the infernal twin of the Earth
Despite its life hostile atmosphere, Venus Earth is more similar to what was previously assumed. The European Venus Express spacecraft on Venus has recorded phenomena that also appear on Earth in winter: lightning in the atmosphere and wind vorus at the poles.
For nearly three decades, scientists have suspected that it flashed on Venus.
Now the European probe Venus Express has produced evidence - it has captured electromagnetic waves at the edge of the atmosphere. On Venus, lightning between the cloud flying from cloud to cloud at an altitude of about 56 kilometers, Christopher Russel of the University of California, Los Angeles, wrote in the science magazine Nature.
According to the known theory of the formation of primal mass, life could have arisen on Earth thanks to lightning. The storms reportedly provoked reactions in the oceans that led to the creation of the amino acids, the cornerstones of life.
It was not the case on Venus: "If life ever existed there, it must have been a very long time ago," explains Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institute in Washington.
Today, there would hardly be anything alive on the surface of Venus. The atmosphere is about 100 times denser than on Earth, and sometimes there are temperatures of around 500 °C.
"Henwe may be the Hell's twin of Earth, but he's a twin," Russel said.
Why Venus, which is so much of a mass of Earth and in size, has started to develop in a completely different way is a fundamental question of the Assos mission.
Since no probe has been launched since the early 1990s solely for the purpose of studying Venus, the launch of the Venus Express probe in November 2005 was a milestone in research on this planet.
According to scientists, the latest research results, which were approached by several articles by the journal of the journal, did not just emphasicit the uniqueness of Venus in the solar system.
"They also showed that our neighboring planet is more like Earth than previously believed," Esa said.
In addition to the already known wind vortic vortic in the North Pole, scientists found a cloud-based whirl on the South Pole that is significantly faster.
This phenomenon is reminiscent of the aerial currents in the Earth's northern hemisphere, writes a research team led by Guiseppe Piccioni of the Instituto di Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica.
The second innermost planet in our solar system is made up of almost the same mass as Earth, and with a diameter of 12,100 km, it is almost the same size.
This planet, referred to as Jitřenka or Evening Star, the Sun or Liccumbar will orbit the Sun in nearly 225 days.
But it rotates around its own axis much more slowly. One day on Venus takes 243 days on Earth.
Although Venus's surface temperature of 460 °C and the pressure of 92 bar (abbreviation for the bar?) does not resemble Earth, scientists are based on the fact that the two planets were created under very similar conditions.
Water accumulated on both of them. On Earth, however, it remained in the oceans, while it was leans from Venus to space.
While carbon dioxide on Earth is bound to Earth in carbonates, it forms the majority of the atmosphere on Venus.
Köhler defends Merkel's meeting with the Dalai Lama
Federal President Köhler is calling for the cessation of party disputes over the adoption of the Dalai Lama in the Chancellery.
He indirectly criticized the SPD for its attacks on the chancellor after a mutual meeting in September.
Federal President Horst Köhler is worried about Germany's reputation and calls on the grand coalition to end the feast surrounding the Dalai Lama's adoption.
"We should not present ourselves outwardly as a nation that is not united on this issue," Köhler told the economic newspaper Handelsblatt.
At the same time, he expressed his understanding of German Chancellor Angela Merkel's (CDU) decision to accept the Dalai Lama in September.
"Although I respect cultural differences, human rights have universal validity for me," Köhler said.
The Federal President, while emphasizing that everyone knows that Germany must maintain a reasonable balance in foreign policy, that has not prevented him from defending Merkel when she was blamed for creating a new policy toward China.
"The SPS did not drop the traditional policy of a single China.
China knows that, too," Köhler said.
Secretary of State Frank-Walter Steinmeier (SPD) indirectly signaled his opposition to the adoption of the Dalai Lama, and was attacked by the coalition for this.
Steinmeier complained, among other things, about the coalition's "dimmain" foreign policy.
After the Dalai Lama's reception in the chancellor's office, German-Chinese relations deteriorated.
Not only did the Chinese government cancel the invitation of German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück (SPD), but, according to SPIEGEL, it has also froze the so-called strategic dialogue between the foreign ministries of both countries.
Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jiabao called on Chancellor Angela Merkel to acknowledge that the adoption of the Dalai Lama was a mistake.
China does not approve of European politicians officially accepting the Tibetan spiritual leader, Wen Jiabao stressed China's position.
Words and actions of the Dalai Lama have shown that Tibet, along with other Tibetan regions also located on the territory of China, is attempting to separate from China.
Schäuble warns of similar unrest that erupted in France
Street battles with police, firefights, set-mates. Wolfgang Schäuble warns of similar riots that broke out in France.
We must do everything we can to ensure that social discontent in Germany does not escalately into violence on the street, the Federal Minister of the Interior calls for.
Barricades were on fire, rioters shotguns at the police. After major juvenile riots in France, Federal Interior Minister Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) is also concerned about similar developments in Germany.
"We must be careful that we also do not create the kind of social tension that will erupt into violence.
We have to take this seriously," he told the Neue Presse newspaper in Hanover.
Not every young person is said to be able to cope with a quick change in social reality.
The Federal Government, countries and municipalities are already working hard to eliminate the problems, Schäuble said.
This does not just mean the integration of migrants.
"From the Summit on Integration to the conference on Islam, we have seen our first successes."
However, caution is still in order.
At the same time, Schäuble pointed out that the planning and sociological problems of German suburbs were not comparable to those of the French.
At the past night, juveniles and police in the northern suburbs of Paris have fought harsh street fights.
Even in Toulouse, cars and public buildings were on fire.
Greater integration efforts by the German government was demanded by the president of the Turkish municipality in Germany, Kenan Kolat.
In light of the unrest in France, Kolat warned against an "imitation effect."
The situation in Germany should not be as explosive as it is in France.
Nevertheless, action should be taken.
Kolat pointed out that among people under the age of 25, who come from a migrant family, the unemployment rate is "above-average high."
Above all, it is necessary to ensure a greater number of learning opportunities.
Kolat emphasized: "We must give the juveniles hope."
But the president of the Turkish municipality added that there is more social control of families in Germany, unlike in France.
Moreover, many teenagers from migrant backgrounds do not want to destroy what their parents have built here.
Kolat said, "Still, we have to be careful."
We need to "requistly allow the juvenile mins to start work and educate themselves."
Meanwhile, the night remained largely calm in the Paris suburb of Villiers-le-Bel.
Hundreds of police officers were deployed, and a helicopter was flying over the area with headlights.
Authorized authorities reported three arrests and several lit-up trash bins and cars.
Since yesterday, the peace has been taken care of by approximately 1,000 deployed riot forces.
Police will intervene for as long as necessary, she announced after a visit to the suburb by Interior Minister Michelle Alliot-Marie.
In riots in the outskirts of the suburb of Villiers-le-Bel, about 80 police officers were injured overnight Tuesday.
The following night, the riots engulfed Toulouse.
The messing was sparked by Sunday's traffic accident, in which two teenagers lost their lives.
According to the initial findings of the prosecution, the police are not guilty of the deaths of juveniles.
In the Reich of Angela, "Citizen's"
The chancellor's reality is documented by the distant output that the coalition is programmatically at the end, and that we can't expect anything more from it either.
What country does this chancellor live in?
After her, dummic, indifferently sounding and content-poor appearance at the Bundestag's general debate, we must say: not here - not here - not in this country, which, after all, she should administer.
The reprohecy of being too concentrated on foreign policy was once answered by Angela Merkel in a very arrogant sentence.
That's provincial, she said, showing she didn't want to understand what the critics were up to.
In the Bundestag, she visibly demonstrated to everyone how much she deserved the remorse.
There was no real interest in Merkel, let alone a flair for the problems in the country.
Instead, Angela presented herself with a "Couglain": a politician who excel at the others who flee to foreign policy and, even there, is only vaguely.
Climate protection, for example: it is praised without ceasing to follow the conclusions of the Heiligendamm summit, but it no longer says how the climate targets are to be achieved in Germany.
Anyway, such a self-clare - that's how much immodest, the CDU chairwoman would have forgiven two years ago.
It is now confined to idle phrases that could increase its popularity among people.
With this approach, it damages his imij pragmatics, who need not be flattered because it solved problems.
But in the Reich of Angela, "Citles" internal political problems are a fringe issue.
Child poverty and the worries of low-paick people?
A few of the secondary sentences on these topics were left.
It is worth noting how often Merkel is recited when it comes to child benefit.
Three times Merkel has to start from the start to speak at least partially the correct sentence.
Once things get too specific, it stumbles like it's in completely foreign terrain.
Department of the Attack
The debate of the Republican presidential candidates' Youtube has sparked in a fierce debate in the case of the favorites Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney - and both must now fear an outsider candidate.
The tension of both candidates is already reflected in the first topic.
Mitt Romney is throwing his rival, Ruda, Guiliim, that he has turned New York into a "hispee for illegal immigrants."
Giuliani quickly responds with sharp reproach: "I believe his own house was just one such refuge," he replies, throwing former governor Massachusetts back at the fact that he privately employed undocumented immigrants.
Candidates are on the offensive. With the Republican base not yet in clear front-runner, eight presidential candidates are using these CNN debates mainly to discredit their opponents.
The half-minute, internet-based user-movaped and video-lotched videos only serve as such clues to the key theme.
"Exactly as such a policy of isolationism, we have allowed Hitler to seize power," John McCain pitches to his rival, Ron Paul, who is the only one advocating an immediate withdrawal of troops from Iraq.
Vietnamese veteran McCain does not spare Romney's remorse for refusing to denounce the tortured method of interrogation called "Waterboarding" in which the heating is simulated.
The reaction of the audience in St. Petersburg, Florida, shows that neither the war of Iraq nor the methods of torture are among the important topics of the campaign.
The audience is applauded whenever conservative values are praised and future tax increases rejected.
That'll show where the weaknesses of both favorites lie.
"I was wrong at the time," Romney explains contritely, asking the party base and the TV audience for forgiveness for being in favour of the abortion being in favour of the abortion in 1994.
Giuliani is embarrassed to comment on the literal interpretation of the Bible.
Musharraf reigns in civilian clothes for the first time
The day after his resignation as commander-in-chief of the army, the Pakistani ruler, Musharraf, took the presidential oath of office.
That concludes the eight years of military rule in Pakistan.
The president of Pakistan, Pervez, Musharraf, took the presidential oath of office on Thursday, staying in the presidency for another five years.
Pakistani television broadcast live a ceremony held at the presidential palace in the capital, Islamabad.
Musharraf vowed to honor the Constitution and seek the well-being of the nation.
On Wednesday, he handed over his office to the commander-in-chief of the army to his confidante, Ashfaq Kiyani, undergoing international pressure, especially from the US.
Eight years after he seized power in a bloodless military coup, the former general reigns for the first time as a civilian head of state.
With the resignation from the position of commander-in-chief of the armed forces, Musharraf met one of the main demands of the opposition and the West.
Another central requirement is the lifting of the state of emergency, which Musharraf announced on 3 November.
According to Attorney General Malik Muhammad Qayyum, Musharrah will be lifted by the state of emergency soon after his oath, fulfilling another of the West's demands.
The country's Supreme Court, which took Musharraf after the state of emergency was declared by his inclined lawyers at the beginning of November, rejected all objections to the contested re-election of the head of state on 6 October.
Meanwhile, in an attack on a military convoy in the tribal area of North Wazaristan, five soldiers were killed and four others were wounded.
A spokesman for the army said the bomb exploded on a road near the border with Afghanistan.
Fathers of krautrock return
The famous German group of the 1970s is playing again. Three members of the Harmonia group re-racing their electronic synthesizers at a concert in Berlin.
The Revival will also include the 1974 Live Live, a cut from the band's most successful period.
They were already considerably better known abroad.
The announced sensation then consists of the performance of three sedate gentlemen, who at first look as if they were just enjoying dinner.
Everyone has a box, cables and mainly buttons in front of them.
Dieter Moebius, 60, in a snow-white shirt, sits in the middle.
On his left is Michael Rother, 57, who has a laptop and a guitar in front of him.
The 73-year-old Hans-Joachim Roedelius, who is leaning intently over the synthesizers, is on the right from the viewers' point of view.
Each contributes sounds, sometimes even beats.
Sometimes, inadvertently, they will be a traditional piece.
It seems like the musicians don't mind much.
Among the lovers of the krautrock, the Turchedi band's revival caused quite a stir.
One thing here is worth noting. Repeated questions have shown that while this name is part of a collective awareness of pop, it is certainly not so well established that this band is in painstallen for twenty-three years.
But why could a German not even celebrate his still-living seventies legends?
And especially when he values the musical style, mistakenly called krautrock, in England and in America than in his own country.
In 2003, when the music business awarded the members of the Cologne group Can the Echo Award for his life's work, the hall was full of questioning views of German pop fans.
Moreover, when the Red Hot Chili Peppers thanked the groups La Düsseldorf and Neu! in their speech, the astonishment of the viewers no longer knew the bounds.
Michael Rother later sat on stage with them during the Red Hot Chili Peppers concerts as their old friend.
The problem of ignorance at home and adoration abroad is one thing.
By remembering the band Harmonia, we unnecessarily overload the memory, this trio existed for only two years, and even at the time it was far from the influence that others later attributed to them.
Moebius and Roedelius had previously played with the artist Conrad Schnitzler under the promising name of Cluster.
They initially played in the cellar of the Schaubühne Theatre in Berlin.
Then in Düsseldorf, for economic reasons, a gramophone firm run by the church.
Rother helped out briefly with the Kraftwerk group, but gained a reputation as a guitarist with the band Neu!, which at the time may have been the most radical German group.
In 1973, Rother followed the band's Cluster musicians into exile in Forst, Weserbergland.
There, in the Old Weserhof, a 16th-century ruin, they lived as members of the commune who had fled the city.
They did not survive here as ideologically as in the communiqué I, where Roedelius was still allowed toil like a nanny.
It was more like a life in such a Spitzwegov artistic being.
The name for the art is reportedly derived from the name of the choir Harmonia Ottenstein, whose badge was allegedly found in a garbage can.
Many of this has been preserved by Harmonia.
The first album was called "Music by Harmony" and the following "De Luxe".
Although their music sounded so calm and modest, the band suffered financial difficulties.
Collecting the ros did not serve only self-knowledge.
The now-reveased CD "Live 1974" was said to have been cut at a concert in Griesse before a record-breaking small, barely 50-pound backdrop.
Rothera had said his wish then that the members of Harmony would heckle and practise occasionally.
For Roedlio and Moebio, it was a completely indecent request.
In 1975, the band announced their split.
Rother ended up in the esoteric sphere and insured his future with the album "Burning Hearts."
The band Cluster came back to reanimate in the 1980s and has been more successful ever since before than Harmonia ever was.
For the live album from Griessemer, we can be grateful to Herbert Grönemeyer.
His record company, Grönland, took the goal of cherish the krautrock as the original German contribution to live music.
The band Neu! was at that time considered Roedeli's solo work.
The heat resurrection of Harmony will take place at the Berlin House of World Cultures.
The performance at the Woldtronics Festival will be publicly sponsored.
Present will be the Brit, Julian Cope, the old pearl and author of the "Krautrock Sampler" handbook.
The founder of Love Parade, Dr. Motte, will also attend.
In doing so, we have drawn the overall breadth of the influence of krautrocka on future pop music.
The empty place of the famous group will be filled by the Harmonia.
Brian Eno's sentence accompanied by the most hirdly sounds float in the hall: "Unique real music, it's the future."
There are paintings on which the producer with Harmony is in the peasant's seat.
The projection of other black-and-white photographs on which the set of instruments are the fiercely connected cables also contribute to the creation of the legend.
Before that, the three veterans are once again employed by improvisation.
No longer by gluing the microphones to the organ and drums to get the instruments of the instruments of the never-beaten samoval-probed tones.
Today, electronic music looks like electronic music.
Three to a technique of absorbed by metclerks.
This is not changed in the choir of the House of World Cultures.
Under the direction of Barbara Morgenstern, there is a whisper under the sound clouds, and in one beautiful place, the "Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa" is emfatically emfl!
Krautrock has always been a very English term.
It was never about rock.
We would find the roots rather than in the blues at music colleges (Can), in technology (Kraftwerk) or in the flight from art and social conventions (Cluster).
Whoever shouts "'68!" in this place is not so far from the truth, but even now, Harmonia will not be taken out of peace.
The most obvious, too, is thought through on the scene.
Where does music begin and when does it end?
This question either takes one's nerve or affords one to experience the passing moments of happiness.
Richard Gere just isn't cynical enough
With the release of The Hunting Party and Mörderischer Frieden, there were two films about the war in the Balkans.
But neither of them is convincing.
The film's draft either puts too much emphasis on action and shooting, or they're too moving.
This is not prevented in The Hunting Party by an actor like Richard Gere.
The good news first: War criminals Karadzić and Mladic still hide in the Balkan mountains, but it is there, in the gloomy background of the Bosnian War, that actor Richard Gere finds himself.
We've lost sight of this most beautiful man in the '80s lately, not only because he's starred in many pleasing, unsighty roles in cool women's movies, but in conjunction with his press conferences forever on Buddhism, you'll be hungry for another movie with this actor.
And yet Richard Gere is suddenly the strongest argument for seeing The Hunting Party - Where does the hunter become prey (Why must the names of the films be so long and entwed these days?).
Gere gives a magical performance. His war reporter, Simon Hunt, is essentially who Gere might have become if fate and the film business were not so merciful: a man who has long since had his best years, but still retains a certain remarkable charm to the ruins like the wreckage.
But despite this trump, The Hunting Party, along with the German film Mörderischer Frieden, which is also entering cinemas this week, is just a sequel to the endless series of failed films about the war in the Balkans.
With the film Mörderischer Frieden, we can do a short process: This film is about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt) who save a Serbian girl from a Kosovo sniper, whereupon one of them falls in love with her.
While it is commendable that the Serbs are not presented here as the cause of all evil, this TV-slow film is changing too early in shooting and action.
The film will leave something much like the show Kobru 11, without a highway, but with the war.
The Hunting Party is an outright graphic examination of why a really good film has not been made about the Balkan War so far.
The story of three American war reporters who embark on the "fisherman," the Serbian head of war, might be the new "Acalypse" in another time and under the direction of another director and screenwriter (British Shepard, both of them).
After all, the two stories are surprisingly similar: small groups go into the forest to do something that the army is incapable of doing, but their journey becomes a road to madness.
One of the reasons for the failure of The Hunting Party is that Simon Hunt is not the debauched and sentimental cynic introduced at the start.
On the contrary, the draft will also prescribe a romantic affair with the later murdered Bosnian Muslim.
The Hunting Party film is finally to be written off after reporters are doing in the last five quickie minutes of the film what NATO, the CIA and all the world's hunters in the last five years have failed: to catch criminals and leave him to the righteous revenge of the Bosnian Muslims.
This is so against the logic of film-making that it would be worth going to the International Court in The Hague.
Yet this film has a deeply human message.
He condemns that Karadzić and Mladic are still at large, and suspect the Americans and the French (as exceptionally united here) that they are not to pursue persecution quite intensively on the basis of secret political agreements.
But good and evil are sometimes so similar, women will think of the famous Brecht poem.
In it, it's a wooden mask of an Asian demon on the writer's desk: "I look at the rushy veins on my forehead with compassion, comment: how arduous to be mean."
In films like The Hunting Party, there are exactly the kind of swollen heads that suggest how arcise it is to be good.
This problem is not limited to the subject of the war in the Balkans.
It was recently said in this newspaper that all Hollywood's films about Iraq were a major failure.
One can add to that: No good film about South Africa has ever been made before.
It's almost always true: When a star wanders around a crisis area or walks around a minefield, a film is made as Rangoon with the Patricia Arquette, the Banger of the Misquette with Angelina Jolie, or Blutdiamanten with Leonardo DiCaprio.
Maybe all the conflicts are just too close in time.
After all, it must have been decades before Hollywood could make a good Holocaust film - the Schindler's List.
Many of the film must probably mature - films that are now considered classic Vietnamese works - "The Deer Huntie," "Apocalypse" or "The "The Lanted Vest" - were in no way hailed as masterpieces at the time.
But perhaps today, when every mass murder at home appears on two screens right away, we know too much about the conflicts of this world.
The writers then do not have the ability to be needed to tell good stories flawlessly.
"To be or not to be" or "The great dictator" had become so good, for Lubitsch and Chaplin did not yet know how terrible the Nazi regime had really reigned.
Maybe you mustn't want to be good to make good movies.
Perhaps he must form a sarcastically awardly measured artistic view as the novelist Lawrence Norfolk.
When asked about the parallel between his historical novel, "Lempri's Dictionary" and "The Balkan War," he said: "Both it is only that some things never change.
Greater cities will always be very dangerous, people will always be murdered in a terrible way, and there will always be a war in Yugoslavia."
Von Beusts for criticism for the Clash of the Olympics
The mayor's resignation from hosting the Hamburg Summer Olympics has come up against fierce criticism of politics and the economy.
Many want to fight further to organize the games by the water.
But Von Beusts is urging realism in estimating the chances.
The chief executive of the Chambers of Commerce in Hamburg, Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, on Wednesday called the decision "in the business standpoint unfortunate."
No other project has recently wit has been as much of a motivation in the city as the Olympic idea.
"Without this goal, this sporting political enthusiasm could not be kept to such a high degree."
Schmidt-Trenz called on the Senate not to bury the project, but to create a new long-term concept for it, "which is based on a changed timetable."
Mayor Ole von Beust remained with his earlier testimony on Wednesday, according to which Hamburg's Olympic ambitions are unrealistic until at least 2028.
"No Hamburg, but the German Olympic Sports Union will decide on the Olympic candidacy," von Beust told the WELT ONLINE newspaper.
He pointed out that at the beginning of December the Sports Association would decide on the candidacy of Munich for the 2018 Winter Games.
"This preference means to us that we have no realistic chance of a timetable for the 2028 in the 2028."
Yet this dream is not yet over, von Beust said.
The Hamburg Sports Association (HSB) called von Beust's statements regrettable.
He is under the impression that Hamburg does not want to compete for the next twenty-five years of the Olympic Games.
"It is too early to destroy our chances by calling the plans buried at this early stage," the president of HSB, Günter Ploss, said on Wednesday.
The departure would be contrary to the testimony of the head of the Senate, which he made at the general meeting of the General German University Sports Association.
Von Beust here did not report Hamburg's candidacy for the 2015 University as a replacement for hosting the Olympic Games.
The University Sports Association Hamburg has only nominated for the candidate city in the past week.
A faction by the SPD in the Senate's Hamburg parliament has criticised the fact that it is wasting valuable time that could be used to build flats in Hamburg.
"The development of the Klein Grasbrook area was hampered by the Senate for years because it bet on the hosting of the Olympics and excluded the construction of the flats," SPD MPs Carola Veit and Jan Quast told SPD.
While the SPD for the Klein Grasbrook region was still planning the Olympics, with the entire area being used for home-based purposes later, the CDU unanimously betting on the "Olympic factor."
The 2012 Summer Olympics were a great thrilled at the time in Hamburg.
Hamburg, however, was wrecked on Leipzig.
These are not Warhol's boxes
Whoever combines the terms of Sweden and the wooden crates doesn't think about Andy Warhol, but on Ikea.
Or is it?
The wooden crates produced in Sweden currently cast dark shadows on the list of Warhol's works.
Most of it on the list of the ninety-four "Brillo boxes" of the Stockholm type are falsifications.
After the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" expressed doubts about the authenticity of the Warhols's "Brillo Boxes" of 1968, the internal research of the Modern Museet Museum in Stockholm comes with the result that brought disillusionment; the six "Brillo Boxes" given to the Museum Moderna Museet in 1995 by its former director Pontus Hultén, are copies - as are most of the other "Brillo boxes" like Stockholm, which are in circulation on the international art market.
Previous events are a tangled, confusing chain of artistic and curatorial events.
Warhol made his first Brillo boxes in New York in 1964, painting wooden crates that were based on the reddish-dollar design of Brillo's paper boxes of soapy powder.
The exhibition of his works at Moderna Museet in 1968 performed - with Warhol's approval - hundreds of Brillo boxes of carton. These were not (for financial reasons) from Warhol, but were delivered directly from the Brillo factory.
These were not works of art, but their origins, mere exhibition pieces.
Warhol apparently also gave permission in 1968 to produce several wooden Brillo crates in Sweden, but these are not on display at Moderna Museet.
The witnesses at the time now speak of the fifteen crates that rightly entered art and auction history as authorized originals - "Andy Warhol's Brillo Boxy" with the designation Type Stockholm.
Some of them were auctioned for more than $100,000 at auctions.
The problem now is that the legendary director of the museum, Pontus Hultén, later falsely claimed that in 1968 it was made and displayed in Sweden by approximately one hundred crates, which Warhol then left to him.
In fact, 105 Hultén's crates were only made in Malmö for the exhibition in St. Petersburg in 1990.
By then, Warhol was three years dead.
In addition to the six Brillo boxes owned by the museum, Lars Byström, the head of the Moderna Museet, explored, in addition to the six Brillo boxes owned by the museum, two of which were made in Sweden in 1968 and, after their plywood boards were painted in the basic colour and rounded, the brush was painted in white with a brush.
On the contrary, it emerged from the 1990 copy structure that the colour was applied without a previous basic coating by the painting role directly to the plywood board - in addition, it is an acrylic and not an oil colour.
"These crates were not authorized by the artist and should be removed from Warhol's official Brillo boxing list," said the director of Moderna Museet, Lars Nittve: "If the Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board organization in New York does not come to another conclusion, Moderna Museet will have to classify six crates from his exhibition collections as "exhibition material - copies"."
As early as July, the Authentication Board announced that it would look into these "fright-wing charges" that had been raised about soapy powder boxes.
But the organization is still in stark silence.
Rebelling soldiers in Manila give up
In the Philippines, rebellious soldiers surrendered to fortify themselves at a hotel in Manila and demanded the resignation of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Rebel commander Antonio Trillanes, who accused the president of the manipulation and corruption of the election, told reporters at the hotel that he denied responsibility for the bloodshed.
Soldiers dedicated to the government had previously attacked the hotel with the use of tear gas.
Hours before, about two dozen soldiers had been fortified in the building.
On Thursday, about half of them were in court over a thwarted coup attempt in 2003, including the Trillanes.
He used the negotiations to flee with his 30 sympathizers.
The military policemen who were supposed to be guarding him apparently defected to his side and joined the rebellion.
They entered the Peninsula Hotel and demanded the resignation of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Government's loyal troops have cordoned off the area around the hotel's selected.
The president called an urgent session of the security cabinet.
National Security Adviser Norberto Gonzales condemned the actions of the soldiers.
"People have had enough," Triallnes said.
"We call on people to join us."
General Danilo Lim, commander of the former elite unit of the Scout Rangers, said that other military units would join the march in a short time.
Critics of the government called for major demonstrations to take place against the president on Friday.
For months, her government has been blamed for corruption.
The Manila financial area had already become the main site of the rebellion of about 200 soldiers against Arroyo in 2003.
As the rebels were refused to join the army, the rebellion failed after less than 24 hours.
Since 1986, they have tried at least seven times in the Philippines to overthrow a democratically elected government.
United Internet becomes majority shareholder of Versatel
United Internet has secured a more than 20 percent stake in the telecommunications enterprise Versatel.
The company announced on Wednesday that the average price per share was 14.46 euros.
The company is now said to own 20.05% of the share capital.
There was speculation about the takeover earlier.
The company still envisages the possibility of further increasing its stake in Versatis.
United Internet has announced that it is seeking to accelerate the consolidation of the German DSL market by doing so.
After Berenberg increased its stake in the Düsseldorf network operator by a further 5 % to 15.1%, conjecture about entry emerged on Wednesday.
In the financial market, it is said that this financial institution holds shares only for a third party.
Yesterday, United Internet, at Drillisch, a mobile telecoms provider, was already close to a 10% share.
As part of the capital increase, Drillisch put another 17.4 million new shares worth €106.4 million for sale.
Of this, the 5.15 million shares bought United Internet for 31.4 million shares.
The companies discussed marketing co-operation in DSL and mobile network products.
"We are strengthening our partnership," a United Internet spokesman explained.
In order to take over Freenet, the companies have jointly set up a joint venture between SMEs.
United Internet announced on Thursday that the two companies would be content for the time being with a share of more than 10% in Freenet and would not exercise their right to take over an additional 18.49% of the business.
It is considered that companies are keeping all options open so far, in particular the possibility of further increasing their stake in Freenet AG.
The interviews between United Internet and Freenet on the strategic partnership were terminated in mid-November.
This months-long and hard-to-pransparent game of Freenet is part of the consolidation of the German telecoms market.
Freenet had 2.9 million mobile network contract customers at the end of the third quarter and 1.27 million customers with complete or DSL connections.
Holding United Internet and Drillische still held a 6.01% stake in Freenet.
It is now said to have been agreed that Drillisch would get around another 4%.
The right to buy 18.49% of the investment company Vatas was agreed in August.
