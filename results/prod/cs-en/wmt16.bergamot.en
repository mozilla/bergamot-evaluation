On a distress call, the professor confessed to shooting his girlfriend
While calling the emergency line, Professor Shannon Lamb admitted to the police that he had shot his girlfriend and it was necessary for them to come to their home.
Lamb has set out that his "sweet little dog" was alive and probably upset to the house, and that contacts on the family of the dead woman could be found on her phone.
Inside the police, the body was found by Amy Prentiss and a handwritten message on white office paper: "I'm so sorry and I wish I could return it, I loved Amy, and she is the only one who ever loved me," the letter, according to the authorities, was written by Lamb.
There was no suspicion that Lamb, who taught two online courses for Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, would go 300 miles to the school campus where police believe he shot favorite Professor Ethan Schmidt at his office door.
The chief of police at Delta State University, Lynn Buford, said university staff heard shooting at 10:18 a.m.
Lamb is said to have made the fateful call to the emergency line shortly afterwards.
Finally, another death came; Lamb had taken his own life when the police came for him.
The day after the school was shot, it forced the students and the faculty to hide behind locked doors, the commissioned authorities still trying to find out what Lamb's motivation was.
The details released by the state-side investigators as well as the students and staff who knew it together created an image of a talented but probably troubled teacher.
The students confirmed that they were looking forward to his lessons.
Police in Gautier, where Prentiss died, confirmed that he had no criminal record or a violent history.
Schmidt himself included Lamba in the book he wrote in the thanks to the "great people" with whom he shared an academic life.
The two taught at the Faculty of Social Sciences and History, along with 17 other faculty members, and many of the students took courses at the same time.
There were also inclinations in terms of problems.
The student who was praising Lambo, Brandon Beavers, said he also seemed agitated and shaky, "as if something was wrong with him."
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said that Lamb had told him that he was facing stress at the end of the academic year 2014-15.
Lamb had previously asked Delta State University for leave for health reasons, when he said he had a problem.
And this year he taught only two online courses.
Recent changes to the recruitment of university staff meant that a doctorate on whom Lamb worked hard would not guarantee him an automatic term to become an assistant professor.
University President William LaForge said he knew no conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but that "Mr. Lamb seemed to be in the mood."
These questions will no longer be answered by Lamb.
After leaving the campus, police picked up his trail as he crossed the border of the state of Arkansas back to Misissippi.
Before he could be arrested, Lamb killed himself with a single pistol shot in the yard of the house about a mile from his parents in the outskirts of Greenville, Mississippi, confirmed to the coroner of Washington State, Methel Johnson.
He left the car on the street.
It was not immediately clear why Lamb had gone to this house, though Johnson had said he probably knew the people who lived there.
Lamb grew up in this region.
Lamb began working at the University, which has 3,500 students in the city, which has a population of about 1,2000 people, in 2009 and taught geography and education classes.
He received his doctorate in education in the spring.
One of Lambo's longtime friends described him as a smart, charismatic and funny man.
Carla Hairston said she was 15 and Lamb 20 when they met through their mutual friends.
She was with her friends in high school, and he was the great older kid who tutored her guitar playing for several years.
He was quite a heartbreaker at the time.
All the girls' heart became extra for him as soon as he appeared," says Hairston, who is now 40 years old and lives in the outskirts of Jackson.
Lamb and Prentiss reportedly dated for some time.
During the emergency phone call, Lamb said, "I killed my wife," but the wedding record never existed.
They had a dog named Lightning, who lived with them in a brick house adjacent to the shoulder of the Gautier River.
The police said the dog was fine.
The ex-husband of Prentiss, Shawn O'Steen, said they separated 15 years ago, but they remained friends and had a daughter, who is now 19 years old.
"She was completely slumped," O'Steen said of his daughter.
She was best friends with her mother.
O'Steen said he had not met Lamb, but through his daughter Abigail, he knew that Lamb was interested in music and played blues.
Lamb met with Prentiss when he and Abigail tracked down at the summer festival three years ago.
They later played random gigs together.
O'Steen said that his daughter was writing and singing her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for various online companies.
Mike Shaffer, the bartender and occasional entertainment coordinator at The Julep Room, a sleeper-lit bar near Gautier, said he last saw Lambo and Prentiss on the night of September 5, the sweat Lamb had finished guitar and harmonica for a small crowd.
There was no sign of anything wrong.
"They were just a happy couple," he said.
We lached and recorded each other for a joke.
I mean, they both had a good sense of humor.
Schmidt, the slain professor, led the first-year seminar and specialized in original American and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, an English professor at the school.
He was married and had three small children.
He studied at Emporia State University in Kansas and was president of the boys' student club and the reign of students.
At the Delta State Campus in Cleveland on Tuesday night, about 900 people, including faculty members, staff, students, and community members, attended a candle-pooing commemorative event.
Schmidt's wife, Liz, and brother, Jeff Schnidt, also attended a vigie during which the university choir sang "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace."
On Wednesday, the school began again.
"We're trying to get our students back," LaForge says.
The crisis is over.
This is the day of healing.
Amy and Rogelio Solis filed a report in Cleveland, Mississippi.
The Associated Press, Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans, also contributed to the report.
This story was edited to reflect the fact that police now claim that Lamb made a call to the emergency hotline after he killed Schmidt, and that although Lamb called Prentiss his wife, there is no evidence that they were actually married.
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer seasonal workers
Toys R Us claims not to have as many seasonal workers as they did last year, but the maker of children's toys and products says it will give current employees a chance to work more hours for current employees.
The company also said it planned to hire about 40,000 employees to work in stores and distribution centers across the country, a drop from 45,000 last season.
Most of the jobs will be part-time.
The company declares that it will start recruiting the bidders this month and will recruit staff during October until December.
While the holidays themselves are months away, the shopping holiday season is approaching and companies are preparing to temporarily hire employees to help out at the shops and the sale, for the dispatch and delivery of the goods.
Michael J. Fox jokes about his 'rande' with Princess Diana
The premiere of "Back to the Future" was a huge professional moment for Michael J. Fox.
It was also remarkable for personal reasons.
"We were sitting in the theater waiting for the royal family to come when I realized that the seat next to me was empty and I realized that Princess Diana would be sitting there," he said in the trailer for the upcoming documentary, "Back in Time."
The film begins and I realize I'm within reach of what might be called a fake date with the Princess of Wales.
"Returning in time," is a documentary about "Return to the Future," which lists interviews with Fox, Leo Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemeckis and executive producer Steven Spielberg.
The premiere of "Back for the Future" was 30 years ago.
Spielberg said: "It is, admittedly, the best travel document ever to be filmed for me."
"Rethod in Time" will be available on VOD, DVD and selected cinemas in October.
UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon says his response to Russia's swift military support for Syria is that there is "no military solution" to the conflict of nearly five years and more weapons will only worsen the violence and suffering of millions of people.
The UN chief again urged all parties, including the divided UN Security Council, to unite and support for inclusive negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban said at a press conference on Wednesday that he planned to meet with the foreign ministers of the countries' five permanent councils - the US, Russia, China, Britain and France - on the sidelines of the General Assembly ministerial at the end of this month to discuss the situation in Syria.
He expressed regret that the divisions in the Council and among the Syrian people and regional powers "made this situation unsolvable."
The Ban called on the five permanent members to show the solidarity and unity they showed when reaching the Iranian nuclear agreement in resolving the crisis in Syria.
8 poll numbers that show that Donald Trump in real light
Some have tried to label him as a man who often changes his mind.
The others waved their hands like a bad joke.
And some are preparing for the implosion.
But whichever Republicans are trying to pull Donald Trump down from the top of the election, they are failing (yet).
10 of the last 11 national polls show that Donald Trump is in charge for a double-digit number, and some people are beginning to ask seriously what this real estate magnate's nomination chances means.
Of course, it is still only the beginning of the election cycle.
None of this says that Trump is likely to win the Republican nomination.
Experts point out that at this time of 2011, the leadership of Rick Perry made the path to the rise of Herman Caine, and in the end neither of them won a single position in the nomination process.
There are many reasons why he might run into general elections.
But outside groups like Jeba Bush's Super PAC and the economic conservative group, the Club for Growth, are aware of Trump's will to endure and are starting to unload their dollars at the stand in order to overthrow him.
Here are some recent voting numbers that suggest that a real estate mogul is not just a passing phase:
Trump's ratings for favorability were reversed by 180 degrees.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, a Monmouth University vote showed that only two of the 10 Republicans have a positive view of this real estate mogul.
By mid-February, it was 40 percent.
At the beginning of August, it was 52 percent.
Now, six of the 10 Republicans have a favorable view of Donald Trump.
Roughly three out of 10 say they have a negative opinion of him.
And these numbers stick at the start.
After the Quinnipiac University vote last week, it was found that 60 percent of Republicans had a positive opinion about Trump.
Two-thirds of the GOP voters would be happy with Trump as a candidate.
In the CNN/ORC poll last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they would be either "enthistered" or "satisfied" with Trump as a candidate.
Only two out of 10 said they would be "split" from his candidacy.
Only Ben Carson creates roughly the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent of people said they would be "enthriggered" against the 40 percent who say the same about Trump).
The next closest in the level of enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio with only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 percent of Republican voters say they would be "dissatisfied" or "disturbed" if Jeb Bush became the candidate.
Most Republicans do not see Trump's temperament as a problem.
While Donald Trump has been widely criticized for his pomposity and insults, 52 percent of Republican voters are nationally inclined to think that a real estate mogul has the right temperament for the presidency, according to a ABC News/Washington Post vote on Monday.
The same number is held in the Iowa State senator's club, which is the first in the country, where 52 percent of Republicans think they have a commander's personality, according to Quinnipiac last week.
Still, 44 percent think he doesn't have a personality to serve effectively, and nearly 6 of the 10 independents say his temperament doesn't belong in the White House, according to the ABC/Post.
Republican voters are getting used to the idea.
When he puts on his learning hats, Republican voters think Trump is a real candidate.
Asked who would most likely win the GOP nomination, four of them said that Trump would be the best choice, according to a CNN/ORC poll last week.
This is a change from late July, when four out of 10 were betting their money on Jeb Bush.
Full publication: GOP voters have not had the brightest crystal ball in the past.
At the time of the previous cycle, 4 of the 10 Republicans selected Rick Perry as the winner of the candidacy against the 28 percent for Mitt Romney's eventual nomination.
Still, it turns out that a certain number of GOP voters see Trump's campaign as credible.
Even when Republicans have gathered around another candidate, Trump still beats almost everyone.
Some scholars emphasize that the fragmented field is likely to contribute to Trump's leadership, while anti-Trumpov support is diffusciously disseminated among more than a dozen other candidates.
But a Monmouth University poll in early September shows that in a hypothetical direct contest between Trump and most of the other Republican candidates, Trump will almost always win majority support.
He leads Carly Fiorina by 13 points, Marco Rubio by 14 points, Walker by 15 points, Jeb Bush by 19 points and finally Randal Paul, John Kasich, Chris Christio by 33 points each.
He's in a dead race with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate who beats him?
Ben Carson would lead the dealer by a wide 19 points in a hypothetical one-on-one match.
A bald majority of Donald Trump's supporters say they've already made up their minds.
A new CBS/NYT poll on Tuesday shows that only more than half of the voters supporting Trump say they will not change their minds.
It's obvious that a lot of things can change that, and no one can really say that they would never change their mind.
46 percent say they keep their back door open for a change between the candidates.
Still, Trump's current strongest opponent is his outsider neurosurgeon fellow neurosurgeon, Ben Carson, but voters who consider their opinion to be final would be twice as likely to vote for Trump.
6 out of 10 Republicans reportedly agree with Trump on the issue of immigration.
Even since Donald Trump called Mexico's immigrants "rapists" in the campaign's announcement speech, immigration is still sticking to the main and central theme of the 2016 conversation.
Some fear that Trump's pomposity will draw key Hispanic voters away from the Republican party and damage the rebranding.
But according to a new ABC/Post poll on Monday, six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration issues.
It seems that as long as the topic of immigration remains in the spotlight, Donald Trump will remain, too.
Frustration from the government is reaching new highs.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson are now receiving about half of the support from Republican voters, especially given their state of outsiders.
Six of the 10 Republicans in the new ABC/Post vote on Monday say they prefer a political outsider to someone with government experience.
And they're also very angry with Washington.
A poll by the Des Moines Register/Bloomberg in Iowa revealed a few weeks ago that three of the four Republicans in Iowa were frustrated by Republicans in Congress, 54 percent were "dissatisfied" and 21 percent "hellly angry."
The House supported a larger share of the state's coal fees.
The Czech Republic will receive more than 400 million.
At first reading, the Chamber of Deputies supported the government's amendment to the Mining Act, which regulates the amount of the fee yields from the green coal's open-ended mining company.
Minister Jan Mládek (ČSSD) promised MPs that this would give extra money to both the state treasury and the budgets of the municipalities.
The draft was criticized by opposition MPs, who fear that mining firms will no longer want to sponsor municipalities as they have done so far because they will pay higher fees directly to the state budget.The House supported the government's amendment to the Mining Act at first reading, which means, among other things, that the state should receive a larger part of the revenue from the mining company's extraction fees.
The state's share will increase to 67 percent, while the share of municipalities will be reduced from 75 percent to 33 percent so far.
The draft also changes the way the remuneration for the minerals that companies extract.
The change in the fees for mineral extraction is expected to bring CZK 427 million more to the state treasury than in 2013.
According to the government, the revenues of municipal budgets are to be neutral on the revenues of municipalities, as the fee is to be higher.
In the previous year, municipalities received roughly CZK 450 million of fees and the state budget of CZK 150 million.
The mining of brown coal was worth about CZK 200 million to the municipalities and CZK 66 million to the state.
The amendment also envisages an increase in the remuneration from the extraction space with the allowed mining to CZK 1,000 per hectare per year.
The revenue from these reimbursements is to continue to be fully owned by the municipalities.
Minister of Industry Jan Mládek (ČSSD) told MPs that this will give municipalities a year to raise CZK 14 million to CZK 100 million.
The amount of mining fees will no longer be determined by law, but is provided for by the government by its regulation.
The refund is newly calculated as the product of the amount of extracted mineral and the rate for each type of minerals.
According to the government, the reason for the change is, among other things, the possibility of a flexible response to the current economic situation.
ODS MP Marek Benda, however, warned against the fact that the charging of the fee by government decree may not be in line with the constitution.
According to the Minister Mládek, however, it is not a tax in this case, because the state is charging for a mineral that is state property.
Fees are received only by municipalities whose territories are affected by the mining.
In the case of deep-sea coal, three-quarters of the money will be given to municipalities and a quarter to the state.
The ratio will be the same for the extraction of radioactive rock.
Some of the money the state will collect in the mining fees will be earmarked.
For example, 28 percent will have to go to repair the damage after mining or to provide the Mining Rescue Service.
The draft was criticized by opposition MPs, who argued in particular that they would damage the municipalities affected by the mining and the regions.
For example, Michal Kučera (TOP 09 and Mayors) warned that mining companies will no longer want to sponsor municipalities as they have done so far, because they will pay higher fees directly to the state budget.
"It is not possible to tunnel one of the poorest regions just to have the Minister of Finance improve his budget," said David Kádner (Dawn) chosen in the Ústí Region.
Ahead of the rise in unemployment in Most, KSČM MP Hana Aulická warned.
Kádner and Aulická unsuccessfully proposed to reject the amendment, Kucera wanted to return the law to the government for its completion.
The explanatory memorandum states that, according to mining firms, the fee increase will not be reflected in the price of coal, as prices are more than 90 percent contracted in the long term.
Major consumers such as power plants or heating plants should therefore not feel the rise in prices.
"On the other hand, this fact increases the risk that mining organizations will compensate for the increase in reimbursements by seeking to reduce their operating expenses, which would mean a reduction in the number of employees," the government admits.
However, according to her, the increase in fees is acceptable in terms of employment.
According to the rapporteur for the amendment to Milan Urban (ČSSD), it is crucial that MPs know the conclusions on the updated energy concept and, in particular, the government's decision on the limits of coal mining, before the law is approved.
If coal is mined beyond the limits, then it will have repercussions on revenues for both the state and the municipalities, he stressed.
Urban disagrees with the Met that the decision to break the limit at the Czechoslovak Army mine should be made after 2020.
The limits at the CSA mine should be breached for social, economic reasons, and because of the long-term stability of domestic energy.
Veselý will lead the Czechs as the number one, the uptake will be affected by the weather.
All four Czech tennis players will appear on the board at Thursday's draw for the Davis Cup draw in India, and this time each of them is likely to hit the game.
Captain Jaroslav Navratil plans to break the load over the entire quartet due to difficult conditions.
There is heat and high humidity in Delhi, so challenging matches are expected to stretch to five sets.
We have to take that into account.
I'd like to spread it out the weather.
And depending on how it will look, said Navratil at today's Czech selection training session in the centre of Raj Kumar Khánna.
He is counting on the team's number one team and the world's 40-year-old Jiri Vesely for both Friday and Sunday's singles.
The position of number two is likely to be Lukáš Rosol and Radek Štěpánek.
I'd like almost everyone to get involved.
It's slow in my head, but I'm not going to say it yet, the captain said.
Another certainty in the Czech line-up should be Štěpánek's participation in Saturday's doubles.
It is just a question of who will stand next to the experienced doubles player, who has a record of 18-4 in the Davis Cup in the doubles.
It's probably not a jolly.
The options remain with Rosol, or Adam Pavlasek.
"I really don't know who with whom and what it will look like," said Navratil.
It will be decided according to the development of the doubles.
Pavlasek may be a variant, with Vesely surprised in the first round with a win in the doubles over the Australians.
"He is decent for the doubles," said Navratil.
I did it against Australia, and if I play, I'd like to perform the same performance I've shown there since the second set.
"I am happy for the experience and I would like to bring a point," Pavlásek said.
The home side will seed Yuki Bhambri (15th in the ATP rankings), who won last week's Challenger Challenger in Shanghai, where he beat the third and fourth rankings.
The number two will be Somdev Devvarman (164th).
They are both Challenger players and our guys have experience in the ATP Tour, but we have convinced ourselves many times that the rankings in the Davis Cup do not make the difference.
"It's the current form that decides, the weather," said Navratil.
Friday's opening singles will start at 6:30 GMT and can stretch out for the weather.
The forecast is to rain and the court is not under the roof.
However, the game can be played under artificial lighting.
They've already lit it up and it's got some two thousand lux, which is enough.
"It should be put to finish under the lights," said Navratil.
Jeremy Corbyn to debut at Prime Minister's Questions
Since his election, Mr. Corbyn's debut in the PMQ is expected very enthusiastically
The new working manager, Jeremy Corbyn, will make his debut at Prime Minister's Questions later, and will work with David Cameron for the first time.
Mr Corbyn will address the first of his six secondmented questions shortly after noon, while his performance is likely to be closely examined by the media and MPs.
In a week's statement, he asked for "less theaters and more facts."
He also stated that he could skip a few sessions to leave for his colleagues.
This meeting will be the first parliamentary test of Mr Corby's leadership, which comes after his appointment to the shadow cabinet and his speech to the TUC annual Congress on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, the Labour leader's decision to quietly during the singing of the national anthem in service on Tuesday to mark the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain met with criticism from a number of Conservative MPs and is the focus of the attention of several stories on the front pages of the newspapers.
Mr. Corbyn's decision not to sing the national anthem drew attention
Mr. Corbyn's spokesman said he'd be "frightened in a respectful silence" and that he would recognize "the heroism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain."
However, Mr. Corbyn's shadow cabinet member, Owen Smith, told the BBC's Two's Newsnight programme that he would recommend the Labour national anthem to sing "regardless" of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Nearly a dozen shadow ministers refused to serve in Mr. Corbyn's top team, quoting differences in the economy, defense, and foreign affairs, and only less than a sixth of the parliamentary party initially supported him as a leader.
The BBC's political correspondent, Robin Brant, says that the political differences in the work are also "supplied" after the appointment of Mr. Corbyn through his position in the European Union and the government's benefit limit.
Mr. Corbyl said at the TUC Conference that the Workers' Party had put forward amended proposals to remove the whole idea of the benefit limit.
A few hours later, Mr Smith, the secretary of shadow work and pensions, said that the party had "very clearly opposed the government's plans to reduce the limit from £226,000 to £2233,000.
Mr. Corbyn will be the fifth leader of the Workers' Party, faced by David Cameron in the last decade since his election as Conservatives' leader.
The leader of the working-class party, who promised a different approach to politics, says he has "from the crowd" ideas to questions for Mr Cameron and have received more than 30,000 proposals.
MP Islington North argues that the PMQ are too confrontational and that they will refrain from both "shot responses," and instead promises to focus on important issues such as poverty, inequality and the challenges facing young people.
Mr Corbyn argues that Angela Eagle, the shadow trade secretary, will represent him at the PMQ when he does not attend-such as when Mr Cameron travels abroad.
He also refrained from the idea of letting other colleagues get out for him from time to time, because he had been told that he had discussed the matter with House Speaker John Bercow.
When Mr. Cameron became a leader in 2005, he said he wanted to move away from the "Punch and Judy" policy style, which was often associated with the PMQ but admitted a few years later that he had failed.
Since their first broadcast in 1990, PMQ has been seen as a key barometer of the leaders' judgment, their leadership of the House and their position among other MPs, even though the critics have argued that they have become a caricature and far-reaching reforms are needed.
"Focus in Joburg": Young homeless people trained as photographers
The centre of Johannesburg is a difficult place to be homeless.
But a group of former street kids found a way to learn and make a living.
"I was photographed in Joburg" is a nonprofit studio that teaches young homeless people to take photographs of their neighborhood and make money.
BBC News met with one of the first graduates of this project.

The pound is rising as pay rises in the UK accelerate
The pound jumped in the following dates and showed the recovery of British wage growth, while the FTSE 100 was guided by the SABMiller bidding target.
Between May and June, GB profits, including bonuses, rose 2.9% compared to the same period last year.
This was the fastest since 2009, and it looked like the estimates of when rates would rise closer.
Sterling was climbing more than 1% against the dollar to $1.5505 and was 0.84% up against the euro at €1.3730.
FTSE 100 index closed at 1.49% to 6.229.21.
SABMiller was an exceptional stock on the market and jumped by a 20% after receiving an approximation of the bids from his rival AB InBev.
The deal would combine the two largest breweries in the world, and an approach to brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry shares were up 0.9% after encouraging news from rival luxury goods group Richemont.
Richemont's latest sales results are above all expectations and show that sales in China, a key market for Burberry, have started to rise again.
Shares in Glencore rose by 5% after the mining giant said they rose $2.5bn with a shared ranking as part of a debt reduction strategy.
Shares in the Packing and Paper Group of Mondi were the biggest drop in the index and fell by 4.3%, after Goldman Sachs downgraded his rating to the company for "sale."
JD Sports up 3.1% after sports company announced an 83% jump in mid-year profits in pre-tax £46.6m
JD Sports chief says higher wages could hurt expansion
Executive Chairman JD Sports, Peter Cowgill, says a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean "greater purchasing power in the pockets of potential consumers."
But it is unlikely that the purchasing power will outweigh the higher wage costs in his company, he says.
The costs could be hit by plans to expand JD Sports, he added, which could mean fewer new jobs.
Opponents of the Prague apartment building marshmallow are cheering.
The controversial structure got a stopwatch.
The investor Praga Progetti e Investimenti considers the annulment of the decision to be unlawful and will appeal against it.
Hundreds of people protested against the construction, which is to be created in close proximity to the St. Agnes Monastery in the centre of Prague, with a petition being created.
The Municipality stated in the decision that the building code had been violated because not all the formalities of the zoning decision had been complied with.
"The zoning decision in question does not contain certain elements, such as the type of land, the distance from neighbouring buildings, the sufficiently clearly and comprehensibly described the shape of the building, the delimitation of the territory concerned by the construction," his decision reads.
The Municipality also considers it illegal to consider that some of the documents for the decision were issued for the documentation originally discussed, but which has changed.
This is, for example, the opinion of the environmental authorities.
Part of the construction is to be created on the National Gallery's land, but the investor does not have her valid approval.
The dossier's dossier, however, has only evidenced the owner of the land as a result of the consent to the project documentation for the zoning procedure, not the consent to the placement of the construction on his land, writes the Building Regulations Department.
According to Francesco Augustus Razett of the investor firm, the Building Regulations Department did not take note of the decision of the superior body - the Ministry of Regional Development, according to which the deadline for initiating the review had already expired.
In any case, this is a scandalous procedure.
"We have been preparing this project for seventeen years, we are complying with all the laws of the Czech Republic and respecting all the authorities and institutions concerned," Razetto said in a press release.
The project, dubbed by people for the supposedly designed color of the facade, evokes strong emotions in Prague.
In the city centre, hundreds of people have gathered in protest against the construction.
Associations and residents of nearby houses resent the fact that some permits were issued many years ago for a house that was supposed to look different.
They also criticize the inappropriateness of the building for the historical centre of Prague and the immediate neighbourhood of the Agnes Monastery.
The house was designed by architect Zdeněk Fránek, the project changed several times.
The original form of the 2008 project, which was envisaged for the glass facade, was rejected by the Ministry of Culture on the basis of the opinion of the National Heritage Institute (NPÚ) and revoked the Prague Heritage Desavers' permit in 2010.
But the new project by Praga Progetti e Investimenti with face-shaped windows was approved by the NPÚ and the Municipal Monuments and a building permit was issued on this basis.
The author of the proposal rejects the criticisms of the opponents, saying he never counted on the façade in pink, which gave the project the nickname after the pink and white confectionery.
A Czech politician gave a ride on the migrants.
The Hungarians put him and them in jail.
Berg went to Hungary to bring humanitarian aid to the refugees.
On the way, he and the crew took three Syrian refugees to the car, who he said wanted to climb about half a kilometer.
It was not yet criminal in Hungary, he said, he told People's Daily.
We knew that law enforcement officers did not suffer such conduct.
But when the police stopped us, to our surprise, they arrested us and transferred us to pre-trial detention in Szeged, he described to the paper.
The politician ended up spending nine hours in the cell.
The officers were said to be correct, but communication was slow, as they did not speak English very well.
But prison, he said, was trite.
For example, in our cell, about three by four meters, was crowded with 15 refugees from Syria.
Among them was a two-year-old boy or a four-year-old girl.
These people were locked up there for the next day and because of the language barrier, none of them knew what would happen to them next, Berg said.
What can't be entertained?
Ask the president of the Chamber of Bailiffs.
On Friday, September 18, the president of the Czech Chamber of Executors, Mgr, will answer questions from readers. Pavla Fučíková.
You can ask her about changes to the Executions Act in force from 1 September 2015 as well as other items related to executions or executors.
Metcash launches campaigning in the country to fight the invasion of Aldi
Metcash is trying to protect its IGA stores from the onslaught of Aldi in southern and western Australia.
Metcash launches campaigning in the country to fight the invasion of Aldi
While Aldi is preparing to open two distribution centers and the first of more than 120 stores in southern and Western Australia at the beginning of next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets are strengthening relations with local food suppliers and building the IGA brand by marketing in mainstream and social media and events such as the Adelaide show.
IGA merchants and suppliers are joining with brands such as Dunsborough-based Simmo's ice cream maker offering tastings in IGA stores, and store owners are selling discounted tickets to the Australian Football League to local customers.
Metcash is expected to release further details of its defense strategy on September 29, with food, alcohol and hardware retailer celebrating its annual investor strategic day.
There is a lot at stake because Southern and Western Australia account for almost 30 percent of Metcash IGA's trade moves and generate a higher turnover than the Metcash IGA network in the eastern states.
Customers in southern and western Australia are notoriously provincial, and IGA stores enjoy a much stronger market share than in NSW, Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 percent in the SA and 24 percent in the WA compared to around 14 percent in the eastern states.
In any case, analysts like Morgan Stanley believe that Aldi will hack 5 percent of the food market in the two states in the 12 months since the first deals opened, which have taken over sales from all existing players, but mainly independent retailers.
This week, in his report, Morgan Stanley analyst Tom Kierath, estimated that the IGA retailer could lose USD 360 million in annual sales and Metcash at the end of 2016 at the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 stores in South Australia and 30 in the Western within the next year, and will generate sales of $500 and 600 million in individual markets.
The loss of food sales and volumes at the fixed price base of Metcash could cost it around USD 13 million in pre-tax revenues, Mr Kierath confirmed.
At the same time, Metcash is losing market share in the eastern states, mainly to Aldi and Coles, although the latest Roy Morgan survey found that shoppers at IGA were the most loyal.
Morgan Stanley thinks that Metcash's food sales will fall by 3.8 percent in 2016, 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018, and its market share will be reduced from 14 percent in 2015 to 10.3 percent by 2020.
Last week, the fund's senior manager, Hamish Douglass, founder of the financial group Magellan, said business lunches in Melbourne could "highly disappear in a decade.
Metcash refused to publicly respond to Douglass's comment.
But it is known that Metcash board member contacted Douglass last week.
IGA's market share has fallen from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010, and the profits from the Metcash food business, which supplies about 1,200 retailers to IGA , have fallen 43 percent since 2012, reflecting the operational development of the change in speculation as sales and yields are under pressure.
However, the wholesaler has gone on a counter-attack and invests more than $150 million a year to match the counter-counter prices in Coles and Woolworths for hundreds of products each week, helping IGA retailers reunite by adding fast-growing food and news from private individuals.
Metcash's CEO, Ian Morrice, says that price-compliant and retailing programs will catch up with the gradient and hope that the wholesaler will return to the basic profit-making rise in 2017 for the first time in four years.
Thanasi Kokkinakis supported by Tennis Australia President Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves fame for his behavior, rather than criticism.
Thanasi Kokkinakis has become a side-by-side loss in a recent fuss about his friend Nick Kyrgios and deserves praise rather than criticism for his behavior, reports Tennis Australia's president, Steve Healy.
Kokkinakis, a younger member of the talented duo often called "Special Ks," drew unwelcome attention thanks to an affair with the notorious Kyrgios and Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters.
Soon after, in a passionate qualifying match in Cincinnati, Kokkinakis and his opponent, Ryan Harrison, had to be twice separated by the referee, Harrison said afterwards: "Wawrinka should have drawn one to Kyrgios and I should have stretched him too."
While he was last seen smashing a racket after a cramp derailed by a possible overcoming of Richard Gasquet at the US Open, Kokkinakis steadfastly defended Healy.
The youngster is currently in Glasgow, where he is competing with Sam Groth for a second-round appearance for a second-round appearance for Bernard Romic in the Davis Cup semi-final against Britain.
"I have thought quite intensely about the fact that in my opinion Thanas has been a little drawn on the dispute," Healy says.
He destroyed his racket when he lost to a spasm in the US, but he is not the first player to take out his racket's rage because of his frustration. I know Thanasi well enough, and I can tell he's not going to be proud of this event.
But he was in serious control very well because he was subjected to very provocative circumstances in the US because of Harrison and so on, so in my opinion he deserves a lot of credit.
He has a fantastic team around him, he also has a great family around him and I think he was treated with a bit of a bit of hard.
He is a very adult 19-year-old man, he works very hard and he fits into the team great and so on, he never had a problem with other players, he is very respected in the locker room, he trains hard, he is in an amazing condition, he is in a very stable and mature young boy and I just think he deserves to be judged according to his own merits.
Healy also supported the decision to overlook Kyrgios for an important match starting on Friday and says the "mutual decision" is the right solution for all, but supporting the Canberra native to return to the team as a long-term stand-in.
"First of all, we want our team to be totally focused on the game and not on all the controversy that [Kyrgios] has arisen around him," says Healy.
And I think Nick was climbing very fast, as Federer, Murray and other people point out, growing rapidly in the public eye, making a few terrible mistakes, and deserving of all the criticism he receives, but we are trying to support him, we are trying to help him understand the consequences of his actions and some time out of the limelight when he will be able to think about it, I think is the best solution for the team and also for himself.
European migration crisis: Hungary declares emergency, closes borders and detains migrants
Following the announcement of the state of emergency, Hungary closed its southern border with Serbia on Tuesday, detaining those who attempted to cross it illegally to stem the flow of migrants.
Chaos arose at the border, while hundreds of migrants piled up in the no-man's-land, and Serbian authorities reacted with outrage.
Those who are stuck on the traps of the country between two states for an unknown period of time are those who flee from violence in their native countries, build tents and settle in.
But comes feelings of frustration.
When a helicopter passes over them, the migrants together call "Open the border!" and berate the riot squad of the Hungarian police.
Some reject food and water in protest.
Serbia's foreign minister declares that it was "unacceptable" for refugees to be sent back from Hungary, while more and more are coming from Macedonia and Greece.
(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution and not just indirect harm.
During the next few days, it will be necessary to discuss with Brussels and other countries," says Ivica Dacic in Prague.
The unrest at the Hungarian-Serbian border came a day after the 28-state bloc did not come up with a unified immigration policy for the ongoing meetings in Brussels.
Ministers agreed to share accountability for the 40,000 people seeking protection in the startled Italy and Greece and spoke with the hope of reaching an eventual agreement for the next month or at the end of the year, which the EU nations would accept more than 120,000 more refugees, including in Hungary.
German Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria convened a special EU European summit on Tuesday for another week to discuss the continental refugee crisis.
Nevertheless, Hungary did not cling its hopes to Brussels or its neighbours.
Tuesday's state of emergency in the two southern regions gave the authorities more power to address the crisis and allowed them to close roads and speed up court cases for asylum.
Meanwhile, Hungarian foreign minister Peter Szijjarto said his country was also planning to build a barbed-wire fence along the border with Romania to stop the refugees trying to cross their country when the fence on the Serbian border is now completed.
CBS News korepondent Charlie D'Agata reported that even the prisoners were on the list of those who helped stretch the barbed wire between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, Hungary has become a major weakness and entry point to the European Union for Refugees, many of whom have fled Syria and other Middle Eastern countries.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban insisted that most of them are economic migrants who go for a better life and not for protections, a view that is clearly different from other EU states, including Germany.
The new laws, which came into force at midnight in Hungary, now criminalise the violation of the 4 metre fence that the government had built on the southern border with Serbia, as well as establishing longer prison terms in prison for those who illegally transfer refugees.
"Thanks to the situation caused by the mass migration, the Hungarian government is declaring a state of emergency," government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs in the southern city of Szeged told reporters.
We are very clear on this: illegal border crossing is a crime.
Technically, the parliament must still approve the deployment of the army that was expected next week, but Associated Press reporters on the border have been observing the heavily armed army with vehicles and dogs for days.
Gyorgy Bakondi, Orban's home defence adviser, said the authorities were caught by 45 people who tried to cross the border and caught the 15 already in the national territory.
They were inflicted using fence damage and are now charged in police custody with committing offences under new law.
The authorities quickly had the fence repaired.
The Hungarian authorities also closed two of the seven border crossings with Serbia on Tuesday morning after using a towed wired toaster.
There was chaos at the main border crossing at Roszke because Hungarians opened a tiny office in a metal container for processing and a crowd of people was created.
About 20 of them fit in, but thousands stayed out.
Another group of refugees blocked the main highway connecting Serbia and Hungary when they refused food and water until they were allowed to cross the border into Hungary.
Election 2016: Hillary Clinton's lead over Bernie Sanders down by half in national vote
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton still holds a double-digit lead in the Democratic race for the nomination at the national level, but Senator Bernie Sanders is catching up.
Clinton is now supported by 47 percent of Democratic primary voters (down 58 percent), while Sanders comes in second with 27 percent (income from 17 percent).
Vice President Joe Biden, who is yet to announce whether he will want to become president, is receiving support from 15 percent of the Democratic primary electorate.
More than five months before the start of the major competitions, the most democratic voters say it is too early to say that they are clearly a decision to support the candidate.
But the Clinton sponsors are more sure of their choice than those who support other candidates.
Since CBS News last month, Clinton has lost ground in several demographic groups, while Sanders has gained several.
Clinton maintains a big lead between women and easing, but her leadership is narrowing.
Her support among men has been significantly reduced and Sanders loses only 5 points to it.
Clinton's advantage with Democratic voters under the age of 50 has evaporated, and she and Sanders are now equal.
But Clinton still has a big leadership thanks to older voters.
Last month, Clinton had a double-digit lead over Sanders among the Liberals, but now Sanders is only 5 points adrift of it in that group.
About half of Democratic primary voters across the nation say they would enthusiastically support Clinton if she became the party's nominee.
A quarter would support it with some reservations, and another 15 percent would support it only because it is a candidate.
Six percent wouldn't support it.
It's perhaps no surprise that Clinton's current appendizers are of particular passion for her.
The views are mixed among those currently underpins than Clinton - only about a quarter would be enthusiastic to support her.
While 48 percent of Democratic primary voters say they would enthusiastically support Clinton, less Republican voters say the same about their favorite, Donald Trump (35 percent).
When Clinton's supporters are asked about why they want her as a candidate, the most common answer is that she has the right experience (16 percent), the time is that it's time for a woman to be president (13 percent), and that she is the best candidate for the job (10 percent).
Clinton's supporters also mention her relationship with Bill Clinton (9 percent).
In addition, the great possibility of election and agreement on the problems is cited.
While the vice president is considering a potential nomination for president, 57 percent of Democratic primary voters would like to be in the face - a third think he shouldn't run for office.
When primary Democratic voters were asked who they would select as the second ballot for the party's nomination, the most common choice is Biden.
Among Clinton's supporters, more than half of Biden listed Biden as their second choice, far ahead of Sanders.
If Biden chooses not to run for the Democratic nomination, Hillary Clinton's leadership will expand from 20 points when Biden ran, to 30 points without his candidacy.
Fifty-five percent of Democratic voters see Clinton as the candidate with the best chance of winning the general election; but that figure fell from 78 percent of last month.
Biden is far from second on this scale, but the percentage of people who see him as the most likely to be selective is increasing.
However, when it came to the question of the candidate's greater importance, the Democratic electorate prefers to solve the problems over a greater chance of being elected.
Like last month, not a single Democratic candidate or potential candidate is acting as an unacceptable candidate for these primary voters.
Democratic candidates or potential candidates have had good results in some of the key characteristics among their party's primary voters.
Most see Clinton, Sanders, and Biden as sincere and trustworthy, and think they have strong leadership qualities.
Biden leads in honesty of all three, while Clinton is a strong leader.
Thirty percent of Democratic primary voters don't think Clinton is honest and trustworthy, twice as many as those who say the same thing about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent don't have that opinion about him.
Primary Democratic voters also generally see that Clinton, Sanders, and Biden are in line with their ideological view.
As for all of these standards, about a quarter of Democratic voters have no opinion of Sanders.
How questions about Hillary Clinton's decision to use her personal email and server as secretary of state, continue, most of the primary Democratic voters are satisfied with her explanation for the matter, and say that their overall view of her did not affect her at all.
But it's a different story among the American public.
Half of the Americans are now unhappy with her explanation, while only about a third are satisfied.
The public's views on the subject were divided in March, shortly after the problem emerged.
Most Americans say this email controversy has no bearing on their overall view of Clinton, while 36 percent have worsened their views on Clinton.
These are mainly Republicans, where more than 6 of the 10 claim to have worsened their views on Clinton.
Even though Clinton is seen as honest and trustworthy among her party's constituents, the issue is still a problem among registered voters overall: only 32 percent see it as honorable and trustworthy, a drop of eight points from last month, and by 15 points since May.
Sixty-two percent of registered voters do not think she is honest and trustworthy.
At the same time, 55 percent of registered voters across the country do not see Trump as honest and trustworthy either.
But both Clinton and Trump have good grades for leadership.
Of the six candidates tested, Biden, Carson, and Bush best ran in the honesty.
More people see Sanders as honest than dishonest, but, as with Carson, a lot of voters didn't make up their minds about him.
The error margin for the sample of 351 primary democratic voters is 6 percent points.
Ben Carson quits Donald Trump in national election
Ben Carson draws closer to Donald Trump in the latest CBS News/New York Times poll
Two candidates are responsible for half of the electorate in the latest poll, and the others are getting support.
Republican voters across the country continue to support Trump by an overwhelming majority, climbing up from 23% of support in the latest CBS poll conducted before the Fox News debate last month, to 27% on Tuesday.
But Carson shot from 6% to 23% in the same period.
The poll also found that Carson is doing well across demographic groups, and eliminates Trump among university-educated Republican voters.
The rest of the field, with the exception of Carla Fiorin and Ohio Governor John Kasich, is behind by Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, fell to the current 2% on the stand.
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio are all in third place together with 6%.
The error margin for the sample of 376 Republican voters in the latest poll is plus or minus 6% and held in September.
The latest CNN/ORC poll released last week, showed that Carson improved and achieved 19% support among Republicans for Trump's 32% support.
The latest poll by ABC News/Washington Post also showed that Trump is well ahead of Carson.
On the upward trend of Carson, Trump decided to shoot in blind in the nurseryurge of retired neurosurgeon, and even apologized to Carson for questioning about Trump's faith.
"We need energy," Trump said during the Iowa campaign last Saturday.
Five members of the fraternity accused of the death of first-year student Baruch College
Almost two years after the student died during the overburden ritual of the Pocono Mountains in Penensylvania, a murder charge was filed against five people.
Members of the New York Baruch College Pi Delta Dogs brutally attacked Chun "Michael" Deng during the ceremony opening in September 2013 and was taken to the hospital by the time he was delayed, contributing to his death, police announced.
The officers report that his eyes were blindfolded, wearing a backpack full of sand weighing a total of £30, and was repeatedly harassed as he tried to reach his destination through the frozen field.
Mr. Deng eventually complained of a headache and then fell unconscious.
Members of Pi Delta Dog Fratern did not call 9111 immediately after Deng fainted and reportedly waited an hour to get taken to the hospital, police say.
However, they found time to change Deng's clothes, Google his symptoms, and contact Andy Meng, the national president of the Brotherhood, and asked for advice, police chief Chris Vagner said at a press conference.
"At this point, the members began to hide the equipment and basically preferred the welfare of brotherhood to Michael Deng's life," said Chief Wagner.
He was unsuccessful in his life and died the next morning.
According to the autopsy report, Deng was repeatedly struck by a blunt force on the head, torso and thigh.
"Too many families have been devastated as a result of overburdening in fraternity, and at least one student dies every year for overburdening since 1970, writes Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer representing the Deng family, in a statement.
The fraternities and their members must be responsible, and this step is important on the part of the institutions.
A grand jury of Monroe County has recommended a third-degree murder charge for the first five members.
Thirty-two other members of the fraternity, including Mr Meng, will also be charged with assault with overburdening and criminal conspiracy.
"We want to detain not only the persons involved, but in the event that there is an organization that approved it, officially or unofficially, we will hold them accountable as well," Wagner said at a press conference on Tuesday.
Baruch College banned the brotherhood, and the national fraternity has revoked its relationship with its local branches.
This is what tents when the Fed raises interest rates
Rate rises will come and the bull market stumbles, bond yields will rise and the economy will slide into recession.
We know all this.
What we don't know is how much time it takes and how long it's going to take.
For the economy, specifically, the history of the short-term offering the history of the timing.
The recession came 11 months after the first rate hike and lasted for 86 months.
The aggarsivity of the Federal Reserve in rate hikes is often, though not always, decisive in how the economy and financial assets will react.
That is why US central bank officials have stressed so strongly that investors should not be focused on when rate hikes will begin, but rather trajectories, how long it will take to normalisation.
There are actually more variables in the game.
However, in the end, market members can make sure that all the upshot to speeding increases can be exaggerated.
"The Fed's first increase since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as the end of the 'cheap money's era,"" Julian Jessop, senior global economist at Capital Economics, said in a note to clients.
By contrast, we do not expect the gradual return of US interest rates to a more common but still low one to create a seismic shock that many might be afraid of.
This means that there will be adverse effects.
Here is a look at how some areas of the economy will react, based on historical trends:
Given what the market has seen over the last month or so, the expected rate hikes may make the air a little volatile.
But once the increase occurs, the effect will not be so dramatic.
"There seems to be a trend for a re-stall in shares after 12-24 months after the first increase, which again perhaps reflects the monetary policy lag," analysts at Deutsche Bank said in a recent study of what will happen after the Fed's hike.
More specifically, the market in the last 35 years or so often the most - about 14 percent - is heading for a rate hike in the relatively flat 250 days (average increase of 2.6 per cent), and then returns to normal after 500 days, with an average yield from the last six cycles 14.4 per cent, according to a recent analysis by Bob Doll, the main equity strategist at Nuveen Asset Management, published on Barron.
Deutsche said the impact on shares tended to become more pronounced later in the rate hike cycle and the return was starting to decline.
Recession is a fact of economic life, but a rate hike often helps it.
The Fed is currently facing some conditions that have not yet existed and could hasten the recession.
Most notable is that a gross domestic product close to its lowest point in history in the Fed's hike in the Fed's rate hike.
According to Deutsche Bank, during 118 rate hikes since 1950, only the two-month year-on-year GDP increase was below 4.5 percent.
Even though it was 3.6 percent in the second quarter of 2015, few expect it to be maintained when it was at just 1.5 percent in the third quarter, reports the Fed.
Raising rates in this complex economic background could be risky and there could be a question "whether this time is different," Deutsche said.
Market participants were prepared for the Fed's growth for the Fed all year round, all eyes turning to a meeting of the Federal Free Market Committee that took place this week and ends on Thursday.
While many strategists and economists believe the FOMC could approve an increase at this meeting, future trading indicates only a 25 percent probability.
"In our study since 1950, all the upcrooting cycles so far in a super cycle of increasing leverage with GDP obscuring the heights of the start of the recession very quickly after the incipient recovery," the report reads.
On the contrary, this was a clearly slow recovery since the worst recession in the sampling period.
The current cycle is by far the longest of those when the Fed has been waiting since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, now we are at 74 months and we are still on.
The firm return was also volatile, as the market expects a rate hike and the model is somewhat similar to what the shares are experiencing.
The main difference is that the impact is more quickly apparent in bonds than in equities when the Fed changes policy direction.
For bonds, the yields appear to change direction immediately after the first start of the downhill cycle.
At the end of the cycle, increases in bond yields fall immediately," Deutsche said.
Charles Schwab's strategists believe that the rate hike will cause the returns to be approached between long- and short-date bonds, which will match the curve.
High-income bonds often work better in this climate, even though "we are still cautious about the strain of the proceeds," Kathy Jones, a fixed-term fixation analyst at Schwab, said in her analysis.
Interestingly, Jones thinks markets are already tailored to Fed policy expectations.
"Act since the dollar's strength and a decline in inflation expectations, there are several signs of the market adapting to the prospects for tighter monetary policy," she wrote.
Short-term interest rates are up, the yield curve is flatter, the credit margins have expanded, and the volatility has increased - all market characteristics as the Fed tightens policy.
Generally speaking, companies that do most of their business in the US win interest rates when they rise, and local products will become more attractive.
Multinational companies with lots of debt will be doing worse, because the dollar growing will make their products more expensive in the world market, and their debt will also be greater.
"History shows that the "quality" of shares tends to override itself within three months of the initial rate hike," Goldman Sachsve analysts said in a client report.
Strong balance sheets were overtaken by weak balance sheet companies in each interest rate hike in 1994, 1999, 2004 by an average of 5 percentage points.
Companies with high capital yields, as well as low volatility stocks, also surpassed their lower-quality counterparts by an average of 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points) respectively.
Debt becomes a big problem.
Companies with a high percentage of mobile interest rates will lose the most, Goldman said.
Outside of pure equity games, consumers are also benefiting thanks to the growing dollar.
Savingsmen can also see their profits through higher returns, but experts have different views on how long it will take.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM, says MP Andrew Bingham
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham criticized this station for 'fooling'
He takes the view that he is increasingly indistinguishable from his commercial opponent
He also focused on the BBC Music Awards and says they just cheat on the British
Deputy colleague Damien Collins attacked the Voice and says even he is not an original idea
BBC Radio 3 is "changed" at the Classic FM, says the leading MP and amassing fresh pressure to air to show that they are doing something that commercial broadcasts do not do.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also told the BBC's chief executives that the public service radio station appeared to be "lumpered" and becoming increasingly indistinctable from its business rival.
"Radio 3 seems to be - I don't like to use the word "fooled"- but it seems to be changing to the Classic FM," he said.
He also focused on the BBC Music Awards, launched in December last year.
The BBC Music Awards, which began last year, appears to be British under a different name.
So if you're trying to do something different - these are two examples that come to mind when you're actually just imitating what we already have in the market," Mr. Bingham said.
The director general of the BBC dismissed the allegations on the grounds that BBC Radio 3 was far ahead of its business rival when it comes to live music and public education.
What I learned about classical music on Radio 3 I wouldn't learn on any other radio.
And their commitment to live music and the creation of music is actually at the top level.
"I also think that the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and commission new works is also very important," he says.
Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3 regulator Alan Davey argued that it is now necessary to work harder to engage the audience than before, because the British are less educated in terms of classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only element of the BBC's production to come under fire for treading on the heels of business competitors during the broadcast of Culture, Media and Sport and got to the commission hearing.
Conservative MP Damien Collins attacked The Voice - a music talent show bought by the BBC from Dutch producer Talpa Media for an estimated price of £22m.
Do you see why this programme is being discussed as unoriginal and not particularly different?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC1 show - in which stars Paloma Faith and Boy George shine as judges - was made "in a way typical of the BBC."
He added that he wanted the Corporation to "found a hit from its own stable" if it launches a fun series next time.
However, he refused to rule out ordering more future series of The Voice or spending the money of the royalty fee for other entertainment formats.
Internet sales are growing at their slowest pace since August and Black Friday may be to blame
For the first three months of 2015, they recorded a 7% increase in online sales
Last month saw the lowest growth since the records themselves began in 2000
Internet sales were boosted three years ago thanks to mobile shopping
Experts believe November's Black Friday could be the reason for the braking of spending
For more than a decade, virtual shopping has been on the rise, making many of Britain's main streets a ghost town.
However, experts say there are signs of stabilisation of online sales, and the new data show a 7% increase in the first three months of 2015.
Total spending for August was the lowest increase in growth since the start of the 2000 measurement, with an increase of just 5 percent compared to last year.
Experts say there are signs of stabilisation of online sales, and new data shows a 7% increase in the first three months of 2015.
"If you look at the level of growth over the past years and you go back to 2000, the situation has always become more rationalised over time," says Andy Mulcahy, IMRG sales index editor.
It explains that online sales were boosted three years ago, when customers started using their mobile phones to make purchases.
It meant that people were able to shop online and that they were able to make purchases in different contexts, such as on the sofa.
But now (growth) is somewhat stagnating, and therefore it seems to be subsiding.
The Black Friday phenomenon, which was taken over from America, is cited as one of the reasons for the decline in sales.
Experts believe customers could be delayed in shopping before the event, which takes place on the last Friday of November.
In the past year, five times more than the average of shoppers turned to their computers to make purchases and to drop several retailers' websites.
Experts believe that Black Friday, thanks to which shoppers are haggling again, can withhold customers from further purchases
Research published by the British Retail Consortium found that only £1 of every £5 was spent online.
For some products, such as TVs and washing machines, more than a third of sales are made via web shops.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online, instead of shopping in brick-and-mortar fashion stores.
Muslims bury victims of crane crash in Mecca and family of Bin Laden sanctioned
The bodies of the 29 dead were carried over the streets of Muslims in the performance of the first funeral in Mecca
Saudi Arabia has partly blamed for the collapse of the design magnate Saudi Binladin Group.
The Ministry of Health said a total of 394 people were also injured after the crane collapsed
Hundreds of Muslims have gathered to bury the 29 victims of the crane crash at the Grand mosque in Mecca. The bodies of the victims were carried down the street.
Dressed to some extent in white, mourners chose the way and paid their respects to the victims as the first of the fallen made his final trip to the cemetery in Al-Moaissem.
The sad message passed the holy place, where only a few days earlier the construction crane had smashed through the ceiling of the mosque and toppled over to the faithful.
The bodies were released for the funeral, and the Saudi king sanctioned the bin Laden family's construction group over the disaster, which was also abandoned by the 394 injured.
The bodies of 29 dead after the crane crash in the Grand Central Mosque in Mecca were carried by the streets
Among the dead were the father of four children, Qasim Akram of Bolton, the Greater Machester, who was at his first pilgrimage when the crane crashed.
Mr. Akram was at the Grand Mosque with his parents before the start of the annual Haj Haj pilgrimage.
Saudi officials have already promised that the Haj to Mecca will take place and thousands of people continue to descend into the city.
King Salman said today that the Binadin Group should not have left the arm of the crane at the top when it was not in operation.
The Arab version of the decree, carried by the state-run Saudi press agency, states that the Binladin Group is partly to blame for the crash.
The English disco agency service did not report this detail, but said that the company's chief executives were banned from travelling abroad.
Earlier this week, Salman promised to reveal what caused the crane to the courtyard of the Grand Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims are metalling before the Hadj pilgrimage later this month.
Binladin Group has not issued any statement about the collapse of the crane and has not been made to hear from its representatives for comment.
The royal ordinances also charged the group for not using the latest security measures, and a lack of coordination with meteorological officials.
Dozens of cranes surround the Grand Mosque in Mecca, which is part of a massive building effort headed by the Binladin Group.
Binladin's family has been close to Saudi Arabia's ruling family for decades and have been running major construction projects.
Al-Qaeda's late leader, Osama bin Laden, was the son of a renegade whom the family renounced in the 1990s.
The crash happened in the midst of strong winds and rain just days before the delivery of millions of people in the kingdom at a fair that every proficient Muslim must take at least once in his life.
Officials say that 158 people remain in the hospital.
Officials determined that one million riyals ($174,000) would be donated to the relatives of the killed, and the same amount for the permanently injured.
The other injuries will receive half of this amount.
B&Q chief says Eastern European traders working for cheaply are no longer a trend
Britons are increasingly employing artisans, says Veronique Laury
Number of trained traders from Eastern Europe is at the end of the growth point
The result is an open 200 Screwfix deals targeting traders
At the same time, Kingfisher closes 60 B&Q outlets across the country
Processed by Rupert Steiner, the main correspondent for the Daily Mail
The British are said to be putting off hammers and brushes and handing them over to employed trained Eastern European craftsmen to work at their home
If you're good with a hammer or a paint brush, you seem to be in the minority today.
As the British are increasingly employing craftsmen to carry out DIY jobs at their home, according to the company's chief executive, behind Screwfix B&Q.
Veronique Laury, the new managing director of Kingfisher, who owns a chain for home use, argues that the large increase in the number of trained merchants from Eastern Europe offering services at the lowest possible prices is no longer a trend.
As a result, Kingfisher plans to open 200 more Screwfix stores targeting merchants, and is closing 60 B&Q outlets.
Ms. Laury says she wants to employ more women in B&Q stores because eight out of ten shopping decisions at the store make better halves.
Currently, most female workers are male.
She said there was a need to address the growing demographic trends that depict more women's homes, which make more domestic adjustments than in the past.
Mrs. Laura says: "Still in our shops, the men work mostly.
We need to get close to the balance.
Basically, half of our customers are women who make 80% of the decisions about the purchase of the goods.
Women play a big role in the decision-making process.
Ms. Laury, who is one of only five women at the helm of leading companies under the British FTSE100 index, also re-structured her top-level team to reflect the equivalence between female directors and women.
Kingfisher is almost alone in having half the representation of women among staff, including the executive and finance director.
Ms. Laury claims: "It was a conscious decision - diversity is an important topic here.
So it wasn't difficult to find the good women to take to us.
Kingfisher announced a slump in both profit and sales in mid-years after the group took the cost of closing the deals.
The result of the Kingfisher trend, which owns Screwfix and B&Q, is to open 200 new stores
The December contribution of CZK 600 to pensioners is in jeopardy.
"It's the justice of equilibences, it has nothing to do with human justice," said TOP 09 Vice-President Miroslav Kalousek, who emphasized the principle of merit.
ODS President Zbyněk Stanjura noted that while the one-off contribution sounded good, it would be better in the long run to be standard indexation, as it would be reflected in the coming years.
"We have the space to find the mechanism to arrange it," said Stanjura.
He supported the original proposal by Minister Michaela Marksová (ČSSD), according to which it was to be indexed to the above the law next year.
Marks defended the subsidy by arguing that it would improve the social situation of pensioners, which she said was not rosy.
A higher indexation of next year, she said, would mean a budget impact of 5.5 billion crowns, and ministers are debating every hundred-million.
Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka (ČSSD) reminded the right that it had lowered the pace of indexation in the past.
The rapporteur, Miroslav Opálka (KSČM), pointed out that the proposal did not address the reduction of real pensions in 2016 and later.
The right-wing veto will make the paycheck much more difficult and perhaps impossible in December, he said.
The chairman of the ČSSD deputies, Roman Sklenák, therefore proposed a reduction in the deadline for discussing the standard in the committee to ten or 20 days, which was also blocked by the right.
But the committee will have a month instead of the usual two.
The bonus should cost the state a total of CZK 1.73 billion.
The money is to come mainly from the budget of the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
Next year, pensions are expected to rise by an average of about a penny.
The allowance should be given to people who will be entitled to a pension or part of a pension in December, according to the pension amendment.
It could also be obtained by those whose pension rights were lost in December before paying it.
But they would have to apply for the surcharge in writing by the end of next year at the latest.
Pensions are indexed to the Czech Republic on a regular basis as of January, by price growth and a third of real wage growth.
This year, the pension is equivalent to 41.5 percent of the gross wage, next year it should be 40.5 percent.
The state spent CZK 314.7 billion on old-age pensions last year, according to the state's closing account, which was roughly five billion more year-on-year.
Spending on old-age pensions accounted for 26 percent of all budget expenditure and 46 percent of all statutory expenditure.
The average full old-age pension rose by CZK 104 to CZK 10714, according to data in the state closing account.
The Czech Social Security Administration provided the payment of 2.4 million full old-age pensions and some 17,000 relative pensions.
Yakunin has abandoned plans for his political career, he will devote himself to science.
The Senate seat was almost assured, according to Russian media.
In the Federation Council, he was to represent the western Russian Kaliningrad region, whose governor, Nikolai Tukanov, as the governing United Russia party candidate, defended his post in Sunday's election with an overview.
Under Russian law, senators are not elected by the citizens, but are chosen by the governor from a trio of candidates whose names he will announce before the governor's elections.
After the election, he selects the senator from the trio of candidates.
The complication for Yakunin was the fact that he had not lived in the Kaliningrad region for twenty years, as required by law.
The Kremlin has found an exemption for Yakunin, saying he is an extraordinary and plenipotentiary ambassador to whom the legal requirement of a long-term stay does not apply.
The filming of the Czech comedy The Theory of the Tiger ended.
The final drop in the main character's resolution is the voluntary death of his father-in-law, who has run out of strength and patience.
Grandmother - Iva Janžurová decided on her grandfather's life, old age and funeral.
It is clear to John that he and his wife Olga - Eliška Balzerová are on a similar journey.
He remembers that he once had dreams of his own will and he wanted to live with dignity and freedom.
He longs to regain control of his life - and as a solution he chooses to escape from the past one, he said of the story of Nightingale.
Bajgar wanted to capture a certain type of relationship in comedy form in which one of the partners did not feel completely free.
From the start, he said, it was clear that the lead roles would go to Bartošek, with whom he had already collaborated on the series Invisible.
Yet the actor, who appeared in front of the camera after a lengthy break in connection after a serious illness, he was surprised.
We made a deal together three years ago.
I gave him the script to read, and he said he liked how sad he was.
And I was surprised that he was obviously a hooded athlete.
He used to always ask the next scene before shooting where he would sit.
This time he rode his bike, climbed rocks and even walked uphill.
And all in the record tropical heat, the director pointed out.
According to Bartoshka, the women are taking the tiger to turn it into a rabbit over time.
They'll pour some feed on him, but they'll close the gate right away so it doesn't accidentally think of playing outside the tiger crab room.
And that's what we're trying to tell our film about, the actor commented.
His wife, who can be mildly negative for the audience, was portrayed by Eliška Balzerová.
She's not just a negative character.
She is also pleasant, intelligent, empathetic and she means well.
But she is also a usurper and wants to bake her husband to death, Bajgar said.
The film also depicts the fates of John's married daughters Olinka and Alice - Tanya Vilhelmová and Pavla Beretová - and sons-in-law of Erik and Pepík - Jiří Havelka and Jakub Kohák.
The film's producer is Petr Erben from Logline Production, co-producers Czech Television and Radio and Televizia Slovakia.
Google has promised millions of dollars to help refugees in Europe.
Google, an American internet company, has promised to provide up to $5.5 million ($132.6 million) to organizations that help thousands of refugees pouring into Europe.
This was announced on Tuesday by Google.org, a charity offshoot of this internet company.
Azerbaijan canceled Teliček's part of the visit for criticizing human rights violations.
Czech MEP for the ANO movement, Pavel Telička, postponed his forthcoming trip to Baku on Thursday because the Azerbaijani authorities cancelled the official part of his visit today.
According to Telička, Baku justifies this by last week's EP resolution, which criticises human rights violations in Azerbaijan and of which Telička co-authored.
By decision of the Azerbaijan Telička party, he lost the possibility of talks with official partners, as well as a visit to political prisoners that depend on the approval of the authorities, his Brussels office explained in a press release.
Telička wanted to use the trip, which was planned several months in advance, to meet with the parliamentary leadership and representatives of the executive as well as with representatives of the democratic opposition, dissidents and political prisoners, the text sent to the Czech Press Agency.
The EP's resolution condemns "unprecedented repression of civil society in Azerbaijan."
It called on European leaders to consider sanctions against all politicians, functionaries and judges involved in political persecution.
The resolution was approved shortly after a recent ruling over Azerbaijani opposition journalist Khadadija Ismail, who advocated the detection of corruption in government circles.
Russia does not rule out building its air base in Syria.
On a visit to Novosibirsk, Bogdanovsky did not rule out the creation of a Russian air base in Syria in the future.
We don't have plans for that yet.
But nothing is out of the question, he said.
Russia has a long-running naval base in the port of Tartus in Syria, which it has so far used more as a service and logistics center.
According to Russian press reports, however, since the beginning of August, supplies of Russian weaponry and military equipment to Syria have risen.
According to Moscow, these are arms shipments resulting from the trade agreements in force.
The Pentagon says the Russians intend to establish an air base outside the city of Latakia, which for the time being remains a stronghold of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.
But Washington is not entirely clear about Russia's specific military intentions in Syria, US commentators agree.
US Secretary of State John Kerry spoke to Russian colleague Sergey Lavrov about the situation in Syria on Tuesday, their third phone conversation in the last ten days.
Next week, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will travel to Moscow to convey concern about the gathering of a Russian arsenal near Israel.
White House spokesman Josh Earnest called Moscow's support for Assad as a lost bet.
He said of Russia's policy objectives in Syria that they were rather unclear.
Moscow, he says, has made Syria its satellite.
It may mean, it means that President Vladimir Putin is pursuing a long-term goal, but what a long-term goal, according to Earnest, that is not entirely clear.
The war in Syria is to be the main topic of Putin's speech at the upcoming UN General Assembly meeting in New York, according to today's speculation in the Russian press.
The situation in Ukraine's Donbass region, on the other hand, is said to be not intended to be discussed by the Russian leader at all.
According to a report by The New York Times today, the US government is not ruling out that President Barack Obama could meet with the Russian president during the UN meeting.
But the views among White House advisers are said to be diverging so far.
Citing the words of Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, TASS wrote today that Putin does not yet have a meeting with Obama on the agenda of his New York City move.
Soak up the segama oil with a gallbladder diet, hemp helps boost immunity.
A good way to increase the flow of beneficial unsaturated fatty acids from these fruits is the use of extra virgin oils.
When pressed from cold seed, all healthy substances will remain in the oil.
Therefore, these oils are also suitable as part of health diets, such as gallbladder.
Some extra virgin oils are suitable for the prevention of cardiovascular disease.
According to the Institute of Health Information and Statistics of the Czech Republic, these are the most common reason for the death of Czechs for several years.
Bile inflammation mainly worries women, helps sesame oil.
If you are one of the lovers of Asian cuisine, you must not miss sesame oil in your pantry, which is part of the original recipes for exotic dishes.
Unlike most other oils, it can also be used in the heat treatment of dishes and has a number of beneficial health effects.
It is often used in the gallbladder diet.
The essential fatty acids it contains are a good prevention of the formation of bile stones.
These are 90% the cause of gallbladder inflammation and women suffer from these difficulties 3 times more often than men.
In general, the gallbladder problems mainly concern people who do not play sports and consume a lot of animal fats.
Seemam oil can also be successfully used in a liver diet, which is very similar to the gallbladder one.
If people want to take advantage of all the health benefits of consuming this oil, they should be careful about goods from exotic food stores.
Manufacturers from Asia often use over-rampous seeds to press, which have a more pronounced taste.
But the oil will thus lose all the active ingredients, described Ladislav Hačecký, Executive Director from the Czech company Bohemia Olej from Kraslice in Sokolovsko, which produces cold-pressed bio virginal oils.
The company also produces sesame oil and uses exclusively unroasted seeds of white sesame.
In an hour, our press can be pressed for 8 kilos of sesame.
By mechanical pressing, the raw material heats up to a maximum of 40 degrees and therefore the product meets the criteria for the extra virgin designation.
At higher temperatures, nutrient substances would be lost.
Sunflower oil benefits from heart and blood vessel diseases.
The Czech favourite among the oils is sunflower.
Jarmila Hamerska's research, which led at Masaryk University, showed that 43% of respondents preferred it to warm the kitchen.
However, it is not really suitable for frying, it is already starting to roll over at 180 °C.
It is better to use it for salad seasoning, for example, and is particularly useful in the diet in which it helps to prevent cardiovascular disease.
It contains a high proportion of omega 6 unsaturated fatty acids, which reduce cholesterol most of all fatty acids.
At heart problems, you should be careful about the amount of fat and calories taken overall.
For example, there are 62 calories in one spoonful of sunflower oil, with a spoonful of rapeseed oil with 99 calories.
When it comes to the energy value of food, it is important to realise that natural food with nutrients is much more suited than so-called empty calories.
These are part of industrially modified products.
It is therefore advisable to reach for extra virgin oils.
The sunflower one lasts just like sesame and hemp 9 months.
The storage in the fridge will be longer shelf-life.
Old oil is recognized by people in particular by the bitter taste.
On the other hand, the defect is not dilage at the bottom.
It's a sign that the substance was not chemically refined.
Cannabis oil contains the most healthy acids.
The seeds of technical hemp are one of the so-called superfoods, which is why hemp oil is considered the healthiest of vegetable oils.
This designation is due to the highest content of omega 3 and omega 6 of unsaturated fatty acids.
These essential fatty acids cannot be made by the body themselves, and a person must take them from food.
The intake of omega 3 fatty acids is particularly important.
A study by scientists published in the European journal of clinical nutrition showed that the daily intake of the substance is insufficient.
Men in France and Greece consume 0.6 grams for it, while Icelanders accept 2.5 grams.
The recommended daily dose is 1 to 4 grams.
Cannabis oil should be included in the diet as part of a supportive diet to boost immunity and injury healing.
It has anti-inflammatory effects and is an essential part of the cell membranes.
People need not be afraid of using hemp oil, it does not contain any psychoactive substances.
The fact that this oil has found its way to consumers is confirmed by the fact that it is one of the best-selling in Bohemia Olej.
It sells 500 litres a year.
People often use one tablespoon on the fasting in the morning.
The cannabis oil is not spectacular in taste, but it will strengthen immunity brilliantly, advised Daniel Vlček from the beauty company Bohemia Olej.
According to the statistics, the most passionate nation in barbecues is Americans.
There's 1.4 grills for one household.
There are then various barbecue competitions around the world, which only confirm the success of this culinary discipline.
The Czechs are not behind either.
Based on consumer surveys of the Czech market, we find that only 4% of people have been grilling in their lives.
The vast majority then grill several times a year.
We must not underestimate the preparation to make the barbecue - it is ideal to adjust the meat by marinating a few hours before the heat treatment.
Which oil is best suited for this and at the same time leaves health-giving substances for a barbecue?
In general, in the barbecue process itself should be conserved with fat.
Experts agree that a large proportion of the oils begin to lose their taste at high temperatures.
Healthy extra virgin oils then also loosens the body's beneficial substances, which we otherwise get from them when consuming oils from dishes prepared at lower temperatures.
But it doesn't mean that extra virgin oils don't find their use when grilling.
Atropical oil for barbecue, health and beauty.
When you say meat, the experts from the company Bohemia Olej from Kraslice na Sokolovsku immediately equips the grape oil.
It is wonderful to complement the taste of the meat and the fish.
The kitchen features a unique feature of enhancing the natural taste of food.
It is also suitable for frying and grilling as it has a high level of combustion, up to 216 °C.
Even at such a high temperature, it therefore stores health-goods substances as one of the few oils, describes the benefits of grape oil Daniel Vlček from the company Bohemia Olej, which belongs to the few Czech producers of this vine oil.
Experts agree that the grape oil is 50 times more effective than vitamin E and 20 times more effective than vitamin C.
It also contains high amounts of linoleic acid and is therefore effective in fighting the excess of cholesterol.
In the grape oil, our bodies also receive important unsaturated fatty acids, vitamins and minerals.
Thanks to the favourable content of these substances, it helps to reduce high blood pressure, increases metabolism and has a positive effect on the kidneys.
By consuming the grape oil, we also help to increase our external beauty - it improves the elasticity of the skin, is used in the treatment of acne and helps to care for dry and brittle hair.
Chefs praise the use of the grape oil in the kitchen.
It is not only suitable for the preparation of cold dishes, for example when seasoning salads, but also for the heat treatment of dishes.
The barbecue can therefore be used in two ways, in marinating and the barbecue itself.
By marinating the meat and fish, we will preserve their succulence.
Three components must be present when preparing the marinade: oil, acidity and spices.
For example, we deliver acidity with apple vinegar and thus achieve the softening of the meat.
The spice, in turn, gives the meat its taste and the oil can preserves and gives the right edge, advises Daniel Vlček.
At the same time, he adds, the grape oil is ideal for marinating because it can pass through dark meat as one of the few oils.
Marinated meat or fish are therefore ready for grilling, how to proceed?
Extra virgin oils are characterized by the fact that only a few drops are enough to prepare the dishes.
The same goes for barbecuing.
Some oils are completely taboo for this method of preparation.
This applies in particular to linseed, hemp and rapeseed oil, which should not be heated at all.
Rub the grate with oil before grilling, preventing the food from burning.
A necessary part of the barbecue is also the preparation of the attachments.
Grilled meat and fish are suitable for just about anything - grilled vegetables, toasted bread, a light vegetable salad and many more.
Chefs from Bohemia Olej recommend, for example, the Hot Summer Salad.
To do it you need: • 1 piece peckle • 1 bunch of rucola • 1 cup of sliced cucumber • 1 cup of salad soup leaves • 3 tablespoons of grape grape oil
Add to the salad bowl the salad leaf-torn rucola, sliced cucumber and the large cubes of sliced peach.
Fill in salt and pepper to taste, you can also season with ground chilli and soy sauce.
At the end, drizzle with a few drops of grape oil.
For an exceptional taste, you can sprinkle the salad with finely sliced almonds.
Multiple sclerosis: it is not only the medication that matters, but also the will of the patient to fight.
Scattered sclerosis is a complicated disease and a person with this diagnosis needs the care of a number of experts: a neurologist, a physiotherapist, an ergoterpe, a urologist, an ophthalmologist, a psychologist, a psychiatrist and many other specialists.
However, it is not just about therapeutic care, for example, women with multiple sclerosis also need consultations, if they decide to have a child, social counseling, recommendations in the treatment of housing arrangements, etc.
Yet all this is not enough: the development of the disease can be fundamentally influenced by the patient himself.
The more he actively fights the disease, the longer he can work and not have to fundamentally change the style of his life.
Indeed, as doctors point out, the passivity of the sufferers leishes out the space for the activity of the disease.
For example, it is proven that regular movement significantly delays the time when the sufferer needs a compensatory aid, such as a stick.
It is important that patients and their surroundings do not succumb to various myths, such as that the disease automatically leads them to end up in a wheelchair.
That is why the Get a Chance page (www.bezmytu.cz), which is supported by the ongoing media campaign Give Your Chance, was created.
The most important person in the care of a patient with multiple sclerosis is a neurologist.
For multiple sclerosis, the adage is twice that the treatment of the disease is treated earlier, the more likely the doctor can have to influence something.
This is because we have medication for multiple sclerosis in an inflammatory stage, when the neurodegeneration process is not so strong.
The earlier we intervene, the greater the chance that we will be able to stop the disease and delay the disability, explains M.D. Eva Medová from the Neurological Clinic of the General University Hospital in Prague.
It is very important in people with multiple sclerosis rehabilitation care, which most often solves the weakening of the lower limbs or a balance disorder.
The patients are treated according to their individual needs: to maintain fitness, improve walking, strengthening the pelvic floor, alleviating swallowing disorders or improving coordination.
"It's really individual, depending on the patient's specific problems," says the M.D. Martina Kövári, head of the Clinic of Rehabilitation and Physical Medicine at the University Hospital Motol.
People with multiple sclerosis suffer from the same disease, but it manifests itself in a slightly different way for each.
Rehabilitation cannot stop the disease, but it can always relieve its symptoms.
Motion activity, however, also strengthens the body's immune state, which is desirable in the case of multiple sclerosis.
Another positive of regular exercise is the fact that the sick check what they can do, and that reinforces their confidence.
"Descination is also washed up during the exercise and makes you feel good," points out the PhDr. Kamila Řasová from the Clinic of Rehabilitation Medicine at the Royal Vinohrady University Hospital.
By influencing the physical side, we act on the limbic system responsible for emotions.
We intervene directly in the psyche and immune processes and stabilize the disease, he adds.
"Previously, these patients were so-called spared, now we know they need a targeted burden," says Prof. PaedDr. Pavel Kolář, head of the Clinic of Rehabilitation and Physical Medicine at the University Hospital Motol.
Physiotherapy aims to be able to remain self-sufficient for as long as possible, including a job.
Physiotherapists therefore work with ergoterapei to give each person a compensatory aid made to measure him.
Many patients also need the care of a psychologist or psychiatrist.
They're in a difficult life situation.
When a serious illness comes into your life, it shakes people up.
They're in shock, panic, fear.
They must respond to the heavy burden - loss of health.
With such a sore soul, we are to go to someone, not to try to carry everything on our own shoulders.
"I work with them to eventually come to the conclusion that even with a handicap you can live a full life and that multiple sclerosis does not mean the end of life," says psychotherapist Renata Malinová - Schubertová from the Neurological Clinic of the General University Hospital in Prague.
Without the Prague-based manufacturer Latecoere, the Airbus would not fly.
Aircraft is synonymous with accuracy and advanced technology.
The new aircraft are full of titanium or lightweight and solid composite materials that are easy for someone to be made and processed.
Still, in addition to the super-picture, computer-controlled machine tools, you can come across something as ordinary as apricot kicks as apricot pips in addition to the autoclaves to shaping composite.
In a drum that resembles a pot for a cotton candy, the pile of the stone is rehashed with the edges of the tin parts that have just come out of the milling machine.
"So far, no one has come up with anything better," smiles Ivan Dubský, CEO of the air doors manufacturer Latecocoere Czech Republic.
In the area in Prague's Letnany, the former Letov produces a complete door for the Airbus A320.
They are the only ones in the world to deliver the door for Brazil's Embraer 170.
The door, part of which is being assembled in Prague, also enters the first and higher class passengers on the upper decks of the world's largest airliner, the Airbus A380 Airbus.
There are also assembling doors full of composites for the new Boeing 787 Dreamliner.
Accuracy is the main motto.
Perhaps the torque keys are being made by the company twice a year.
If the yellow sticker lacked a check-up record, they would have a lot to explain to the auditors from Airbus or Boeing at the Prague plant, who come regularly to see if the doors are made according to the agreed rules.
But the advanced technique has not yet completely replaced the human senses.
There are 1,500 rivets on one door to the A320.
These must be shaken by the rioters.
It takes them two days.
Even by the sound of the falling hammer, they can tell if the rivet is properly shaky.
The tolerance in which they move is minimal.
The ripening may rise above the surface of the aircraft from zero to 0.13 millimetres.
That's roughly twice the thickness of a human hair.
The check-up comes with a trained touch.
When the inspector runs his finger on a series of rivets, he knows if any are out of tolerance.
Only then does he pick up the exact aberration.
Freetat fed the program of the L-39 military aircraft training aircraft before 1989.
But in 1991, neither of them was produced.
The company had to find new orders quickly.
At the time, it was hooked up with European aircraft manufacturer Airbus.
She won the tender for the A321 emergency door vendor contractor.
The courtship with Boeing was not so happy.
"We were a small company for them at the time, which did not have enough money to invest and to guarantee Boeing long-term stable deliveries," Dubský recalls.
The door to the American manufacturer would have remained slammed if Letov had not taken the French-based Latecoere group's Italian Air Industry Association at a Prague conference in 1999.
I spoke about our collaboration with Airbus.
Negotiations with the French were underway the next day, says Dubský.
A year later, Latecoere bought the Czech company and new orders came with a strong company.
As early as 2000, the assembly of the door parts for the A320 was launched.
Three years later, the upper-hand door was added to the A380s.
In 2006, the company built a new composite processing hall for deliveries to the Boeing Dreamliner.
Without a Latecoere, we would not have gotten ourselves into these big contracts.
Maybe we'd be doing parts or small parts.
Partners want guarantees of deliveries for twenty or thirty years, explains Dubský.
Last year, the Czech Latecoere achieved a turnover of over 2.9 billion and a profit after tax of CZK 147 million.
The exclusive position among aircraft manufacturers' suppliers is not free of charge.
Latecoere has invested CZK 1.5 billion in Prague since 2000.
The company must have quality certificates, certification of 170 special production processes and qualification cards for key employees.
Without them, the business would not have made any doors to the aircraft.
To obtain certificates that the production processes meet the requirements of customers, and it costs millions of crowns in repeated inspections to keep them, according to Dubský.
Production processes change every year.
They are more accurate and rigorous.
We need to train employees, retrofit the facilities and re-certify the whole process, Dubský adds.
Now the company is finalizing the preparation of a process for the coating of zinc and nickel to replace the existing one for human-harm-damaging cadmium.
They received the assignment from the manufacturer, but then had to adapt the technology to the equipment or chemicals they use in Prague.
The people from Boeing will come, check out the whole line's concept.
Then we'll show them the production.
They will also check our laboratory.
They test one set of samples themselves in their laboratory and then compare the results with ours, Dubský is described in the way the customers check them.
The reward is the Prague-based company's long-term exclusive contracts.
With the Prague plant today, the production of embraers is standing and falling.
For the A320, it produces half of the total door volume.
Replacing the Czech Latecoere is either impossible or very difficult for a Brazilian or European manufacturer.
But it doesn't mean he can say any price at the door.
Part of the contract is a price curve.
It indicates how much one door will cost in ten, fifty, hundreds of pieces made.
The price per piece keeps dropping to a certain limit value.
We must fit into this price formula.
If not, we'll lose money, says Dubsky.
Half of the hall, where the electric cabinets for the Airbus A400 M military aircraft are assembled, is still empty.
But it is a symbol of the future.
Behind the screen, a new semi-robotic rip-taking and door mounting for the upgraded A320 Neo model is being built here.
The ripening will accelerate and refine.
"This is the trend of the timetable assembly taking away," Dubský adds.
The outlet is secured by the future line.
Airbus reports that airlines have so far ordered 3278 new A320 units.
Just a few metres away, there will be a line for the complete assembly of the door for the top deck of the A380.
It's a strategic decision of our parent company.
The aim is to reduce production times and reduce costs.
Full assembly could start in two years, says Dubský.
Before that, however, the company must undergo qualification tests for the installation of some electrical and electronic devices for the largest Airbus.
The company is also betting on the further development of production from composite materials.
In addition to Boeing, it should also participate in the new Airbus A350 program to compete with the US Dreamliner.
"It's a huge credit for the company to be able to process composites in addition to metal materials," Dubský says proudly.
However, the Latecocoere is getting to the edge of production capacity in the Czech Republic.
There is no more place in the Letov area where it is based.
Prior to the French mother's entry, the company had 180 employees.
Now he has 800, and there could be a hundred more in three years.
As long as Airbus and Boeing compete for how many hundreds of new aircraft the airline is ordered every year, they may not be worried about the job.
Although it has contracts for several years in advance, the parent company of Prague's Latecoere faced the threat of bankruptcy.
The French group did not have enough money for the loan repayments in September.
Eventually, Latecoere was able to reach an agreement with the main creditors.
At the end of August, she swapped some of their loans for shares.
The creditors received a 37.4 percent stake in the company by increasing the capital by €57.4 million.
The company's debt fell by two-thirds, or €180 million.
The second part of the financial recovery came at the beginning of September.
The company subscribed to the new shares among the current shareholders for €222.9 million.
In total, it raised the registered capital by €280 million.
At the same time, the whole group benefits from the growing production of Airbus and Boeing, which account for 85 percent of the sales.
It expects average contract growth of four percent per year until 2017.
In the custom book, he has orders for €2.6 billion, which is equivalent to four-year production.
French media say Latecocer can finally take another breath after years on the drip.
The Czech race in Prague's Letňany is significant for the groups.
The group's sales contribute 16 percent.
Depending on the number of employees, it is the group's largest foreign branch.
The MPs supported the state's larger share of the coal fees.
The change in mineral extraction fees is expected to bring CZK 427 million more to the state treasury than in 2013.
According to the government, the revenues of municipal budgets are to be neutralised because the fee is to be higher.
In the previous year, municipalities received roughly CZK 450 million of the fees and the state budget of CZK 150 million.
The mining of brown coal was worth about 200 million crowns to municipalities and the state to 66 million crowns.
The amendment also envisages an increase in the reimbursement from the extraction area with the permitted mining to CZK 1,000 per hectare per year.
The revenue from these reimbursements is to continue to be fully owned by the municipalities.
Industry Minister Jan Mládek (ČSSD) told MPs that this will give municipalities to receive between CZK 14 million and CZK 100 million annually.
The amount of mining fees will no longer be determined by the law, but is provided for by the government by its regulation.
The refund is newly calculated as the product of the amount of the extracted mineral and the rates for individual minerals.
According to the government, the reason for the change is, among other things, the possibility of a flexible response to the current economic situation.
ODS MP Marek Benda, however, warned against the fact that the setting of the fee by decree of the government may not be in line with the constitution.
According to the Minister Mládek, however, it is not a tax in this case, because the state is charging for a mineral that is state property.
Fees are received only by municipalities whose territories are affected by the mining.
In the case of deep-sea coal, three-quarters of the money will be given to municipalities and a quarter to the state.
The ratio will be the same for the extraction of radioactive rock.
Some of the money the state collects in the mining fees will be earmarked for purpose.
For example, 28 percent will have to go to repair the damage after the extraction or to provide the Mining Rescue Service.
The draft was criticised today by opposition MPs, who argued in particular that they would damage the municipalities affected by the mining and the regions.
For example, Michal Kučera (TOP 09 and the Mayors) warned that mining companies would no longer want to sponsor municipalities as they have done so far, because they will pay higher fees directly to the state budget.
"It is not possible to tunnel one of the poorest regions just to have the Minister of Finance improve his budget," said David Kádner (Dawn) chosen in the Ústí Region.
Ahead of the rise in unemployment in Most, KSČM MEP Hana Aulická warned.
Kádner and Aulicka unsuccessfully proposed to reject the amendment, Kucera wanted to return the bill to the government for completion.
The explanatory memorandum states that, according to the mining firms, the increase in fees will not be reflected in the price of coal, as prices are more than 90 percent contracted in the long term.
Major consumers such as power plants or heating plants should therefore not feel the rise in prices.
"On the other hand, this fact increases the risk that mining organizations will compensate for the increase in reimbursements by seeking to reduce their operating expenses, which would mean a reduction in the number of employees," the government admits.
However, according to her, the increase in fees is acceptable in terms of employment.
According to the rapporteur for the amendment to Milan Urban (ČSSD), it is crucial that MPs know the conclusions on the updated energy concept and, in particular, the government's decision on the limits of coal mining, before the law is approved.
If coal is mined beyond the limits, then it will have repercussions on revenues for both the state and the municipalities, he stressed.
Urban disagrees with the Met that the decision to break the limit at the Czechoslovak Army mine should be made after 2020.
The limits at the CSA mine should be breached for social, economic reasons, and because of the long-term stability of domestic energy.
Time to decide on interest rates for the US Federal Reserve
The world is watching as the US Federal Reserve is set to meet in two days on Wednesdays and Thursdays to make a major decision on whether to raise interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade.
A survey by the 80 economists interviewed by Reuters found that more than half of those who thought the Federal Reserve would make a decision now think they would remain inactive for some time, leaving interest rates in the range of 0-0.25 percent.
It is a historic event because it has saddled years since the Fed cut rates to zero.
For the first time, we are approaching a situation where the main central bank could be able to get off the zero bar and start the process of normalizing interest rates," says Angel Ubide, head of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The US economy has performed reasonably well, with a recovery in the form of adding trillion dollars to the state's account and creating only a low level of inflation.
However, the Fed cannot ignore a less rosy global perspective.
They warned markets to be prepared for an increase, but the circumstances suggest that they also saw great chances against the move.
The decision is due to be announced on Thursday 20:00 CET.
Shooter at State University Delta left a message
Shannon Lamb, who shot his girlfriend in Mississippi - and later that day on the same day - wrote a note claiming that he was "laughter" of the first murders and that he wished to take it back, was revealed by the government authorities on Tuesday.
Police in Gautier, Mississippi, said Lamb, a geography and social science teacher at State University of Delta, called the police at about 10pm on Monday morning
and said he shot someone.
Lamb asked the dispatcher to send the police to his home.
He said, "I shot my wife last night" and also mentioned that there was a "cute dog" in the house that "will not annoy anyone" but is upset.
The police demanded the caller's name, but Lamb did not introduce himself.
Lamb also did not explain why the house was fired.
When police arrived at the scene, they found the body of 41-year-old Amy Prentiss and a handwritten note from Lambo that said, "I'm so sorry and I wish I could take it back.
I loved Amy, and she's the only person who ever loved me."
After leaving the message, Lamb set off on a 300-mile journey to Delta University, where he killed history teacher Ethan Schmidt and then took his own life.
University dean William LaForge said he knew no conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but that "something was clearly taking place in Mr. Lamb's head."
Despite Monday's statement that Lamb allegedly believed in Amy Prentiss's romantic relationship with Schmidt, government authorities said there was no "no evidence" of the "love triangle."
Shawn O'Steen, who had been married to Prentiss for over seven years, said she was a "great person."
The divorce took place 15 years ago, but both remained friends.
The 19-year-old daughter of O'Ssen and Prentiss was "shaken up" by the case.
O'Steen said Prentiss and her daughter were "best friends."
According to Linsday Knowles, a close friend of Prentiss, as the Sun Herald put it, Prentiss worked from the house online.
Knowles said Prentiss, who had a hunting dog named Lightning, dated Lamb for about three years.
"She always wanted to help others," Knowles said.
Police said Lamb spoke to his relatives on Monday and said he would not "go to jail."
When officers caught up with him on the highway near Greenville later that night, Lamb stopped and fled into the woods, where he shot himself.
According to a biography published on the school's website, Lamb received his doctorate in education at Delta University in the spring of 2015.
Stars that have lost their charms
The actor (left), in a picture with his son Redmond (right), has had several stressful years.
He struggled with leukemia in 2001, and in 2009 lost his longtime partner Farrah Fawcett to cancer.
The actor also reportedly had a drug problem and was arrested for drug possession in 2008.
All these things are surely taking their toll.
Luke Shaw of Manchester United will be out of the game for several months due to a double fracture.
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture of his right leg during Manchester United's defeat in the Champions League against PSV Eindhoven.
While this left-back has left this injury in tears and has been sidelined for at least six months, Louis van Gaal remains positive and thinks Shaw could play again at the end of the season.
The injury was caused by a reckless tackle by Héctor Moren in the 15th minute when 20-year-old Shaw broke into PSV.
He was treated on the playground for nine minutes and an oxygen mask was also needed before being rushed to the hospital.
Van Gaal said, "He suffered a double leg fracture and is now in the hospital."
He will be transferred tomorrow or perhaps the day after and then rescheduled in Manchester.
It's horrible - a guy who comes to Manchester at the age of 18 it's very hard, but he plays fantastic and then this happens.
When he was in the locker room, he also wore an oxygen mask.
He was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but a double broken leg will require six months of treatment and he won't be able to play in the group stage.
I believe he will play again this season.
Moreno was very lucky to not get a red card and a penalty kick.
Referee Nicola Rizzo did not punish the Mexican.
Van Gall suggested that the Italian referee had made a mistake.
You can judge for yourself whether it was a penalty and a red card.
It was a very nasty procedure with both feet.
The Shaw account tweet says: "Thank you all for their reports, in words it is not possible to express how devastated I am, my path to recovery begins now and I will come back even stronger."
Related: Manchaster United recorded Luke Shaw injured in defeat against PSV
The England defender will have an added motivation to recover in the form of the European Championship in France next July.
Phillip Cocu, the PSV coach, said, "It was a very nasty injury."
When any player leaves the pitch with an injury like that, everyone is very sad about it.
It is never the aim of our players to hurt the opponent.
Moreno suffered a broken leg in a match for Mexico against Van Gaal's Holland at the 2014 World Cup.
"It's very difficult for him because his intention was not to hurt the opponent, and when you hear about the seriousness of such an injury, it's not good," said Cocu.
I was unable to see this moment.
All I saw was a ball that was heading in a different direction, so it looked like [Moreno] touched it, but I didn't see the save for Luke.
In an interview with SBS6, Moreno said: "I know how he feels, I know how difficult such a thing can be.
It makes me feel very ill, I'm very sorry.
PSV player Andrés Guardado was also taken to the hospital after the procedure of Chris Smalling.
Surely David Cameron knows The Lorax better?
Every parent knows this thing: when a child loves a book, it doesn't take long for them to memorize it.
Of course, you mustn't be David Cameron.
Asked by the child scheme provider to name a popular children's book, he chose Prime Minister Lorax, a fable by Dr Seuss from 1971.
It was hard to choose, Cameron writes in a report posted on the SuperCamps website, and goes on: "Very funny, moving, creative and with strong content, I like to read that to my children because there was always an image or message behind it that I had not seen before."
Well, then, that in the following paragraph, Cameron allegedly described the plot of the book based on the lift from the 2012 film, which added additional characters and details to fill out a brief original text.
"In the city of Walls-Wed by Thneed-Ville, where all nature has ceased to exist, and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of a girl of his dreams, Audrey, by fulfilling her wish to see a real tree," is the brief content of a book chronicle that records the object of love unknown Dr. Seuss, whose real name was Theodor Seuss Geisel, who died in 1991.
As if it wasn't suspicious enough, the text supplied by Cameron reads as the summary elevator of the film Lorax, which finds them on the Internet of the Movie Database, and begins with the words: "In the city of Thneed-Ville, surrounded by the walls, where all nature has ceased to exist, and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of a girl of her dreams, Audrey."
Because he was an openly practical parent, it seems unlikely that Cameron would be acquainted with the plot of the book, where an unnamed young man learns that the local nature is devastated by the ragging, the trees-and-cut industrialist Once-ler, who, despite the protests of titular Lorx, a crouched, moustaching creature who "speaks for the trees."
In all likelihood, such a relatively low-grade PR task was given to a sidekick who had never read the child 20 times in a row.
A Downing Street spokeswoman said the text was most likely from Cameron's supporters' office.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was provided by a Cameron employee, but without further comment.
Adam Lyth was in danger of England's omission but still holding
Continuing with Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a tough task, but after seeing the team England selected for this tour, I think it will be less than likely to repeat the 3-0 defeat they suffered in the test series last time.
I would also not directly rule out the visitors' win.
Alastair Cooka's party may be less experienced than the one three years ago, but there are good players sleeping in this bounty set, and also the collective thinking is strong; they won't carry the scars of 2012, only a youthful positivity.
With the ball, the Moeen Ali is a developing spinner, and Adil Rashid, although he is unknown at the test set, represents the offensive option.
Related: Adam Lyth dropped out of the England team in an experienced series and was replaced by Alex Hales.
The decision to omit Adam Lyth is a tough challenge for me to analyze, because his head coach is in Yorkshire.
His seven tests were opposed to two good attacks in challenging conditions and a simple one, but the hard reality is that the cricket players are judged on the basis of performance.
There were no question marks around the name Joe Root, for example, which led to the announcement, because-and I've mentioned this before-the players are their best selectors.
A few more half-century, and Lyth could have extended his streak, but he had control over his own destiny.
Hopefully, if he can get more runs for the Yorkshire, there's another occasion.
England's head coach, Trevor Bayliss, praised his attitude, even though his performances were not entirely 100 per cent, and I'm not surprised; he was always a team player.
The question of how much test time a batsman gets to show himself is a tough nut to crack.
Lyth was given seven caps-as well as Sam Robson before him-while Nick Compton had won nine.
Only Compton got a chance at home and away.
The only thing you could grumble for is that England gave Jonathan Trottto a chance first in the Caribbean-evening even though Lyth was in the best shape-but this wasted opportunity is a thing of the past.
Here comes Alex Hales and he's a baton who I rate very positively.
He's a cricket-based, cricket player, seen here in Yorkshire at the start of the season, when he got 236 against us at Trent Bridge, which kind of did.
He must be given at least the same opportunity as his predecessors were given, but of course all of this would depend on the overall lineup in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea of Moeen starting at Cooco's side, who would get another extra spinner while maintaining four quicks, has been raised and I have no reservations about it.
I don't understand why the machine-box can't be fired and this left-handed man has already shown that he's an amazing cricket player.
Moeen may not be able to do his job for his county, Worcestershire, but he was number 3 for them, and there's no big difference.
My former teammate Justin Langer first played his first 38 rehearsals before his performance in 2001.
He had succeeded immediately for three centuries and he did not look back.
Zafar Ansari comes into the team as a backup spinner and when I had the chance to watch him, he caught my eye as a very impressive young man.
People can look at his rough stats - an average of 31 with a bat and 35 with a ball-and I see that as a pram, but there aren't a lot of spinners to raise their hands, and the selector opted for youth.
He'll learn a lot on this tour.
Outside the team, England appear to have made several changes and clever additions to their coaching staff.
The appointment of Mahel Jayawardene, the Sri Lanka batsman, as a consultant for the test matches, can be a masterstroke.
He's one of the most beautiful men playing who brings in a wealth of experience by having experience with all the conditions and all the attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes in part of the white-ball tour and brings both energy and a merciless sparkle to the team.
I've always felt that he was born into the world of international cricket, whether as a player or a coach, and, like Mahel, possesses the intellect that can be used.
New voices in the dressing room, even if they are voices saying consistent things that have been said before, can occasionally lighten the atmosphere.
Colly Durham's teammate Ben Stokes was given a day off, just as Root got a similar break against Australia, and I have no problem with this decision.
Even if many disagree, the trainers and the selector do not create a timetable.
And you have to remember, as players, that their work depends on the results.
Such decisions can never be taken lightly.
The Brexit campaign could win if the economy starts to stagnate by 2017.
David Cameron's ill-conceived strategy to renegotiate Britain to keep Britain in the EU is getting into more trouble with each passing day without the election of the brilliant Jeremy "Is it Yes or No?" Corbyn to lead the Workers' Party, or the TUC will take the whole situation around Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners also have their Corbyn and Nigel Farages.
A close friend of a European diplomat recently explained how Europe is mired in various crises - not all of which are their fault - some Member States have already had enough of the British egocentric agendas, the division of concessions and disruptive treaty changes that they mostly did not want.
At its one-year meeting in Brighton, the TUC decided that they didn't want to do so even if they erode social protection.
We can even call it the selfie agenda of Dave and George.
The Prime Minister and the Chancellor attend summits or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals, take a picture in front of the famous local monument, with or without local dignitaries, and then come home saying they are winning allies for reform.
It's all about me.
My European friend who wants a wicked-out Britain in Europe in Europe - "Don't leave us alone with France," says Berlin - suggesting that some of the short-sighted ministers and officials in some of the major cities have reached a point where they do not care about our departure.
Angela Merkel, Germany's cautiously balanced chancellor, is an ally, but has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave her post before she becomes as bad for her, as has been the case with the long-running Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
Frenchman François Hollande faces re-election or replacement in 2017.
His power is also in decline.
Poland may soon have a nationalist government on the right side, Spain on the left.
It is difficult to watch the French selfie break their feet in helping the British, who could better invest their energy to prevent Scotland from leaving the UK - something they do not want because they have similar separatist tendencies.
So some of these ministers may be planning deliberately unhelpful SNP-style remarks during the 2017 referendum campaign in the UK to hasten the Brexit process, a friend says.
"The re-running has solved the problem" and "Britain has no worthwhile in the negotiations."
Europeans, to their own detriment, know how predatory Fleet Street can be and how sceptical the EU is by the press oligarchs barons because they were not 2-1 in 1975 inspired by Tony Benn's 1975 entry.
They can vaguely remember the name Boris Johnson, a cheeky Euro-opportunist who made his name as the Brussels-based "EU straight bananas" correspondent in the early 1990s.
Despite his vanity, Ed Miliband knew his enemies.
They included a patchwork of bad guys not paying taxes, foreigners hacking with phones, and pseudo non-seeranic departments that owned most of the major newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair thought the same thing about them, but he realized that when you were in a cage with a frantic gorilla, you had to throw bananas to her so she wouldn't have you dinner, and then tea.
In fact, Miliband was more like Blair than Blair himself when he opposed Cameron's referendum routines, ever since Blair admitted the principle of the abolished EU constitution that was sunk by French and Dutch voters in 2005 and won him a drop card.
The press never forgave him either.
But, dear Jeremy Corbyn, who patted me amicably on the back at Westminster on Monday - I told him that he must not waste his time on me - seems in danger of accepting the strategy of the boycott of Murdoch Neil Kinnock, which was a mistake then and now.
It may take some time, but he needs to work out a coherent media engagement strategy, not with me, but certainly with Andrew Marr, whose chair he left the BBC on Sunday.
Corbin's official position towards Europe, I will say it pleasantly, is evolving.
He argues that he would like to remain in the reformed European Union.
Well, most people beyond the frantic tendencies of the Ukip and the wild shores of Tory's little Englanderism can certainly accept that.
Hilary said the same to Hilary "Bemm, but not by Benniite" Benn on both radio and television this week, when his inner scout could not commit to admitting that Corbyn's appointment of the abrasive McDonnell as shadow chancellor was a bad decision.
It reminded me of the 1970s when his old father fought on television for his loyalty without going too far and losing his job.
Hillary's game was much more attractive.
But to fight to stay "at all the circumstances" - Benn's phrase - it didn't seem to be what McDonnell said, nor what JC told colleagues and MPs at their private meeting on Monday night,
Whatever the background, the sensitive image that Corbyn wants to convey - don't forget, he touched me, too - the discipline of the news remains important in the ages of all-day television and especially in the swirl, the stinging of paranoia and betraying, which are the social media
It is fair to not provide Cameron with a free pass to Europe that would allow him to take the support of the Workers' Party in the referendum campaign as self-evident, as McDonnell put it.
Simon Jenkins is definitely thinking that.
But McDonnell and Corbyn's basic prepping about EU membership - in line with their Bennite-declacing economy, the anti-capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of esoteric discussion between left-wing dissidents, for whom the narcissism of small differences is the central essence of dogmatic bickering.
As with his squirding about Nato - Tom Watson is convinced that the JC campaign will not want to end it - foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to understand the meaning of all this for their landlords.
Why should Paris or Berlin spend political capital - they also have suspicious voters - because of Britain's concessions when that seems pointless?
The United States is already quite disappointed with the brisk 'weak military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even in reducing the costs of the Conservative Government in power, as I was recalled at the launch of Monday's launch of what was called the Security Forum of British Concentration.
Experts criticise review review of electronic published by Public Health England
The government-funded statement by the agency that e-cigarettes is 95% safer than smoking came from a meeting of 12 people, some of whom are associated with the tobacco industry, the researchers report.
Experts writing at the British Medical Journal (BMJ) have joined the Lancet to criticise the evidence used in their e-cigarette report by the Public Health England (PHE).
PHE released the "minor" report last month, describing it as a "comprehensive review of the evidence."
However, several researchers questioned the complexity of the data and drew attention to the links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
An editor in the Lancet's expert magazine last month attacked the "extremely flimsy base" on which the PHE news agency was basing its main conclusions.
Two other experts who write for the BMJ have disputed the allegations that were allegedly "built on rock or sand."
Martin McKee, a professor at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, a professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: "The basic principle of public health is that politics should be based on evidence of efficacy."
They indicate that the public might expect that the PHE claim that is "the current best estimate is that e-cigarettes are around 95% less harmful than smoking" are based on a detailed examination of the evidence and modelling.
In fact, this conclusion comes from one meeting of 12 people convened to draw up an analysis of the multi-criteria decision (MCDA) model to synthesise their views on the damage associated with the various nicotine-containing products; the results of the negotiations were summarised in a research report.
McKee and Capewell report that one sponsor of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose CEO allegedly previously raised funds from British American Tobacco for independent studies.
He also approved the Public Health Entry of Public Health in the Sustainability Report, he says.
One of the 12 participants in the meeting awarded funding from the e-cigarette manufacturer, but the financing it allegedly obtained earlier from the tobacco company Philip Morris International is supplied.
The reason for selecting panel members is not available, but they do contain several well-known e-cigarette champions, some of whom also declare industrial funding in the newspapers.
Some of the other people present at the meeting are not known for their expertise in the fight against smoking.
The meeting in PHE was also attended by the tobacco management.
A report produced in this group "tellingly concedes," the missing "hard evidence of the harmfulness of most products to most of the criteria," wrote McKee and Capewell.
However, none of these references or limitations is described in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell said that the PHE's claim that "there is no evidence yet that e-cigarettes act as a path to smoking for children or non-smokers," was premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, director of health and well-being at PHE, said the BMJ claim had already been answered before.
He said, "Electronic cigarettes are considerably less harmful than smoking."
One in two lifelong smokers will die because of their addiction.
All the evidence suggests that the health risks posed by e-cigarettes are small compared to the case, but we must continue to examine the long-term effects.
The PHE has a clear duty to inform the public of what the evidence shows, and also what it does not show, especially when there was so much public confusion about the relative dangers of tobacco.
Nearly 80,000 people a year die from smoking-related illnesses, and smoking costs the NHS$2 billion a year.
By highlighting the current evidence - that even if e-cigarettes are not without risk, they bear only a fraction of the damage caused to smoking - we are fulfilling our national competence.
BBC should end with EastEnders, former Channel 4 director says
Former Channel 4 Director Luke Johnson, said the BBC should stop broadcasting programs like EastEnders and The Voice, and confirmed that his commercial rivals would "give the right-hand man" for a hit show like Albert Square.
Johnson said the licensing fee should only be used for programmes that are not made up of other British television broadcasts.
He criticized the BBC for deploying public service programs that are likely to be watched by only a handful of people, into difficult broadcasting times compared to his rivals, "the biggest rating show, and on channels like the BBC4.
After General Manager Tony Hall said the corporation wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations, Johnson said he had tried unsuccessfully to join the BBC for the six full years he had worked on Channel 4.
"I am fighting the idea that the BBC is commissioning and broadcasting programmes that would certainly have been broadcast by rivals without state contributions," Johnson said on the Public House Communications Commission, as part of the BBC's Future Negotiations.
If you maintain royalties that I am not sure are a good idea in the medium or long term, the creation should be reduced at least in terms of programmes that others do not produce or are not awarding.
They're broadcasting The Voice in prime time because they want to get the widest possible support for the future.
The idea that no one else would have sent it is a ridiculous joke, and understandably nonsensical.
Johnson said: 'I don't understand why a regressive tax should support programs that can be funded in a post-to-service way.
The Voice is one of them, EastEnders another, and of course produced domestically.
Honestly, other channels would give them their right-hand hand.
I can't understand how these public broadcasters are.
I don't think it would weaken the BBC in the slightest.
Johnson, the show's businessman, who led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, told the BBC that he felt guilty about catching up on ratings "because of the ambitions of the people who worked here, and because he believed that this was the best way to secure long-term support."
His commentary on the BBC's most popular show reiterates those that former Sky Managing Director, Tony Ball, who used his MacTaggart lesson in Edinburgh in 2003 to suggest that the BBC sells the show as EastEnders.
Johnson said that even the BBC's more cherished public service programmes "transfer to the BBC4, where quite often the audience cannot be measured, but they are fulfilling their authority and can argue when they are preparing to justify the £4bn income from the royalties on their hypocritical mission, "But of course we do all these obscure programmes that no one is looking at."
They're being sent when no one's looking at them.
As for the licence fee, Johnson told the commission: "I'm calling on you to find a more regressive system about who gets the best value out of it.
Of course, we all think that 150 British pounds a year is a large sum, but for people for whom 150 pounds is a lot, I'd be surprised if they paid so much because they don't look at the BBC as much.
Former Sky and Channel 5 director David Elstein, who appeared before the commission on Tuesday, said the BBC should review its reith mission in the sense of "informing, educating and entertaining."
He confirmed that the BBC's small production volume was now previously classified as educational - it used to be 1% of television production and 0.1% on the radio - and should take public public broadcasting in Australia and Canada as a model and change it to "inform, explain and entertain."
On the subject of the partnership, Elstein said the BBC should do more in areas like the Proms, which were broadcast on television only a handful, and join in with commercial reporters so that we can see them all online.
‘Sonogenetics’ or control of brain cells using sound waves
This video shows how the sound pulses affect the direction the nematodes move.
Scientists have raised worms with a genetically modified nervous system that can be controlled by sound waves.
Tiny nematodes change direction when they are hit by sonic pulses that are inaudible to the human ear.
Pulses work by switching off the cells of genetically modified motor neurons, which are programmed to respond to these ultrasonic waves.
Related: Scientists can read and write brain activity using light
Scientists have reported that these worms are a great example of a new methodology called sonogenetics that uses ultrasound to activate brain, heart, and muscle cells and activates outside the body.
Sekanth Chalasani, a researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told the Guardian that this method could one day replace deep brain stimulation - an invasive procedure in which electrodes that stimulate the brain are injected into the patient's brain. The method is used for example to treat the symptoms of Parkinson's disease.
The mushrooms usually don't respond to the ultrasound, but Chalasani found that the reaction would come when they were placed in a liquid containing microscopic bubbles.
As he discovered, the bubbles are amplified by ultrasonic waves, which then pass through the worms' bodies.
The reinforced ultrasound waves are active in the TRP-4 ion channels, which are found in the membranes of some worm cells.
Thanks to the sound waves, these channels open and activate the cells they are linked to, a report by the journal Nature Communications.
In order to control the nematodes using ultrasonic waves, Chalasani genetically modified the worms so that some of their motor neurons contain the TRP-4 ion channels.
Then, when he used ultrasound on the worms so modified, the sound waves were reinforced with microbubsels and transferred to the worms, where they turned on the modified motor neurons.
The new method is much like optogenetics, a pioneering instrument that allows scientists to turn on and off neurons using light.
Chalasani, however, has been quoted as saying that the sonogenetics could have many advantages over this technique.
Unlike light, which must be sent by optical fibre to the desired place in the brain, ultrasonic waves can penetrate the tissues without any limit and be sent directly to the brain.
"We believe that if we use gene therapy and therapeutic viruses, we can target human neurons and make them temporarily sensitive to ultrasonic signals used in clinical treatment to treat neurological diseases," Chalasani said.
He added that the method would also find its application in the treatment of muscle cells and insulin-producing cells.
Illegal torture devices - right on your doorstep!
Ads dismantling the British arms deal.
Watch the video on the anti-Serrant Market by Amnesty International.
The menacing killer drones!
The shackles of the legs that break the ankles!
Splinter missiles!
And the electric stunning batons that cause excruciating pain but leaving no trace!
The hilarious voice and caricature of the metaphor leave no doubt that this advertisement at the world's largest arms fairs is a sharp parody created for Amnesty International to highlight the British government's willingness to sell weapons to repressive regimes through the defence and security facility of the International Veselice at the ExCeL Centre in London's Docklands district.

But a stand-alone campaign is also conducted with the emergence of posters at bus stops and metres that require a second view.
"Important announcement, DLR travel from 15 to 18 September?" reads one, using a font with the London Underground brands with the DLR lines to become a picture of a tank.
This September, a swarm of arms dealers will descend on the DLR ... Customers are being asked to help stop the arms deal.
The 300 posters are made by artists who exhibit their work at the Museum of Cruel Design in Banksy's Dismismaland.
The Special Patrol Group collective helped distribute them all over London and using the "Ad Space Hack Packs," which is £6 apiece of the Allen key, which supposedly "gets access to about a third of the advertising space of the planet's bus stops."
Transport for London is not amused by this flyposting "vandalism."
One of the advertising parodes made by the Special Patrol Group collective.
According to Gavin Grindon, curator of Cruel Designs and an assistant professor at the University of Essex, artists are increasingly questioning and trying to show political activity to viewers outside the galleries.
Many artists are switching to working with activists as part of the protest movements and realize that they have to get out in the real world in order to have their art impact on society.

The Amnesty video was viewed by more than 100,000 people on Facebook in 24 hours and was created by the VCCP agency working without a fee and a graphic designer and the commentator also worked for free.
The VCCP's creative director, Matt Lever, would be surprised at the silence surrounding the arms store ads - he saw an empty spot on the ExCeL calendar - and he thought, "Let's show them a campaign to avoid."
They toyed with the creation of a more realistic risky corporate ad, but "adding colorful colors and animations, we've made it attract more people."
"They did a fantastic job and helped us raise concerns about the sale of illegal torture instruments at the fair," says Tom Davies in Amnesty.
What we need now is for the UK Government to take action to ensure that the torture device is not being traffickered illegally on our doorstep.
Perhaps the most creative art surrounding the weapons store comes from within ExCeL, where exhibitors sell fantastically euphemistic products.
In a press release, Saab unveiled an order from the U.S. military on the "armial AT4CS RS."
This includes "a unique shaped warhead that provides amazing effects from behind the armor inside the target."

Eight golden rules for living in a student dorm
11 years ago, I moved to the college of students as an oblivious 19-year-old boy, still a barele-gain believer and moral relativism, but only now do I recall the tense smiles of those I'd wolpped - and the numerous, lengthy, lengthy complaints about others.
Everything I've learned can be distilled into eight simple rules.
Movement on the tracks can range from a slightly nerves going to the totally appalling one.
It's tempting to babble: telling people where you're from, if you took a year's break, what an opinion you have about Corbyn, and why "you sincerely don't love Marmite, because you guys, it's just an extract from HAHAHA's yeast, I'll be in your room."
Take a deep breath.
And help others to take a breath, too - ask and express an interest.
It's guiding a conversation and it's going to help you find the people you like, and you who you wouldn't talk to even if your eyelashes were on fire and they'd release the fire-fighting machines.
Leave the people's space.
People's rooms often turn into drinking receptions, movie evenings spots and community public spaces, but they are also rooms in which people dress and customize their underwear.
Related: Don't even think about starting to go to college while being in a relationship
The introverts in college will come up short.
Your room should be a haven, yet a lot of tracks turn into an out-of-peaceous walk-out culture that is friendly, sociable and contributes to lifelong friendships.
This may be hell for someone who needs to recharge.
No culture allows you to say, "I love you and I want our friendship to continue, but I need you to leave, to be able to return to the energy I've used to talk to you."
Try to see when a classmate is tired of socializing - and maybe write him a place to knock.
Speaking of knocking: knock.
A boy in my dorms was used to the fact that if the door wasn't locked, he was invited in.
He saw a few things.
Make your friends by baking.
Having started going to the university at the top of baking mania, knocking on a foreign door, and a show with a sheet of baked cakes seems slightly less strange than "Welcome to the neighborhood, I've baked you a little something, now smile while I ask the personal questions."
Offering homemade delicacies is a good way to make friends.
Your roommates will feel obligated to talk to you, and maybe it will all end by tying your face to a tasty surprise.
This is, of course, the object of being a decent baker.
Poorly condensed pieces of flour, sugar and a cottage are likely to guarantee that others will pretend to sleep when you try to knock on their door.
The theft of food is a common crime in student dormitories.
The theft of the whole chicken is a crime, of course, but is there a drop of milk in your tea theft?
Check with the milk owner twice.
There's a chance they'll offer you milk even if they're raving inside.
If someone steals something from you, it's annoying and you have my sympathy - but try to deal with it a little more mature than my roommate, who swapped her milk for a dishwashing device to punish the thieves.
He's in jail now.
You shouldn't make noises that disturb people from sleeping or studying.
It's not just about being a decent human being, it's also about being the proverbial people in the glass houses.
A girl from my hallway asked her neighbors if they could lower the drum and bass a little bit because they were 3 at night and had a test in the morning.
Their answer was to boost music.
When they finally fell silent at 5 a.m., she let them sleep peacefully for two hours, and then played her own music out loud, locked the door and went off to her three-hour test.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future husband went to the same dormitories as you?
Conversely, wouldn't it be appallingly embarrassing if you mistook your roommates for their future spouse, slept together, broke up, and had to see each other every day, and maybe take control of your mutual friends, too?
Of course, you're not going to tell your heart - but if your sexy roommate is definitely not your future spouse, try to talk to your weaknesses a little bit.
At an uplifting moment, when you realize that someone left the keys in their unlocked room, there is only a thin line between fun and bullying.
A good prank is funny, but it's easy to fix.
Teach them a valuable and fun lesson about their security by saving them something - never whip someone's room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock their doors and put the keys in a bottle of water, which you then shove in the freezer - but never stick their stuff on the ceiling more than twice.
Eva was looking forward to the twins despite the uncertain prospects for the future.
Eva had a rough time while already pregnant with the now seven-year-old Vítek.
His father broke up with her, and she was alone to prepare and raise her offspring.
I came to terms with the situation quite quickly - I was very much looking forward to the child and looking for positives in it.
I was trying to not worry about the uncertainty and being alone with the child.
And I certainly had the hope that we wouldn't be alone for long, Eva recalls her first pregnancy today.
She had already met online on the cottage of the elder Vasek, with whom they began to talk about their favourite films.
Vasek even brought Eva and Vítkem home from the maternity ward, but he did not rushing too much into the role of stepfather.
"He then withdrew from the program for a while," Eva described in the documentary series Four in the Then 3 3.
The motive for the third series of the Czech TV series is just the search for happiness at the second attempt.
She managed to care about Vítek and the family's financial security thanks to part-time work and a big help for her mother and to help the aunt's assistance.
Even the prospects for responsibility for a foreign child did not ultimately spoil Vasek's affection for Eva.
They finally got together around Vítkov's second birthday and he now understands Vasek as his dad and he also addresses him that way.
Although Vasek already has two adult daughters, she says she enjoys paternity at the age of 60, and she is also more devoted to children.
In addition to Vítek, they were joined by two-year-old Leontýnka and eventually by twins.
"Vasek came into our family kind of naturally, perhaps even by the fact that my mother never talked much into my relationships," the smiling Eva thinks.
Not enough room?
At least we're close.
The twins Emma and Ela were born by caesarean section after Eva was diagnosed with pregnancy cholestasis at the end of her pregnancy.
This is a disorder of production and activity of bile acids, which are then found in excessive amounts of the pastus and are particularly manifested by itching.
The disease is dangerous for the unborn fetus, which is at risk of premature birth and death, in the mother usually spontaneously subscriber after giving birth.
Emma and Ela were born healthy to Eva and Vasek's happiness, even though they were only at 36 weeks.
The emxtinction was placed in an incubator in the intermediate department, where Vasek's niece also works, who managed to take over and accommodate her.
Elinka was bigger and right after being transported from the ICU to the room I had it with me, she describes the challenging period after giving birth to Eva.
She spent twenty days in the maternity ward until the doctors volunteered to release the babies, who had managed to reach the two-kilometre mark.
Waiting to take on the children in the maternity ward, Eva, was not happy.
"I was a madhammer for my husband and children," the mother of four-times recalls of the six-week ward.
She and her husband also considered signing the reversal, including because of the insensitive approach of one of the doctors.
But this did not happen in the end, and the doctors discharged Eva and the twins to home care.
The stories of four pregnancies and births are broadcast by ČT1 on Tuesday evening at 9:45 p.m.
A fairly large family can be cut back.
They live together in a small house near Prague, where Eva had to make do with an electric two-purpline and cramped conditions.
The house did not get bigger, but Vasek made Eva happy by installing the gas cooker to make the food preparation more comfortable for six people.
If it's at its best, we'll take turns taking a cab.
Eva is convinced that children perceive especially the family's well-being and pleasant atmosphere, and not the size or the shallowness of the cottage.
For now, we've put together very nicely, better than we'd expected.
The mess is harder to hide in a small space and we sometimes cross the cut-out babies, but at least we are all around, smiling Eva, who can find a positive side for every situation.
Vaška's work of the lighting for the film is not a guarantee of regular income.
That's why he sometimes takes to the streets of Prague as a taxi driver.
At the age of 60, he says, he physically manages family finance care and children, but how long will it be?
"I realize that given our age difference, it will be me who will feed this family one day," Eva admits frankly when questioning about the future.
She would like to return to work, but is even more attracted to the possibility of her own business.
With four children, I'm not a big deal for my employer.
And when it's at its worst, my husband and I can take turns taking turns on a cab, jokes a sympathetic blonde.
Apple suffered a yo-yo effect.
It's all the fault with the displays.
A more powerful processor, a larger-resolution camera, a firmer chassis or a touch-sensitive display are, in short, the virtues of the recently introduced Ninth-generation iPhones.
The last two then also have a negative impact on the dimensions and weights of the iPhones 6s and 6s Plus.
Apple's trend to date has been that every new generation of the iPhone is lighter than the previous one.
The exception was only the third and fourth-generation, whose weight increased slightly compared to previous iPhones.
The two-gram masses the difference to the detriment of the novelty was really insignificant.
However, this is far from the case of new iPhones.
Compared to last year's iPhones 6 and 6 Plus, the weight of the smaller model grew by 14 grams, and the larger ones by a whopping 20 grams.
On the one hand, it is not surprising, last year's affair by bending in Apple's pockets greatly troubled.
The chassis of novelties are made of the more durable aluminium alloy 7000, which was also reflected in the weight.
But the displays have a much bigger impact on it.
In fact, Apple used 3D Touch technology for the news, which will make the displays recognize the power of touch.
To do this, the display had to be fitted with another layer of capacitive sensors.
The weight of the new iPhones' displays has thus increased more than double compared to previous generations.
For the smaller iPhone, from originally 12 grams to 29 grams, and for the larger one, from 19 to 40 grams.
For the iPhone 6s, the display is the toughest used component.
The weight of only 143 grams is then achieved in this novelty thanks to the defacement crust, which touched most of the remaining components.
The larger model is then the heaviest used element of the battery, but its weight has not changed from its predecessor.
In this case, too, the biggest increase is noticeable for the display.
The weight of the 5.5" iPhone 6s Plus thus reaches 192 grams.
To the extent that the new display technology will be practical, it will only become apparent when used.
The first users will be able to try it out as early as Friday, September 25, when iPhone 6s and 6s Plus sales will start in selected countries.
Have the flakes of champions' breakfast been in tens of thousands of years?
In Grotta Paglc, Italy, the archaeologists have made the find that opens up interesting possibilities.
They discovered traces of the settlement of modern man from different times, including murals, remnants of instruments, and so on and so on.
In the layer of 23A, which according to the tools is dated to around 30,000 years ago but discovered by scientists but something that is very reminiscent of the remnants of the breakfast buffet.
There were traces of oatmeal in the site, which apparently went through the process of producing today's so popular flakes.
At that time, the grains are first soaked, then dried, rid of the packaging, the so-called pluch, then sprinkled and spilled.
In the cave of Pagllecci, the grains, which were believed to have been shaped or steamed, and then apparently crushed between two millstones - at least the marks of use on the two stones in the cave.
So the scientists were unable to prove in their publication for PNAS that there was a complete process of making flakes in the cave, but the similarity is really very noticeable.
We also have no evidence of how people could eat the flakes, but the assumption that it was with some liquid and quite possibly warm is, of course, quite logical.
At the same time, it is a very interesting illustration of how intensively people used cereals long before the creation of agriculture.
Indeed, if the show's interpretation is correct, the oldest flakes have overtaken agriculture by roughly twenty thousand years.
New station reports in the Transportation Business of the City of Brno.
So I listened once again to the names of the stops in the trolleybus: Hnusáčkova, Ghost, Frázova, Spratecká.
Of course, the trolleybus was a bit noisier, so the report in a man's voice was somewhat less intelligible than before, when the stops were reported in a woman's voice.
The female voice is higher, so in the deeper noise of the traffic traffic it is more discernible than the deeper male voice.
DPMB argues that this announcer was chosen by the passengers themselves - I don't know who, who were not asked by anyone, but they certainly chose that from studio recordings made in complete silence, which of course sounded quite different from the noise of the bus engine.
I have lived in Brno for quite a few decades for a few decades, so I know the correct names of all those stops by heart, so I don't need these reports, but foreigners from elsewhere who are unfamiliar with themselves in Brno and for whom these reports are primarily intended may be confused and can be confused at the end, where they accidentally arrived, then claim that the stop at which they were to perform was not reported at all.
Perhaps the selection of the announcer should be made again - but better again the announcer - again, and this time tinged with the normal traffic noise and the clattering of the engine in which the bus speaker's chimney, is almost lost.
So we don't have to listen to the names of the stations of Water Heršpice, Šmírova, or then immersion in the creaking shawl, to which I transferred in Komárov.
I suppose my old-age hearing didn't get so bad at the same time in the only day the call-up of the stops changed.
I understood the reports pretty well before that day.
Good morning, Comrade Chief.
From the track notes.
Today, few people know what the so-called comprehensive clearances were during the reign of the party's biggest and smartest.
I took the liberty of reminiscing about it.
The bus was late.
I bumped into the dispatcher's office the moment it was said from the radio that it was seven o'clock.
"You're lucky you didn't collide with the comrade chief, he came in a minute before you, and he doesn't seem to be in the mood," the dispatcher observed as I entered the book of arrivals.
Thanks, I'll be careful.
Write to me that I am driving around the districts to revise the minor mechanization.
It's not going to work, there's clearances today.
Everyone's so fucked up, it's a horror.
What is it?
"You'll see," the dispatcher sneered.
Next time you'll be, too.
I ran out into the hallway.
Then the warwoman's door opened and the chief appeared.
Stuffed, stony-faced, in a perfectly fitting uniform.
"Good morning, Chief," I said respectfully, quickly on the two buttons of the uniform's jacket.
"Good morning," came the reply, and I hurried out to the second floor, not realizing the cold, ominous tone the old man answered.
"You're playing games," said the engineer Eva, the elderly lady I respected.
She said she was even a chief before her comrades deposed.
There are checks, and you'll arrive.
How many times have I asked what the comprehensive background checks are, but no one wants to talk about it too much.
They say they're every three years, they all have to join them, and it's pretty uncomfortable.
At least for some.
I'm supposed to be.
I pulled the file out of the drawer with periodic reports and the phone.
"Horcan here, come to me right away," the chief's voice said.
What's bothering?
Now we met and nothing ..." I mumbled, but no one answered me, each with their own thoughts.
"Good day, Comrade Chief, I came at your command," I faded, stepping into the chief's office.
The chief sat behind the desk, looking at some paperwork.
"Comrade Mechanator," he said after a moment, without raising his head and still studying the paperwork carefully, "I don't like your behavior at all."
He tossed the paperstroke onto the table, leaned back in the chair's back of his chair, and stared at me with his usual, unpleasant, evil, prickly gaze.
I lost my mind.
What's the matter?
Yesterday, the undersecretary praised himself for the fact that in my few months in office I had worked very well and that he was very happy with me.
That the chief did very well to pull me out of the platoon at the distance.
Now this?
You realize you're a track-stage distance technician and you have to act like it.
The kind of greeting you used this morning is just unacceptable.
I stammered that I've used such a greeting since I was a kid, that I was raised so well and that I don't see anything wrong with it.
To the chief, it was like a red rag on a turkey.
"You are on the socialist railway and the only acceptable greeting is the honour of the work," the gnaphlete faded.
Plus, you're still knitting the name of your superiors.
One day you say "sir" and the second time you say "comrade."
But I'm not the chief to you, I'm a comrade chief.
The deputies are the vice-children deputies, the top trackers are the comrades to the top trackers!
You'll remember that!
Excuse me, sir... comrade chief, but... but I greeted you with a normal civic greeting.
There's nothing wrong with that ... and that honor of a job or a comrade... you know...
"It's not your preference that you're not in the party," said the chief coldly, calming down a bit.
It's still going to be mentioned.
Anyway, remember, you don't have that chair up there for retirement.
That was not good.
When the chief told someone that something was not their preference, it didn't look good with the person.
He gave me a cold, prickly look, and I searched for the words to answer.
I was also annoyed by his haughty first name.
He was only a few years older and playing the Lord, actually comrade-fortama.
The heel, cocky, authoritarian, arrogant, as he was at the moment.
He was all pooted.
So be it, he's a chief.
In fact, not all of them, the chairman of the party organization, as all partisans but also independents, was on a first-name basis.
But the chief tos to many, especially those with whom he could exercise his superiority.
He's just wiped me off for total bullshit.
I thought of something about the ass, and it cost me enough to overtake it so I wouldn't shoot it in his face.
But then I wouldn't even go back to the chumpster, let alone keep working as a railroad clerk.
What would I feed two kids for?
Plus a built-up hut!
I felt like crying, but I took control.
I won't make him happy.
"That's all for now, you can go," the chief said, ending the audience, and began to look closely again at the paperwork he had been in hand.
At eleven-thirty, I was summoned.
Everyone in the office was already there, and to the questions, what and how, they said, didn't they say it would be good.
Only Jožin said tartile, as was his custom, that they could not fire us all, because the comrade chief himself and his loyalists would have to do the job, and that was not the danger.
The word "comrade" emphasized, as if he knew what the old man had wiped me away for.
The chief's room was a pretty reunion.
Comrade chief behind his desk and at the long council table other comrades who were to decide on my clerical being or not being.
Kádrovák, the chairman of the ROH, the staff writer, the special-profile officer, the manner of the countermint in the army, and the deputy, my boss.
And the most important person, the chairman of the party organization.
I knew him from the trek.
An ordinary track worker, he sanded with sleepers or pitchforks threw gravel.
But also a former guard.
It was rumored that he had been no fun at the time, a pretty beast, he said.
The evil tongues said he had gone out in the seventh grade, learned nothing, he didn't know anything.
And when the jail was canceled, he ended up on a trek at the pickaxe.
But comrade, yeah, comrade was forged!
The chief motioned for me to sit down.
There was a little soul in me, an unlicencative cone in my throat.
Kádrovák read the opinion from the civic committee from the residence.
I come from a working-class family, I'm married, two children, and so on and so on.
So far, so good, I thought, and I was breathing a little better.
Then an opinion from the party's street organization.
He copied the opinion from the citizens' committee, perhaps the same person wrote them both.
But then it came!
Parents of the party's longtime members, refused to appear before the screening committee and subsequently withdrew from the party, reportedly for health reasons.
The chief looked at me sharply.
The cadre saw it and stopped reading.
The chief motioned for him to continue.
Beyond that, it was only worse.
I was a member of the SSM Municipal Committee and there I was won as the candidate of the party.
Regardless of the parents who came out of the party, the party gave me the confidence.
But I got married, and I had a wedding in the church in addition to the national committee.
I have failed the party's confidence in the worst way.
That's why I was removed from among her candidates.
But that wasn't enough!
I had both children baptized, and even for my mother, when she died, I gave a church funeral, even though he was a former member of the party.
I am showing with all this negative attitude towards the party's leading role.
When the cadre read, only the tapping of the chief's pencil at the tabletop's plate interrupted the tense silence.
Everyone stared at me, and I wished I'd been far away.
In doing so, I kept repeating to myself "Communists - superhuman, communists - the superhumans." What did I get into?
Why didn't I stay with the blacksmiths?
I could repair the switches without some fucking check.
But now?
The career of the railroad clerk was taken over before she started.
Go back to the platoon?
I don't think the chief will go out for an hour.
"Comrade, how did you check out the comrade being discussed?" the chief interrupted the tense silence with a question to the cadre.
Well, according to a previous job report.
You got him here?
Kádrovák was clearly not twice in the face.
On the graft of sweat, he winked nervously, as if he were himself being vetted.
He nodded zealously and handed the chief some paper.
"Well," the chief said, with a hint of joviality, which often had been a preclamon to the storm.
At first glance, all the praise, trained with honours, graduated from industrial school, worked in the taskwright as a locksmith, the standard averaging one hundred and twenty percent.
But the essentials are missing.
Where did you get the report from, comrade?" he said again to the cadre, who felt that it was somehow beginning to turn against him, and that very soon he might not even be a cadre.
This is where the comrade gave it to me, at the entrance.
That's enough for you?
"Well, when he joined us, he went to the cupcake district," the cadre babbled.
And there the assessments don't demand, his was kind of extra, so I put it in his file.
"So when you were assigned to the technical function, this scrap of paper was enough for you," the chief said dryly.
The cadek winked nervously, and had no answer.
"Never mind, we'll discuss that later," the chief concluded, and the cadre was clearly relieved.
For now, he's stood by.
"So what about you, comrade?" the chief asked me again.
Suddenly it's coming out, so that's the end!
My eyes were darkened, the heat doused.
There was a flurry of reprimands and accusations, and I knew that I was the world's most despicable creature, which did not deserve the slightest mercy.
That by planting an incomplete opinion I misled the comrade of the caddler's comrade, not understanding why the report was incomplete when I got it from the cadre in the factory.
I am also an anti-socialist element that, at the time of the building of real socialism, promotes the rejections of religious obscurating, a.vi, even participates in them.
That, that, there was a lot of what I did, or maybe I would commit again, and I prayed quietly to be over.
I didn't care about everything anymore.
I didn't care about me flying out of the job.
I didn't care if they took the pick.
This is a job for the honest and decent people, not the enemy of the people I was in the eyes of the comrade chief.
"That's enough, Comrade Chief," the party chairman said suddenly, emphatically interrupting the chief's levities.
This is where the comrade made a mistake, a tremendous mistake.
What a mistake, he's done stupid!
But he's already been given his punishment!
Don't forget that, Comrade Chief!
What could be worse for a young person than to close the door to the side for a time!
To reopen to him, he would have to prove that he had changed, that he was worthy of our trust again.
The uneducated guard sounded like a book.
Where did he come from?
Is he so well-read or parroted phrases from partisan training sessions and meetings?
That's why this young comrade must get a chance from us!
A chance to prove he's changed.
And who is to give it to him if not you, Comrade Chief?
It is your duty to support this young young, true, somewhat misguided comrade in his efforts to redress!
It's your party duty that no one can get rid of!
Actually, it's a partisan duty for all of us, too.
Here the comrade must see that the party has not forgotten him.
That as a kind mother, she not only punishes, but also loves.
When the chairman was finished, no one was even fumbling.
No one expected such a turn of the situation.
At least me.
"I completely agree with you, Comrade Chairman," the chief agreed icily, seeking to take the initiative again.
If you had me finished speaking, you'd hear that's the conclusion I was about to.
They all nodded in agreement, but you could see that they didn't believe him a word.
"So I was confirmed for the job of a stand-alone officer of the care of the basic means," I shouted as I returned to the office, and then I began to cry.
Good thing, apart from the engineer Eva, everyone was at lunch.
She silently listened to my incoherent makeup of the fresh experiences, and in the meantime, I relaxed.
When I finished, she asked if I'd like some coffee.
Without waiting for an answer, she put the water on the cooker and prepared the mugs.
In the meantime, she talked about the cadre practices.
How one report, often full of praise, is given to a man's hand, and the other, in which there is any dirt, is sent to the new employer.
But I didn't end up where I was supposed to, but on a trek at the pickaxe, and so the comrades from the factory didn't know where to send it.
And our cadre?
He just cares where he would eat or drink what, and that's how it turned out the way it did.
"He'll get it from the old one," she said mischievously.
He's definitely not going to like it today.
Beware of him anyway, he's pretty vindictive.
And the party chairman?
Basically a far worse chief, no philanthropist.
Zero from the pickaxe with great power.
The coffee water boiled on, and the next thing the office was filled with the scent of the just-drenched coffee.
I dropped a sugar cube into the cup and made a silently stirred a hot potion.
I hope the worst of it.
I'm not fired now, and the next checks aren't for three years.
Anyway, the comrade chief won't soon forget me today.

The symbol of the village came to life.
The round of the windmill above Chlum is spinning again years later.
It can be seen from afar because it is located on a 15-metre-high mast.
People from a wide area call him "the airline on Chlum."
For the municipality of 150 inhabitants, it even became one of the elements of the municipal emblem, which the municipality received to mark the councillors' meeting in 2010.
"We applied for a sign at the time and of course we wanted to have a fan on the sign, everyone knows it in the area," said Mayor Jiří Mašek.
The Chlum wind pump is a local technical monument.
It is also a bit of a memento of the moment: it recalls a time when the people here fought for quality drinking water.
The one in Chlum in the past centuries was a rarity.
It was not until 1910 that the Chllum representatives decided to address a solution that suited it until the mid-1980s.
In the village at the turn-off to Číchov, they had a seven-metre-deep well excavated.
Three years later, they supplemented the well with a metal structure with a wind pump that pumped the water into the reservoir at the highest point of the village, near the local church.
"The construction was carried out by the company Antonín Kunc from Hranice na Moravě with a cost of CZK 2,400," says the commemorative sign on the ground-floor fence of the mast structure.
The pump, after several repairs and wind-wheel crashes, served in 1971.
On 7 May 1973, a new chapter in the battle for water was written: a new water pipe began to be served on Chlum.
The wind pump was left only with a dysfunctional municipal symbol and a rarity here.
The dominant feature was put into operation at this year's reunion of the natives.
It was not until 2008 that the Chlumsky decided to repair the wind wheel again and put them back into operation.
They had a replica of the original wheel made - scaled in diameter by half a metre.
The round was fitted with a mast, but it had to be brought down that same year.
The replica manufacturer did not choose the appropriate material and the bike could not resist the gusts of wind.
Then the Chlum's dominance rested for several years dismantled under the roof.
As of this June, however, the bike on the tall mast is rolling again.
On the occasion of the native meeting, the village had the replica of the bike modified and re-fitted it to the top of the iron tower.
But the bike draws utility water from the well only to the overhead blind shoulder.
And we completely disconnected it over the summer because there was little water in the well.
It was at least a blank.
"In the autumn, we will then disconnect the wind wheel shaft from the pump in the suction basket again," Mayor Mašek explained.
Chlum is not the only municipality in the Czech Republic where a wind bike has entered the municipal emblem, but it is the only villages of this kind in the whole Highlands.
They have a similar element in the emblem in honour of local technical monuments in the taste of local technical monuments in Chvalkovice and Zelená Hora in Vyškov, Kuželov in Hodonínsk, Partutovice na Přerovsku or in the Police na Vsetínsko.
No offense, but I don't know Lafatu, the prop of Tripoli Goian admitted.
"I remember the game against Slavia very well, and my goal, like everyone in my career," the 34-year-old Goian smiled at the pre-match press conference.
Georghe Hagi was coached by us then, it was a shame we lost.
I hope to score a goal for Sparta now.
Only that we won't lose this time," Goian continued.
It is this man who played 60 matches for the Romanian national team that is a key supporter of the Greek team.
As a hitter, he will face the raids of the Spartans offensive.
A few thousand people will come, no hell, says Spartan Hybš of the Greek duel.
And he's partly aware of what he might be in for by Thursday night.
I know Fataie, who played in Astra, Romania, with my brother Luciano.
I saw all their fights at the time.
I know he's a very good forward, that's why he went to Sparta, Goian said.
He did not appoint other Prague club footballers, so the direct question came as to whether he also knew David Lafatu, the best striker in the history of the Czech league and captain of the Sparta.
Goian smiled and was pointing a slightly reproachful look at the Czech journalists.
The helpless look on his face indicated, "Why are you asking me that?"
After a moment of silence, he began to silence.
We've seen some videos and I've noticed that Sparta is playing a lot of team.
He's got really good players.
And Lafata?
No offense, but I don't know anyone else but Fataie.
The Spartans know very well about Goian.
"He has experience from bigger clubs, you can say that he holds the defence of Asteras, he is kind of their organizer of the game," observed Spartan assistant Stanislav Hejkal.
Goian has already had his best years, but he can boast a very interesting football biography.
At the time, he was interested in him Borussia Dortmund, Stuttgart, both Manchester United and City, but from Steaua he headed to Italy's Palermo, Italy, and played for the Glasgow Rangers.
We are expecting an aggressive and unusual style, says the coach.
Sparta are a big team, playing European Cups on a regular basis, battling to win the Czech league.
For me he is the favourite in this match, but we are playing at home and we want to start the group with a good result.
Like Sparta, we will try to win, Goian said.
I am in the room with the Slovak goalkeeper Tomáš Košická, who is very much looking forward to his opponent from the Czech Republic.
Me too.
But for the whole team, I can say we're going to fight hard.
Kofola is moving from Poland to the Czech Republic, considering joining the Prague Stock Exchange.
The new headquarters should be Kofola in Ostrava.
Kofola S.A. was registered in Poland for trading in the company's shares on the Warsaw Stock Exchange.
Our primary objective is to have the group headquarters in the Czech Republic.
The steps we have taken so far in the project are mainly legal and administrative and have no de facto impact on events in the company, says Daniel Buryš, the finance director of the Kofola Group.
"In connection with the transfer of the seat of the group, shareholders are considering placing the shares on the Prague Stock Exchange."
Due to entry at the Prague Securities Exchange, the company is finalising a security prospectus, which it will present to the Czech National Bank for approval shortly.
The transfer of the holding's registered office and the related share transfers will be made in the form of a non-public transaction, with only existing shareholders involved.
As part of this operation, no shares will be offered to the public or new investors.
"A possible offer of shares to new investors would be made - if the company and its shareholders so decide - at either 4. Q5 or 1st Q6 2016," the company said.
The firm has previously stated that any share offer could consist of an issue of new shares or the sale of existing shares.
This offer could consist of a share offer on the stock exchange in the Czech Republic and Poland, including the location of the shares on the Warsaw Stock Exchange.
Czech Television's objectivity test in informing about the migrant crisis.
Another small test of the objectivity and balance of coverage of the main Czech media coverage of the refugee crisis.
This time the main news broadcast of Czech Television.
And how did she stand?
When they teach at the Journalist Faculty about how the media can manipulate reality, they can release today's broadcast to Czech Television Events.
The migrant crisis was devoted to about 80% of the coverage.
Except for the first minute, when TIME reported the riots on the Serbo-Hungarian border and called the attacks by the migrants on the police officers euphemistically their patience - throwing stones and attacking metal bars), the current promigrant propaganda - judge the names of the individual stories.
Criticism of NGOs - a large space for non-profit organisations that criticise the mistreatment of migrants.
Syrian children in the Czech School - a story of integrated Syrians in the Czech Republic.
Refugees not only as a threat, but also as a chance.
Going to the refugees - TIME consistently uses the terms of a runner or a refugee and not a migrant.
What is striking is mainly that TIME in the illustration footage uses consistently only and only footage of young children and women.
At the same time, she herself said on the same broadcast that 80% of the migrants detained in the Czech Republic were men.
Summary: For the most part, propaganda, which is unprecedented from communist agitators.
I have to say, as a former journalist, I'm ashamed of my colleagues.
Ecology in practice.
When I got up for a block of flats once, I soon ceased to be the only resident.
The Formica toilet was moved into my fish.
Petsnons of the landlord, insects with an imperfect transformation, i.e., not making the transformation from caterpillar to be a bun and a cub looks like an adult, only tiny and gradually growing.
They were disgusting to me and I didn't dwell on them to kill them.
First by hand and later chemically.
The socialist drugstore provided some blue crystals to eliminate them.
I think it was called Cyclone B.
Or any other way?
But it eliminated them successfully.
Later, I dealt with the pharaohs in a similar way.
A box with a kind of juvenile-seller, brought to the nest by ants and he then did not allow the Queen to generate new offspring.
But I digress.
As time went on, the insect became the object of my admiration, and I became more and more inclined to think that they had the same right to life as we humans did.
In addition, I took away from my life the experience that interfering with the ecosystem does not lead to success and one pest can replace another.
The truth of the fleas and bedbugs I might not hesitate to worsen karma by killing them.
In the new home, my partner and I agreed that if the fish didn't climb our necks, let them eat their renegade skin chips in peace, some of those invisible algae, that sort of thing.
Their peaceful existence was disrupted by the spider after a time.
It was a common type of cushioner that had long resided on the ceiling.
We thought he lived on the occasional flies and mosquitoes, which only made us more comfortable.
Having lived with us for several years, we found that they were mainly fertile for the fishies and that the number of them seemed to be kept in a reasonable numerical state of order.
With a confidential regular contact with each need, we found out that she was a female.
For we have witnessed romantic courtship with a partner about a third less, cringing cobwebs to the fibres of cobwebs so that he is not eaten before he reaches the desired kicking.
It took about three days when they didn't move and didn't respond to our checks.
Under the toilet bowl where the love games took place, we later found the remains of the dried-out male next to the female.
Then the spider did not move for weeks.
When we thought it was over, we were surprised by the number of little spiders hanging in the neighborhood.
They soon disappeared.
They were eaten by their mother's piece, part of it scattered elsewhere.
Even the female disappeared after a week.
Whether she went elsewhere or passed away, we don't know, but after a month, two, she appeared on the ceiling again.
True, a little smaller, probably the daughter of the toilet exterior.
For a time, she watched our behavior cautiously from the ceiling, and by moving under the toilet bowl, she assessed our non-aggression as a friendship.
The numerous condition of the somewhat multiplied fishes had decreased in turn, and the spider was in peace upon himself in his normal activities to provide food.
For a year, our ecosystem hasn't changed.
In between, our daughter had reached an age when the use of the potty was already a disgrace.
We have tolerated it so far, but the eternal pouring of its contents has already been eaten away.
We urged it more and more forcefully to use the toilet.
But to maintain her bad habit, her daughter found an excuse in that spider she could see very well at wiping.
Our talk about seeing the spider was not taken to have any luck in the house at all.
With a tear and a roar, she forced her potty.
No alternative.
There was a moment when the spider had to be ordered, in the interest of the daughter's developmental shift.
It's all right with me.
He was captured in a glass and banished across the balcony to the garden.
I said goodbye to him as a friend, but I still felt vile, after living together for such a long time, as if I were firing a relative.
We assumed that the fishes would start to appear more often and start to multiply geometrically.
You marvel at the world, a week, two, there was none of us there.
I began to speculate on the cause.
I wondered if the spider had somehow grown them there, following the example of ants, that the setting of the toilet was not as favourable to their existence as we had thought.
But then the first pieces of medium-sized were on, and they were swarming again.
I had to think of a different theory about the cause of their disappearance, and I found that their link to the spider must have been the cause of the fact that if they didn't see him, that he was hidden in some other place, and that they were in danger from anywhere.
Or, perhaps they had some telepathic connection to their predator, and his quick disappearance triggered some alarm.
All the more so because I have no illusions about their eyesight.
They showed some light of shyness, but that they would react to waving their hands or moving quickly, no.
My daughter already goes to the bathroom regularly.
I think she's forgotten about the potty.
All that remains is to attract a spider again.
I'm already sending my wish on the air, and I hope they didn't arrest me after the execution.
Otherwise, we'd have to use the Cyclone B.
Albert Einstein's ten statements that enriched the world.
The remoteness of a brilliant scientist from the last century will probably never stop fascinating humanity.
He could dive so deeply into everything that the product was always astonishing discovery.
Albert Einstein (1879 - 1955) was one of the most important scientists of all time.
He entered people's consciousness primarily in his special and general theory of relativity, which so far best describes the universe in its gigantic affair.
It is also not to be forgotten to clarify the photoectite or the idea of quantizing the electromagnetic field.
There is no doubt that the descriptive and knowledge-based system of the popular theory of relativity is so convoluted to many that it prefers to choose easy analogy for closer acquaintance.
But it is not easy.
Of course, it wouldn't be Albert Einstein if he didn't find a brilliantly simplified form of explanation for this, too: The hour near your lover seems a minute; a minute in a hot furnace seems to be an hour - and that's relativity.
I took the liberty of his plethora of famous quotes to select these ten, which literally captivated me.
Intelligent people try to solve problems, the brilliant people try not to make them.
Only two things are endless.
Space and human stupidity.
I'm not entirely sure about the first one.
No many attempts can ever prove that I was right.
But the only one can prove at any time that I was wrong.
But it is a sad time when it is easier to break up an atom than to destroy prejudices.
If the mess on the table is a reflection of the mess of the mind, then what does the empty table reflect?
I don't know what's going to fight in World War III, but in the fourth, it's the sticks and the stones.
There are thousands of ways to kill the time, but no way to resurrect it.
Knowing little is dangerous and to know much, too.
If I had an hour to handle a problem on which my life would depend, I would have spent 40 minutes studying it, 15 minutes of analyzing it, and 5 minutes of dealing with it.
In the world, the hardest thing to understand income tax.
Finally, I can't help but mention the Einstein formula to the definition of success: Taking A for Success, the formula: A=X+Y+Z, where X is a job, Y rest and Z is to keep his tongue down.
New and modern.
Hospitals in the Zlín Region are facing changes for 1.5 billion.
"It is a success when we consider that all four of them are holding in the black for the whole year," said the Governor Stanislav Mišák, aghdly.
The total profit of the regional facilities at this point is about CZK 32 million.
The share of this is mainly due to higher reimbursements from insurance companies, which are equally favourable for this year.
This fact, too, shows that, after the poor years, hospitals can finally afford to make more investment.
In Kroměříž, Vsetín, Uherské Hradiště and Zlín, this is due to the construction, which together will cost almost CZK 1.5 billion.
The long period when we mainly bought the appliances is over.
Now we have to start building new buildings, because you can't do top-quality health care without them, the plans were made by the regional deputy for health care, Lubomír Nečas.
They look forward to the changes in all hospitals.
The builders will come to the hospitals as early as next year.
In Vsetín, they are now collecting suppliers of a new internal pavilion for almost CZK 300 million.
In Kroměříž they have a scheduled addition of dialysis.
Uherské Hradiště wants to add a new internal one for about 200 million to this year's open central pavilion.
And the Bata Hospital in Zlín faces a long-delayed construction of a new central reception and an internal, which will require three-quarters of a billion.
In all cases, these are the major and often the biggest changes in recent years.
"This is an extremely important step for the whole region, patients and doctors," said the director of the hospital, Věra Prousková, to the construction of the Vsetín internal room.
The five-storey building is expected to be ready in about two years and will offer comfortable equipment for both internal and neurology, dialysis, new ambulances, beds and intensive care units.
Greater comfort for patients.
The changes, which will be recognised by patients in particular, will affect all regions.
The new buildings will be replaced by those in which, for example, many of the sick people lie in one room, have even one toilet on the floor, the beds are unplugged, the windows are leaking and the paramedics do not have the appropriate conditions for work.
"For example, our internment was built thirty-five years ago and is now at the limit of its lifespan," pointed out the director of the Zlín hospital, Pavel Calábek.
Within a few years, it will therefore be replaced by a seven-storey modern building connected to an emergency reception.
Doctors and patients will thus have all the acute wards in one place, in addition to the new premises.
The same model already has half-finished Uherské Hradiště.
The central reception is already standing and there will be an internship within three years.
"We will pay for the construction from the loan and partly from our own funds," explained director Petr Sládek.
It is this hospital that can afford its own funding as the only one in the county.
Profit still has the highest, and it didn't make the loss two years ago, when, for example, the Zlín hospital was struggling with a nearly two-hundred-million-dollar loss.
"We have good contracts with insurance companies, excellent performance, we increase revenues and manage the costs in the whole hospital effectively," Vlastimil Vajdák, who is in charge of the economy, said.
Improvements will also be made for patients at Kroměříž Hospital.
Over the course of ten to fifteen years, up to half a billion crowns will go to repairs, new devices and reconstructions.
Already this year, the repair of the detention station will be ready, then the addition of dialysis will begin, or the construction of the building for a new MRI.

No one has explained to me how I should keep the refugees in the country when they do not want to live in the Czech Republic.
After talks with his European colleagues, Interior Minister Milan Chovanec (ČSSD) complains that other states are pushing the Czech Republic to accept quotas for the redistribution of refugees, but reject any discussion.
He also notes that no one has yet explained to him how he should keep the allocated refugees in the Czech Republic when they do not want to live with us anyway.
"We did not receive the answer, so we wanted the quotas to be dropped from the final text," Chovanec told reporters.
Can you specifically describe the position you came up with at the meeting of the Interior and Foreign Ministers of the European Union?
We do not agree with mandatory quotas as a system that simply cannot function.
We cannot refer to migrants as bags of salt or flour.
They're living beings who have visions, they're going somewhere, they've got some relatives.
We wanted to hear from colleagues how we were able to keep migrants in the territory of the Member States if they were redistributed.
We can't imagine.
We did not receive the answer, so we wanted the quotas to be dropped from the final text.
With the other conclusions - functional hotspots, i.e. registration points, border protection, camps outside Europe, a trust fund for African countries and other things, we have no problem with that.
We've been talking about this for a year, and we've been saying this is the way.
But to say that quotas will solve everything?
Not long ago we were dealing with forty thousand, now it's a hundred and twenty thousand.
When will it be five hundred thousand?
And how do we keep these people in that territory?
Ninety-eight percent of all the people who pass through us want to go to Germany.
Almost nobody wants to come to us, we just don't know how to keep them here.
We have the ambition to come to other foreigners, Ukrainians, Vietnamese and others who take the Czech Republic as a destination country, gain asylum in our country, but the interest of the people from this migration wave, i.e. from Syria and other countries, is marginally close to zero.
You mentioned that the refugees didn't really want to come to us, but we've already committed to accepting fifteen hundred people.
Wouldn't it be possible to accept more of them this way?
We are committed to accept 1,500 people, but with a condition.
We said: functional hotspots, border control, military operation.
Even with the 1,500, the point is that there are 1100 people to deal with with the asylum procedure.
They'll come to our detention facility, and we'll treat them the same as the ones we picked up.
It is a big question, and we will debate this with Europe about whether we can detain the people who will be registered in Italy and Greece, or in Hungary.
Because Europe treats this in such a way that, if they have a registration, they cannot be detained.
That means they will come to our territory with registration, and if there is a deal that is not yet there, it may be that even the 1100 will not be kept on the territory of the Czech Republic and they will leave again for Germany when they arrive.
If we can detain them for the duration of the asylum procedure, we will deal with them with the asylum procedure.
If it is the citizens of Syria, Eritrea, they are almost 98 per cent of it, according to European statistics, who receive international protection.
They will then be given documents to enable them to travel around Europe.
And I think these people will end up in the destination countries again.
Then there are four hundred people who will relocate.
This is the second project that has been underway so far, and we have only progressed there in the fact that we are debating with the churches about the possibility of helping them to get jobs, accommodation, and so on.
But that's a very long shot.
You said that at the ministers' meeting with us, the other states were unwilling to discuss.
But isn't it the case that the Czech Republic is just rejecting quotas, but is it not offering any solidarity move to unlock the discussion?
And what exactly do you think this is to be a solidarity move?
If the Federal Republic of Germany makes an incentive that all migrants from Syria can access them, the news is spreading in an order of magnitude way through all camps across Europe, but also in Turkey, Jordan.
It is challenging another wave of migration that is heading to Germany because they simply do not want to come to us.
We think the way is to protect the external borders - simply to discourage the migration waves, to help those in need, and to separate economic migrants.
It's definitely to let them know they don't stand a chance.
Last year alone, fifty thousand Kosovars came to Germany.
From the safe Kosovo, where we pay for all the saturation of this state, including the police, the courts, the prosecution service.
If we could have separated them and not accepted them or only accept them according to the needs of the economies, then the fifty per cent of what social systems are making to them in vain today could go to the refugees.
Compared to the first day when Germany introduced checks, the number of detainees in the Czech Republic jumped.
Now it's eighty, the first day it was twelve.
How far is it to get border controls to tighten up?
We were afraid of catching hundreds of people.
These are the numbers we can handle.
We still have several hundred vacancies in the stone detention facilities.
Of course, all the people we deter will be returned to Austria within seven days.
We're doing it by default.
The Austrians are the only ones who take those people from us, with Hungary it's complicated and the Greeks - that's a completely useless story.
So where is the tipping point?
Would it have to be a thousand a day?
I think it would have to be several hundred a day.
Two hundred, three hundred people a day two, three consecutive days run out of our capacity to set in for emergencies.
Then I am agreed with the Prime Minister that he would immediately convene an emergency government.
He's very interested in the whole thing, we're in phone contact several times a day.
Should the situation arise, the government can sit de facto immediately and by one resolution decide to strengthen the police on the military, say, the customs administration, or the prison service.
The extreme option is the state of emergency that Hungary has now declared in some places?
I don't think it can come to us that far.
Keep in mind that our position is different, we are a national state within Europe, we have the Schengen border only and only at the airport.
I don't know what would have to happen to make this happen on the territory of the Czech Republic, I don't want to spread alarm information.
All the information we have, whether from Moldova, Serbia, Hungary, is more likely to suggest that Hungarians will try to divert the migration flow to Croatia and Slovenia, which would then mean a direct route to Austria.
The Czech Republic would be very marginally affected, almost at all.
Slavia paid off a large part of the debts at the last minute.
They are trying to prevent bankruptcy.
Soccer Slavia paid the debts.
The footballers also got their money.
Slavia Football ran for the first time on Tuesday for the insolvency proceedings in court.
Almost three months after it was filed for around CZK 20 million by the company Online Services of Pacific Samoa.
Slavia's attorney, Zuzana Mládková, tried to convince Judge Michaela Wenzlová within a few hours that she should not declare her bankruptcy over Slavia.
And it must be said that she had the arguments.
One of the main arguments was that the week before last, the new owner of Slavia was the new owner of Slavia by the large Chinese industrial and investment group CEFC, as well as by Czech billionaire Jiří Šimáně.
Apparently, money from the new owners arrived at the club, at the last minute.
This is also evidenced by Slavia's comments before Tuesday's court hearing - the Vršovice club on Monday, just the day before the court hearing, he sent tens of millions of crowns to the court.
"Everything was paid for between 11th September and 15th September," said the solicitor's attorney, Slavie Mládková.
Who did Slavia pay?
Current and former players and business partners.
Specifically, for example, to the Slovak ex-representative Milan Ivan or the Czech midfielder Mario Liček.
Slavia also paid the fee to the agent Alexander Losenick.
Already on Friday, the club also paid the fees due to the city district of Prague 10.
Thus, de facto only the claims contradicts Slavia remain part of the insolvency dispute.
Either the club did not make the commitments in question at all, or they are litigated.
However, we are prepared to pay the sums in the event of a loss of these disputes.
"We have the necessary funds in a bank account, which we can provide with an account statement," Mládková, the lawyer, told the judge.
"Everything that was overdue is paid for," Mládková said, adding that unreplacement or disputed liabilities are not only unrepentant or contradicted.
It is also certain that the judge will not decide in the next few days and the proceedings will continue.
She gave Slavia three weeks to send detailed evidence that she had actually paid the debts in question.
Subsequently, all the evidence will be evaluated.
A decision can therefore be expected in November at the earliest.
The judge ordered the continuation of the hearing for the third of November.
However, the decision will not be made at this meeting, but only in writing after it.

FastMig X is a representative of the latest generation of inverto welding sources.
The combination of cutting-edge technology, hardware and software integrated into modular construction brings benefits and a quick return on investment in the form of high quality, productivity and reliability.
The FastMig X is a modular system, so the final set-up is always configured to the customer's requirements.
Any of those, from welding of structural steel to welding special alloys, as well as welding coarse materials to welding thin sheets, from appding in workshops to welding in the yards.
The incredible amount of welding curves, simple welding and the expandability of the welding source allows you to respond quickly to a change of requirements, leading to a reduction in downtime, the need to rebuild the resource and more productive welding.
FastMig X enables welding with high-end welding processes, developed by Kemppi, which ensure higher productivity and quality of welding.
Time is lost and there is no waste of material or the repair of faulty feuds.
There is flexibility, there are fewer downtime, more welding and higher profit.
It's this year's new feature, which premiered in Nitra, where she also won a gold medal.
We greatly appreciate these honours, as they confirm the uniqueness of the product.
The world's leading manufacturers boast similar systems, but thanks to the difference in software and parameter management, FastMig X is one of the world's top performers.
For those interested, the delivery times, which are around three weeks, are certainly also pleasant.
In the Czech Republic, we have already established the first contacts, which will definitely be expanded after the Brno trade fair.
We have been regular participants for over twenty years and our business results are almost always better after it than before it, stresses for ARC-H Miroslav Streichsbier, head of the Kemppi store in Pilsen.
FastMig X is a modular system, so the final set-up is always configured according to customer requirements.
Blanca was built in a way that didn't go off.
But it would cost half a billion more, says the expert at the company that designed the tunnel.
Blanka could be minted and safer, says the expert.
The Blanka tunnel complex could be built in such a way that there would be no two drops of earth in Prague's Stromovka, according to the production director of Satra, the main designer of the tunnel, Alexander Butovič.
He said so on Wednesday evening during a press tour of the tunnel.
But it would be about half a billion crowns more expensive, he says.
It will open to the drivers on Saturday afternoon.
It's always a compromise between price and security.
"The tunnel was minted safer, but the cost is rising exponentially," Butovic said.
The conditions in Stromovka were the same all the time, he said, yet the country fell just a few steps from where it began to be minted with a safer and more cautious method.
"If the measures had been applied 500 metres earlier, the tunnel would have been half a billion more expensive," said Butovic.
The Blanka tunnel collapsed three times during the construction.
Twice, in 2008, a crater was created in Stromovka, in 2010 the land collapsed at the Ministry of Culture in Prague 6.
According to the director of Metrostav, Jiří Bělohlav, the tunnel is unnecessarily expensive, he told the weekly Euro.
According to the original intention, the construction was expected to cost CZK 17 billion.
Add to that the VAT, which has jumped twice over the construction period, you've got twenty-one of the $17 billion.
Add to that technology, land purchases and engineering activities, indexation and similar items, it's 29 billion, which is not that far from the 37, said Belohlav
Somebody ordered that and paid for it.
iOS 9: How to get the new iPhone operating system with new Apple update
The new operating system can be requested in Settings when you click on the "General" tab and choose "Software Update" (mountage of software).
When it is ready, your phone will offer you the option to download and then install it.
Some users faced a problem after installation, namely the error message "the software update failed."
One solution to this problem is to wait for interest in the update to subside or to attempt it via iTunes.
The phone will guide you through the update process.
And that includes the need to uninstall apps to vacase space - but that won't be necessary, because Apple has reduced the update and also facilitated the process by using a special tool that will design the user's apps to delete and reinstall after the update is over.
Make sure your phone is charged before you start the update.
If the battery's state is low, Apple will not allow the update to start, because the process interruption could cause an update error.

FedEx Mixed Profits, Reduction of the fiscal outlook for 2016
FedEx reported disappointing results for the last quarter and a huge reduction in full-year profit forecasts due to low demand for freight and higher land-based costs.
The company also said it planned to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers over the holidays.
This period last year, FedEx announced that it would hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holidays.
The company's stock fell about 2.5 percent in pre-market trading 45 minutes before Wednesday's opening.
FedEx says it expects earnings to be between $10.40 and $10.90 for the fiscal year ending next May, marking a 20 ccent drop from the previous forecast.
Analysts had expected $10.84, according to a survey conducted by FactSet.
The downgraded outlook comes on average by 4.9 percent despite the interest rate hike, which will take effect in January. 4, and higher supplements for the transport of heavy or large parcels starting in November.
The company said it still expected to grow in profit compared to the previous year due to cost cuts, higher revenues and growth in online trading.
Board Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said the company "published solid performance despite weaker-than-expected economic conditions, particularly in manufacturing and global trade."
The holiday hiring plans were announced a day after rival UPS said it planned to hire 90,000 to 95,000 extra staff, which is about the same as hired last year.
In the quarter, which ended in August. 31, FedEx raised $692 million, up 6 percent from the year.
Earnings per share were $2.42, which is less than $2.44 per share, predicted by 12 analysts interviewed by Zacks Investment Research.
Sales rose 5 percent, to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts surveyed by Zacks were expected to be $12.23 billion.
FedEx has been hit by a decline in priority international shipping in recent years, causing revenues in its Express Unit to stagnate.
But the online shopping boom boosted the results of the FedEx ground unit.
In the last quarter, ground revenue rose by 29 percent, but operating profit was essentially the same because of the higher prices for larger packages and your own insurance.
The Express Force recorded a higher income due to higher base rates, while profits fell in the cost store due to higher labour prices.
In pre-market trading, they fell by $3.85 or 2.5 percent to $150 an hour before the opening of FedEx shares.
They ended Tuesday with a drop of 11 percent per year and 17 per cent below the record of 11. June.
At their most anticipated meeting in years, federal reserve lawmakers will spend two days sitting at the 27-foot-long Honduran mahagonal table this week, and will decide whether, after nearly a decade, the time has come to raise the key interest rate.
To rise above them at one end of the central bank's ornament, the two-storey meeting room will be a U.S. mural.
The map is a reminder of Fed Chairwoman Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues are supposed to give the nation's economic interests over everything else.
The central bank has a double charge of Congress: maximize US employment and keep prices stable here.
But since the Great Recession, Fed officials have acknowledged that there is an unwritten third term: financial stability.
And this third term of office could be the X-factor too close to the predictable decision to be announced on Thursday, on whether the US economy is ready to be launched at the shutdown from an unprecedented stimulus in the form of a near-zero short-term short-term interest rate on the spot from the end of 2008.
While most of the data shows solid economic growth, recent turbulence in global financial markets could already be spooked by the cautious Fed because of adding volatility to the volatility by raising its federal fund reference rate - even no more than just a quarter of a percentage point.
"It is obvious that the labour market and inflation will be the most important thing to watch in the first place," Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at the brokerage firm Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"But I think they were just looking for an excuse not to increase the rate, the increased uncertainty surrounding the global market already provides them with sufficient justification to wait," she said.
There is no consensus on what the Fed will do, which in itself is the cause of the jitters in the financial markets.
About half of economists recently polled by Blomberg predicted a rate hike this week.
But financial markets expect the Fed to delay the issue, with only about 30% of the chances for the increase, with a key indicator.
This would point to a stock market decline if the Fed raises rates only if politicians soften the slump by promising that another increase is not in sight.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones' industrial average jumped 228.89 points, or 1.4%, to 16,55.
The rally was triggered by the expectation that Fed politicians would keep rates quiet this week, says John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
"It would come as a surprise if the Fed raised rates now," he says.
If the Fed's politicians did this, "they'd have to go to the extreme in their program statement and hold the hands of the financial markets so they don't panic."
Other experts said that raising rates would reassure financial markets as it would remove uncertainty about how the Fed would proceed.
Just a month ago, the Fed seemed on track to raise the 0.25 percentage point rate this month, the first small step in a slow tightening of the monetary conditions to confirm the strength of the US economic recovery.
Yellen said that despite the spring and early summer, she expected a rate hike this year, despite complaints from the Liberals, that more economic progress was needed.
Even as job creation slowed in August, the labor market has seen solid growth this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1% the previous month, the lowest in more than seven years and close to the level the Fed considers full employment.
Wage profits showed signs of a lift.
And while inflation continues to run below the central bank's 2% annual target, Fed policymakers argue that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices.
The economy "can cope with higher rates and needs them, given the tightness of the labour market," said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But financial markets around the world began to struggle late last month after China devalued its currency.
The industrial average of Dow Jones fell to 16% below its record high in May, with investors fearing that China's slowing economy would drag down global growth.
The market has rebounded somewhat this month, and Dow is now only losing almost 10% of the May maximum.
The Fed's political figures are provided by a quibble market situation with a comprehensive calculation to factor in an interest rate hike.
"In the absence of what has happened in the financial markets and the reports of the weakness of the Chinese economy in the last few weeks, there would be a tightening of this meeting," Stephen D. Oliner, senior researcher at UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and former Fed official.
He now predicts that they will wait at least a month to gain better control of the consequences.
"There's a lot of uncertainty about the impact it's going to have on the US economy, and they have almost no data to rely on about the latest developments in China," Oliner said.
The health of the global economy is not one of the Fed's main interests, so it should not technically be included in their decision-making.
But in fact, the Fed has become the monetary authority of the world.
The central bank's influence in recent years has been enormous.
A mere hint of then-President Ben S. Bernanke's 2013 that the Fed could "chake up" their monetary expansion in the market, was spasked back online.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly closely linked, Fed officials can also be expected to follow developments elsewhere, but are also consulting other central bankers and experts to better read the state of the global economy.
Their decision-making process is "more art than science," said Zachary Karabell, head of the global strategy for wealth-management Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Va., noted this month that "Fed has a history of overreacting movements in financial markets that appear in unrelated to economic fundamentals."
Lacker, a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee's policy-making, which pushed for a rate hike, cited the decision in 1998-99 as an example.
The financial crisis in Asia led the Fed to cut its reference rate by 0.75 percentage points over the three meetings "Despite the limited identifiable effects on US growth," Lacker said.
A year later, Fed officials reversed those cuts.
The Fed should only prioritise financial stability concerns during a major crisis, such as the market collapse of 2008, said Adam Posen S., a former member of the Rate Committee at the Bank of England.
The latest turmoil is not even approaching this level, he said.
"You certainly don't want to be in a situation of fear of a rate rise because the markets have become upset," said Posen, president of the Institute for International Economics, Peterson .
The Federal Reserve Act still has a double mandate and does not mention financial stability, and until that changes, I don't think they should get to the top.
Do you need a great Thai market?
Try LAX-C in Chinatown.
Yes, the Chinatown of China
The market/station was opened in 1997 and is owned by LAX-C Inc.
It is often referred to as Thai Costco, LAX-C is a wholesale Thai market that also sells to the public.
Yes, it's the Chinese neighborhood and not the Thai neighborhood.
The market/track is the only contact point that offers a stunning range of fresh, frozen and dried goods, the popular Thai and Asian refreshments, and kitchen utensils, furniture, religious and holiday decorations.
There is even a car part available if you need a little engine oil.
The store is massive and will take over an hour to climb through all the aisles.
If you're hungry for all this shopping, go for a meal in the LAX-C BBQ Express.
The interior trading venue (good, inexpensive) is close to the registers and has various subscription points.
What's in stock: Do you need something - anything - Thai?
In LAX-C, you'll probably find it.
Items are affordable and a lot of items are sold in bulk.
The fresh produce covers special Asian and regional Thai herbs, fruit and more.
The spread of meat is great, for example, fish - the staff behind the counter will wash and the forbake for you, even fry it for you if you wish it,
A good part of the shop is left to a massive freezer compartment, where you'll find frozen kicles leaves, a bitter melon and galangal, entire ducks, fish, beef blood and bile, pork gut, fish balls, regional sausages, over-the-counter semi-finished products and more.
Who buys here: Restaurant owners and chefs, also separate families and individuals.
Broad alleys reach out to shopping trolleys and forklifts.
Findling: Fresh month-to-mond durian next to the cash desk stand.
Where it is located: The shop is in the industrial part of Los Angeles, surrounding the suburbs of the Chinatown and the Centres - a few blocks from Philippe The Original.
Parking: LAX-C has its own car park, which it shares with other shops and restaurants.
While a shop can be booked, parking is usually not hard to find.
The speed on the highways will remain the same.
Acceleration to 150 km/h was rejected by the House.
On selected sections of motorways, it will not be possible to increase the maximum speed allowed to up to 150 km/h under favourable conditions.
The House decided to do so on Tuesday when it acceded to the Senate's amendment, which rejected the increase in speed.
The amendment to the Roads Act will now head to the president.
President Miloš Zeman said at the end of April that he would veto the law allowing the 150-kilometre speed.
Transport Minister Dan Ťok (for ANO) was also opposed to the increase, according to which the Czech motorway network is not yet built for such speed.
Speaking to members on Tuesday, Ťok endorsed the Senate's version of the bill.
The approved amendment will now allow, in line with the government's original proposal, to increase speeds from 90 to 110 kilometres per hour on selected first-class roads, in particular four-lane roads.
The House first extended this option to highways, which could be driven at speeds of up to 150 km/h in selected sections, but the Senate refused.
Members have now agreed to his proposal.
The senators, with the approval of the Minister of Transport, also removed the authorization of the traffic police to have the final say in the modification of local roads, which are handled by municipalities.
The Senate version, which the House approved, also envisages that the sewerage, water supply or public lighting cables could be stored lengthwise under the road surface.
The municipalities would thus save on the purchase of the land.
Municipalities should also not be obliged to take care of the road vegetation along the local roads, regardless of the owner of the land in question.
The amendment is also intended to help improve road protection and make it easier for municipalities to deal with towed vehicles, to which the owners do not subscribe.
Newly, municipalities could sell towed vehicles that are not claimed by their owners within the six-month period after the towing notification.
Municipalities will have the possibility to exclude transit freight traffic through their territory on second and third-class roads under the threat of a fine even for forwarding firms.
The amendment also cancels the possibility to introduce electronic motorway vignettes instead of the existing paper ones, which will continue to be used after 1 January next year.
According to the government, this will save money for the introduction of an electronic system.
The Ústí ex-mayor goes to trial.
He faces 10 years of overpriced welcome to the citizens.
The case concerns the allegedly overpriced project Welcoming the Citizens.
The police also wanted to prosecute MEP Zuzana Kailová (ČSSD) in this case, but the Chamber of Deputies did not extradite her.
According to the legal qualification of the case, both face up to ten years in prison.
The trial is scheduled for two October days so far.
According to the public prosecutor, Mandík and Macík caused at least one million crowns of damage, the prosecution shows.
The applicant relies on an expert report.
The former members of the city's management, according to the plaintiff, improperly allowed the financial benefit of the company that organised the welcome of the citizens.
According to the indictment, Mandík, ordered the then head of the Municipal Department of the Municipal Services, Education and Culture to address five linked companies in the selection process.
When another company that offered the lowest price entered the competition, City Hall canceled the contest.
The contract was then to be entrusted to the administrator by the city, and only Darothore entered the competition, which was then awarded the contract by the city council.
The city paid out at least a million more.
Both accused were led by the aim of ensuring for Darothore the award of a public contract for the organisation of the Welcoming of the Citizens in Ústí nad Labem for a long-term and coordinated action at least in a coordinated manner, in a coordinated manner, the prosecutor writes.
At the same time, according to him, they were aware that Darothore would subsequently, after obtaining the contract, account for Ústí nad Labem for the implementation of the Civil Minister's Award for the implementation of the Civil Enforcement event, which will be disproportionately increased compared to the real value of the services actually provided.
In three years, according to the file, the company collected more than five million crowns for the project.
The city eventually paid out only one part, roughly CZK 1.7 million, then withdrew from the contract.
The amount paid out was at least one million crowns overpriced, according to the expert's report.
Mandik had previously denied any violation of the law.
I've committed no crime, I'm innocent.
I do not understand this fabricated case, the former Mayor said earlier, noting that the city under his leadership had only followed up on a similar project from previous years.
Between 2008 and 2010, the Roxy II Agency handled the event.
"It was under the same conditions, for the same money," Mandik added.
Criminals initially wanted to charge MEP Kail, who was also a member of the city council.
However, the Chamber of Deputies did not extradite her for the prosecution.
Criminals have therefore postponed the case in her case, but are counting on charging Kail after her end her parliamentary mandate.
The welcome of the citizens was a social event that took place several times a year.
The mothers received a gift check for CZK 5,000 to buy children's supplies and small gifts.
Hungarian police officers allegedly dropped a dog on the fugitive.
Then they got the press to delete the footage.
Hungarian police are said to have briefly detained an AP cameraman on the border with Serbia and forced him to delete a footage of a police dog allegedly hitting a fugitive to the ground.
But the Hungarian government is questioning this accusation.
The alleged incident occurred on Saturday evening when AP cameraman Luca Muzi filmed migrants crossing the border with Serbia through a corn field near the Hungarian town of Röszke.
Police officers took action against the refugees, and one of them had a dog attacked by a Syrian with a basket on his nose.
The dog of the man who shouted "Please, please, I'm a fugitive," Muzi said.
The fact that Muzi was filming everything was not noticed by one of the officers and did not allow him to leave.
The journalist was then no longer allowed to call either his superiors or his colleagues on the spot.
Officers took Muzi to a dark spot at the refugee registration center and asked him to show them what he had to do.
Then he was ordered to delete the footage.
Muzi thus lost the result of two days' work in Serbia and Hungary.
He says he felt in danger because there were dogs nearby.
The AP sent a protest letter to Hungarian government spokesman Zoltán Kovács.
In it, she described the behaviour of the police officers as unacceptable and said that journalists should be able to cover events without risking physical violence and not having to worry about the government destroying the legally obtained material.
Kovacs, citing Muzi's police report, disputed the events.
He said the officers just wanted the press to show them if they were in some of the footage, which they said they were entitled to do.
When they found out they weren't there, they didn't force him to delete anything.
"Dogs can bark - they're trained to scare off and scare a little, but they're not attacking for sure," Kovács says.
The unpredictable Champions League.
Promotion to City kicks in, Juventus believes
"It's disappointing, I don't think we deserved to lose," said Manuel Pellegrini, the coach of the home City.
We had more chances and we played better than Juventus.
It was a classic Champions League match.
Neither team made many opportunities, but we had the ball on the kickbacks for longer.
"The cause of the defeat was not in tactics, Juventus simply scored two beautiful goals," said Pellegrini, whose team collected in a competitive match after a long 636 minutes.
It was the finalist of last season's Juventus who was in the opposite position before the clash - after the first three rounds of the Italian league, he has only a point as the defending champion and is only a point with a score of 2:4 in the 16th place on the table.
That is why the turnaround at the Etihad Stadium was a big surprise.
"This win will help us mentally, it will kick us," believes coach Massimiliano Allegri, who had to deal with the loss of three props - Pirla, Tévez and Vidal - before the new year.
They were represented in Manchester by Pogba, Mandzukic and Morata.
"That's right, this victory is terribly important, hopefully we'll take the winning streak thanks to him," Morata hopes.
Because when we're on it, we rank among the best teams in Europe.
We were better in the second half, especially in the attacking phase.
This result is what my players deserve.
"Before our equaliser, we could have been scoring 0-2, but Gianluigi held us up," said Allegri, the goalkeeper Buffon.
"We burned some good chances," said Yayu Touré, the City midfielder.
We have to take our experience from the Champions League and try to get a better result next time.
Goodbye Angela, farewell to old Germany II.
Before we go on about the issue of immigrants, we should be aware that the whole media frenzy around it is run by professionals.
According to the needs of the media and also from above.
So let's stop for a minute.
Today, the newspapers and the media are full of babies who are carried on by their parents on the dusty roads of the exodus.
And this automatically evokes in a person - that is, a European man - a sense of guilt and compassion.
Well, they're not just the desperate kids coming here, notice the footage of the boats landing at the Greek islands, that the little kids can't be seen in them that much!
Well, somehow, the pictures of the ships heading to Lampedusa, the refugees in the French border at the Menton, have disappeared from the TV of the day, with thousands of young men lying around the beautiful promenades.
Much of the young blacks.
Also, the pictures have disappeared from Callais, where these darken ones, and the black men are waiting to see if they can climb through a tunnel under the La Manche.
I don't think it's moving.
Even the pictures of the primitive Christian church of the Eritreans did not give a special impression on the people of Europe.
Too much of it was falsehood.
So when it comes to quotas for refugees, it is somehow concealed that it is not only about the unhappy children of Syria, but also about the enlivened - for the elderly: fashionably fainted - young men.
Won't the musculature look like they've just come out of a fitness center.
To do so, just one personal experience.
This summer, on the Turkish - Muslim - part of Cyprus, we were lying on the private beach of the hotel.
Regardless of being private, a large group of cars suddenly arrived at the beach.
But no hams.
And young blacks stepped out of them.
About 30 men and five women.
Age between 15 and 30.
They entered the beach, all dressed in designer clothing and shoes. In the hands, of course, smartphones.
They were not interested in the fact that it was a private beach, and the employees - the Turks, the Muslims! - were evidently afraid of them.
They took all the deck chairs.
Whoever wasn't lying on it and just been in the sea was unlucky.
They were dressed up for an American rapper movie.
On the heads of the caps with the nail, white and coloured adidaska on the legs.
Then they put on the local beach bar and began to feast.
They took the tables around, crammed in beside the sitting swarthy and white bar guests - read to the Muslims and Europeans, without asking.
Mothers and children fled the dining terrace to somewhere quiet.
The newcomers drank beer straight from the thirds - as they did in the US soap operas?! - on the beach, they threw empty bottles around them.
They were always roaring loudly at each other.
It wasn't English, though.
Then they went to drink wine, also straight from the bottles.
They jumped into the hotel's swimming pool - in designer swimsuits, especially the young ladies - screaming and screaming in the water, mothers and children and pensioners fled in horror, and half an hour later, not a single black-and-black guest was on the beach or in the pool.
They all disappeared.
Regardless of whether someone was a Christian or a Muslim.
The hotel's staff were even afraid to talk about them.
The waiter said to me in a low voice that night, "Did you see the gold they were wearing?"
"Yeah," I said.
"Well, they certainly didn't have it from work," the waiter said.
I remembered, "I know, they all had massive gold chains around their necks.
And one had about a 20-centimeter massive cross of gold on his neck.
And the women were like a jewelry store.
"Are they drug smugglers?" I asked.
"You've seen them drink," the waiter replied.
Drugs don't wallow or use.
They're smuggling something completely different.
So I could see what they were smuggling.
However, in June 2105, it was not so important to me.
I had no idea what was coming next.
But the Secret Service and the top politicians should have known first.
I don't think they don't know.
At the time, about 1.5 million immigrants went to Europe.
And they go and go and go.
Today, the European Union's main problem has emerged that totalitarian-political-correct politicians, as if the intellectuals and their associated lobbying and economically important groups have the greatest strength in Europe.
Germany and its politicians - the now publicly recognized main force in Europe - lie and lie - but not only them, the leaders of the EU and television, including ours.
For example, recent TV pictures about the enthusiastic welcome of refugees to Germany are at the level of pictures of Moscow's August 1968 on Moscow's pictures.
Sure, there were a few sunshiners at the station, but most of all - the old-fashioned - the Muslims welcomed their fellow tribesmen.
For weeks, they babbled on the news on Czech Television, as the Germans said were almost all for the arrival of the emigrants, according to some research.
But who was only in Germany for a few days, knows it's a lie like a tower.
Which is confirmed by further information.
For example, the famous public opinion research organised by ARD - the Czech Association of Public Television Society of the Federal Republic of Germany.
According to ARD, more than a year ago wanted to take in even more refugees from more than 50/50 Germans.
That's what our TVs melded.
However, they concealed what the next day burst in Germany: that the poll vote on the article showed that 94.5 percent of Germans no more immigrants wanted any more immigrants - 67,000 people took part in the poll.
It is true that Chancellor Merkel publicly said in November 2010, five years ago,: "Our attempt at 'multi-cultti's society has totally failed.'
She went on to say: "Germany is giving up the fight for a multicultural society."
"All efforts to live together have totally failed."
In a country where four million Muslims live, she said, a strategy that allowed people from different cultural backgrounds to live alongside each other without integrating worked. They live here with us today, and we lied to ourselves for a while, that they wouldn't stay, that one day they would disappear again.
But that's not reality.
A multicultural approach, when we tell ourselves that we just live happily side by side, this approach has failed.
He failed completely.
But even Merkel probably doesn't have the power to go up against the powerful Germany and of Europe, and especially against political correctness.
It shows escalation of events.
The conflict is rapidly increasing.
Euroněcmec Schulz, President of the European Parliament, SPD MEP, the only one who reportedly doesn't even have a high school graduation in the European Parliament - yes, that's the one Berlusconi said in the EU parliament that he could play a guard in a concentration camp from the minute - has shown himself, as he has done more than once.
It seems, especially under the impression of the latest statements by German politicians, that Germany has crossed the Rubicon.
Note that, apart from some, most European politicians do not support these statements, the statesmen of the countries that were victims of Nazism are appalled.
What happened to the Germans?
With the rich, the successful and solid Germans?
Who have spent years trying, at least on the outside, to deal with their terrible past of the aggressor and the murderer of millions?
Are those who say that in the soul of Germany it is the devil of aggression, superiority and violence to sow?
Was Chancellor Otto von Bismarck right when he stopped, by all his strength, the Greater Khran's attempts to control the entire centre of Europe?
When did he say the Grand-German idea would be destroyed by Germany?
I think he should have.
When it was shut down, the preparations for World War I began.
The idea of the Greater German, which led the Germans and Europe to two wars costing millions of lives, was probably returned in a different form.
After the attempt by the Marxists to dominate the state, for example with the Rote Armee Fraktion, and after the failure of the GDR, a new German ideology, on the basis of the failure of the GDR, for example, was an ecology, which was one of the main ideologues of Nazism, began to develop.
We'd say sunshine.
The German elites have long resisted the creation of German nationalism, leaving in peace to all those anti-Aoma fighters, enthusiasts seeking paradise for all, quietly supporting the old imperial and Nazi slogan Our Forest must live.
To satisfy the restless young people who want to do something differently and better everywhere, they have fully sided with the fighters against the warm-up of the planet, stopping nuclear power plants, etc.
And they forgot that there is also a strongly anti-Semitic - so-called pro-Palestinian - and anti-Slavic stream in this stream, which has been a difficult vermin - since Karl Marx, who, after his parents' Jews, has been mainly a German nationalist.
Also, as the latest statements by Schulz and the German minsters openly threatening the disobedient East states, the idea of a leadership-based Germany show.
Which must be listened to without a given apology.
Otherwise, wow!
And when we add in that that immigrants are a very influential group of voters, we have what we have.
And, as always, the capital, is behind it, especially the German one, which is what it is for, and which is that Germany actually controls most of Europe's states through the banks and the Union.
The pseudosophistes of the sunshine first took the Germans to the swamps of ecology and multiculturalism, and today it brought home to them and will bring in perhaps millions of Muslims.
Who, who, the voices of the sirens, will soon hit the wall of reality that Merkel does not want to see and start to rebel.
Germany can only once again threaten its neighbours with force, again some of its residents - but it seems, a smaller part of it - may inflate ideologically, but in the end, as always, it will catch up with it.
Will Germany burn again?
The Muslim hostels are on fire.
What will the German government do when the German public protests against the incoming Islamists break out?
To be helped, will Muslims who have lived in Germany for a long time, but certainly not assimilated to take over the local customs and laws?
What will the German government do when the naturalized Muslims, the incoming Islamists and the Germans, watching with fear the Islamization of their country, embroika?
What will this do to the Germans, and to Germany in general, when people rise up to loudly and publicly protest against the new Euro-shot Muslim?
Germany has simply changed.
The conflict that has triggered in Europe by supporting the sunning ideology, the ideology of elitist and essentially totalitarianism, and its insatiable banks, is growing.
And because of the blunt conduct against the disobedient democratic Germans and all the inferior and disobedient eastern neighbours, this cannot be all right.
Finish tomorrow.
The best way to get rid of nosy vendors: scare them to death.
Just knock and the sturdy knocker tipped at you in a way that doesn't have to withstand the weaker natures.
A revived head will wipe you down and drive you to the hardened one, accompanying (or rather more likely to banish) the insistent seller and the animated sculpture for the journey away.
Perhaps it is a pity that a talking knocker cannot be purchased in reality.
Even with us, it would be useful to banish a lot of peekeepers and scum.

Tiny weeds that tolerate a dry environment.

On September 16, 2015, I photographed a beautiful plant that is one of the expletive weeds, but visually creates a nice impression when it comes to flowering.
Among the outdoor tiles is located.

She likes a drier environment, is easy to adapt, modest and undemanding.

Brazilian paediatrician Rio Grande promotes healthy diet while breastfeeding
The Brazilian paediatric company SPRS came up with a shocking way to try to give women knowledge of the importance of a good diet when breastfeeding by pictures of children suing out of a breastplate painted with the depiction of unhealthy food.
Human breast milk consists of various proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates, which give infants all the nutrients they need to create a strong immune system.
Thanks to the overpower requirements, pregnant women and new mothers are advised to increase daily caloric intake by 500 calories per day.
However, new surveys suggest that increased calorie intake is not the only dietary measure that mothers should follow.
A recent study conducted by Robert Waterland, a professor at the Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, found that healthy diets of pregnant women actually influenced the genetic make of their children and protected them from tumor development.
Unfortunately, it was also confirmed that unhealthy diets had negatively affected the child's immune system.
Seven's Sunrise dominates the rates, though Nine's is attempting to take the lead at the Today Show
The run by Karel Stefanovice and Lisy Wilkinson to Canberra to cover the cost of the leaking of the liberal leadership failed to produce a sufficient increase in the rating for Today.
The morning Nine show projected from the national capital after the overthrow of Malcolm Turnbull Tony Abbott.
Rival Sunrise, with host David Koch and Samantha Armytage, is stuck in London as part of a week-long series of international television broadcasts that also includes Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
It did not seem to seem so much about this dististance tyranny to viewers of Aussie TV, as it scored averages of 397,000 viewers in five major cities compared to 330,000 viewers of the Today broadcast.
Today recorded a smaller increase in its ratings compared to Monday (317,000) and last Tuesday (283,000), but their figure was past Thursday (343,000).
Today has been filling the gap on Sunrise in recent months.
In August, there was an average of 318,000 in the Today, compared to 330,000 in Sunrise.
At the start of the year, the gap was between 40,000 and 50,000.
In September, Sunrise averages 349,000 viewers so far and Today 314,000.
This is the most interesting thing that's happened all morning.
The winds of change affect this morning more than just parliament, my friends!
Karl and Lisa are doing well, thank you for asking!

The big news for Seven was the stunning debut of 800 words with former star Packed to the Rafters by Erik Thomson.
A new drama about a recently-vastised father who decides to move with his two children to the seaside part of New Zealand has an average of a very impressive 1.219 million viewers.
Critics wondered if Thomson himself could pull off a TV hit without Rafters star Rebecca Gibney.
Last night's result gives a clear "yes."
Seven's X Factor retained a powerful 1.136 million viewers, beating The Block (838,000) and TBL Families (76,000) smoothly).
Seven recorded the mixed ratings of the second night of The Chase Australia.
The first half-hour of the new TV quiz (from 5 p.m. to 5 p.m.), featured Andrew O'Keefe's averaging a viewer of 446,000.
The second half-hour (from 5:30 p.m. to 6 p.m.) jumped to 633,000 spectators - enough for Eddie McGuire's small victory over the Hot Seat.
On Monday night, the first half-hour The Chase Australia averaged 520,000 viewers, and the second half had an incredible 720,000.
Hot Seat had an average of 620,000.
Thanks to the drop in the second-night standings, Nine will be convinced that Hot Seat will eventually win at 5:30 p.m.
The Chase Australia is replaced by Million Dolar Minute, which failed to beat McGuire's show.

Three in the finals, agrees that Bachelor's Sam Wood is the perfect kid - but who does he choose?
The secret revealed?...
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may have inadvertently found out who would win Bachelor.
The woman Sam Wood comes to Bachelor with is shrouded in insurmountable mystery.
And the three girls who stay standing will certainly not reveal who is the one who will receive the first one to receive a rose in the end.
But when we asked Sarah Mackay, Snezany Markoski and Lana Jeavons-Fellows the day before there were only two left, they involkly told us who would win.
Sam Wood holds his tongue up for Thursday's final
All three women were singed with lyricism as to why Wood was the perfect man, quoting his sense of humor, ambitions, family values and positivity as the reasons they would like to be his partner.
Anyway, when asked, "If not, which gets Wood's final flower?," their answers might have worked as a conduit for whoever gets Bachelor's heart.
Both the Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski quickly named Mackay as the one that would have been best suited to Wood, in addition to them.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have shared a light relationship since the day.
"From the moment I entered the house and watched the energy of Sara and Sam, I felt they were pretty compatible and I still think so during the course," says Jeavons-Fellows.
"Sarah is a really earthy woman, she's a lot of fun," Markoski added.
I've seen them together, and there's the right chemistry between them.
They are comfortable and comfortable together.
Sarah Mackay thinks she and Sam Wood might be a nice couple.
For her, she claims that during his last visits to her home, she realized that Wood might be "the real one."
"As soon as I saw him with my friends and family, I realized that this isn't just a game anymore - I've opened my heart to him now," she adds.
I asked who Wood would choose, if not her, she looked mysterious.
"I don't know if I can say," she said.
I love both girls equally - it's a tie between Snezena and Lana.
Bachalor airs on Wednesday at 7.30 to Ten.
Originally released as the best choice for Sam Wood?
Jarryd Hayne had several options to launch his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle showed a lot of interest after his move to the United States, and a lot of teams questioned his brilliant start to practice at the end of last year.
But Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsl, and it looks like a sensible decision.
Some coaches let Hayne sit for the rest of the season because he made a mistake, as the Australian Rugbie League converts did on the first kick-off from the pitch in a 20-3 win at Minnesota on Tuesday.
But Tomsula showed that he had confidence in the player and gave him another chance to come back and cast him in the game after Reggie Bush's injury.
Tomsula was also continued to be honest in the locker room after the game.
Instead of chewing the rookies in front of the rest of the team, he was able to cheer them up.
Tomsula was also supported by Hayne publicly at a press conference after the match.
The 49ers reporter, Cam Inman, said that Hayne also received encouragement from the special team coordinator, Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget the mistake and just take care of another game.
Already in the first quarter against Minnesota Vikings, Jarryd Hayne made up for his mistake.
It certainly wasn't the start Hayne and his massive Australian fan club were hoping for in his NFL debut.
Hayne was captured swearing when he left the field after a mistake and later told the Australian radio duo Hamish & Andy at 2DayFM 104.1 he could not even imagine a worse start to his NFL career.
"It happens, you just focus on the next game and that's all," Hayne said.
Hayne compared the embarrassment to his original debut in 2007, when the record in his own goal area led to Queensland's three-way.
Overall, it was a great experience for the 27-year-old.
Hayne posted a photo of fans holding the Australian flag on her own Instagram after the game.
Elton John and Russian Vladimir Putin to meet in discussion on gay rights
In 2003, the richest man in Russia, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, was arrested while pointed in the Siberian runway.
After openly questioning President Vladimir Putin, Khodorkovsky was convicted, his Yukos oil company confiscated and his democratic efforts curtailed.
The CPS defended the emigrants who sought the property to be repaid.
The pair emigrated in 1984 and their property was acquired by a new owner.
After 1989, the property could no longer be returned, so the couple appealed to the state for damages under the Out-of-Court Rehabilitation Act.
The court first awarded them the amount claimed, i.e. over 2.8 million crowns, but the appeals court changed their claim by awarding them only under CZK 90,000, referring to the fact that the amount of the compensation is determined according to the 1991 price regulations.
The emigrants were defended by the Supreme Court and tapped them the amount originally sued.
The Ministry of Finance, which was supposed to pay the money, but it appealed to the CPS.
In the meantime, there was such a change in social and economic circumstances that the compensation granted under the legislation in force at the time - although at the time the compensation was adequate in relation to the off-the-rent property - now only amounts to a fractional amount of the property.
"This cannot be the burden of the interveners as in the restitution of the beneficiaries, who have claimed their rights since at least 1995 and who did not have the opportunity to obtain compensation earlier," explained Judge-Rapporteur Jaroslav Fenyk, explaining why the ÚS sided with the emigrants.
"The CPS has repeatedly spoken in favour of the general courts acting in restitution cases in such a way that any inconsistency is not interpreted to the detriment of the beneficiaries and that the purpose of the restitution legislature, i.e. aton the lawfulness, aton for the property grievance caused by acts of the former totalitarian state," the judge added.
Evita in the musical Studio DVA will now be portrayed by Radka Fišarová.
Radka Fišarová, incidentally, became the world's youngest Evita when, in 1998, at the age of 20, she starred as the wife of Argentine dictator Eva Perón in the first Czech performance of this famous musical by Andrew Lloyd Weber and Time Rice at the Spirála Theatre in Prague.
Coming to a return to the same role, he says, "To this end, the intensity of Evita has not been matched by much of a performance."
Evita is not only an amazing role, it is also a responsibility.
She was recommended for the role of the first lady of Argentina by Monika Absolon.
I saw Moncha in Evita three times and it was definitely inspirational for me.
Here I suddenly saw a whole new concept.
I am a whole fan of more modern make-up, but this one is just particularly hilarious.
"Ondřej Sokol's directorate is original, lightweight and contemporary," Fišarová says.
The notional handing over of the musical scepter between the two singers will take place at Monica Absolon's Birthday Concert on September 27 at 7 p.m. at the Studio DVA Theatre.
The evening culminates with songs from the musical Evita.
The experiences will surely include a joint duet Don't Cry For Me Argentina (You'll Cry, Argentina!).
In a limited number of performances, Ondřej Sokol also juts out of the directorial lectern when he takes his place for the duration of the filming of Karel Roden's film as President Perón.
Due to public interest, further dates were added to the sale until May 2016.
The fifth Czech production of the world musical Evita is presented by the Studio DVA Theatre in collaboration with The Really Useful Group Ltd.
London with success since February 2015.
Directed by Ondřej Sokol, the main female role was originally performed by Monika Absolonová.
Karel Roden appears alongside her as President Perón and in the role of Che Peter Strenáčik.
The legendary songs by Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber with Czech lyrics by Michael Prostějovsky are performed by a live orchestra under the direction of Kryštof Marko, who was already involved in the first performance at the Spirála Theatre.
4 people killed after police officers shot rubber projectiles at demonstrators in Nepal
Four people, including a four-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after police fired rubber projectiles into a crowd of demonstrators against the draft new state constitution, an official said on Wednesday.
The violence took place on Tuesday evening in the Rupandehi district, about 175 miles west of the capital, Kathmandu.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, the head of the district officer, reports that more than 1,000 protesters gathered outside the police station, with some throwing stones and incendiary bombs.
Mr Dhakal reports that police used tear gas and then fired into the air before they resorted to the rubber projectiles.
Twenty police officers and five civilians were injured, he says.
It was not immediately clear why rubber projectiles, which are known for their ability to kill but are traditionally used as a less lethal alternative, clearly caused a high number of deaths.
This clash was the last week of violent demonstrations across the southern plain of Nepal, where members of the Madhesi ethnic group say they have set up a new province under the proposed new constitution and have eased their political influence.
Other demonstrations in western Nepal were also recorded by the ethnic group Tharus, which is demanding the creation of its own state.
As of August 10, at least 40 people were killed in the violent engagements, including 11 police officers.
when the four main political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into the provinces - a big step towards the new constitution, but a very contentious issue in Nepal, which was centrally managed for centuries.
Work on the new constitution has been ongoing since 2008, but lawmakers have accelerated the process after a devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April.
Lawmakers voted in Kathmandu this week on the draft constitution, and officials say the new charter should be adopted by Sunday.
We mustn't panic now.
After losing to the ice of champions Litvínov, you didn't even manage a home duel with the Sparta players (3-5).
Aren't you worried about a similarly disastrous entry to the extras as you were a year ago?
I hope nothing like this will happen again.

NHC predicts a 60 percent probability of a cyclone south of the Cape Verde Islands
A wide low-pressure system of about 350 miles (560 km) south of the southernmost Cape Verde Islands is likely to be 60 percent likely to produce a tropical cyclone in the next 48 hours, the US National Hurricane Center said on Tuesday.
Another well-defined low-pressure system about the middle between Cape Verdean and the Little Antilles also has a 60 percent probability in the emergence of a tropical cycloon formation in the next two days, the weather forecaster based in Miami added.
Google has launched a campaign to collect $11 million for refugees.
Google Inc (GOOGL.O) said it was launching a campaign aimed at raising $11 million for humanitarian organizations helping thousands of refugees who flooded European states fleeing war-torn and poor countries. Google doubles each selected amount.
Google announced this on its blog in a very unusual way.
The news was posted on her blog by Google employee Rita Masoudová on the basis of personal experience when she fled Kabul's family as a seven-year-old.
"We have travelled on many dark trains and buses and have experienced hunger, thirst, cold and fear," Masoudová said.
I was lucky.
But with the deteriorating immigration crisis in Europe, more and more families like her are willing to help.
All contributions will be distributed among the 4 nonprofit organizations helping refugees and immigrants: Doctors Without Borders, the International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google said it would double all posts made via google.com/refugeerelief to $15.5 million.
Europe is facing the biggest wave of refugees since World War II. Most of them come from Syria, torn by a four-year war that has driven 4 million people out this year alone.
Many people are also fleeing war-torn Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

For mildly obese diabetics, weight loss surgery could be useful
The benefits of weight loss surgery for mildly obese people with type 2 diabetes can last at least five years, according to a new study.
However, it is still too early to say whether the mildly obese people with type 2 diabetes live longer after weight loss surgery than those who receive non-surgical treatment.
"Destal data takes a long time to display," says Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert in weight loss surgery who wrote an editorial for a new study of JAMA surgery.
Sense loss surgery, bariatric surgery uses different methods to shrink the stomach.
Reducing hunger and limiting the human body to absorb food.
Over the years, bariatric surgery has proven effective for treating type 2 diabetes, but most of the survey was conducted on people with morbid obesity with a body mass index (BMI) of 25 or higher.
A BMI which measures the weighted relationship of height is considered to be normal in the values between 18.5 and 24.9.
BMI values of 25 or higher indications of an overweight person and people with a value of over 30 are considered obese.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For their new studies, researchers at the Min-Sheng General Hospital in Taiwan use data collected from a study since 2007 on two types of bariatric surgery - gastric bypass and gastronomic gastro-rectomy - in type 3 diabetes treatment in type 3 diabetes treatment in people who were mildly obese.
The average BMI among those who underwent surgery has fallen from 31 to 24.5 towards the end of the fifth year, according to the study.
Meanwhile, the BMI of those who were not given surgical treatment of diabetes remained roughly the same at 29.
Among patients with surgery, diabetes was solved completely in 36 percent and partly in 28 cases.
In the medication-treated group, only 1 percent were completely resolved in the 1 percent and in only about 2 percent of patients.
In addition, blood pressure, trigylcerides and "bad" LDL cholesterol were also proven "generally better in the surgical group," the authors found.
Researchers also monitored the patient's haemoglobin A1c levels in the blood, which reflects the ongoing blood sugar levels in the body.
The Hemoglobin A1c is best kept below the level of 7 percent, researchers say.
After the surgery, the average haemoglobin A1c dropped from about 9 percent to about 6 percent.
In the medication-treated group, however, this remained at about 8 percent.
But this better "glykemic control" - which is reflected in the better levels of the A1c hemoglobin - did not reduce mortality at five years, according to the lead researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.
The research team also compared the average results with two types of operations.
After the fifth year, the bypass group lost more weight compared to the gastrektomy group (18.7 against 14.2 kg), achieved larger declines in BMI (7.4 against 5.1), and the A1c hemoglobin (3.1 percent against 2.1 per cent) and were more likely to remise the diabetes (46.9 percent against 16.7 percent).
While the new study does not show an improvement in survival or surgery after five years, there is evidence from the study of stronger people in Sweden, where they found that surgery leads to an extension of life, says Blackstone of the University of Arizona College or Medicine-Phoenix.
According to a Swedish study, obese people who underwent bariatric surgery had about a 29 percent better chance of survival in the next 15 years, compared to a group that tried multiple conventional methods.
Although the new study did not show an improvement in survival among patients after surgery, according to Blackstone, this is a reassuring result for BMI people below 35, who are interested in these procedures.
"Right here this thesis is critical because it states that surgery is safer in the lower BMI group," he says, without increasing the risk of death or kidney disease.
Blackstone also further argues that people and their doctors should start taking their weight really seriously after the drop in the patient's BMI between the 27 and 30s.
"I think we've been waiting too long to be showing people the gravity of the situation," he says.
I think that once a build-up of these genetic changes, which will firmly link their bodies to obesity and diabetes, the way back is already really hard.
"It's impossible for everyone to come to Europe" - The Dalai Lama - RT News
Europe is unable to accommodate all refugees, said the Dalai Lama, adding that a genuine solution to the current refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader has called for an end to the violence in the refugee's home countries.
The Dalai Lama addressed the issue of the ongoing refugee crisis in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, a study of ethics, at the start of his 10-day visit to the United Kingdom.
He argued that under the current circumstances, humanity's interest should be placed before the interests of individual countries or even continents.
He also stressed that the response from Western European countries, however admirable it was, was inadequate in this situation for the refugee crisis.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama praised the efforts of Germany and Austria in a solution to the crisis, he stressed that this was only a temporary solution.
"It is wonderful to take care of several thousand refugees, but in the meantime you will have to think about a long-term solution to bring about real peace and real development, especially through the education of these Muslim countries," he stressed.
Finally, we have to think about how to reduce the killing in their countries.
We must limit the use of force.
The use of force has never solved these problems," he added.
In dealing with the issues of violence, the Dalai Lama also commented on the George Bush actions after the 9/11 terrorist attack, claiming that "the US's violent response has sparked a chain of uncontrollable events.
After 9/11, I expressed my condolences in a letter to President Bush and advised him that the way to solve this problem was not a violent way.
I know his motives were good, but he used the power to create unexpected consequences," the Dalai Lama said.
A four-fold increase in the number of children who have been treated with a sanitation igloid over the past 4 years
Toxicology centers around the United States reported a rise of nearly 400 percent from 2010 in the number of children up to the age of 12 who swallowed a high-alcoholic ambulance, according to the toxicology center in Georgia.
According to Dr. Gaylorda Lopez, director of the Georgia toxicology centre, the number of ambulance perpetuitage for children under the age of 12 who were reported to the poison inspection centres increased from 3,266 in 2010 to 1611 in 2014.
"Children get to these products more often, and unfortunately there is a percentage of children who have to be taken to the emergency room," Lopez told CNN.
Some children drink the ambulance on purpose, while some want to impress their friends or as a challenge on social media.
Videos on the YouTube show teens drinking a sanitation device for cheap fuss.
The penitiments allegedly mixed the ambulance with the mouthwash containing the alcohol for a stronger drink.
Younger children may be attracted to the attractive scent of the resource.
"The children do not think about the fact that it would hurt them," Lopez said.
A lot of more attractive (sanitational means) are those that are perfumed.
To be introduced are sanitation remedies with the smell of strawberry, grapefruit or oranges, which are very appealing to children.
The ambulance contains between 45 and 95 per cent alcohol.
Especially in young children, several swigs can mean alcohol poisoning.
"This is highly concentrated alcohol," the medical director of the Athexia Toxicology Centre at the University of Kansas Hospital, Dr. Stephen Thornton.
You wouldn't just let a glass of whiskey lounging, either, but people leave these ambulance remedies out there, and when the kids get to them, it's a quick road to alcohol consumption.
Nhaijah Russel, a 6-year-old girl who recently ingested up to four swigs of a strawberry-scented ambulance agent at school and was taken to the emergency room for treatment.
Her blood alcohol level was .179, which is twice the threshold considered to be drunk in an adult, according to Dr Chris Ritchey, the emergency doctor who cared for her at the Gwinnett Medical Center outside of Atlanta.
Nhaijah spoke the dim words and was unable to walk after she arrived at the emergency room.
Doctors monitored her overnight at a separate children's hospital for any signs of brain trauma because of any signs of brain trauma because of alcohol, and hit her head, Ritchey says.
"It was very scary," Nhaijah's mother told CNN.
It could have been mortal for my child.
Lopez advised parents and teachers to use non-alcoholic products or arrange for ambulance to be out of the reach of children.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some sanitation products were associated with death.
In 2013, two women from Ontaria died after swallowing a sanitation device containing a toxic, undeclared ingredient.
Health officials believed the product contained methanol, a deadly reagent, rather than ethanol, which was listed as an active ingredient.
In January, three fourth-year students in northern New York City planned to poison their "bad" teacher by deploying antibacterial products around the room," according to a police report.
The teacher is very allergic to sanitation and has forbidden their presence in the room.
Police assessed the thwarted plan as "innocent chatter," referring to the discipline of the school district,
Famar: No mismatch in the Celtic team
Griffiths downplays talk of a mismatch in Celtic, while Deila admits that Hoops are in the wrong place, but he reverses it again.
Hearts will fight the SFA against the attack on Neilson, and Warburton is worried that the new reinforcements of January will disrupt the team's unity.
Dons increase their lead over Celtic by 5 points
The first-half penalty in ADAMA's lead by Rooney gave Aberdehen a narrow victory over Hamilton in Pittodria, giving Dons a five-point lead between themselves and Celtic.
Griffiths denies talk of mismatch
This situation has sparked gossip about the mismatch in Celtic, which were denial by Griffiths, who insists that he and his teammates are not working under any pressure from increased surveillance in the preparations for the match with the leaders of the Dutch league.
I don't think we feel under pressure, I think the players are looking forward to it.
Lack in Scottish title rivalry bored with the Netherlands - de Boer
Former Rangers midfielder and former Netherlands international Ronald de Boer claim that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic - because there is no more rivalry between them because of the title.
De Boer, who is currently the ambassador of Ajax, states: "In the Netherlands, they no longer show the best of Celtic's matches, and why?"
'Cause the Rangers are no longer there.
The people here don't just talk about the Rangers' return.
He's talking about the Old Company.
They're talking about the two teams together, and that's what they're interested in.
There is a lot of tension at the Old Company matches and not only the people of Scotland are watching these games.
I turn things back to the good, commits Deila.
ROONY Dealia admitted that Celtic was stumbling a little, but the Norwegian boss pledged to turn things back to the good.
The defeat by Malm and the following out of the Champions League were quickly followed by a defeat against Aberdeen, which had only 10 players and now powered to the top of the table with a five-point lead.
But Deila says, "The whole has been through a bad time and will rise again."
Now we want to get out of this as soon as possible.
I know it's very frustrating and a lot of people are really, really angry or sad with current events.
We're in the same position - but we have to move on.
Really, we really need the support of Celtic because it makes the players much better.
It is now very important to stay together.
Warburton is concerned about January reinforcements
Despite comments that surfaced a few weeks ago and suggested that he had already identified some of his January targets, Rangers chief Mark Warburton is worried about the big shopping of reinforcements and insists that he does not want to disrupt the unity of the Ibrox team.
The former head of Brentford states: "The January transfer window is very different from the summer's."
Players who come in the summer have a pre-season season to get in, which you could see on our own team this season.
The team is doing really well.
Sometimes it's more damage by adding unnecessary players to the ones you really need.
Celtic Michu's transfer target hints at retirement
Forward Swansea Michu, who was associated with Celtic in the transfer window, indicated that he could retire after his contract with Swansea expired.
The 20-year-old marksman has had a susceptible ankle problem for two years and has failed to find his way out of Wales this summer.
Hearts to battle the SFA for commentary against Neilson
The Hearts led 2-1 when Paterson was sent to the locker room and eventually lost 3-2, but the red card for that defender was later cancelled - a third red card issued by referee Collum, who was removed.
Neilson stands by his assertion and states: "I did not question the integrity, I did not comment on the performance."
Griffiths pledged to avoid Tynecastle
The stubborn Hibbe was strictly reprimanded after admitting that he was singing a song with a lyrics aimed at former Hearts player Rudolf Skácel.
The incident took place in a pub in the Roserburn area of Edinburgh before the Edinburgh Derby in the Tynecastle in March of 2014
"This was a derby and it was a heated moment," the striker said, continuing: "I can safely say that I will not return to the Tynamsle unless it is in the jersey of Celtic."
Tannadice Council believes in the management of Dundee United - Donelly
Simon Donelly insists that Dundee United's board still believes in correcting the situation through the team's current management - but admits that the decline on the pitch must come to an end.
I think Stephen Thompson believes in us.
We'll prepare the boys for action again," Donnelly promises.
MCInnes is happy for the 'ugly victory' against Hamilton
Derek McInnes admits that his Aberdeen team had to hold desperately against Hamilton Accies to win a seventh consecutive league victory and a five-point lead over Celtic at the top of the standings thanks to a penalty from the first half in Adam Rooney's serve.
McInnes states: "There is no team that has won anything, cups or leagues, without winning this type of matches."
Scottish unemployment remains unchanged as UK overall unemployment rises
NON-GAMMANNANOST in Scotland remains unchanged at 164 000 between May and July, while the total number of unemployed UK staff has risen by 10 000 to 1.82 million during the same period.
Scotland's unemployment rate of 5.9 percent was above the UK rate (5.5 per cent), as shown by data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS).
Meanwhile, employment in Scotland has fallen by 12,000 over a three-month period, with the number of workers now halting to 2,612,000.
The employment rate in Scotland fell to 74.0 percent during the quarter - a figure above the UK average of 73.5 percent.
Scottish State Secretary David Mundell said in a commentary on the latest data: "The long-term government plan has laid the groundwork for a stronger economy."
It is almost exactly a year since Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom.
In these 12 months, we saw a further improvement in the labour market and Scottish employment was rising while unemployment was falling.
Why I witnessed an execution in Oklahoma
Later today, despite the late legal intervention, I will be watching the man's death.
If that happens, and I hope it doesn't happen, I'll be sitting in a viewing gallery in the death chamber of Oklahom State Prison and see Richard Glossip, who will be executed by lethal injection.
He asked me to be one of four officials who would be witnessing his death.
I received the invitation first in January through my best friend and although I was shocked, I agreed.
As the day gets closer, I'm getting scared of it.
Then why am I doing this?
I have accepted this invitation because I think it is a good way to tell you of the story of the death penalty.
It would offer me a unique perspective.
It is true that journalists are allowed to watch executions in America and because there are often more requests than vacancies, a morbid lottery is being carried out to decide who will be elected.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of posts for journalists from 12 to five.
Whoever is chosen will be watching the entire execution dispassionately.
I can't do that.
I will be sitting at the side of Richard Glossip's closest friends and create a special bond with him through the months of phone calls and one-two and a half-hour visits.
I like the boy.
We often laugh when we talk.
The Prison Administration says I can't be both a witness and a journalist, so I won't be allowed to take a notebook and I won't be able to record what I'll see.
I'll just have to remember all the details.
A journalist from Oklahoma accused me on Twitter of compromising my impartiality.
This is a lesson.
Tell the inmate's story the way it likes, get access.
I was complaining about it.
She admitted that "she could have phrased it better," but still thinks what I'm doing is wrong.
Richard Glossip had a problem with some of the things I said and wrote.
He doesn't tell me what to write, and even if he did, I wouldn't listen to him.
I told him he could remove me from the witness list at any time.
But he wants an international journalist who will be ready to tell the story on the spot.
He thinks that if he dies, his case will help the death penalty procedures.
Kim Bellware, the journalist at the Huffington Post, will be by my side.
To know more about the case, please listen to the series of podcasts I have created.
I'm not going to repeat all the details again.
I can't say for sure that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Treese would have found him guilty of complicity in the crime.
But I believe there is a good chance that he is innocent of the murder.
I certainly believe that sufficient evidence has not been provided to justify the death penalty.
In my opinion, the execution is wrong.
And it is from this perspective that I will be watching his death.
I can't say I'm going to be really objective.
For this purpose, you can contact other journalists.
What you get from me is the experience of seeing the person I love, to die an unnecessary death.
Man escapes from Canning River after police chase
Officer Canning Vale remained dry after freeing the man from the Canning River.
The man's bet from Petrh that he would run away from the police did not come after he got into the shallow muddy water only a metre from a policeman who tried to persuade him to go back to shore.
Police from Canning Vale were called in an incident beyond Beckenham on Tuesday.
When they saw the suspect, he tried to get rid of them by escaping the Canning River.
But he didn't get far.
"He was in the water and he repeated I'm not going to go out, just come for me," said Sergeant Shandell Castledine.
Officer Lachlan Perhavec didn't exactly want to soak his uniform, so he tried to use safer tactics and the police negotiation."
'People sometimes try to do funny things when they escape,' said Castledine.
Soccer champion Ben Cousins gives a memorable example.
In 2006, Cousins drove his car into a ditch to avoid a bus and try to swim across the Swan River.
His efforts were in vain, but he inspired the locals to start planning Bena Cousins' biathlon.
Peter Moody says organizers tried to spy on him and threatens to end the races
Peeter Moody accused the Racing Victoria organizer of trying to get a spy into the stable last year and threatened to end the race immediately.
He focused on the organizer and integrity department of Racing Victoria, and he relied on the belief that they had a late-crackled personal campaign against him with Lady Tatai's late-scrapped maintenance day, which was the last straw for him on Wednesday.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he had always tried to do what was best for racing and found himself in a difficult situation when it came to Lidara's positive swab for cobalt, which he could not explain.
He bit his tongue about the espionage charge for 18 months and didn't want it to look like "dry grapes."
"I didn't want to say anything about sitting on it for a long time, but you just feel so frustrated that it's all come out of you at once," Moody said.
They know it went on.
Sometimes you respond and you have to live with the consequences, and I'll have to live with what I said.
I'm going to go home today and get some sleep.
I want to go up with my head and the owners think I'm doing the best I'm doing it for them.
If they start thinking otherwise, then I shouldn't be a coach.
I'd have to consider doing my license afterwards.
Previously, Moody launched a bomb in his race-agr.com interview that the integrity of the department had tried to spy on him.
"Eighteen months ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown, and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in a room with the man - whom I will name after the question - and offered him a job at my stables for finding out about the things that are being done at my stables," Moody told Racing.com.
Of course, they thought I was a fraud.
If that's the case, they should all show their information, because they totally burned me in an attempt to catch me.
Robert Roulston, former RVL chairman, David Moodie, current chairman of the RVL, and Bernard Saunda, the current CEO of RVL, were aware of this at the time and are aware of this today.
Should I think this is becoming a personal matter?
Will the RVL grow a few spheres and arrange for people outside of coaching positions to take responsibility for what is happening in this industry?
Am I bad for this industry?
Am I really that bad for this industry?
Maybe the people here think they do.
Maybe they need to take away my license and push me away, and I have no doubt that what I'm saying now will give them the material to reflect.
But I got to a point, since I don't care, and it makes me sad.
I was really sad.
I will press them and pass on the burden to make a decision.
I have the support of my family and I can leave.
The level of the coach's frustration has been increased with a long-term investigation into cobalt, including Lidari, and a recent scratch has made him feel like "having his desk license for hours."
Mood, best known for preparing undefeated champion Black Caviar, called the race day's rule "ridiculous" after being applied to the horses' feet by a clay clad or mud, which is against the rules.
It's against the rules of racing.
I must take full responsibility for this," he said.
Someone on my team accidentally applied mud to his leg.
He could have had it last night.
It could have happened yesterday, and it did.
It happened on the day of the race.
Moody faced a three-month disqualification for treating the tiles on the day of the race, to which the organizers had already opened an investigation.
It's a joke.
The people who make these rules know nothing about horses.
"We all understand that we need the rules, but this has gone too far," said Moody.
Cobram driver who fled has been arrested
Police have arrested a man who hit a cyclist in Cobram over the weekend and left after a collision.
The cyclist was flown to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries after being hit by a car on the main road Murray Valley on Saturday morning.
Police said the motorist left without stopping and helping the injured rider.
On Monday, a man in the 50-year-old from Nathalia confessed to the police in Shepparton.
He is expected to be charged with unstoppable accidents, failure to render assistance and other traffic offences.
The cyclist, a 40-year-old man from Cobram, remains in the hospital in a stable condition.
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy strikes back at rivals over wrestling claims
Craig Bellamy, Melbourne Storm's coach, criticized his players' interventions as "setting a plan" by two NRLs favorite premiership.
Trent Robinson, coach of the Sydney Roosters, said the referees had allowed the players of the Storm to "restore" his players during the controversial victory for the Storm team in the Sydney Qualifying Final on Friday night.
Wayne Bennet, coach of Brisbane Broncos, made a slightly veiled rematch to Stroro after his team won the qualifying final over the North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night, calling the game a "sightseeing" of the rugby league, and according to him two of Queensland were not "too great" for wrestling.
Bellamy defended the footage of his players and said they concentrated on "contact" during them.
Bellamy added that this situation has increased his confidence because his team is being criticised by two leading coaches, which may mean they are afraid of a defeat by the Storm team.
"It's still coming - I don't remember Trent Robinson talking about wrestling when we were beaten 24-2," Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I can guarantee that we haven't changed any of our defensive systems and techniques in the last year, the last few weeks we've only put the emphasis on contact during the interventions, and that's a turning point for us.
Trent's been here for three years and he's obviously been coaching a great team, so he's probably not used to losing, which could have been a bit of a shock to him.
It's funny how such things always come up in this one year's part.
Bellamy devalued Bennet's idea of "exciting football" and reminded his mentor that Bennetov's St George-Illawarro Dragons team won the premiership in 2010 by playing "boring" football.
Wayne talks about exciting football.
He was right about his Saturday play as exciting as ours. It was also equally exciting," Bellamy said.
I remember in 2010 they were criticized by St. George for being a boring team and Wayne said at the time that he didn't give a damn.
But now he has a team that can play a style of play that he finds to be canceling, especially his young midfielders with their speed.
You would like to play such a football if you had this type of player at your disposal.
He said that view in 2010 and now he wants all teams to play his style of football - but not every team has two midfielders like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, so they can't play that style.
It gives me more confidence because they say things like that because they are worried about the match against us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't even think of us when they got to the big fights.
Bellamy also pointed to the fact that more goals were scored in the Storm and Roosters game than in the Broncos and Cowboys.
The Broncos' game was probably good, I didn't look, but what's the score? 16-12?
Our game ended 20-18, in our game there were two more attempts, but is it exciting football?
Or are breaks and no-goal attempts interesting?
I think it's the agendas.
If they mention us, it means we will definitely meet again at the stage.
Storm are on a break this weekend and have won the right to host either the North Queensland Cownboys or the Cronulla Sharks in the preliminary final of the next Saturday night at AAMI Park. Tickets will be on sale from next morning next Tuesday.
Serbian man gets $200,000 bail for drug charges
A man facing a possible life sentence for possession of 40 kilograms of cocaine, which was smuggled out of Queensland, received bail of $200,000.
Marko Maksimovic (29) was one of five men arrested last month by federal police searching for 100 kilograms of drug from the Solay yacht, who arrived from South America via Vanuatu and docked in Coomera in August.
Maksimovic was spotted meeting with the accused in the harbor during the morning and later met them at the Coomera Roadhouse Cafe, where police found 40 kilograms of the drug in Toyota Echo.
Even though he faced a potential sentence for a life sentence for holding commercial cocaine, Maksimov's lawyer built the defense on the fact that there was no evidence that he owned the full quantity and that he could be in the cafe entirely by accident and innocence.
Supreme Court Justice Peter Flanagan believed Maksimovic had fled.
It has a clear connection to Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia," he told the court on Wednesday.
In the crown case, he lied to the police about where he lived.
Together, Mother and the stepfather, Maksimovic, offered bail $200,000 for his release.
"After reading the sworn statements of both people, it is clear that the deposit of USD 200,000 is a real financial burden for them," Judge Flanagan said.
Their efforts themselves were clearly inadequate, because the accused did not appear further in court, he warned.
Maksimovic has been granted bail on the condition that she relinquishes both the Australian and Serbian passports, report to the police on a daily basis and observe the curfew from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m.
Stevan Hogg used the girl's phone to lure paedophiles to send pictures
The paedophile used the 11-year-old girl's phone to get photos of child abuse.
Stevan Hogg picked up the girl's phone while she was sleeping, then signed up for her online chat, where he had a lot of rude photos of the children sent to him by another user.
The girl then came to theater and discovered that she was missing the phone and then found it in the hands of the sleeping Hogg.
She went through it and found disturbing news before alerting her mother.
Police became involved and saw five photographs, after which analytical computers found the address and discovered "disturbed" searches on the web using terms for searching for naughty pictures of children.
Hogg then claimed to the officers that his reason was to "take the paedophiles" online before he "pretended that he was a police officer and frightened them."
Fiscalcus Eilidh Robertson told Dundee Sheriff Court: "He said it was an addiction - that he was addicted to scaring people.
He admitted that he did the computer searches, but he claimed he only wanted to pretend to be a cop to scare the pedophiles.
He was asked about his conversation with an unknown person who had sent him the pictures and why he wanted her to send more.
According to him, he did it to lure them in
He claims he went crazy drunk and said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder.
Mrs. Robertson added: "When the girl found the messages on her phone, he called his mother, shivering and crying.
She saw the naughty pictures on his phone and the defendant was then confronted.
The girl was interviewed and talked about the defendant's use of her computer and Playstation to talk to girls who looked much younger than him.
Hog, 23, residing in Ward Road, Dundee, pleaded guilty to suing the adoption or receiving inappropriate images of children 14. June of last year, he violated the terms of his bail on January 25 and did not appear for a hearing at the court on March 24 of this year.
Defense attorney Gregor Sim asked Hogg not to be placed on the list of sex offenders because he can argue that there was "no major sexual overtones" in his actions.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael postponed the ruling until October to file a report from social workers.
Hogg was granted bail in this case, but was held in custody before hearing about other unsolved cases.
He was placed on the list of sex offenders before the date of his judgment.
Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe gives a bad speech in parliament
Mr Mugabe, Africa's oldest leader, had earlier fallen on the steps leading up to the stage this year.
He was not injured, but the video of his fall became viral in social media.
The opening of the parliament was also tainted by opposition legislators' claims that they had received anonymous threats of killing, warning them against the whistle of Mr Mugabe during his speech.
He was booed and provoked last month during his speech on the state of the nation in parliament - a speech he reiterated on Tuesday.
The chairman of the Movement for a Democratic Change (MDC), Innocent Gonese, said that seven opposition politicians received text messages on their mobile phones with a warning not to hinder Mr Mugabe's speech.
"The report comes from a number that will not be displayed, but is named 'death'," he told the journalists after Mr Mugabe's speech.
It warns the members concerned to know that immunity ends up in parliament and, once they step out of parliament, their parliamentary immunity does not work.
The chief said that the party being run by Morgan Tsvangirai was "enough" about threats against MPs.
Hewlett-Packard is set to cut its job by as much as 30,000.
Hewlett-Packard the abolition of 25 000 to 30 000 jobs as part of its efforts to restructure and cost savings of the company's commercial services.
Later this year, HP will be divided into two listed companies and will separate the trading of computers and printers from its faster-growing hardware and service operations.
The expected job reduction will result in a change in the size of about $2.7 billion and start in the fourth quarter, HP says in a statement.
"This restructuring activity will enable us to create a more competitive, sustainable spending structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise," says Meg Whitman, CEO of HP and Chairman of the Board of Directors, who will head the unit after the split.
"The Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more sophisticated than HP today and will have a wide and extensive business portfolio to help businesses move to a new style of business," Whitman said.
As a separated company, we will be in a much better position to meet the evolving demands of our customers around the world.
Hewlett Parckard Enterprise will be sent to the company's declaration of an annual revenue of more than $50 billion and "will be aimed at providing unrivalled integrated technology solutions" to companies.
This will spread the company set up by Stanford University graduates Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard, the electrical equipment graduates, and whose Palo Alto garage was dubbed the "Silicon Valley family."
HP was undergoing a massive reorganization to manage the transfer from traditional personal computers to mobile devices.
This move by HP, the second largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest technical firms in the Americas, is the latest in this sector based on the belief that a narrowly specialized firm has better results.
Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta says teammates must get past injured Jack Wilshere before Dinamo Zagreb
Wenger also stressed to Wilsher that it is still only September and, if his rehabilitation goes according to plan, there is no reason not to play again at Christmas.
This best scenario already means that Wilshere will surely miss at least the next four English games and, from the point of view of history, his involvement in the next European Summer Championship, is clearly uncertain.
The big pity for this newest problem is that Wilshere ended last season with a severe ankle injury and then got back into his former form during the pre-zone.
"This kind of injury does not threaten a career," says Wenger.
It's a wound that requires healing.
This is nothing special.
It was just an accident.
It was not about his ankles or injuries he had suffered before.
This could be true from a purely medical point of view, as Wenger admitted that there is a relative danger of further injuries whenever any player returns during the season.
There is also an unpleasant pattern.
The survey conducted by Premier Injuries Ltd. has recorded 23 different injuries to Wilshera since he made his game debut six years ago.
During the past five years, he has played in only 65 league games for Arsenal, out of a total of 157:
From a broader perspective for Arsenal, this means that in six of the eight seasons since 2007-08 he was one of the two Premier League clubs to lose the most days due to injury.
Wenger accepts the potential of the vicious circle, but Arsenal believe that the improvement in the area of recorded injuries during the last season will continue.
"Sometimes when you come back from injury, you have a vulnerable time, a time when you need to strengthen your body and get a competition," Wenger says.
Jack's young enough to get out of it.
I hope his body stabilizes, I'm sure he will and will have a career he deserves.
Arsenal begin their campaign in the Champions League on Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb's Chelsea matches on Saturday and Tottenham Hotspur the next Wednesday, and Wenger is preparing to rotate his team.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey did not travel to Croatia, which is that Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are likely to start.
Wenger could also start with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud in addition to Nacho Monreal Theo Walcott.
"I try to keep the balance and let the players in need let it out," says Wenger.
Although Arsenal are the clear favourites to advance from Group F, Maksimir in Zagreb has a reputation for the most intimidating stadium in Europe.
Dinamo were also not beaten in a total of 41 matches after they kept the "unbeatable" campaign last season.
The stadium rocked on Wednesday night with a magnitude 3.2-meter-acquirection Richter.
That was the 10th year in Zagreb.
Wenger thinks that the Arsenal have learned their lesson from last season's Champions League, when he capitulated against Monaco and is left with a distant hope of leading the club to their first victory in the European Cup.
"This deployment is tremendous," says Wenger.
It never happened to Arsenal.
We were very close in 2006, but on the other hand, I have to be a realist.
We're ambitious, but we're not dreamers.
FriendsFest: a comedy show that gives us a serious lesson about a man's friendship
The absence of such views in various shows is blatant, especially given the need for men to open up more desperate than ever when it comes to suicides among young men under the age of 15.
In 2013, it was the only largest cause of death in men aged 20-45 in the UK and remains three times more common for men than in women.
In an effort to address the problem, Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) called the 2015 year of the Man's Year, which aims to challenge a culture that prevents men from seeking help if needed.
At the heart of this fight lies the friendship for fulfilling this challenge.
A recent study by more than 2,000 high school students showing symptoms of depression found that if the victim had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with a "healthy mood," their chances of recovery doubled.
Likewise, for those who are not depressed, the circle of sane, sender of sinsinters' friends is half the chance of occurring for mental health problems.
But for the friendship to work, of course, it must be reachable first.
In this communication via social media with an emphasis on style and not the content of the message, the immediate response is often favoured over meaningful contact.
Thanks to our digital lives, our need to look stronger, more loving and more successful entertainment has doubled, although we are rather isolated in reality.
This shallow success is dominated by what psychologists call external values; money, image, social condition, everything at the expense of our true values - our personal desire for growth and friendship - which have a profound effect on our mental health.
And, as one billionaire and game-maker explained not long ago, the money doesn't really buy better luck.
The beauty of Friends was the source of this idea for him.
None of the characters were defined by their work, but by their personalities, who shone through friendly interactions.
Joey's humor and Chandler's frequent victims, the moment watching football on comfortable chairs, Ross's desire for Rachel, all stemming from the realization that he did, men can identify with it, even if they mostly keep their feelings to themselves.
as a Samaritian worker explained to me: ...."my role as the listener of people who feel depressed or suicidal really confirmed to me that even the smallest friendly interactions can make a difference."
Men who contact us often feel the inability to communicate with friends.
The old adage of "to deal with it" is strong in the sense that it will be seen as weak to open up to problems.
Friends are one of the shows that will emerge in my memory when I try to offer a longer-term settlement mechanism.
He emphasizes the short moments in a man's friendship.
As for my task, the state of the outsider's phone helps people in moments of desperation, but long-term support has to come from a larger near-town, a network of friends and family.
So if you're going to FrendsFest this weekend, held by Comedy Central Station, why not take your friends for a drink in Central Perk, where the interior for the occasion of the celebration will be completely redesigned.
Or if you see someone alone in Starbucks, smile at him and say hello.
You never know the difference your friendship can make.
Friends will air on Comedy Central from start to finish - full 236 episodes - for #FriendsFest
Di Maria scored to help PSG sweep Malmo aside
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after scoring a goal against Malma.
Angel Di Maria scored on his debut in the Champions League, helping PSG beat Sweden's Malmo team on Tuesday.
Here's the news of the game and the reaction to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani both scored in Tuesday's game and Paris Saint-Germain began their journey in the Champions League with a final comfort victory of a 2-0 win against Malmu on the Parc des Princes.
Di Maria scored a goal less than four minutes after his debut in the Champions League and that PSG player sent the French champions to win, but then threw away a few chances until they finally increased their lead when Cavani scored a head-to-head goal in the 61st minute.
Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk are also in Group A, which is why the Paris team needed a strong start against the Swedish champions, as they focus not only on qualifying for the knockout rounds, but on improving their path to the quarter-finals, which they have recorded in each of the previous 3 years.
But even though they scored three points, it was not the classic performance of the team of Laurent Blanca and Zlatan Ibrahimovic was marus-breaking in front of the goal and was later replaced against his home team and club, in which he began his famed career in 1999.
"It's not easy to win away or at home in the Champions League, so a 2-0 win gives our opponents a problem and looking comfortable on defense is a good start, even if there are things we're going to have to improve with the season progressing," Blanc said.
That's a good sign.
We wanted to win and we won, yet I regret that we didn't score one or two more goals.
Ibrahimovic returned from injury as one of the three changes to the PSG team, which drew 2-2 at home with Bordeaux in the League this weekend, but was overshadowed by Di Maria in the fourth minute.
The Argentine wing was identified as a man who would take PSG to a new level in Europe after the transfer from Manchester United, which took place last month, and showed why, when he ran to the pass of Marca Verratti's defence to Malma's defence and sent the ball behind Johan Wiland's back to the far corner of the goal.
However, if anyone expected to kick-start a spectacular victory for PSG, they had to be disappointed.
Malmo, who beat Celtic in the playoffs to reach that stage, entered the starting lineup with 9 internationals and five defenders and two drawn-down midfielders, were a tough opponent.
But apart from a shot from Nikola Djurdjice, who just missed the far corner of Kevin Trapp's goal in the 34th minute, they didn't offer much in the attack.
Instead, PSG themselves struggled to benefit from the attack with poor passes and a lousy finish that was not good even from Ibrahimovic, who could not shoot five times in the first half, and was then disappointed as his shot arrived in the net shortly after the start of the second half of Cavani.
However, he proved much more appropriate when it came to the preparation of the chances for his teammates and it was from his pass that Di Maria sent a spinning shot that ended in Wiland's goal after 52 minutes.
The second goal finally came after the hour of play thanks to Cavani, this Uruguayan header shoved his sixth goal over the line after Ibrahimovic passed him on a pass from Maxwell's left flank.
This ended Malmo's thoughts about the possibility of making something of the match, and only a brilliant tackle by Wiland from close prowled David Luiz's hopes and the score remained unchanged even when reliever Ezequiel Lavezzi's goal was unrecorded at the end of the game.
The coach of the Malmo Age Hareide team later admitted that PSG were a class above his team, the Norwegian said: "Our last game in the Champions League took place in December of last year."
Since then we have only played in the Swedish league, which is not on the same level.
Qualifying matches are not enough.
Hats off to Paris.
For them, it was a fascinating match.
Glencore made $2.5 billion for share sales
Mining giant Glencore, based in Switzerland, which was hit by the collapse of commodity prices, made $2.5 billion on Wednesday from the sale of shares as part of its large-scale debt-reduction plan.
Glencore says in its statement that it has sold new shares worth about £1.6 billion to repay the debt.
This company, which has lost 57 percent of its market value this year, is facing a peppercat of commodity prices, as China's slowdown in the economy is reducing demand and sparking destruction across markets.
The issue of rights sent Glencore's share prices to the top in the London stock market in the early morning business on Wednesday.
The stock jumped 2.77 percent to 131.60 pence on the FTSE 100 index, which opened up 0.69 percent.
Glencore revealed last week that a $2.5 billion share sale is part of a broader plan to reduce their $30 billion debt, which has accumulated by about a third
The company sold new shares at 123 pence per share, marking a 2.4 percent discount on the closing price on Tuesday.
They got rid of 1.3 billion shares, at a total price of 9.99 percent per group.
Concerns over the hike in the brakes on the Chinese growth have cut the price of iron ore by nearly half, and coal, with copper and other commodities plummeting by 20 to 40 percent.
White House confirms Washington visited Xi Jinping
Chinese President Xi Jinping will visit the US at the end of the month, the White House confirmed in its Tuesday report.
President Xi's first visit to Washington will take place on September 25 in response from Barack Obama to a visit to Beijing, where the president visited in November, the report said.
US President and First Lady Michelle Obama will invite President Xi and his spouse, Peng Liyuan, to a state dinner to be held after the talks.
"President Xi's visit is an opportunity to strengthen relations between the US and China and urges cooperation to address the challenges in the field of international, regional and common interests, and is an opportunity for a constructive debate about disagreements between the two states," the report adds.
Xi, whose visit was first announced in February, should visit Seattle, where he will meet with several US technical leaders on his way to Washington, and then resume to New York at the UN meeting in September.
Obama and Xi are expected to address contentious problems, including Washington's concerns about China's alleged cyberespionage and its mounting aggressiveness in the waters of the South China Sea.
How the refugee crisis shattered the Schengen area.
The emergency flare launched by Germany has far from bumped over the European garrison, but is already forcing the ship to change course, the French daily Le Figaro reported.
The European Union decided on Monday to tackle the problem of refugees first: it will be more systematically sorting migrants and asylum seekers as soon as they set foot on the old continent - especially in Greece, rather than arguing over the future distribution of refugees according to quotas based on quantities, which are increasingly moving away from reality.
Six days after European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker asked 25 of the 28 EU countries to redistribute 160,000 refugees, the interior ministers of the Member States made the priority.
Before taking care of the final destination of the refugees, it is first necessary to filter out those who are arriving today and to resolve the fate of those who are already moving within the Schengen area.
"Effective management of the EU's external borders is essential to manage migration," the text discussed by ministers in Brussels stresses in a text discussed in Brussels.
Following the crisis of the common currency, the EU is in danger in its next major integration project.
Germany may be surprised, but it is not losing its resolve and increasing the pressure.
It is renewing border controls, particularly with Austria, but without blocking the influx of those seeking asylum in the country.
The central power is making it clear that without it, no free movement is possible in Europe.
It has already been used as evidence that Austria and Slovakia joined the measure on Monday.
Poland, the Netherlands, Belgium and even France are also considering this, albeit with varying intensity.
Hungary did this a long time ago.
These exceptional and temporary measures are admissible under the Schengen rules.
That it is a domino effect is also seen by the blind.
A key issue for Berlin and Paris is now the effective introduction of mandatory entry-level controls in Greece, southern Italy and also in Hungary for those who have already passed inland.
French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve and his German colleague Thomas Maizière discussed this intensively during a private interview with their three colleagues from Greece, Italy and Hungary.
This idea is not new, but it is tough.
In Italy, according to unofficial statistics, two-thirds of the newly arrived refugees have already been registered and identified by removing fingerprints.
Budapest rejects the introduction of any entry point on its territory because it is more afraid than others to keep the camps on its shoulders in which the refugees would pile up at its expense.
Greece remains a real black hole.
More than 200,000 people have landed on its islands near the Turkish coast this year, twice as many as have arrived in Italy recently.
Most of them are real asylum seekers who came directly from Syria after passing through overcrowded camps in Lebanon, Turkey and Jordan.
It's a huge gaping opening.
Athens, still in financial disruption and waiting for a new government, has folded its hands in the lap.
This is the starting point for the Balkan route and the source of concern now common to German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán.
The Juncker Commission promises to introduce the checkpoints as soon as possible, but did not give any number or date.
"The challenges facing Greece are related to the whole of Europe," EU interior ministers agreed on Monday to mobilise on the front.
So it is a matter of deploying the intervention teams of the European Frontex Border Control Agency in this country.
The EU wants to help Greece expand its reception capacity for asylum seekers and strengthen the surveillance of the islands.
"Afghteal financial resources will be needed," the text submitted to the ministers for approval warrants warns.
In terms of law, Athens will continue to have the last word.
The question of the emergence of genuine European border guards has not been formally raised, but Europe is imminent.
The 28's new emergency situation, it has, as a matter of the same way, pushed back to the second rail for the issue of binding quotas and 160,000 refugees, which was established earlier in the year by the Juncker Commission and the European Parliament, strongly supported by Angela Merkel and French President François Hollande.
Hungary, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Poland still do not want to hear about it.
They see it as an attack on their sovereignty.
The number, but not the obligation, was retained in a text approved by the majority of the 28 on Monday.
But as a political commitment.
In other words, the process is interrupted.
The only firm promise includes the redistribution of 40,000 refugees in the next two years, which was already reached in June during the hectic EU summit, concludes Le Figaro.
Seven dead under an avalanche in the Alpine, including three Czechs reportedly.
Three Czechs and four Germans are among the seven tourists who were killed by an avalanche in the French Alps.
German nationality, according to the authorities, is also the woman who was the only survivor of the afflicted group of eight.
Previous media reports indicated that it was a Polish woman.
A 30-year-old woman was hospitalized in the city of Briancon with a serious leg injury to her femur.
The dead were mostly 40-year-olds, according to AFP.
"The rescue operation is over, the bodies of the victims were also taken to Briancon for identification," said the prefect of the Hautes-Alpes departmentister Pierre Besnard.
The accident happened around noon in the Pelvoux mountain area below the top of the Dôme de Neige des Ecrins mountain, measuring 4015 metres.
"The sudden avalanche was 250 meters wide and about a metre high," said rescue chief Nicolas Colombani.
The eight-member group, according to him, was pouring in a huge amount of snow at the height of about 3900 meters.
The Meteorological Service did not warn in the area today before the weather.
Trengove before the Braga match: Finally, a true Europe.
Coach Jindřich Trpišovský, in his debut in the cups, managed to go through the Europa League round-robin rounds with Liberec to the group stage and now he is looking forward to enjoying the right Europe with the team.
The Slovan will welcome the 2011 finalist Braga to the start of the main stage of the competition and, according to the coach, wants to impose his playing style on her.
After all the nerves in the knockout stages, when every goal and every situation could knock you out on the way to the dream group, now we're there and we're going to play six games.
Of course we want to win, but we don't have to worry about every goal, we can play our tactics and we're not bound by a double-header.
"I am very much looking forward to it and it is the true Europe, before it was only qualification," Trengove said at a press conference.
Braga considers himself a top team.
They will be very active, with all the Brazilian, Portuguese and Spanish players who are good on the ball.
The opponent may just be more difficult just because he doesn't have that name, but he has a player in his cadre who, I suspect, scored three goals for Manchester.
"It's an excellent team-level team," Trpišovský said.
But he does not consider Braga to be the clear favourite.
I take it we're playing at home, so we're not underdogs.
"I think we showed in the domestic competition and in the preliminary rounds that we are strong at our stadium and we want to confirm that," said the coach, whose team lost only the opening Super Cup in Pilsen from 11 duels this season.
He believes that Liberec can also impose its style on Braga.
We have a team coming up that will be strong on the ball, at the same time it is atypically disciplined for them.
They play from a 4-4-2 set-up with a quick transition to the offensive phase.
"He is a very difficult opponent, we have discovered the weaknesses, but the most important thing will be how our players will do it on the pitch," Trpišovský said.
We studied the opponent a lot in the pre-season, which helped us a lot, this time we want to focus on our game, which we adapted to the training sessions.
"And we definitely want to, although it will be very challenging to be played according to our notes," the coach added.
Student films will dominate Písek, the international festival begins.
Over 350 authors from 51 countries have entered their works this year for the 15th International Festival of Student Films in the Písek competition.
Four dozen of them, which were sent to the final by a committee of students and educators, will be screened from 15 to 18 December. October at the Portych cinema.
The best of these will be chosen by an international jury, said festival spokesman Jakub Charvát.
Each year, the festival has a special theme that comes from the festival's theme song.
This is a detective story this year.
The director of this year's gala evenings, Richard Blumenfeld, plans to combine elements of television, film and theatrical.
"And of course we also have to solve the crime that was committed in our trailer this year," said Charvát.
Visitors will see a selection of the most interesting of the student's work - films of feature, animated and documentary.
They will be evaluated by an international jury, which will include last year's winner, director Miklas Manneke, Spanish director Claudio Niubo and British producer Hemant Sharda.
As every year, the festival organizers prepare an accompanying programme.
Wattican Punk Ballet from Armenia, singer Ondřej Ruml, professional didgeridoo player Ondřej Smeykal, turbošanson band Poletíme?, playful band Zrní or, for example, Petra Hapková with the recital Life at the Bar.
The festival will also host two exhibition of photographs.
The first will be brought by a graduate of the sand film school and a recipient of the prestigious awards, including the World Press Photo 2014, Jana Ašenbrennerová.
The second exhibition will bring to light the atmosphere that prevailed in Nepal after the tragic earthquake.
The cinematographer and documentary filmmaker Martin Čech will come to the sit-down with the visitors, the silent film The Cameraman will be accompanied by Gerhard Gruber and the sandbags Brukner, Novotný and Hlach in the studio of the sculptor Jan Novotný christen their new book 3 by friends from the city of P.
This year we will also remember Miroslav Ondříček, the patron saint of FAMO in Písek, who left us recently.
Our school and the festival are his legacy, which will live on.
"Young people from all over the world will continue to meet here, exchange experiences with each other and develop joint ties and film crafts," the spokesman said.
This will certainly be helped by the Pitching forum, where students can meet film professionals, complete several job-suits at the same time and get a job position.
The festival is associated with the creation of the Private Higher School of Film in Písek.
Its founders, husband and wife Vladana and Miloň Terčovi, organised their first year in 1997.
It was held once every two years until the sixth year.
In the bankruptcy of the TA, insurance companies are to cover the claims of clients in full.
Insurance companies should cover the full amount of clients' claims for the travel agent's bankruptcy.
This was decided by the House on Wednesday when it approved a modified amendment to the Tourism Business Terms and Conditions Act.
Travel agencies will be able to replace bankruptcy insurance with a bank guarantee, according to the draft, which is headed for consideration by the Senate.
Insurance companies with the obligation to pay for clients' claims even above the agreed limit disagree.
The Ministry of Regional Development insists on the adjustment, arguing consumer protection.
Insurance companies have already threatened to end the insurance of travel agencies against the crash if the amendment applies.
But the proposal has also been criticised by travel agents.
Without insurance, they will either have to quit or go abroad.
Minister for Regional Development Karla Šlechtová (for ANO) pointed out that the cases where insurance companies did not pay full compensation were not Eurocomform.
She drew attention to this year's Constitutional Court ruling, which confirmed that the client is entitled to a full refund regardless of the insurance limit.
Insurance companies will receive enough information about the management of travel agencies and will be able to set the correct limit, Šlechtová stressed.
"We appreciate the effort to increase consumer protection, but they must have a limit to be feasible," said TOP 09 Vice-President Miroslav Kalousek.
The bank guarantee, according to him, will not work because no one will give it unlimited.
"Tourist offices will have to cease their activities or move them abroad," Kalousek warned.
Member of the Presidium of the Association of Czech Travel Agencies and Agencies, Tomio Okamura (SPD), disagreed with Kalousek's concerns on the basis of a survey of member CK.
"Stop showing us lobbying insurance companies," he said.
The insurers' comments are not considered relevant by Okamura, there is no official written statement of which, in his view.
But they are said to be investigating whether the travel agencies will compose co-payments, which Okamura says is not a problem.
Jana Fischerová (ODS), who referred to the opinion of the competing Association of Travel Agents of the Czech Republic, and her party colleague Petr Bendl, who talked about the deletion of the stairs to Czech travel agencies, also warned against the provision.
Travel agencies, according to Fischer, will not be able to take out insurance.
"Consumer protection is working," Fischer says.
Her proposal to launch the contentious passage was not approved by the House.
Nor did Vojtěch Filip (KSČM) proceed with a proposal to return the draft to the committee because of the alleged violation of the Civil Code.
Filip drew attention to the travel agencies, which he said could threaten consumers.
The rapporteur of the draft, Martina Berdychová (ANO), in the light of the Constitutional Court's verdict, withdrew her proposal, which would limit the liability of insurance companies in cases where they could not have known that the insurance benefit would not cover the entire risk.
The amendment will not initially propose a minimum, four million-strong insurance limit for travel agencies offering air transport tours and a million-dollar limit for offices selling, for example, bus tours.
The threshold will remain at 30 percent of the planned sales of the package.
However, the insurance benefit limit will have to be such that it covers all customer claims in the event of a travel agent's bankruptcy.
The standard, even after the modifications, stipulates that travel agencies will have to newly mention for the sold tours, which travel agency organizes the trip.
Travel agencies will have to submit to insurance companies before the conclusion of the contract, among other things, data on the management and number of trips.
The approved amendment to the Public Administration Committee also envisages further regular reporting of insurance companies.
Travel agents will have to supply them with details of the number of passengers and tours sold each month, the total price of the tours sold and the amount of advance payments and sales for the tours and vouchers.
If the Ministry of Regional Development finds that the travel agent has failed to fulfil one of the legal obligations to the insurance company, it will call on it to be rectified, according to the draft, or be able to prohibit it from entering into new contracts if the breach of duty could jeopardise the interests of customers.
The amendment is also to be re-aligned to the financing of the mountain service.
The Ministry of Regional Development will determine the amount of the grant to the mountain service on the basis of its application, which it will be submitted until the end of April for the next year.
The request will include a report on the use of government money last year, a financing plan for the expenditure and an outlook for the next two years.
According to the association, the petitioner of the law, however, he did not think through a situation of what would happen if the insurance company terminates the CK contract.
It will not be allowed to hold tours, and clients who purchased the trip before the insurance is terminated, will lose it, according to the association.
The TA will suffer a significant loss in such a case and may even fail, even though its management was in good shape.
One of the options for travel agents to cope with such a situation will be the claim for compensation.
Another option will be to go abroad and use much softer conditions abroad and then we will only act as agencies in our market, said the association's vice-chairman, Jan Papež.
The draft amendment also contains the institute of the Bank Guarantee, but so illconceously that it cannot be implemented in practice at all, as the bank guarantee cannot be readily at an undetermined amount.
Moreover, according to the association, the change in past practice is de facto unnecessary.
In the two-year horizon, the whole law will need to be revised again, given the new EU directive.
There are now a total of 942 active insured travel agencies operating on the Czech market.
This year, only three TAc services have ceased their activities.
Domestic travel agencies sell trips worth about CZK 20 billion annually.
Merkel: We need to improve conditions in the Middle East.
The European Union must work to improve humanitarian conditions in refugee camps in Jordan and Lebanon to limit the arrival of refugees in Europe.
This was announced by German Chancellor Angela Merkel after talks with the German provincial prime ministers.
At the same time, it again appealed for the distribution of refugees who had already arrived in the EU among the 28 members.
We must do more to help the countries from which the refugees leave, or where they are staying for the country.
I expect a signal from the European Union that we will work for decent conditions in refugee camps, such as in Jordan and Lebanon, the German Chancellor said that such a signal could also be higher financial assistance or closer cooperation between the EU's international humanitarian organisations.
"Federal countries are also supporting the German government to promote a fair distribution of the weight of the refugee crisis to European countries," Merkel said.
In this context, the country's prime minister of Brandenburg, Dietmar Woidke, said at a press conference that he expected real solidarity from all EU states.
The distribution of refugees in the EU on the basis of quotas has long been rejected by the Czech Republic, among others.
Merkel and Woidke also spoke in favour of speeding up the asylum procedure in Germany.
People need to know as soon as possible whether they have a chance of staying here.
It is also needed for the authorities to start integrating foreigners more quickly, the Prime Minister of Brandenburg said.
According to him, it is also necessary for the majority of the money that Germany spends to care for refugees to be used precisely to integrate those who have a chance of obtaining asylum.
It will take more teachers to make the refugees manage German.
It is a great challenge for our country, but I believe that if the refugees can be integrated, they can become an asset to us, he said.
Matt Damon downplays diversity in film
Matt Damon confronted the Afroameter filmmaker Effie Brown during a discussion about diversity, claiming that it was not necessary behind the scenes.
During Sunday's episode of the HBO project, the Greenlight actor, cast in the series, interrupted the Brown series, emphasizing the need for alternative views about black-haemon protagonists in the script.
"When we talk about diversity, you do it by casting a movie and not when casting a show," Damon says.
Shocked, Brown reacted indignantly with disconculpation, and sighed "Hoo! Wow. Okay," when the comments about the Martian got on the air.
Damon and Brown teamed up with joint well-known producer Ben Affleck and the Farrell brothers to discuss the show's finalists.
"I'd like to appeal to people to think, whoever the director is, how they're going to treat the character of Harmony," Brown said at the outset.
The only black character that's a hooker who's hit by a white herder.
Drama White People producer championed the finalists Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio for the Rights to Direct of the Film; Damon retorted that their direction "would eventually give us something we don't want to do."
After the discussion aired, social media exploded in disapproval of Damon's comment.
Twitter user MrPooni expressed his anger at the clip's writing, "Matt Damon interrupted the only black woman in the room, so he can explain to her that diversity is SOWHERE, that it hurts."
The tweet has garnered more than 5,000 retweets and 4,000 leks since it was released.
Damon's comment comes as accurate racial representation in the media is at the forefront of social debate.
After the killing of teenage Michael Brown was a white police officer in 2014, the Black Lives Matter movement took up a national effect and pushed the creators of the laws and authorities to refrain from discriminatory practices against colorful people.
In February, the singer Prince made allissions to the movement, while presenting the nominees in the Album of the Year category during the Grammy Awards.
"Alba is still important," he said.
Like books and black lives, albums are still important.
Most recently, the leader of the Black Lives Matter movement presented a statement in response to a question from Fox News, Elisabeth Hasselbeck, whether the group should be considered a hate group.
"Black Lives Matter Network is a group of love," the supervisor said.
Damon was recently listed on the list of entertainers, producers and media of moguls who were invited to visit the Pope to discuss the depiction of the Catholic Church in the west.
Whether he accepted the invitation or has already met the Pope is unclear.
‘American Ninja Warrior has the first winner’
The professional climber and busboy Isaac Caldiero became the first contestant to win the American Ninja Warrior on Monday to take home one million dollars.
In a competition that had just finished its seventh season, none of the contestants had managed to overcome all the obstacles on the track.
During the final of this season, two men made it to the final round, Caldiero and cameraman Geoff Britten.
The last hurdle was a 30-second climb for a more than 220-meter-long rope.
Britten graduated in the climb first, within the set limit, becoming the first contestant to surpass the debauched 4 in the American Ninja Warrior, however, overcame it by a full three seconds and won the competition.
Caldiero gave an interview for the news! News right after his hard-earned victory and it was clear that he was still in shock at the $1 million prize win.
"It's an amazing feeling, I've never made more than $10,000 a year in my life," Isaac E! said in response to his winnings.
"So suddenly . . . I can't even imagine what it's going to be like right now."
Executive producer Kent Weed gave an interview to The Hollywood Reporter about the run-up to the finale and why Britten would not receive any reward despite the fact that he became the first contestant to complete the track.
According to the rules, the money belongs to the one who completes the track the fastest.
"If more competitors take part in the track, the best time will win," said Weed.
Even if winning the main prize would change his life, Britten is happy with his performance.
"I don't think he's in forge.
He's glad he's managed to get what he's accomplished.
He received a warm welcome from fans.
He's a great guy and he likes his family.
For his children and his wife, he is a hero."
Geoff said to me, "If there was going to be someone who could have beaten me, I'm glad it was Isaac."
And I think if I had won, Isaac would have felt the same.
The America Ninja Warrior will continue with the eighth season, which will begin filming in the spring of 2016.
The Detroit Tigers only passed just past the Minnesota Twins
MINNEAPOLIS -- For the Detroit Tigers, the second half of the season was not exactly a walk in the park.
The Tigers, one of the best baseball teams, are now in the last of the central division of the American League.
They narrowly averted their defeat by the Tigers, beating Minessot a narrow 5-4 result at Target Field in Tuesday's game.
The twins missed the chance to move closer to the Houston Astros team and captivate the second wildcard in the American League.
Even for one night, for Detroit, it was the return of the word to Z, which was so elusive to them during the second half of the season.
"Working is always fun, and it doesn't matter what way," Tigger Manager Brad Ausmus said.
Tigers pitcher Alfredo Simon kept his offensive standings, and Detroit scored three times in the first two innings and then took another in the sixth and ninth inning.
Simon (13-9) allowed the opponent 6 1/3 of the hits and 3 runs.
It was his third consecutive game in his last nine games.
"I want to finish with convincing results this year," Simon said.
"It's hard to get into a match when you're often on the bench and that's why I want to get into the game properly."
Tigers' batter Victor Martinez scored three shots to make 2 runs and his first drawn point since mid-August.
It was Martinez's first three-point game since the last game in June, scoring four times in a game against the Seattle Mariners.
"He leaned into it nicely," Ausmus said.
"He looked good at practice, batted noticeably better, and managed to bring it into the match."
Thanks to three circles at the end of the seventh inning, the Twin Towers won the best chance to return to the game.
The centre-runner Byron Buxton took the shift with two points on the left side of the field.
Right-handed-in Aaron Hicks scored a point with a set-up bat, and Simon whooled Brian Dozier before being traded by left-hander Blaine Hardy.
Hardy knocked out his only opponent, Mauer, and was in front of him by batter Miguel Sano, who hit the ball and ran two bases, leaving right-handed Drew VerHagen behind.
With two players on the bases and a chance to draw in the second inning, VerHagen managed to send the third-seeded sweeper over two bases.
Plouffe has already made 27 runs through two bases this season and is reigning the league table.
Detroit held the ninth inning, Mauer scored two points off, and Bruce Rondon gave a score of 5-4 for the Tigers.
However, this right-handed one dropped San to three odds.
Detroit took the advantage to score points on Phil Hughes' game.
The Tigers acquired three orbits in the first two shifts against a retired right-handed man who came into the game after a break for a moment's break due to a back muscle inflammation.
"I certainly didn't see that start," Hughes said, "but I already felt during my third shift that I was doing better."
After resisting the onslaught in the first inning, Hughes let one point in the second to the methampire Ian Kinsler.
Two departures for the right-hand laureate J.D. Martinez was carried out by Victor Martinez, who was the first to run all the bases.
Victor Martinez broke his 0-21 streak.
Third-year-old Nick Castellanos followed him with a point on the right side of the field and scored with another cycle, but Victor Martinez was sucked in to reach third.
The Tigers added a second-inning when pitcher James McCann and fielder, Anthony Gose, scored two and, in turn, one point to give them a score of 3-0.
"That got us on our knees," said the Twin Two Manager Paul Molitor.
"He didn't hit the ball very well, but he got it in the right place."
Hughes, who won the pitch count, finished in the third inning without any points and was replaced by right-hander A.J. Achter.
Hughes ran three bases, got six hits and 4 strikes.
NOTE: Anibal Sanchez, the Tigers' right pitcher, ended the match with pain in his right shoulder.
He will be taken care of by Dr. James Andrews, who operated on Sanchez's shoulder in 2007.
Sanchez, who is on the injured list thanks to his outstretched muscles in the shoulder from mid-August, is expected to start in Wednesday's game.
Sanchez will be replaced by left-handed Daniel Norris, who will return from injury and take on the Twin Towers.
From 30. June, when Norris was traded for left pitcher David Price, he scores 1-1 after 4 games.
However, he has not yet played since August 20 because of a stretched muscle.
The Tigers and the Twin Towers will play their third match at the Target Field Stadium on Wednesday.
Norris (2-2, 4.43 ERA) will face Minnesota's left-player Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73 ERA).
Xi calls for the economy to be opened up to the wider world
It is necessary to open the economy to the wider world to boost growth, President Xi Jinping told the group, whose task is to reform the governance on Tuesday.
"China should be involved in attracting foreign investment and expertise and improving open policy-making," the central group's head of the Deepening the Overall Reform said regarding the 16th meeting.
Promoting opening up in the nascent reforms will give new impetus and vitality, and will also provide a new space for economic growth, says Xi.
The lead group adopted a number of directives, including a negative list of regulatory market access, the loosening of the border control policy, supporting state-owned enterprises (SOEs) to absorb private capital and reorganisation of the SGI system.
The statement states that a negative list will be drawn up to identify the sectors and enterprises outside the investment limits.
This system will be gradually tested and improved through test programmes.
This step is significant as it will give the market a greater role in the allocation of resources, the provision of a legal business environment and make the market more open, the statement says.
The government will also release controls on the powers it delegates to firms and make sure that the firms themselves decide how to run their business.
The statement also states that China will allow the border areas to discover new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new support mechanisms for regional growth.
In an effort to open up the state-controlled sector, more areas will be open to private investment.
"The government will not change its policy towards foreign investment and will protect the legal interests of companies that are funded from abroad and will provide them with better services," the statement reads.
In addition, it will be easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or a "green card" by optimizing the requirements and simplifying the application process.
Provision of the rights of attorneys to practise and develop professional judges and the prosecutor was also discussed at the meeting.
The meeting was also attended by Prime Minister Li Keqiang and Lecturers Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli, according to a statement issued after the meeting.
In the Karlovy Vary Region, new bed wards may be created.
According to the Deputy Governor of the Karlovy Vary Region, Jakub Pánik (ČSSD), the current capacity of bed wards of two regional hospitals and two private hospitals in the region is sufficient and partial adjustments should be made on the basis of an agreement between departments of individual hospitals.
In the region, however, there are also possibilities of expanding care.
For example, in the surgical department departments, there could be centers of one-day surgery, where surgical procedures would be performed according to the set concept, which do not require more than 24 hours of hospitalization.
In which specific hospitals should be workplaces focused on one-day surgery is not yet clear.
The skin department of the Karlovy Vary Hospital could in turn create a laser center with the possibility of using laser technology for skin disease.
The concept also recommended the creation of an apalic center to take care of patients with a braingenital condition who are in a vegetative state.
Such a centre should be set up centrally and be an integral part of the anaesthetic and resuscitation department.
There is also the possibility of concentrating such a facility in the Ostrov hospital, where such care already exists.
Another bed capacity that appears to be insufficient in the Karlovy Vary Region is the after-care bed and especially the bedbeds of the Long-Term Patients' Treatment (LDN), whose capacity in Nejdek is insufficient and, above all, should closely connect to acute care beds.
Part of this facility should act as rehabilitation beds and part as a classic LDN bed, the concept recommends.
As he points out, the aftercare beds are mainly absent from the hospital in Karlovy Vary.
There, you could use the abandoned buildings after centralization.
Last but not least in the Karlovy Vary Region, there are no social health beds with a focus on the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
These beds are in short supply throughout the country, so it could also serve for other regions as the so-called Alzheimercentrum.
Hospitals should also prepare for the introduction of so-called follow-up beds, for which European subsidies will be mobilised.
"These are beds that will follow the subjects of supespecialized care and will form a space for translating patients after the procedure, for example, after a cardiac surgery, neurosurgery, transplantation or other procedure," the regional concept of bed care describes.
New services could also be offered in the area of psychiatric care.
