The 28-year-old chef found dead in a store in San Francisco
The 28-year-old chef, who recently moved to San Francisco, was the steps of a local store this week.
But the victim's brother says he can't think of who would hurt him, adding, "He's finally started doing well."
The body found at the Westfield Mall on Wednesday morning was identified as a 28-year-old San Francisco resident, Frank Galicia, the medical examiner's office said.
San Francisco's police department said it was a violent death and an investigation was underway.
The victim's brother, Louis Galicia, told ABC KGO in San Francisco that Frank, who was formerly a regular chef in Boston, had received his dream job as a chef at the Sons & Daughters restaurant six months ago.
A spokesman for the Sons & Daughters restaurant said they were "shavered and destroyed" by his death.
"We have a small team that works as a closely connected family. We will miss him very much," the spokesman said.
In this difficult time, our thoughts and sorrows belong to the Frank family and friends.
Louis Galicia said that Frank was first sleeping in the dormitories, but that he had recently "fine at last."
“He found an apartment, he's been dating a girl,” Louis Galicia said to KGO.
Louis Galicia said he couldn't think of who would want to hurt his younger brother.
He had a kind soul and a big heart.
When he wanted to get in touch with his family, he always cooked us a meal, made us dinner," Louis Galicia said.
He never wanted to be in any argument.
It was a brother who took things for the way things are.
"Even if everything else in the world was wrong, he was an unbroken diamond that he lit up every day," he said.

Czech Railways has invested over 31 billion in vehicle modernisation.
They have air conditioning and new toilets.
In the last six years, the state carrier has invested over CZK 31 billion in the modernization of vehicles.
A third of the cars are currently equipped with air conditioning, with about half of the trains having a new system of closed toilets.
However, the amounts for the modernisation in individual years, with the exception of 2012, are gradually decreasing.
In the last six years, Czech Railways has invested over CZK 31 billion in vehicle modernisation.
A third of the cars are currently equipped with air conditioning, with about half of the trains having a new system of closed toilets.
The money spent was reflected in a reduction in the average age of two years for locomotives and separate units and six years for classic carriages.
A larger share of the investment was given to the carrier in regional transport, where roughly 60 percent of the money was directed, and 40 percent was invested by the company in the renewal of long-distance vehicles.
The average age of locomotives and units is currently 19 years.
However, the upgraded older vehicles are counted as brand new in this indicator.
If vehicle upgrades were not counted, the average age of the driving drivers of ČD would increase by ten years.
On average, the passenger cars are slightly older, with an average age accounting for upgrades being set at 23.
If only the age from the date of manufacture was taken into account, the average age of these vehicles would be 33.4 years.
However, classic sets made up of carriages and pulled by a locomotive have gradually disappeared from the Czech and global railways in recent years and are being replaced by motorised or electric units.
Between 2011 and 2015, locomotives fell from 280 to 223 pieces, and the number of classic carriages fell from 2716 in 2011 to 2132 in the middle of this year.
The carrier was particularly disposing of old vehicles equipped with leatherette seats and doors without the possibility of blocking the opening while driving.
From January to July, the carrier had 110 of these cars scrapped.
From the investments planned for the vehicle fleet by ČD in the near future, it is possible to mention, for example, the purchase of 50 carriages for speeds up to 200 kilometres per hour, which the carrier plans to deploy on the international line Praha - Bratislava - Budapest, or a framework contract for the purchase of electric units for domestic fast tracks.
The contract provides for the collection of up to 30 motor and 20 pieces of electric units.
The authorities have known for a quarter of the year about the illegal ad, they can't get rid of it.
We are utterly helpless, they admit.
For a quarter of a year, the editors of the online daily Aktuálně.cz have been following the story of a billboard in South Bohemia, which now attracts motorists to visit Lipno, where not only is a tourist-interesting walk in the treetops, but also the Olympic Park.
The highway managers know they're standing there black, but say they can't do anything about it.
There are hundreds, perhaps thousands, of such ads across the country.
According to officials, the guilt is to blame for the poor law, which makes it impossible to remove the illegal mobile billboards immediately.
What is needed first is a complex bureaucratic wheel.
In the meantime, however, the company changes its name and the bureau is short on it.
Or just move the ad a few meters away and the official process has to start over.
The Road and Motorway Directorate admitted a quarter of a year ago: an online advertising bill on the ground against the main road from České Budějovice to Lipno is on our land by the state road.
But even three months were not enough for the officials to get rid of an unauthorized portable design with a giant ad poster.
It was as if no one minded that he was standing just next to the road, in a 50-meter protection zone where safety was not allowed to stand.
Road managers say they can't easily cope with the billboard because of the leaky law.
Maybe load him up and take him away.
"We can't afford that," says Road and Motorway Directorate spokesperson Nina Ledvinová, referring to the complex bureaucratic wheel that the removal of the billboard must precede under the law.
The case of this particular billboard, the fate of which began to be followed in detail by the online daily Aktuálně.cz in the spring, is not unique and points to a general problem that the state and authorities cannot deal with effectively and quickly.
In South Bohemia alone, the paper counted dozens of similar mobile advertisements placed against the rules just next to or near the road.
So are the other counties.
"We have difficulty for companies to take out the banners," confirms the head of the transport department of the České Budějovice Regional Authority, Jiří Klása, whose colleagues are dealing with similar stories.
According to Klása, the leaky law that binds officials to blame.
First, he has to approach the billboard owners in a difficult way to get the ad out.
But company executives are often elusive or know the trick that Aktuálně.cz has described in the past when it became more interested in the issue: just move the mobile ad stand a few meters, and officials can throw the previous call to remove black advertising.
That's because the bureau has to pinpoint exactly where the illegal billboard stands.
"If someone moves it and the coordinates suddenly disagree, it is viewed as a new facility and we have to reach out to the owner again," explains Jiří Klása.
The new law won't help.
A new law could have brought about the change, banning billboards on motorways from September next year and restricting them at Class I roads.
Critics point out that the rules for tackling illegal and readily transferable ads will remain the same as before.
And the authorities don't get so relieved.
Companies can thus continue to earn tens to hundreds of millions of crowns a year from rentals of illegal areas, and no one can access them.
For example, a billboard attracting Lipno to feature Commerz Billboard.
Officials know it well: the České Budějovice Municipality is currently conducting three administrative proceedings with it for black-built billboards.
The company faces a 300,000 fine in each proceeding.
These are multiple advertisements that were placed in the protection zone of the class I road without permission.
The proceedings are not yet completed, says Jaroslav Mráz, head of the Transport Department of the České Budějovice Municipality.
The advertisement, which Aktuálně.cz is of interest to Aktuálně.cz, is not yet among these cases, but will most likely be added to them soon.
According to the RMD spokeswoman Nina Ledvinová, the company did not respond to repeated written calls for removal, and the case would be on the table of the county and then probably the Municipal Officials.
Commerz Billboard is one of those suspicious firms that can't be contacted.
It does not take the post office and cancelled the official headquarters in Žižkov more than six years ago.
It's not even clear who's behind it.
In the past, the company's post office went to the South Bohemian entrepreneur Anton Fischer, who was famous for his sharp dispute with the head of the Czech representation of the Hyundai brand.
However, Fischer, whose Euro Billboard leases the premises from the Comerz Billboard and offers them to advertisers, has in the past rejected any link.
At the same time, at the instigation of Aktuálně.cz, this spring, when the RMD began taking an interest in the Lipno advertisement, Fischer had a letter sent to the mysterious company Commerz Billboard to his guesthouse, where the company is believed to be based.
This address, however, has not been heard from the highway managers to this day.
Futile fight.
Such silence or opaque changes to settlements are not uncommon.
We gradually fined one company a few years ago for two million crowns.
But she changed the name and ID and there was nothing to deal with.
The bailiff returned the case, the ads kept standing, perhaps in other places.
We are quite powerless against such firms and their business practices.
It is like fighting windmills, one of the officials admits on condition of anonymity.
The amendment is not yet being addressed by the law in this regard.
Aktuálně.cz spoke to several MPs who were intrigued by the problem.
So far, however, they have not developed any activity.
On the contrary, there were MPs who wanted to extend the deadline for keeping the billboards for the main Czech roads.
The government rejected it.
Billboards are not only for national but also regional and municipal politicians with a very sensitive and somewhat schizophrenic theme.
On the one hand, they know about the social demand for their restrictions; on the other, they need them themselves to advertise in the election campaigns.
I don't take the rather established impression that if something doesn't work, you need to change the laws.
Farmers will harvest less grain this year, but more rapeseed and poppy seeds, the statisticians estimate.
According to estimates by the Czech Statistical Office, the cereal harvest will be 6.7 percent lower this year than last year.
Yet this year's crop is above the average for the last five and a decade.
On the other hand, rapeseed harvests (3.9 percent) and poppy seeds (2.5 percent) will be higher.
Grain harvesting will be 6.7 percent lower this year than last year.
Farmers will harvest 7.2 million tonnes of grain.
This is the result of an estimate that is based on the 15th. July published by the Czech Statistical Office.
The initial estimate a month ago was more pessimistic and projected a one-tenth drop from last year.
Last year's cereal harvest, however, was above average.
This year's crop is above the average over the last five or ten years.
On the contrary, the harvest of rapeseed and poppy will be higher this year.
Rape growers will harvest 3.9 percent more than a year ago, when they got 1.256 million tonnes under the roof.
This year's poppy crop could be 2.5 percent higher than last year's.
The projected decrease in cereal production is due to both a 3.7 per cent reduction in the hectare yield to 5.71 tonnes per hectare and a decrease in the sowing area.
Farmers have sowed three percent fewer fields this year.
The winter wheat, which is the most important cereal for the Czech Republic, will be up 3.3 percent less this year, according to an estimate.
The farmers planted it in more fields.
But the decline will be hit by a lower hectare yield, which will fall to 6.04 tonnes.
The statisticians predict a decrease in the spring barley, which is most commonly used to make beer.
The reduction in the crop is due to a reduction in the crop area by 15.2 per cent, but also a lower hectare yield.
The winter barley, on the other hand, is 6.3 percent higher.
The harvest will also increase in the rye.
Rape crop is estimated by statisticians at 1.305 million tonnes, which is more than last year.
The sowing area has expanded by 7.3 percent.
But the hecera yield will be 3.2 percent lower than last year.
This year's rapeseed crop will exceed a ten-year average of 13.3 per cent, while sowing is a third more extensive on the area than it was a decade ago.
In the last four years, there has also been more poppy-seed fields.
This year, farmers planted it on 35,543 hectares.
But compared to 2008, when poppy was grown on a record 70,000 hectares in the Czech Republic, the fields are half.
Thanks to the expansion of the sowing areas, this year's poppy harvest will be richer.
It will rise 2.5 percent against last year to 27,423 tonnes.
But the hecera yield will be 6.1 percent lower.
Olomouc police officers charged two men for the knife and machete attack, and the court remanded them in custody.
Police have charged two attackers who attacked a 35-year-old man with a knife and a machete on Tuesday in the centre of Olomouc.
"Although the attacker tried to escape, they caused a cut and cut injury, which required treatment at the hospital and further treatment," police spokesperson Marie Štrbáková said.
The two apparent perpetrators were apprehended immediately after the attack by police officers.
The prosecutor filed a motion with the court to remand them in custody and the court granted it on Friday.
Both men face between three and ten years in prison.
Officers charged two detainees with assaulting a 35-year-old man in the centre of Olomouc with a knife and a machete.
The attackers caused him with schievous and cuts, and the man ended up in the hospital.
The attack was preceded by an incident between two groups of people, which happened at high noon on Tuesday at the Liberty avenue, police said.
The perpetrators ended up in custody, Olomouc police spokeswoman Marie Štrbáková reported.
A mass scuffle between two families took place in the area of the garden in front of the Tratorie bar in the immediate vicinity of the centre of Olomouc.
After an aggressive verbal dispute, two attackers attacked a 35-year-old man with a knife and a machete.
Despite the assaulted man trying to escape, he was injured in a cut and cut injury, which required hospital treatment and other treatment, a police spokeswoman said.
The scuffle, which attracted a lot of attention in the city centre, and for which several police patrols and officers had to intervene at the scene, it was a family dispute.
Forensics charged a 34-year-old man from Slovakia and a 37-year-old man from Olomouc with attempted grievous bodily harm and disorderly conduct.
The prosecutor filed a motion with the court to take them into custody and the court granted it on Friday, the spokesperson added.
The machete was also used in a mass brawl in the centre of Olomouc in a mass brawl five years ago, it happened then only a few tens of meters further, in front of the disco of Varna in Riegrova Street.
Officers said at the time that a group of around ten foreigners carrying weapons attacked the guests of the establishment who were standing in front of the entrance.
Police said they had knives, canes and machetes in their hands.
The court then sentenced the two attacking foreigners to a suspended sentence.
Abandoned and empty houses in the centre of Prague.
You'll be surprised, you may walk around them every day.
One of the most glaring examples of an unused and empty house is the sprawling building of the former IPB residence in the middle of Senovážné Square.
It should have operated as a hotel a long time ago.
But still nothing.
That you need to build new and new apartments and offices in the metropolis?
What about using the existing, often architecturally valuable and protected?
Directly in the centre of Prague in the immediate vicinity of Wenceslas Square there are several apartment buildings which, despite their location, size and often monument protection, are only fainted and empty.
We chose the properties in the centre using the project Prázdnédomy.cz, which maps long-term empty properties in the Czech Republic.
Houses are usually the victims of the financial problems of their owners, opaque relationships between companies, or a state that does not or does not want to get rid of them.
There are more empty houses in the Czech Republic than the homeless.
Let the owners pay a special tax for them, the initiative wants

Mr and Mrs Clinton earned $10.6 million last year.
Trump refuses to release his tax return.
Hillary Clinton and her husband, ex-President Bill Clinton, made $10.6 million last year.
More than $1 million was donated to the Clinton charity.
Most of the Clinton's - over $6 million - is for their speeches.
Trump refuses to publish his tax returns.
US Democrat presidential nominee Hillary Clinton released her tax statements on Friday, increasing the pressure on her Republican opponent, Donald Trump, to do the same.
Hillary Clinton and her husband, ex-President Bill Clinton, made $10.6 million last year, the AP reported.
Most of the Clintons' income - over $6 million - is for their speeches, largely from before April 2015, when Clinton launched her election campaign.
The tax report showed that Mr and Mrs Clinton paid the federal income tax of 34.2 percent last year, as well as nine percent of income tax at the state and local level.
In total, they paid 43.2 percent of income in taxes.
But Trump has a problem with a similar move, and has not yet decided to release his tax return.
There is a possibility that Donald Trump pays no taxes at all, Clinton tweeted a few minutes after the release of her confession.
Clinton has repeatedly returned to secrecy over Trump's income, among other things to raise doubts as to whether her opponent is really as rich as she claims, the AP reported.
Trump's fortune is estimated to be worth billions of dollars.
Lower earnings would damage the Republican nominee's reputation as a successful businessman.
Senator Tim Kaine, who is running for vice-presidency in tandem with the former First Lady, today released a report on his tax levies for the past decade.
He and his wife, Anne Holton, gave 7.5 percent of their earnings to charity and paid 25.6 percent of their earnings in taxes last year.
In Nigeria, polio broke out again.
The Islamists of Boko Haram prevented a consistent vaccination and killed the doctor.
In Nigeria, cases of polio have re-frequired.
In the northeast of the country, the government there declared an extraordinary vaccination, as two children infected with the disease were paralyzed.
The vaccines were flown by helicopters.
In the affected area, Islamist Boko Haram terrorists resisted the vaccination and even killed doctors.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the virus circulated there undetected.
In northeast Nigeria, extra an polio children will begin vaccination because two children infected with the disease have paralyzed there.
In Africa, polio was last diagnosed two years ago in Somalia.
The Nigerian government has announced that a million children will be inoculated in the state of Borno and another four million in the surrounding states.
On Friday, the AP reported that Nigerian military helicopters quickly delivered vaccines against polio to the affected northeastern part of the country, where Islamist terrorists from Boko Haram are active.
The World Health Organization (WHO) said the virus had been circulating in the area unnoticed for many years.
Boko Haram extremists have defended vaccinations in the past and even killed doctors.
Their attacks also made it impossible on Thursday for doctors to reach areas where children with polio were identified.
The two affected toddlers came with refugees from part of Nigeria newly freed from Boko Haram.
The WHO section director responsible for eradicating polio, Michel Zaffran, told the BBC that vaccination in Nigeria would begin as early as next week.
The Islamic radical group Boko Haram has long been active in Borno state.
The area was not made available to international organisations and the government until earlier this year, when Boko Haram was able to weaken in a major way in that part of the country.
Nigerian Health Minister Isaac Adewole has admitted that new cases of polio are a major disappointment for the country, as Nigeria wanted to report next year that polio had been eradicated in it.
The WHO pointed out that it was possible that although the disease had not appeared for two years, it was still spreading among the children.
Children under the age of five will now be vaccinated.
In 2012, Nigeria accounted for half of all polio cases in the world.
While polio was still in 125 countries in 1988, it now persists in only three areas - Afghanistan and Pakistan and the north of Nigeria.
The Pope met former prostitutes in Rome.
He listened to the troubled stories of the fallen women.
Pope Francis met with 20 former prostitutes who were leaked from a shepherd's gang thanks to the police.
The Pope listened to their difficult life stories and urged them to look with confidence to the future.
With this meeting, Francis wanted to draw attention to human trafficking and call for an intensification of the fight against him.
Pope Francis met in Rome with 20 former prostitutes who were freed from the power of a pimp gang by the police.
The head of the Catholic Church listened to the troubled stories of the fallen women for more than an hour and subsequently urged them to look confidently to the future, a Vatican spokesman said.
Among the former prostitutes visited by Francis were six women from Romania, four from Albania, seven from Nigeria and one each from Tunisia, Italy and Ukraine.
Their average age is around 30.
All of them, according to the Vatican, were subjected to severe physical violence during forced prostitution.
By the visit, Francis wanted to draw attention to human trafficking and call for an intensification of the fight against him, the Pope's spokesman said.
Francis often draws attention to the fates of people on the margins of society.
On Thursday, for example, he had lunch with Syrian refugees who arrived at the Vatican in April this year and in June on his personal invitation.
France will strike at the Jihadi production plants.
But without the help of Muslims, it will not be possible.
France is to be helped by the Muslims themselves in the fight against radical Islamism.
In addition, Prime Minister Manuel Valls's government is making major changes to the functioning of the mosques and the education of clerics.
Since last December, we have closed 20 mosques and prayers.
Others will follow, the Interior Minister announced.
There are over a hundred Jihadist producers in the country.
"If Muslims do not help the state in the fight against those who violate public freedom, it will be increasingly difficult for France to guarantee freedom of this religion," said Prime Minister Manuel Valls.
In particular, it intends to ensure that only imams who were educated in the mosques and prayer hallways in mosques.
At the same time, it wants to stop funding for mosques from abroad.
At the moment, about 20 percent of the money is coming from abroad for the construction of new mosques, most from Morocco, Algeria and the Gulf countries.
This, too, is then brought to the mosques by preachers who can sow radicalism in France.
"Our country must show that Islam is compatible with democracy," the prime minister added.
The key to ensuring that these goals is met will be the new French Islamic Foundation.
It should act as a bridge between the secular state and the Muslim minority.
No more money from abroad.
The country is now the country's French Foundation for Islam, founded in 2005 by then Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin.
Even then, the foundation was supposed to contribute to making the financial flows between the mosques and the countries that finance their construction.
But the institution was soon hit by internal divisions and rivalries.
"It's a total failure," Valls said recently.
On the French political scene, after the attack on Charlie Hebdo magazine in January 2015, a debate about a new institution to replace the dysfunctional foundation erred.
All were hastened by further terrorist attacks in France carried out in the name of the Islamic State by radicalised Islamists.
French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve recently let it be known that a new foundation will be established in October this year.
It will have two main challenges - to secure the funding of mosques from indigenous sources, as well as to oversee imams.
It is not yet clear where he will take the money not only to build new mosques, but also to various educational centres.
But several proposals are being considered.
One is a special charge or a tax on halal food.
This would be paid for in practice by the sellers of halal food, for providing certification.
Some of that money would then go to the foundation's coffers.
The allowance of ten to twenty euros ($270 to 540) could then be paid by the French pilgrims who go to Mecca.
Every year, about 30,000 go there on the traditional pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia.
And not only that.
According to the prime minister, in the future only preachers who have passed through special education programmes at French universities should be active in the mosques.
This should ensure that the sermon is in line with democracy.
Radical mosques will be closed.
The French government is also in a campaign against the militants.
Others will follow, the Home Secretary announced recently.
There is no place for those who preach hatred in the mosques and do not respect some of the principles of our country, such as equality between women and men.
The country is estimated to have about 2,500 mosques and prayers.
It is estimated that about 120 of them are under the influence of radical Islamism.
Since 2012, the authorities have expelled some 80 imams, and for several dozen more, they are considering it.
But not everyone thinks that the government's actions can significantly crack down on radicalism.
Those who want to be radicalised will do the same.
This is not the case in mosques, young people are becoming radicalised online, said Severine Labat, an expert at the National Center for Scientific Research.
Traitor Kelemen lost in the first round of the sprint to the star Baugém.
The Czech track cyclist must fight for the last eight in the nominal.
The drafeldest cyclist Pavel Kelemen lost the first round in the defending sprint to the top 18 after advancing to the Olympic Games in the first round with French great Grégory Baugé, the defending silver champion from the previous games in London.
He must fight for the last eight in the final rounds.
There were 27 riders at the start of the royal discipline on the course and the best Czech trackmaster of the day was the 14th best time.
He made the 200 with a flying start in 9.969 seconds.
In the main knockout stage, he was expected to be in qualifying for fifth-placed Baugé, who already has bronze in the team sprint from Rio.
Although Kelemen drew on the experienced Frenchman in the end, he kept an eye on the progress.
A brilliant performance was flashed by the defending gold champion, Jason Kenny.
The 28-year-old Briton finished the third fastest 200 in history and won the qualification in an Olympic record of 9.551.
He then easily, as expected, also dealt with the last advancers, the German Maximilian Levy.
The British quartet also flourished in the line-up with Bradley Wiggins, who set a new world record of 3:50.570 in the 4 km pursuit and advanced to the final.
The previous best (3:51.659), which was the British for four years since the London Olympics, improved by more than a second.
Young doctors push: They want fresh wind in the industry
Representatives of the young doctors were gathered to approve the new steps in their dispute over the new contract.
The Council of Junior Physicians (JDC) at the British Medical Association (BMA) must seek the full council to support further disciplinary action in early September.
JDC says ministers have failed to resolve the issues regarding the treaty.
In July, young doctors and medical students voted to reject a contract agreed with the BMA.
58% of its members who participated in the election were rejected.
In a letter to members posted on Twitter on Thursday night, JDC President Ellen McCourt said the government had remained "quietly" on the issues, which is very much to dismiss the contract.
She said: "In this light, the executive branch of JDC voted to reject the proposed new treaty in its entirety and request new formal negotiations on all matters."
In a response to the government's silence, the Executive Board of the JDC formally requested a special meeting of the BMA board to approve a running programme of heated trade events in early September.
The dispute led the young physicians to be announced this year to six strikes, including the first general strikes in the NHS history.
Leader of the junior doctors at BMA, Dr. Johann Malawana, resigned following a decision to reject the agreed terms of the contract recommended by the BMA.
He told the BMA members at the pre-vote meetings in front of 54,000 young doctors and medical students that the agreement was good and should be accepted.
After the vote, the health minister said the treaty would be a burden for medics in England.
Russia and Turkey: an alliance of the "incompatible"?
It was a gesture that ended in a crisis.
Leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to shake hands and announce a formal end to the eight-month war of war of long, the war of war and economic sanctions.
But while Vladimir Putin welcomed the Turkish counterparty to the sumptuous hall of the palace in St. Petersburg, I had the impression that Ankara wanted more of this reconciliation.
There were hands on, yes.
But Putin did not smile, and he was hardly radiating warmth, even by his measured standards.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, has repeatedly spoken of his "dear friend" to Mr. Putin - five times, as one of the reports says.
I didn't count.
He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their pre-crisis levels, but would be even better.
The next day, one of the local newspapers wrote that Erdogan had acted as if nothing bad had ever happened.
To me, his enthusiasm betrayed the exact opposite.
But the lingering chill that emanated from Putin showed that the Russian leader had forgotten nothing.
The real cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his opening statement: the shooting down of a Russian fighter jet by Turkey on the Syrian border.
Moscow's response at the time was furious.
Putin was blowing around him, accusing Ankara of crashing a knife in the back of Moscow.
The outrage was all the greater because it came from a supposed friend.
Rebuilding real trust will be difficult, perhaps even impossible.
Russian public opinion has also changed since December.
The state-controlled media have run a massive nationwide campaign against Ankara for months.
Suddenly it was as if the Turks were to blame.
More serious was the accusations from top state officials that Erdogan's own family had benefited from the illegal oil trade in parts of Syria controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He strongly denied this.
But in St. Petersburg came the official message that it was time to move on.
After all, this meeting was only because Putin received an apology he had asked for from President Erdogan.
Russia could have declared some victory to be won.
For Ankara, the benefits of declaring a truce are clear.
In the first place, Erdogan was almost stripped of power during the failed coup last month and therefore needs all his friends.
The repeated terrorist attacks in Turkey have visibly shaken him as well.
There is also an economic motive.
Russia's sanctions have had a harsh impact - mainly the cancellation of charter flights, which are transported by several million Russian tourists to the coast of Turkey each year.
This number has decreased by almost 90%.
As for Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be relieved here when flights are resumed.
They make money from the Mediterranean tourism at the end of the season.
Even this week, state television promised cheaper fruit and vegetables when imports of agricultural commodities from Turkish are again allowed.
"Tourists there, tomatoes back here," as the news in the Vedemosti newspaper reported.
But the visit had further political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry with the West for what it sees as a feeble response to the coup attempt.
In addition, the long-running animosity of lengthy EU accession talks and the accession of Putin - eager to take advantage of the cooling and break Turkey's ties with the West.
The Russian leader certainly scored bonus points when Ankara asked him to help the elected authorities after the coup attempt.
You must understand that for Moscow, which has a deep-rooted fear of regime change, it is a given.
So the summit in this pompous, seaside palace to Russia and Turkey allowed you to demonstrate what one of the analysts described to me as the "universal of the incompatible": how the forces of two countries that feel rejected and used by the West are joining forces.
However, despite publicly showing reconciliation between them, there are fundamental differences between the two countries.
The first is Syria, where Moscow recently stood as a peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey stand on opposite sides.
You could say that after nearly three hours of initial interviews, the two presidents said at a press conference that they had not even mentioned the issue.
The Turkish president deliberately avoided answering a question about the differences between them, while Putin decided to highlight these differences.
There is no clear agreement on the basis of which both states can find common ground on the issue of Syria.
But after months of open hostility - and given the risk of a complete disaster when a NATO member Turkey shot down a Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better that the two leaders are at least talking to each other again.
Royal Bank of Scotland disappears for customers outside Scotland
According to the bank's managing director, the RBS brand is to be quashed to the role of the back office.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be lost to customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was linked to the bank's global ambitions.
It eased off them when it almost disappeared eight years ago and had to be redeemed from debt.
At the time, the strategic brands used "RBS" to protect other consumer finance brands.
It was backed by millions of pounds for sponsoring international sport, from the Rage championship of the Six Nations to the champion of Winbledom Andy Marray.
But it has now been decided that it is better to give more prominence to national brands.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be used with Scottish customers, but will not launch new stores.
All references to RBS in England and Wales, with the exception of headquarters and stock market coding, will be changed to NatWest.
For customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, the Ulster Bank brand is already in use.
There are other, smaller private banking brands that come to the fore more - Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond, and Holt's Military Bank.
During his travels to our customers and employees at Inverness-shire, McEwan answered Ross McEwan's questions.
He told the BBC Scotland: 'The RBS brand will cease to be our investor brand and the brand our employees work for, because we are becoming a bank of brands much more now.'
As the bank itself became a global brand, it also became a global brand for RBS.
Now I say that we no longer have global aspirations, we have efforts to play the domestic scene.
Each of these brands will mean something completely different in their own communities and our workers will work under these brands.
RBS has already said it will not continue its sponsorship of the Six Nations Championships, preparing the profile of individual sports sponsorship brands.
"Is it a good time for us to move on to the brand's bank, because the basic question (which we ask) is how to focus on becoming a better bank for customers?" said the CEO.
Three years ago, it would have been very cynical if we had said that we would become a great bank for customers and introduce the brands.
But along with the way we focused on the needs of the customers and not our own, I think there are a lot of changes.
We can recall these brands, I think the time has come.
Frankie Dettori in Newmarket horse-riding Predilection leads 3000th winner
Dettori sprays champagne after double victory in Newmarket earned him 3,000 victories
Jockey Frankie Dettori secured his 3000th victory in Britain in Newmarket on Friday.
He achieved this milestone with his second victory of the night on his local track - the horse Predilection, coached by John Gosden.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to achieve such a result in the flat races.
His predecessors are Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson.
The three-time chorus of Dettori, who had previously won on a horse by Ghayyar, said, "It's strange."
I'm very touched because my family is here too
I am extremely glad that this happened in Newmarket, because this is where I docked 30 years ago.
It's not a huge event, it's not the Royal Ascot - it's Friday night on the floor with 20,000 people.
I'm relieved and I'm very grateful.
Dettori collects congratulations when he brings Predelillaction after victory
Two jockeys reached this milestone in the hurdleship - champion jockey Richard Johnson and 20-time retired champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who has taken more than 4,300 winners to the finish line during his career breaking records.
Lester Piggott, nine-time Derby winner, 4,493 career winners
Frankie is one of the best jogglers of the modern age and it is not surprising that he has reached the milestone, which was reached by only a few riders before him.
He is stylish and strong, but it is his tactical fištrón that sets him apart from the other riders in the weighing ladder.
He is a fantastic ambassador for the race, his enthusiasm and charisma attracted fans to this sport for years.
A few weeks ago, I told Frankie in Epsom that if he had not only ridden on weekends and big races, he would have already had 6,000 winners!
But the truth is that Frankie rode the winner in the UK for the better part of his 30-year career, and that's really something.
He has a vivid nature, which is good for the British racing sport. But more importantly, he's an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated his success with his famous fleeting jump
From the summer finishes to the fleeting jumps - Frankie Dettori was the delivery boy of the British flat-rate races for two decades.
It was like a roller coaster ride.
An uninterrupted number of winners of the big races, including his well-known "great-eyed sevens" in Ascot. But he also survived the plane crash and was banned from taking off for drugs.
He stagnated for the first time three years ago when he returned after a 6-month launch ban, but he showed incredible inner strength and returned to all the doubters in best shape in spite of him.
And perhaps not for the last time - Dettori has previously stated that he would like to continue racing until at least 50.
Russian President Putin Releases Presidential Office Chief Sergey Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin abruptly fired Sergei Ivanov from the post of president's office as head of the presidential office on Friday.
Ivanov has been one of Putin's closest associates for many years.
The 63-year-old Ivanov was appointed special representative for ecology and transport.
A statement from the Kremlin said that Putin "relisted to Ivanov from his service as head of the Russian presidential office," but no reason was given.
His place will be taken over by Anton Vajno, who had been Ivanova's deputy since 2012.
Vajno, 44, was previously a diplomat.
Born in the capital of Estonia, Tallinn, in 1972, graduated from the prestigious State Institute of International Relations in Moscow (MGIMO) and worked at the embassy in Tokiya.
The website (in Russian) states that he later served as head of the presidential protocol and the presidential office.
When he appointed Putin, he said, "Thank you for your confidence."
I believe that the most important role of the administration is to support your activities as the Head of State's activities in the sense of draft laws and the control of the extent to which your guidelines are respected.
Putin told the Russian television station on Friday that Ivanov had asked him to be relieved of the post and recommended that Vajno replace him.
Convincing smiles?
This move has completely mystified Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov was one of Vladimir Putin's closest associates for the long time, and like Putin, he worked for the KGB.
As head of the presidential office, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin broadcast on state television, both men said they were leaving the presidential office's post at their own request.
But the smiles for the cameras convinced only a few people - most importantly now, just before the parliamentary elections.
So is this a result of some power struggle?
No one knows yet.
But the official claim that the man who was once thought of as a possible president is suddenly eager to pursue Russia's environmental policies has been met with a lot of mistrust.
The Kremlin's website quotes remarks made to Putin, in which Ivanov states: "It is true that in 2012, in an interview I asked you to give me four years for this very demanding post, you might say the problematic post.
Apparently, I was head of the presidential office for four years and eight months.
Ivanov took up the post in December 2011.
He previously served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and, before, like Putin, worked for the State Security Committee (KGB).
In the late 1990s, when Putin was in charge of the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation (FSB), which replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed as his deputy.
When Putin came to power, he appointed Ivanov to one of his five closest associates.
Indeed, it was speculated at the time that Ivanov might succeed Putin at the head of state after his second term, because the third term would be unconstitutional for Putin.
But this post was taken over by another close associate of Putin's associate, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became prime minister just three and a half years later before returning to the presidency.
Thomas Gibson, star of The Ideas of the Criminal, was released after being hit by the director
Gibson was involved in a physical exchange of views on the scene in Los Angeles last month.
The ABC and CBS television stations, which produce the series, announced his release in a joint statement.
Gibson, who played Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, apologized on Thursday before announcing his firing.
There were creative differences in the scene and disagreements.
I'm sorry that this happened," he said in a statement.
According to a statement from ABC and CBS, the details of how the character of Gibson disappears from the series, which follows the stories of the FBI's team of a team of FBI agents, is a little later.
The 54-year-old actor, made famous for his role in the sitcom Dharma and Greg, has starred in the series since the first season in 2005.
"I love the Thoughts of the Criminal, and over the last twelve years I have given my heart and soul to them," Gibson said in his statement issued Friday.
I was hoping to be in it until the end. But that will not be possible now.
I would like to express my thanks to the authors, the producers, the actors, our amazing team and, above all, the great fans that this show has ever been hoping for.
The series is expected to return to the 12th series on September 28.
In the town of Banff, fish mysteriously landed in the garden
A man from the town of Banff asked for help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden.
Kevin Bain believes that 75 fish may be the sand eel left behind by the water storm.
Bain, who lives about 500 metres from the sea, posted a short film of his find on the Periscope Canal, believing that someone might help him explain how the 5-centimetre fish got into his garden.
Queensferry Crossing: The bridge now connects with Fife
£1.35bn project to be completed by May 2017
The engineers have connected the northern platform and the Queensferry Crossing and the viaduct - so the bridge now connects with Fife.
It is therefore the first of the four caps between the "siders of the platform" which are now almost completed around each of the three pylons of the bridge.
Part of the bridge from Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tonnes.
It features 10,000 tonnes of iron and 20,000 tonnes of concrete and 46 suspension ropes.
The £1.35bn project is due to be completed by May 2017.
Economic Secretary Keith Brown visited the construction today and was among the first to come from the mainland to the bridge.
He said, "This is a historic moment and a symbolic moment of Queensferry Crossing to build.
On this project, we all see how the civil engineers used more than 30,000 tonnes of concrete and steel in an impressive scale to construct this part of the bridge.
Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the cap between the viaduct and the platform of the bridge was a delicate operation that required extraordinary accuracy.
There is now a total of more than 79% of the total area of the bridge in its place, the concrete for the last part of the platform is now being cast in Rosyth, so the whole platform is ready to be raised for the bridge.
Michael Martin, the project's leader at the Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors, said: "The first closure for the construction of each bridge is always an important milestone.
On this amazing project, this closure represents the top of the building building.
After installing the last part of the road platform and connecting it to the North Tower expansion plateau, we then had to close the last gap on the north side - towards the mainland.
We did this by crossing the northern approach viaduct 700 millimetres south.
This was a massive and, at the same time, very delicate operation.
Massive because the viaduct is 222 metres long, weighs about 6,000 tonnes and was necessary to be pulled with a climb of about 3%.
Delicatable because the tolerances the team worked with were very small - only a few millimetres in each direction.
All went very well, fortunately.
Saving in Moelfre Bay: Three men are 'happy to be alive'
The three men are "happy to be alive" after being washed away by the water from their fishing boat off Anglesey.
The Moelfre RNLI Rescue Boat Station ran the alert at 1:20 p.m. on Friday, British summer time, after the crew saw the incident at Moelfre Bay.
All three of the men tried to swim to safety as their boat continued uncontrollably.
"We saw their boat circling in their vicinity and we thought of the worst," said the cruise reder's helmsman, Moelfre Vince Jones.
"Fortunately, the strong wind blew him away from them before we left them," he added.
Two men were rescued by a local fishing boat, a third man aged 60, found without a life jacket exhausted holding on to the buoys.
All were transferred to the deck of the coast rescue and take them back to the rescue boat station
Jones said, "Three men toppling into the water are happy to be alive and unharmed.
The ship's engine had a rope to be cut off, but somehow it was disconnected from the person who was driving the boat when the boat was overturned.
Someone from above was holding a protective hand over the boys.
The judge refuses to hear the case for Tluchor's wife.
Petr Tluchoř is one of three deputies who, according to the indictment, were to receive a political tobacconist from Prime Minister Nečas and his then head of cabinet, Jana Nagy, a lucrative post for political concession.
In 2012, it was the approval of the tax package.
Šnajdr, Fuksa and Tluchoř allowed him to resign by their resignations.
Then they appeared in influential posts in state-owned companies.
That is why they also faced suspicion of a bribe and ended up in custody for a month.
According to the court, however, they were wrongfully, and they received compensation of a total of almost CZK 2 million.
Tluchoř is now a witness in the case, following the intervention of the Supreme Court.
His wife works in the courthouse on the Fruit Market and resolves civil disputes.
Yet Judge Helena Králová wants to be cautious (address criminal matters) and avoid possible objections.
The case will probably be put in charge of another Prague judicial district.
The King has twice acquitted Jana Nečas, formerly Nagy.
It was an alleged misuse of military intelligence to track the first wife of Prime Minister Nečas Radka.
In this case, Tluchoř did not feature.
According to lawyer Jaroslav Ortman, however, this is an unnecessarily overreaction.
I think that impartiality cannot be interpreted in this way to preclude a court if the witnesses have a wife or relatives in court.
I'm afraid there's nothing to judge then, he noted to the Journal.
"It seems crazy," he added.
Roman Boček, a former official, is also charged in the case of political newsagents.
According to his lawyer, Peter Toman, any objection would have a chance of success.
The District Court for Prague 1 heard 13. June the indictment of the former head of the cabinet of Prime Minister Petr Nečas, Jana Nagy (now Nečas) and other defendants in the case of abuse of Military Intelligence.
In the picture, Nečas and her husband come to court.
Tluchor was to address the statements about Peroutka.
The ex- exec's wife, for example, was to try President Miloš Zeman's remarks about the democratic pre-war journalist Ferdinand Peroutka.
Zeman said he had sympathized with Adolf Hitler.
One of the schoolgirls is already dead!
The girl appears to have been killed in an Allied air raid.
She flew to Syria, along with her two equally old girlfriends, from London's Gatwick Airport last February.
The British Home Office did not comment on the news of her death.
Young Londoners who escaped from home were secretly taken to Syria via the Turkish border, according to police.
Shamima Begum, Amira Abase and Kadiza Sultana have headed to their other former Bethnal Green Academy classmate at London, according to the media.
The case drew a huge wave of attention last year, as did tensions in relations between Britain and Turkey.
British security forces estimate that some 600 British Muslims have so far traveled to Syria, about 50 of them young women and girls.
A number of them joined the militants of IS and other groups.
Those who return home pose a terrorist threat to Britain.
Dream job for a $ 100,000 salary.
A great-paying job that you don't even need college for.
This is what the work of the IT guy looks like at first glance.
And often the other one.
The advantage is not only an extremely high salary for Czech standards (in Prague you earn up to CZK 180,000 by working in IT), but also with extreme benefits.
This is due to the huge lack of IT specialists.
Thousands of specialists are missing.
It is estimated that almost 20,000 IT specialists are missing in the Czech Republic.
The most wanted, according to statistics from the staffing agency Grafton, are programmers, developers, network engineers and application specialists.
Candidates can choose between several job offers.
So the candidates will not compete for the job, but the jobs for the candidates, comments Jitka Součková, marketing manager at Grafton Recruitment.
College is not a must.
Higher education is not a necessity for IT guys.
Higher education is a good foundation and is an overall indicator of the candidate's intelligence and education, but it often has little to do with knowledge of development.
Developers have to constantly learn new things, which will not be the schooled university once replaced, says Petr Kubačka, director of Monster Career CZ.
The most profitable is in Prague.
I.T. wages everywhere move high above the Republic average.
The most money will be spent in Prague and Brno, it is no longer such a hit parade in the regions.
"The winter conditions in Brno are comparable to those of Prague," confirms Kubačka.
The highest earnings will be achieved by the technical directors.
In Prague and Brno they can come in at 120,000 - 180,000 CZK.
In other regions, the salary is lower, but it will not fall below CZK 80,000 there either.
Also in demand are IT project managers.
When they start, they can earn CZK 60,000 - 100,000.
There is also a fight for graduates.
While in some professions graduates often have to go straight to the employment office, this is not the case with I.T.
In fact, if companies are to be poached and overcharged by an expert from another company, they are happy to reach for a graduate.
They can raise him their own.
They can't do without a language.
Knowledge of a foreign language is useful in every profession, but at least decent English is necessary for I.T.
Knowledge of at least one foreign language is a must for some IT positions.
On the other hand, we see a number of cases where companies are looking for a particularly well-educated and experienced person, and are content to do with only the average knowledge of English.
However, for example, if a support worker controls more than one's foreign language, he is of interest to his employer because it can serve more customers from different countries, adds Director Kubačka.
Yeah, in Google, there's paradise.
Only the Czech workers of the employees at Google are quietly envious.
Of course there is a flexible working hours, the possibility of working from home or various part-time work, not only for mums.
"The company provides new dads with four extra weeks of leave after the birth of the child," says Martina Jonek, a spokesperson for Google.
The covertisation also involves health care for the staff and the family, the catering, the transport, the training, the wellness or massage directly at the workplace.
Whoever wants to be educated is green and no matter what new one wants to learn.
But the benefits don't stop there.
Such a full free fridge is definitely not a bad one either.
A healthy lunch (even breakfast and dinner in some locations) are available on site every day.
In addition, there are so-called micro-kitchens in all offices, where people always find a healthy snack, the speaker reveals.
And to avoid having to throw away, as long as nothing is dreamed, he puts in boxes that the staff can take home in the evening.
And the reason for these unbelievable advantages for the Czech situation?
Create a creative and motivating environment!
"It is not important for Google that employees sit in the office for eight hours a day, but the results of initiatives or projects, a shift or development, ideas and innovative solutions," the spokesperson adds.
The UN sharply criticized Bulgaria for the criminalization of refugees.
Zeid Raad al-Hussein, the UN Human Rights Commissioner, accused Bulgaria on Thursday of systematically violating human rights by criminalising refugees.
The official strategy of the Bulgarian government "poises serious concern about Bulgaria's failure to comply with international law," warned Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein in a statement.
He pointed out that "it is particularly disturbing to witness how important and influential public figures publicly express support for the criminal armed fighters who boldly hold fairies on refugees on the border between Bulgaria and Turkey."
"One of the most serious problems is that almost all people who cross to the Bulgarian territory irregularly are automatically arrested," Zeid pointed out.
What's worse is they - they are often prosecuted and imprisoned - for a year or more - if they try to leave the country.
Their attempts to leave the country are criminalized despite the fact that everyone has the right under international law to leave any country, including their own.
Bulgaria has detained 14,000 migrants this year, with 21,000 for the same period last year.
Pokémon Go - the pursuit of health and happiness that pays off
It's fascinating to see the world change.
Many people have lamented over the last decade of the fact that teenagers and children no longer play outside, prefering to spend their free time in front of screens.
Pokémon Go lifts people from the sofa and leads them to activity.
Time spent in front of screens was originally shrouded on TV, later for video games and, most recently, smartphones.
It's great to see that technology and activities out there are no excretion.
I am, of course, talking about the fashion, which is Pokémon Go, an app based on characters that first appeared in video games in the late 1990s (later a cartoon, playing cards and more).
As with many cultural phenomena, there was a drop in interest before the launch of this new play at the beginning of July in the US, Australia and New Zealand.
The launch in other countries was then postponed due to the massive interest that led to the overload of servers.
Pokémon Go has gained more users than Tinder in a few days, and almost as many users as Twitter.
How does it work?
In short, the smartphone players go out looking for the Pokémon, which they follow with GPS, and when they find them, they can "take them" (through a screenshot on the phone) or "catch."
Mania has gripped a generation that played the game at a younger age, lifts it from its seats and drives out to find Pokémon.
In the US, thanks to this game, there has been a significant increase in the number of steps that the "average" person makes every day.
The Apple's smartwatch Cardiogram, which is watched by 35,000 users, recently told the Washington Post that within two days of the game's launch, the number of people surveyed who practiced for 30 minutes each day has jumped from 45 to 53 percent.
The company has no information about who plays Pokémon Go - sees only rough data on the exercise levels.
Many public campaigns to "found 30," "get off the couch" and "be active every day" fell to barren ground, because most of the public health messages are boring and designed for people who don't look good.
Yet the importance of exercise must not be underestimated.
Those who exercise regularly reduce the risk of cancer or depression.
Physical activity is involved in controlling weight, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that we cannot fully mention here.
But the beauty of Pokémon Go is that people go out and do something they enjoy.
You cover three pillars of health - movement, fresh air and sunlight. And fun.
Some people even make new friends in their pursuit of pokemon.
As is usually the case, of course, there are those boring patrons who are looking for any excuse to complain.
And, yes, someone could walk in the door.
So what, like?
There's a breakthrough.
In their day, smartphone apps, like Fitbit, could track our activity, but gave us no reason to do something like this game did.
The news is seen and the interest in it begins to subside at some point.
However, thanks to the success of Pokémon, other games will emerge that will combine applications and virtual reality with activity in the real world and help a number of people hunt for activity, health and a better form.

Simone Biles wins gold in multi-eight of women's gymnastics
Forget the pressure.
Forget the excitement.
Simone Biles is immune to all of this.
Dynamic to jump.
No effort on the beam.
In the floor, they all became speechless.
Excellent in everything.
And now, finally, the Olympic champion.
The 19-year-old American gymnast went straight to the title in the multi-event event on Thursday, overcoming the others at the fullest under the Olympic floodlights.
The overall result of 62.198 was clearly confirmed by her lead over the silver medalist and member of the "Final Five" team, Aly Raismanova, and Russian bronze medalist Aliya Mustafin.
Simone Biles (USA) on Thursday during a caucus appearance at the tiara in the final of the individual's multi-fighting in sports gymnastics at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
Biles became the fourth American in a row to win the multi-fight, and fifth overall, when she confirmed her reputation as the best gymnast of her generation and perhaps the best ever.
When her overall final standings were on the board and her long journey to the end of that moment, tears came on her face.
This success puts it in the same league of singular athletes of his time, such as Michael Phelps, who have added a new dimension to their sport:
Biles has dominated her sport for the past three years, winning 15 medals at the world championships - including 10 golds. Her stunning line-up is a mixture of ambition and precision, and the 1984 Olympic champion, Mary Lou Retton, called her "the best gymnast she's ever seen."
The last test awaited her in Brazil, not so between Biles and the rest of the competitors, but between her alone and the burden of too much expectation.
Anything other than a return home to his family in Spring, Texas, with a hand full of gold medals, would be seen as a disappointment.
Simone Biles (USA), on the left, and Aly Raisman are embracing the golden and silver medal in the individual women's final competition at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on Thursday.
Biles won the first one on Tuesday, when she was an exclamation point in celebration of outgoing national team coordinator Martha Karolyi.
Biles insists that she never looked forward during her long journey to the top, which is not entirely true.
Part of her lineup in the floor - the one that contains a typical triple, double-turnover, flip-fitting - is set in Latin music that would just be suitable for home, to the streets outside the Olympic arenas in Rio.
It's not a coincidence.
The girl was adopted by her grandparents as a toddler, and her talent was discovered by the coach's mother, Aimee Boorman, on her way to the gym, where Boorman was training and where she gained strength.
She has not lost the competition in the multi-event since the summer of 2013 - this is a sequence of victories that can continue as long as Biles wants.
Although Mustafinova took the lead for a short time through two spins, it was just an illusion.
Kladina and the floor - where Biles is defending the world championship - is waiting.
She went back to the lead with 15.433 points per beam - and finished with 15.933 points in the floor.
Raisman hugged her gently as she waited for the final score - a mere formality - and tears appeared around the glittering red, white, and blue shadows when the wish she had once made to her little one in her diary came true.
Raisman's performance was a bit of a payback for the Olympics four years ago, when she shared a third-place finish with Mustafin, but then she eats bronze for the sum of the top three best routines.
This time, the 22-year-old team captain the Americans call "Grandma" was way ahead.
After her floor, she sent the crowd airy kisses, conquered by a return that seemed unsteady at times.
For Biles, the post that this 19-year-old athlete posted on Twitter this week, where it has become a complete hit, has a whole new meaning:
Police: Three victims in serial killer case shot while listening to music in car
According to a police report released Thursday, two women and a girl aged 12 died during the most underperpetle attack of the decade, the case of the first serial killer in Phoenix. They were shot while sitting in the car, talking and listening to the music.
Authorities reported that Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis' daughter Maleah were shot 12 on 12 June in a car parked in the driveway.
The report states that the armed man was on the passenger's side and fired eight shots from the handgun. He then fled in another vehicle.
According to police, the robbery is not worth the triple homicide because the assailant did not take his wallets, nor the amount of $2,900 that one of the adult victims was carrying.
Phoenix Police spokesman, Sergeant Jonathan Howard said investigators were investigating whether the shooting was related to any of the previous four attacks.
In two mostly Hispanic neighborhoods, there were a total of nine attacks in four months in which seven people were killed and two other people were injured.
"It's happening in the residential area in front of the houses," Howard said earlier this month for a CBS branch of KPHO.
Police believe the suspect used several cars, including a brown Nissan in the late 1990s, a black BMW from the late '90s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
Investigators refused to reveal what evidence led them to conclude that the attacks were related and were carried out by the same killer.
Ellis (33) was taken to the hospital, where she later succumbed to her injuries.
Liner (31) and Ellis' daughter Maleah died at the scene.
The witness told police that it was not uncommon for the women to sit in a parked car and listen to music.
Authorities also released a police report on the shooting, the target of which was an empty van just half an hour before the triple murder. Police believe it was the serial killer who was the source.
Investigators found the cartridges and put a bullet from the remains of the bullets in the seat and from under the hood of the engine.
Mother of a 6-year-old child with microcephaly: ‘His condition is improving’
Edmund Picciuto, like most of the children of his age, loves to sing, toys and, of course, his mother.
But unlike his peers, he suffers from microcephaly, which is the result of a genetic disorder that his mother, Elizabeth Picciut, was unaware of during her pregnancy.
When he first came home, the first thing I thought was that I couldn't do this.
I can't do this.
I'm not ready for this.
Which is not true at all - of course you are ready for it,' she said.
She and her husband, Vincent, had learned that Edmund might never have known them and that he might not have survived.
Some doctors even suggested that he be placed in an institution.
"My first reaction was that I thought people didn't do that anymore," Picciut explains.
Edmund comes with the help of a walker.
Until the age of three, he couldn't sit or crawl. And he's still not talking.
But some landmarks are already being filled.
He's a good help and rides a bike.
He also loves to play with his two brothers and loves to sing.
Elizabeth performs a sign language with which Edmund says "please, sing to me."
"We're learning him sign language," Picciut told CBS News.
But it's not a common sign language - he says that Edmund made up some of the characters himself.
Microcephalia can arise from a number of different states: genetic, as is the case with Edmund, and after infections in pregnancy caused by viruses such as measles or Zika.
Symptoms and forecasts may differ in a substantial way.
It's too early to say what impact the Zika virus will have on the lives of the infected.
Picciut recalls the emotional tax that takes away from an uncertain future.
I keep asking, "What's next?"
What happens next?
And she's still not sure.
In fact, I never asked what the overall prognosis was, because I don't expect anyone to even tell me.
Picciut, however, has an encouraging report for the mothers of all the children who suffer from birth defects caused by the Zika virus.
The situation is improving.
Know that it will be better.
You will love your child and your child will love you.
Heavy rains and floods have been required to be rescued by salvage work in Louisiana, Mississippi
Heavy rain and massive flooding in Louisiana prompted the governor to declare an emergency on Friday. More rains are expected in the state on Saturday.
The National Weather Service (NWS) reported that after extreme downpours, a number of rivers in southeastern Louisiana and southern Mississippi would be pouring out of their banks and threatening major flooding.
Louisiana Governor John Edwards said civil servants were in constant contact with local authorities and assistance was already on the way to the affected areas.
Mike Steele, a spokesman for the Governor's Office for National Security and Emergency Standards for Emergency Situations said they were receiving vehicle applications for water rides, boats and sandbags.
Steele said that Tangipahoa district alone asked for ten thousand sandbags.
Flood patrols will remain in most of southern Louisiana to work until Saturday.
The Meteorological Service said in a statement that about 8 to 13 more centimers could rain over the sea.
In southern Alabama, the flood patrol was on alert Friday as the rains continued in the Mobile city area.
The Comite rivers at Baton Rouge and Amite are forecast to peak at Denham Springs this weekend.
Meteorologist Alek Krautmann said both said they could flood a number of houses in the suburban areas of the Baton Rouge.
He went on to say that the danger was flooding downstream in the Ascension district, when these swollen streams would be slowly sunk into Lake Maurepas.
The Tickfaw River, slightly south of the Mississippi state of Liverpool, Louisiana, reached the highest levels recorded at the level at 9 a.m. local time on Friday.
Rescuers are still picking up people from the torrendulent waters of County, County of Aretil and Wilkinson in the southwest of the Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and stepson were previously among the Protected at the Gloster on Friday.
Hansford (62) said that the water from Beaver Creek, which is normally more than 120 meters from his house, rose quickly overnight.
He said he was alerted by his next stepson, who lives nearby.
"We woke up and the water was coming," Hansford said.
I had it up to my waist.
According to his wife, this is the highest level she has ever experienced on the stream in the last 48 years.
Hansford said that he and all the members of his family were the disabled and he was the only one who could swim.
Hansford said that emergency workers rescued all three of the military-style huge trucks and taken to the fire station in the Gloster, where they remained covered on Friday.
Krautmann said that with the resumption of heavy rains, the flooding is "fastly spreading" and authorities are considering evacuating.
According to Krautmann, the observer near Livinstol reported that 35-centimetre rainfall fell from midnight to Friday to morning.
Krautmann said the land had been heavily soaked since Wednesday.
Authorities said heavy rain and paid-for trips required rescuing residents from their homes in Tangipahoa district and the cancellation of classes in five school districts.
The CBS's WWL branch reported that 200 homes were inundated, according to the elder of Tangipaho.
Residents have been evacuated to two churches, both of which are now flooded.
The mayor of the municipality, Robby Miller, said the authorities rescued 72 people and seven domestic animals who were imprisoned by the tall water.
In the municipality of Amite and in the town of Hammond, shelters were set up for those who were evacuated.
"They'll be able to come home when the water starts to fall off," he said.
In the Tangipahoa district of Hammond, more than 20 streets were closed due to the flood, and local residents were given bags of sand to pick up and try to protect their homes and businesses from the water.
"We had the last major flooding in March," said the city's manager, Lacy Landrum.
It seems that these floods will be similar.
Rupert Lacy, the crisis management manager at Harrison, Mississippi, said that persistent rain continued on the Gulf coast.
He said the flooding of a couple of houses was announced on Thursday, but none of them appeared in the report on Friday.
Keith Townson, head of Shopper Value Foods in Amite, has lived in the area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in a few places I've never seen before," Townson said, "and she's still there."
Mahaj Brown (6) - "boy shot up as sieve," survived shooting in Philadelphia
Police say a six-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia. This week is the second shooting at a child aged 6 in the city.
The child's grandparents identified him for CBS Philadelphia as Mahaje Brown.
Grandparents say the boy suffered several gunshot wounds, including the groin, leg, arm and abdomen, but he was conscious when he was transported to the hospital.
'He caught an awful lot of it, his little body was shot through as a sigh,' his grandmother, Delores Melendez, told the station.
I can't believe it.
The boy is in critical condition at the hospital and has undergone several operations.
The family told the station that the boy should recover.
He was to enter the first grade of elementary school.
Mahaj Brown is among four people who were shot in the Germantown section.
Three other men were shot: two at the age of 29 and one at the age of 32.
One of the men, aged 29, is in critical condition, with two other victims in stable condition, according to CBS Philadelphia.
According to the station's reports, the child was found to have been shot in the front seat of the vehicle, along with a 29-year-old man in critical condition.
The other two victims were not in the car, and police are looking into whether any of the injured men could be the shooter.
Investigators at CBS Philadelphia said there was likely to be a shootout between several armed men.
Casing was found at the scene from weapons of an offensive type belonging to various offensive weapons.
By all accounts, it was most certainly an ongoing battle.
There were shell casings on both sides of the sidewalk on the street.
So it appears that there were several armed combatants who were actively involved," Philadelphia Police Captain Anthony Ginaldi said.
Several houses and vehicles in the area were also affected.
No one has been apprehended and police are reportedly examining video footage from the cameras.
Another six-year-old child, this one girl, was shot in the arm by a stray shot on Tuesday in front of a house in the neighborhood of West Oak Lane.
The girl is recovering and police are still looking for a suspect.
Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
This is how I imagine the women's gymnastics team for this year's Olympic Games, for several reasons.
First, I've been to every Summer Olympics since 1984, and the U.S. has never been so dominant.
And second: There are three gymnasts in this team, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas, and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who have inspired so many young colorful girls.
Everyone is proud of the composition of this team, which is complemented by Aly Raisman, who is of Jewish origin, and the Catholic Madison Kocian.
We finally have a team that looks like America.
He also cemented the presence of black women and Latin American women at the top of the sport.
The number one Gymnast in the past four years has been an African-American woman.
Simone and Gabby were on first and second place last year.
That means something.
At the last Olympics, Gabby Dougals surprisingly became Olympic champion, and America cheered.
Now the world could have witnessed an incredible performance by three-time world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, who had performed the unexpected but masterful gymnastic figures.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth American to win gold in the women's multi-event event.
And team member Aly Raisman won silver.
We're witnessing a sporting peak, but it doesn't look like it in gymnastics class in the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie made the same journey to the Olympic team as Aly and Madison.
They are the "final five" because the gymnasts' team for the next Olympic Games will only be made up of four athletes, and this is the last year Marta Karolyi is training.
But the reality is that gymnastics is a financially challenging sport, and gymnasts train mostly in private gymnastics clubs, which keep parents who pay the cost of training, equipment, travel, jerseys, competition fees, hotel accommodation (for coaches and their charges and families). And that's far from all.
Most of these sports clubs are in the rich areas of the suburbs that can support activities.
In these clubs, gymnasts have all the training sessions and for the families of gymnasts and gymnasts it is a costly and long-term commitment.
Aimee Boorman, Simone Biles' coach, and Maggie Haney, the coach of Laurie Hernandez, both trained the athletes at the time they started in gymnastics.
It is our duty to bring in gymnastics training, which is more accessible and accessible to the communities of countless young girls who were inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie.
I founded the Gymnastics Foundation 20 years ago.
In my organizations, where we offer free gymnastics or at low cost at Harlem for more than 15,000 young people within the city (mainly of black and Hispanic origin) and we have trained national and international champions.
In September, we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to provide quality gymnastics to young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Gymnastics develops the strength, flexibility and coordination of the body and hard work, discipline and determination of the mind.
This combination means lifetime benefits for good health, success at school and work.
It is the inspiration of this team that will be sent to us by thousands of young girls who will want to be in high school. And that's great.
Participating in this sport is very important, especially for girls.
It's been a very exciting time.
Thank you, Simon, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison, for showing the "girl's strength" and winning the Olympic team gold. And thank you for motivating so many young girls of all backgrounds to set off on a journey to become healthy, strong and successful young women.
After Jeremy Hunt's proposal is rejected, young doctors are ready to enter into more strikes
Ministers had hoped that after the reworked contract with representatives of the British Medical Association (BMA), disagreements over the changes would be brought to an end. But 58 percent of the 37,000 junior doctors who took part in the election rejected the contract.
Hunt in July revealed plans to force the contract, saying that the NHS was in a "no man's land" and further delays would have a detrimental impact on staff and patients.
The first young doctors have already signed a new contract that includes changes to night and weekend working practices to improve care in non-social hours.
In a statement last night, doctoral commissioner Ellen McCourt, the president of the BMA for Young Physicians, said: "Young doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, especially in the sense that there will be an increase in the current labor force crisis and thus a fair treatment of all doctors."
Just eight weeks before the first group of doctors reaches the new contract, progress is needed and the time is running out.
The BMA's efforts to resolve disputes through negotiations were met with a reluctance to involve dr and often deafening silence on the part of the government.
This is despite Jeremy Hunt's promise last month that this possibility is still open.
"Jeremy Hunt must act now, push for the honing, and resolve the concerns of the young doctors."
If this does not happen, then young doctors are ready to take the next steps.
During the last strike at the end of April, nearly 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 visits were postponed as nurses and specialists were called to take the standstill of doctors who were among the protesters.
Ministers hoped that after the conclusion of the recast contract with representatives of the British Medical Association (BMA), there would be a disagreement about the changes.
BMA wants higher payments for work on a weekend for 54,000 young doctors who would be the subject of a contract.
Daniel Mortimer, chairman of NHS employers, called on young doctors not to take any strike.
Mortimer said, "Few or nothing is achieved with the event, but there will be pressure on already overburdened teams and services, and there will be more worry, exhaustion and disruption for patients, nursing staff and their families."
Over the past two months, we have held talks with the Young Physicians' Board of Directors and, together with the Ministry of Health and others, have responded positively to concerns about the role of the supervisor and the informant.
Employers hoped that the continued positive involvement on other important issues - such as workload, flexibility in training, further training for those returning after a career break, the cost of training, mutual recognition of subjects, sabotage and pay gap between genders - was evidence of how seriously employers, Health Education England and the Ministry of Health took the agreements reached with the BMA in November, February and May.
A cure for sixty crowns per day can reduce the risk of a heart attack
Thousands of patients at risk of heart attack will be able to take a drug that costs around sixty crowns (two pounds). The authorities recommend administering it to more patients for a longer period of time.
The drug to clotting Ticagrelor reduces the risk of a seizure of the seizure again in people with heart disease.
The drug is now being given for a heart attack for 12 months to reduce the risk of a stroke or other seizure.
NHS watchdog NICE recommends that the drug be given to people for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
But now NHS watchdog NICE recommends that it be given to people for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
In England, about 140,000 people suffer a heart attack every year, and a quarter of them suffer another seizure or heart disease.
Heart attack and stroke are caused by the accumulation of fat, which creates a continuous layer on the arteria walls.
If this layer is disconnected, a blood clot may be formed, the blood access to the heart may be blocked and a heart attack can be blocked.
If the clot is released, the bloodstream can continue through the bloodstream, blocking the blood supply to the brain and causing a stroke.
People who have already had a heart attack are at a higher risk of another seizure.
Ticagrelor, manufactured by the British firm AstraZeneca, which is sold under the trade name Brilique, reduces the risk of the formation of coats less likely.
The NICE proposal, which was published today, recommends that patients receive 90 mg of ticagrelor for 12 months and then 60 mg together with aspirin, twice a day for the next three years.
Professor Carole Longson, director of the NICE Health Technology Evaluation Center, said: "Despite the availability of effective secondary preventive treatment, there are a quarter of patients who have had a heart attack and who will have another heart attack or stroke - often with devastating consequences."
Fear of repetition can have a significant negative impact on the patient's quality of life.
It is proven that Ticagrelor, in combination with aspirin, is effective in reducing the risk of further heart attacks and strokes in people who have already suffered a heart attack.
We are delighted to extend the preconditions for treatment, given Ticagrelor's preliminary recommendation, the treatment options available to the many thousands of people who will be able to benefit from it.
As information on the efficacy and safety of Ticagrelor - particularly about the risk of bleeding - beyond three years, is not limited, the proposal for treatment beyond this time is not recommended.
With computer culture, fraud in Muslim areas began to flourish
Tower Hamlets Mayor Lutfur Rahman was removed from office last year for corruption, which was linked to a government report
The culture of political correctness has led to the disregard for the spread of fraud in Muslim communities, a government report says today.
Ex-minister Sir Eric Pickles has sharply criticized the police, election inspectors and town halls for ignoring voter abuse for "sensitive substance of ethnicity and religion."
The former secretary of the community, now the ruler of anti-corruption interventions, said that intimidating voters on the basis of their religion was so bad that the police should make cordons and protect the frightened voters in front of the polling stations.
He recommended that voters take their identity document with them and be able to prove who they were at the polls.
At present, voters need only give their name and address.
The report also proposes to apply indelible ink to the fingers of the person when surrendering their voice to avoid being voted twice.
Whistleblowers should have more protection, Pickles says.
It calls for the press to be given greater access to the minutes of the meeting and to the decisions taken by the unofficial committees or the group's workmanship.
"This is not only about protecting itself against electoral fraud, but also about protecting the local government from the wider corrupt environment and the financial fraud that goes hand in hand with it," he said.
The report was requested by Downing Street as a result of the election scandal at Tower Hamlets in West London.
A special electoral court ruled last year, the incumbent mayor of the city of Lutfur Rahman should be removed from his post after a charge of corruption and illegal practices.
The court found that Rahman had "cynically intervened" with the religious sensibilities of his Muslim community and silenced his critics with accusations of racism and Islamophobia.
Rahman, in his words, "have led his campaign to be a religious duty of loyal Muslims to vote for him."
Up to 300 votes were cast doubt or as a result of identity theft, when a person votes and sets out to someone else.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud across the country.
He expressed particular concern about the fraud of the correspondence vote - which is claimed to have been put under pressure by the Muslim community to vote for the candidate they had elected.
Sir Eric, in the picture, made several recommendations on how to clean up the electoral system, including the presentation of an identity document
His report states: "Coulding evidence was provided that vulnerable members of certain ethnic minorities, in particular women and young people, were pressured to vote at the will of the elders, particularly in the communities from Pakistan and Bangladesh."
"There have been fears that . . . state institutions have turned a blind eye against such behavior because of the "politically correct" hypersensitivity to ethnic origin and religion."
Sir Eric made 50 recommendations on how to clean up the system, including forbidden political activists to manipulate correspondent votes to prevent "enforcening."
The report, now being assessed by Theresa May, also asks for more thorough checks on registrations to prevent the use of the election lists for immigration fraud and benefit fraud.
Consider the possibility of asking voters to provide proof of identity before the vote.
The use of indelible ink on the fingers of people in the vote to prevent someone from voting twice.
The implementation of systematic checks of the nationalities of the persons to ensure that they are able to vote.
Restrict applications for automatic correspondence votes to a period of three years.
Prohibit political agitators and activists to manipulate the submitted correspondence votes and election envelopes.
Give the police the authority to create cordons around the polling stations.
Change the laws to make it easier to prosecute those who exert illicit coercion under the Reform Act of 1983.
Ban the taking of photographs at the polling stations.
Requirement to only the English to work at the polling stations (except for Wales).
Strengthen training and ensure that workers follow the rule that voters go to the ballot boxing individually.
Sir Eric criticizes the London police and says it is "surprising" that no criminal charges have been filed after the Tower Hamlets case.
"The Electoral Court ruled out Lutfur Rahman and his agent for the litany of corruption and illegal practices," he said.
For a number of reasons, he was found guilty beyond reasonable doubt - in the strength of proof of the crime.
He also criticises the fruitless "check check boxes" in the council's registration departments at City Hall.
Sir Eric said, "Last year's court decision in the Tower Hamlets case awakening.
Our nation has the proud legacy of the cradle of parliamentary democracy, but the worrying and covert spread of electoral fraud and the state of rejection by some authorities threaten this reputation.
The fading with the cycling double of Duchess Kate and other doppelgangers of well-known personalities at the Rio Olympics
This week, fans of the Rio 2016 Olympic Games went crazy for French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, who is strikingly similar to the Duchess of Cambridge.
But the 24-year-old Olympian is far from the only athlete aiming for gold this year to boast her own double from among well-known figures - at least not according to social networks.
To celebrate the Rio Olympics and all the well-known figures currently appearing on our screens, the FEMAIL women's column has compiled a list of Olympians who are more than remotely like Hollywood celebrities.
As game hunted: U.Schroman men's team member Brady Ellison (left) was likened to Leonardo DiCaprio from a young age
Next to the Kate doppel on the cycling track, a number of people online quickly pointed out that a certain archer could be the twin of star Leonardo DiCaprio.
The competitor from the American archer team, Brady Ellison, caused a storm on Twitter after his pictures surfaced, bearing a striking resemblance to the Wall Street Wolf.
Braddy himself had noticed the media frenzy and admitted to hearing about his similarities with Leo since he was a little girl.
"He doesn't see much of a similarity myself, except perhaps his beard," Brady told the Huffington Post.
"He's a dude and he looks good, so I think it's a compliment."
One of the most popular comparisons from London 2012 will undoubtedly be emphasized even more this year: a striking appearance between the British long jumper Greg Rutherford and popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
Russian gymnast Aliy Mustafin was said to be a copy of Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And when we look at the swimming pool, the South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared to the star of the series, Gell Matthew Morrison, for several years.
And for a change: The user thinks that Nathan with the "athlete version" of the actor from Origin (Inception)
Another long-standing comparison is the comparison of tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, who have similarly thick eyebrows and lips.
Russian silver swimmer Yulia Efimova boasts not only the same dark skin and blonde hair as Annalynne McCord. And of Nathan Adrian of Team USA, fans say he looks like a "athlete version of Joseph Gordon Levitt."
Fearning women: Football star Hope Sol (left) and actress of the series Dexter Jennifer Carpenter (right) have a similar face and eye shape
Not just one: Twitter's user was very pleased that the similarities were noticed by others
On the wave of theory: According to this user, there may be a reason for such couples' appearance
A Twitter user recently expressed her satisfaction on the website that "the rest of the Internet thinks Hope and Jennifer Carpenter are identical in truth."
Soccer star Hope Sol and the show's actress Dexter Jennifer Carpenter have an incredibly similar shape to the face and eyes.
Among the other popular comparisons are Kerri Walsh-Jennings and her smile, which is almost identical to the smile of actress Laura Linney, or the gold medalist for gymnastics winner Gabby Douglas, priding on her wonderfully wide smile, who seemed to follow the smile of Gabrielle Union, the star of Bravo Girls,!
CBC Olympic Games commentator apologizes for saying of the Chinese swimmer that she "bumped off"
CBC's viewers of Wednesday's live broadcast from the Olympic Games on CBC were outraged by an analysis of 14-year-old Ai Yanhan's performance by commentator Byron MacDonald. The swimmer finished in fourth place in the women's 4x200m relay in a free style
The Canadian CBC station was forced to apologize after one of its commentators said that the 14-year-old Chinese swimmer had "taken like a stink" during the race and "bumped out."
Commentator Byron MacDonald thought his microphone was off when, at the end of the 4x200-meter women's 4x200-meter relay final, he began to churning out his own opinions.
MacDonald, who was supposed to bring "a revival" to the CBC's team of commentators, said, among other things, "The little 14-year-old from China gave up on it, man."
Excessive excitement, dragging like a stink, exploding.
Thanks.
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan (14) swam the second relay of the race at 1:57.79 - a 1.61 seconds slower than Canada's Taylor Ruck, to allow the Canadians to drag China back.
Viewers in Canada quickly began to sound online and were appalled by the tone and language the commentator used
Emmett Macfarlane wrote on Twitter: "Herevitted the CBC announcer that a 14-year-old swimmer from China "bumped out"??????"
The idiot didn't notice he was still on the air.'
Ai Yanhan of China in the final of the 4x200-meter freetroot women's relay was described as: "The little 14-year-old from China gave up, you fool."
Byron MacDonald's criticism on Twitter came from all sides and many demanded his appeal
When Twitter users learned how insensitive Byron MacDonald he was, they didn't hold back
Another user, Sarah Paradis, wrote: 'Wow #ByronMacDonald.
You represent the CBC and Canada, and it sounds like a bunch of racists.#Disolved.
Soon after, Scott Russel, who hosted the CBC broadcast, apologized for MacDonald's lively commentary and said, "We apologize for commenting on the lifesuit of a swimmer who had escaped on the air."
It was an unfortunate choice of words, we're sorry to see it happen."
CBC finally apologized to people who tweeted in response to a comment
Associate President Scott Russel had to apologize on behalf of MacDonald
CBC then copied and added an apology to the reply for more than 90 Twitter users who complained to the MacDonald commentator's comments
The station also quickly apologized and made a statement.
She sincerely regrets the words being uttered, not getting on the air.
We quickly apologized to our viewers on the air and those who watch us on social networks.
To be clear, Byron's comments were about the performance of the swimmer, not the swimmer herself.
In other words, this was an inappropriate and unfortunate choice of words. Byron is deeply apologetic for what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, Byron MacDonald apologized on live television and attempted to explain his remark by claiming that he did not want to be a personal attack.
"I would like to apologize now for the comment I made last night after the women's relay," he said on the broadcast from the Olympics on CBC.
"I was referring to the performance of a swimmer and not the person of the swimmer as such."
"No need to say that I had no intention of disrespect, and I am very sorry."
Chancellor in Primark scandalized by a woman who blatantly tried her underwear in the middle of a store
When the woman took off her clothes to try out her panties on the sales area in the middle of Primark, the shoppers were not sure which way to look.
To make it worse, she tried to fade her size, took off her panties and put them back on the rack.
She continued to browse, and eventually tried four pairs of panties at the Bouverie Place shopping centre in Flokestone.
Primark store at the Bouverie Place shopping centre in Folkestone, where the woman was rehearsing her panties before returning them to the shelf
The mother-of-two, Jenny Davidson, who was in the store at the time, said that the mystery woman, after testing her underwear, "dressed again and came out of the store without buying anything."
She said, "The people couldn't believe their eyes."
She stood in the middle of the shop, took her panties off the shelf, took off her own tights and panties, and put them on.
"She didn't even try to find a discreet place - she was just standing there, rude as a monkey."
"Everyone just stared at the way she took off her panties again, and evidently didn't like them because she put them back on the shelf."
She did the same with three others before she finally decided she didn't like her, dressed again, and left.
"She didn't seem to mind who was watching-or that thought about the man who might be buying the panties she was trying to."
Miss Davidson (33), who lives in Kent, said, "The idea of someone taking home the panties that someone else was wearing and not being cleaned. That's gross.'
The event took place on Tuesday afternoon.
Miss Davidson added, "When she left, I gathered up things that she was clearly trying to get them off sale - what's the only right thing to do, either."
"I'd be terrified of the idea of bringing new panties home and discovering that they were worn by another woman, undressing them, and not been washed."
A spokesman for the trade, Primark, said, "Primark knows about the incident at our store in Folkestone on Tuesday, August 9."
All the products in question were withdrawn from sale.
How to defend against a gun attack with Krav Maga
The world out is dangerous, but this Dailymail.com video could make it a little safer for you.
We spoke with Rhone Mizrachi, the grand master of the New York-based Krav Magy Federation, to see how to cope with armed robbers at close range.
This video will show you how to suddenly gain the upper hand over the rapist, whether it comes to you from the front or from behind.
If he comes near the back of you, Mizrachi says, then the first thing you have to do is turn around to see your attacker and "have a free-track of the missile."
You will then seize the weapon between your forearm and shoulder just before you hit it in the face with a free elbow.
Then the knee follows into the groin, and while the attacker writhes in pain, you wriggle the gun out of his hand, hit him in the main face and begin to retreat, keeping the gun at his point.
If an armed man is approaching from the front, it's a similar technique - get your body out of the firing line, grab the gun and drive it out so the villain can't shoot.
At the same time, put the force in the weapon and strike the attacker in the chest, then romp the weapon from his grip and start retreating, always aiming at him.
Does that sound complicated?
Watch the video, where you'll see exactly how Mizrachi does it.
But remember, the safest way to get out of the ambush - unless you're the grandmaster of Krav Maga - is to hand over all the cash.
Traveller Ian Wright ollizes the dirtiest places in Europe to the travel guide
The British traveller decided to give a heavy test to his immune system and a haggiving reflex - licking the dirtiest and disastestrious places in Europe.
Traveller and travel writer Ian Wright (51), originally from Suffolk, as a token of the power of his immune system, he wore a euro bill with his tongue, a railing at Piccadilly Circus, a flushing button on the toilet on the train, and a Russian public phone.
Before wearing each object, he used a luminometer to show himself and to all of us what he was getting into.
However, the experiment, on the basis of which Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength was made, produced interesting results.
The idea to lick the flusher button on the train used by thousands of other people may seem utterly repulsive, however, for example, there are in the kitchen sink there are in fact much more harmful bacteria.
As a whole trip around Europe, Ian Wright spoke to doctors and health specialists about strengthening bowel flora bacteria and his own health.
Fortunately, none of the licked left him any worse in his mouth than the aftertaste.
Ian Wright is famous for testing the resistance of his intestines on the road around the world and eating strange and amazing things.
During this mission, he tested his immune system quite safely - from the public railings at the train stations to the flusher
In the film he made about it, he says, "I've cared little for my health since I was a kid, and I've been putting all sorts of things in my mouth, from dirt to eating worms and muddy water."
In the film, he certainly confirmed his reputation.
The only thing he refused was the dirty public toilets in Russia.
After a simple luminometer swab, the luminometer showed a value of more than 4000 units.
For comparison, freshly washed hands should have less than 60.
But he refused to lick one public toilet in Russia after his luminometer showed more than 4000 units, while freshly washed hands have less than 60
Ian Wright and Finnish dairy manufacturer Valio made a traveler's film called The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, which shows the numbers of bacteria in various places, such as in the bathroom
In the film, he said, "This is almost the ugliest I've ever felt in the bathroom."
Nothing dirtier than this doesn't exist!
I'm not licking anything because it's disgusting.
The film Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength was shot in collaboration with Finnish dairy producer Valio.
The company provided Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains lactic acid and vitamins C and D, which in humans help to strengthen intestinal bacteria and the immune system.
Niko Vuorenmaa, senior vice president of Valio for refreshments, juices and new categories, said: "We wanted to offer consumers something really new.
Something that would be watched with the fascination while allowing us to explain the benefits of probiotics.
We've devised a lot of crazy ideas that ended with the idea of "let's call Ian."
They say interest in bowel health is becoming a global phenomenon.
Instead of just talking about the products, we wanted to put them in a broader context - good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of bowel health and how it is linked to the immune system.
The growing interest in healthy intestines is a global phenomenon and through this paper we have brought more detailed information to consumers in an interesting way.
I also think there is a great sense of humour in the film!
Tom Hakala, who directed the film, adds, "Let's put it this way, Ian would lose my respect if he licked up some of what I wanted him to do - like that disgusting Russian toilet that appears in the film."
Licking some things was naturally easier for Ian, others pretty hard.
I'm glad we've filmed the lick of some of the dirty stuff."
Valio conducted a survey in 2015 showing that 84 percent of respondents associated with lactic acid bacteria primarily with stomach and bowel health, and 58 percent of respondents said they were at least occasionally using products containing added bacteria of lactic acid.
A family of socially needed before evicted vandalized a municipal building in Saltash, Cornwall
The socially needy family left £50,000 worth of damage to their municipal house after being accused of terrorizing their neighbours.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were evicted from a house in the city of Saltash, Cornwall, after a long series of complaints against them.
After their forcible evictions from the house, housing association officials were shocked to discover that the property was in a state of disrepair.
There were holes in the walls, the floor covering was torn, garbage was litched all over the floor, and the walls were scrawled.
The family has already moved out and is believed to be living in private accommodation
Donna McEvoy, director of housing at Cornwall Housing, said she was worried about whether she could save the house.
She said, "It was a nightmare for the people here, and I don't think people should live like this.
A number of circumstances need to be considered, because this property will probably come into the consciousness of "not such a nice part" of Cornwall.
The family is notorious, and their names are notorious.
The couple has three sons who sometimes stayed in the house, and police said the family's reign of terrors, which the family was involved, was a street fight using baseball bats, intimidation of nearby residents, drug use, drug use, and loud shouts, arguments and abuse.
Skeldon (47), whose name was on the lease, was given a sentence in June for anti-social behaviour.
In several rooms in the house, which may be demolished, smelly trash were found.
In the house from which the drugs were distributed in the past, the floor cover was torn out
Neighbors say they've been seen fighting on the street, and people have called the police regularly
Cornwall Housing forcibly emigrated her and her partner from the house this week after receiving an additional 11-week period to move out voluntarily.
Neighbors who were relieved, welcomed the eviction, saying that their lives were a living hell.
One of them said, "They didn't cover for anyone at all."
We've lived next to them for 20 years, and it's always been like this.
How many times we've seen the police here, you can't count at all.
"We couldn't sleep this morning."
We got up because it was incredibly quiet here - we're not used to it!
It'll be nice when they're finally gone.
Adam Fitzpatrick, the supervisor in the neighborhood of Cornwall Housing, said the family had failed to work with local authorities.
The family lived in the house for 20 years, the police were regularly called to the house
Garbage and old toys were lying in the overgrown part of the municipal house
He adds: "It is a shame that the tenant failed to accept responsibility for her own behaviour and for the behaviour of her family. The eviction is always the last step that Cornwall Housing is considering.
This was a very complex case because their behavior was extreme and their actions, according to a witness, had to be terrified by their neighbors.
I appreciate all the work my team, Devon and Cornwall police, and the members of the local community who bravely informed us.
I hope this move will bring a little comfort to the neighbours, and at the same time carry the message that we will not tolerate unsocial behaviour.
Fitzpatrick said that all three of the tenants' sons who lived in the house at different times were in the house for about 20 years.

Workers will now have to remove the piles of garbage left dumped around the house
In 2014, the house's shelf raided, finding over 70 grams of cannabis, weight, equipment and £1,700 in cash.
Skeldon was fined when found guilty of possession of Class B drugs that she wanted to sell.
She claimed that the money was intended for the foundations of the house for her son, Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
Tanya and her partner are believed to be living in private accommodation in Plymouth after the eviction.
The walls in many of the rooms of the house were painted graffiti.
Police say they will seek to evict tenants who break the rules of their lease agreements
Angela Crow of the Den and Cornwall Police Department said the eviction was sending a clear message to other tenants who would continue to break the rules.
"This is a message to all those who think they can behave with impunity and those who would like to follow such behavior," she said.
The Dens and Cornwall Police will never tolerate criminal and non-societal behaviour and will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal terrified after low-floor overthrow of military jet over the beach
Tourists who enjoyed the sun's rays in Aveil, Portugal, were terrified to death
Portuguese Air Force P-3C aircraft flew over the airliner to an incredibly low
The Air Force said it was a training flight and insisted that there had been no threat to safety
As the low-flying jet descended above the crowded beach, the frightened tourists were in for panic.
The dramatic footage shows a military aircraft getting within almost a touch of sunny people on a sandy beach near the town of Aveiro in northern Portugal.
Tourists began to rise after being disturbed by the noise of the jet's engines without seeing what would emerge from the clouds.
The incident occurred yesterday afternoon on Costa Nova near the town of Aveiro.
Daniel Fernandes, one of several holidaymakers who posted video recordings of a dramatic flyby on social networks, said: "The plane flew twice really low and at one point it seemed to collapse."
Nuno Arroja adds, "I surfed, and I really thought the plane would fall on my head."
Tourists on a beach in Aveir were horrified when a plane flying low came out of the darkness
The Portuguese Air Force today declared that the P-3C Orion pilot was on a training flight to identify the fishing boats off the coast and had to be lowered because it was the only way to check the ship.
The aircraft allegedly flew a little lower than usual due to poor visibility caused by smoke from nearby forest fires. However, the Air Force insists that the safety of the people has not been compromised.
Forest fires destroyed part of mainland Portugal this summer, resulting in four fatalities on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese Air Force said today that the pilot had to fly low because of the thick fog and smoke from the fires that prevented him from viewing
The aircraft was on a training flight and the pilot was asked to identify the fishing boats as part of his training.
Half of the funeral services do not comply with the regulations.
Half of funeral service providers do not comply with the legislation.
The Czech Trade Inspection Authority (ČOI) found this out during inspections in the second quarter.
Funeral services are most likely to not inform survivors of their prices or issue a written acknowledgement of the order.
The CHOI imposed 41 fines for a total of CZK 73,000.
Today, her spokesman, Jiří Fröhlich, reported the news.
Inspectors found errors in 47 of the 95 inspections.
In addition to not informing prices and missing acknowledges, some funeral services also sold products or provided services at different prices than agreed.
In five cases, the products sold were not properly labelled and once the seller used an officially unverified gauge.
The inspection therefore prohibited the sale of 23 products for a total of CZK 7077.
It involved urn wrappers, candle covers and vases that were not properly marked with the required information.
"Given that the law is still in violation of the law in this specific area of services, the audit will continue in the next quarter of this year," Fröhlich added.
London schoolgirl who joined IS killed in Syria
It was reported that Kadiz Sultana, one of the three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join IS, died in Syria.
Tasnime Akunjee's attorney said the family learned of her death in Raqqa, Syria, weeks ago.
ITV News reported Thursday that it was likely to be killed during a Russian air attack in Raqa, a stronghold in the country.
Sultana was 17 years old and, according to her family, died just as she was preparing to flee the war-tried country and to return to Britain.
"It is to be believed that the only good thing about the whole thing - as a message and a warning to others that these are the real dangers of going to the war zone - is that it will discourage people from ever making a decision," Akunjee said.
Sultana and two other schoolgirls from the east of London boarded a plane to Turkey in February 2015 and then a bus to the border with Syria.
The Sultana family learned that she had married an IS fighter in Syria - and was widowed within months.
Reid says she will keep Garland as the Supreme Court nominee if she is elected.
Senate leader for the Democratic Democratic Party, Harry Reid, says he believes the Democratic presidential candidate, Hillary Clinton, will nominate Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court in the event of her election.
Republicans in the Senate blocked Garland's appointment, though President Barack Obama nominated him as early as March.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnel says the person to replace the late Supreme Court judge will be elected by the future president.
Reid said during a conference call Thursday that he believed Clinton would choose Garland "with a certain degree of credibility."
Reid's spokeswoman later said that he did not speak directly to Clinton about whether she would nominate Garland and that he was merely speculating.
He praised Garland and said that the Clinton team, by electing someone else, would not want to "swhip the ship."
Garland is the president of the federal appeals court in Washington.
Reid said the republicans that block Garland's appointment are "defforts" and "jump-up" Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump.
He said Trump didn't fit in office.
According to Treats magazine, nude calendars are for "women and for men"
Treats Magazine works closely with photographer David Belleer to release the 2017 calendar, inspired by the 1970s Pirelli calendar.
But instead of revealing well-known figures, he is trying to find the next generation of top models for his 2017 NU Muses calendar.
Treats President Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his magazine full of nakedness was different from the old-school Playboy because "Playboy is for men."
I do it for women.
He clearly believes the calendar is as well.
"We have to go back to depicting timeless and classic nudity, with both women and men feeling comfortable and being inspired by the photographs of the female body," Shaw said in a press release for the calendar.
Women want to be part of this project because it's a wonderful piece of art.
Models can send their images online or in person during open auditions in Los Angeles and New York.
Where is vinyl going: who really buys the gramophone records?
Vinyl is loved by lone middle-aged men.
Before you decide to overwhelm the commentary section with peprn notes under the pseudonym Not allalleronamedMžiVJuVředníDku, we note that this statement is based on actual data.
According to YouGov, the much-discussed resurrection of gramophone records is associated with the boom of millennials who want to enjoy the originality of the physical subject's ownership, but with a nostalgia of the middle age.
Those who have recently bought a vinyl album are most likely to be people between the ages of 45 and 54.
Young people aged 18-24 are the least likely.
It's not really about the accumulation of an enthusiastic fan either - the whole thing has an emotional dimension: older people who buy gramophone records are more likely to want to keep their feelings (56% versus 53%) and are happy to be alone (69% versus 66%).
But are the results of YouGov true?
If this blog were broadcast as a TV report, I'd be watched by a camera setting out on a busy Soho street, dressed in a decent gray suit, and gesturing widely. Then I'd stop by, and he'd pull out his arms and say something authoritative, like, "Let's take a look at it."
Let's take a look at it.
As Soho's heart is slowly fading from his heart and charm - the buildings once occupied by independent retailers, hotels, restaurants, and canteens, outfits, and office supplies are now filled with fillings - several of the fantastic specialist gramophone board stores are still to be done.
I'd probably ask the camera to stop filming for a while. I will stand close to the various men in these shops and try to observe what their age and emotional mood are.
Stuart (55), a native of Glasgow, who I follow from Sister Ray (twers: two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (times: eight middle-aged men, one woman around 20) has a meeting in London in the afternoon and looks at the shops to fill in for hours.
I ask him if he's a collector.
"I think so," he says.
I have about three or four thousand recordings.
All the recordings are lined with the walls of his living room - in the picture upstairs (he e-mailed the photo to me, I didn't follow him home).
He also has this huge number of albums and singles because he can afford it: he can now buy gramophone records he couldn't afford when they were coming out, and he's re-cracking what he sold in his youth and didn't even have a penny.
"A lot of what I'm buying is from the late '60s and early '70s. These are things that would be published when I was 11 or 12. I was too small then and couldn't get them," he says.
He agrees that those who buy the recordings are probably introverts who like the company of themselves. He adds, "I don't smoke or drink much.
This is my sin.
Wez (25) works at Sister Ray and also thinks that a number of customers he meets in the profile of YouGov.
He also noted a new influx of people affected by the media wave. People who had heard of the comeback and felt forced to buy their old record labels back.
According to my interviews, people got rid of their collections most often between 1998 and 1999.
Customers who once sold their record labels and bought CDs are now selling their CDs to buy their record labels back," he says.
This could explain the boom in gramophone lovers of a certain age.
But what about the alleged emotional importance of the gramophone records?
It won't take you more than a few seconds to find out in a shop like Phonica that in the music shops you find a pleasant community of people with similar sentiments.
According to Wez, some older customers are particularly outraged by the contactless payment system.
Some fans of the record can smell of overwhelmed in the digital world and opted for the familiar setting of the record labels, things that evoke memories of peaceful adolescence.
"I think that filling a gap or owning something material can bring some comfort," Wez says.
I'm a collector myself, I do, and I think with a lot of people, too.
It's an easy way to fill up in the head.
"We're all like their social workers!" the associate says from a pile of gramophone records.
A survey by ICM in April revealed that nearly 50% of people who bought a vinyl album a month earlier had not yet listened to it.
According to the survey, 41% of those surveyed have a record player they never use, while 7% of those who buy gramophone records are not available to the record player.
At this point of the story, he was probably looking seriously concerned while walking through a stack of chata bossa nova.
The "troofha" and the revival of interest is something noted by Jonny (42), who works in Sounds of the Universe (number: three middle-aged men).
"Someone came in recently and said, "I don't have a record player yet, but I want to buy a Radiohead on the board so we can put it on display on the shelf," he says.
The percentage of these is not great, but it happens.
It's more about the product side than the music.
We have people coming in who say, "I don't have a gramophone."
These are the younger people, not the older, the grown-up teenagers who are getting into it.
Fopp, where almost a full floor is currently reserved for gramophone records, has much more diverse visitors when I arrive.
There are pairs of 70-year-olds, tourists who take pictures, teenagers and middle-aged women.
While the atmosphere is not as relaxed as the shops used to be - the latest Wild Beasts pop is heard from the speakers instead of pulling jazz, full of synthesizers and sex, it is good to see different customers.
None of them look particularly lonely, but it's hard to gauge mental trauma to be around when you're standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora (27) walks in Fopp for a few minutes and looks at various gramophone records at a discount.
She is one of those who looks at the windows rather than spend feverishly.
He says he doesn't make much of a profit, so it's out of the question that she's collecting gramophone records.
It costs a lot of money.
It's easy to listen to music on a computer or something. But the gramophone records have their charms . . ."
I can't explain it - it's unique.
My last stop is a store that supposedly inspired a new generation of gramophone lovers: Urban Outfitters.
I pretend to be very interested in the calves of the girls in tight jeans and watching a group of teenage girls who are currently congregating around Polaroid cameras. Then the father and daughter decide to buy the gramophone Crosley.
To the left is a staircase whose wall is covered by the record labels Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary and classical music, the basis of any average collection of gramophone records.
No one is looking at them - perhaps because they are just for decoration, and some are so high up on the wall that they can't be reached.
It's purely a "vinyl trick."
But because any attraction to it could mean more money for the industry and send a few customers to the depths of Soho for more, there's not much to complain about.
It is no surprise that the demographic area, where there is more time and money is more likely than in other areas, is also the one where it is spent the most luxurious goods, as vinyl must be.
But while, to my findings, the results of YouGov appear to be accurate - at least in the gramophone board stores, they don't take into account the large number of collectors and vinyl lovers who actually exist, in grammophone stores and online forums.
These people probably work hard in schools or offices.
He's certainly not spending alas on Thursday morning wandering around the gramophone record stores on Berwick Street, going through the recordings, and avoiding looking at the strange, 30-year-old fake TV presenter hiding behind the backs of unsuspecting middle-aged men.
Greenland's shark is the longest-lived vertebrate - a video reportage
According to scientists, the Greenland shark has the longest life-derive life expectancy of any vertebrate on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, who studies sharks, says the recording shows the female, whose age is estimated to be between 272 and 512 and five metres long
Court in France refuses to demolish shops in Jungle refugee camp
A court in France has rejected the order of the authorities in Calais to demolish dozens of makeshift shops and restaurants in the Jungle camp, where thousands of refugees live.
During a court appearance this week, authorities in Calais argued that the state should be able to cancel a total of 72 makeshift shops where people sell goods inside the camp, from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer hair-cutting, selling tea for 50 cents in makeshift restaurants or basic dishes for several euros.
The prefect's office in Calais argued that the sites had to be demolished because they pose a parallel economy that did not pay taxes and because they pose a risk of fire and health risks.
Humanitarian organizations told the court that shops and restaurants were vital and that free meals offered by state-sponsored associations and other groups did not provide a food supplement for the growing numbers of refugees in the camp.
The disputed makeshift shops and restaurants often provide shelter and free food to people in need.
The Lille court ruled that there was no legal basis to prevent people from operating 72 makeshift shops, but stated that Prefect Calais's objections were ‘completely understandable’.
Judge Jean-François Molla said that grocery stores, cafes and restaurants have a much bigger role to play in the mere feeding of food to people who "live in extremely desperate conditions."
He said the premises provided peaceful places to meet refugees and volunteers.
One of the places facing demolition was a café in the camp, Jungle Book Kids, run by a nonprofit organization that offers 200 meals, English and French lessons a day, and asylum counseling for hundreds of endangered unaccompanied minors in the camp.
A petition to protect the "children's" cafe was signed by more than 170,000 people.
The Guardian received a letter saying that the closure of the café would "malleacle for these children, some of them only 8 years old."
The charities Help Refugess and L'Auberge des Migrants estimated on Friday that the numbers of refugees in the camp rose to more than 9,000 - the highest ever in all of this time, following the steep increase in arrivals during the summer.
He thought he was dead.
Ulč is revitalized by both volleyball Ústí.
"I've been able to train normally since March," he said at the start of the summer training in full force.
What was wrong with you?
I had a bilateral pulmonary embolism, then I had heart problems for it.
Because when I was at the Universiade in Korea, I didn't know I had any blood problems.
So the trouble was caused by a long flight to Asia?
I had a clot in my calf for two years, and I didn't know it.
I was hurt, no one found me anything.
Then the clot went up.
There's a damaged vein in the calf, it's going to hurt all the time, especially when the weather is working or changing.
But nothing that would limit me, more of an aesthetic thing.
Were you concerned about your life?
I did.
Last year at the summer tournament in Dřevěnice, I didn't know I had an embolism, and I couldn't move there at all.
I threw up blood in the evening.
The doctors told me it was something completely different, I was finished for five days.
I really thought I was dead in Wooden, and my girlfriend and family.
I've seen myself somewhere else before.
How did you deal with that?
I guess I had to go through it, now it's just going to go up.
I know I have some blood problems, that I have to watch myself more when I fly somewhere.
But you can do everything with it.
Only when I wanted to return to the preparation of Příbram last year, there were still heart problems.
It's all good now.
Since March, I have been fitness-prepared at home alone to be able to play again.
I'll knock it, physically, I'm better off than I was before.
What do you expect from Ústí?
I'm excited, the gang looks good, I know most of the guys.
I'm curious to see two other strangers coming.
Perhaps we will sit down humanely to fit together.
Will you lift Ústí?
It had a reputation for being battered, but every season is different.
Brno was eighth two years ago, now it came to be second.
There's a new team in Ústí, with only a few players left.
It was the last one in the extra league, so there's plenty of room to improve.
How we use it is up to us.
We'll see who's the toupee after the first rounds, we'll hopefully not.
Is Coach Brom a guarantee of success?
He's already experienced and experienced a lot, he'll think of a better job than the last place.
But my arrival was unrelated to him, I made a deal earlier.
There were other coaches in the game, I'm a big friend with one and it was agreed that he would be here to operate.
I'm not calling the name.
Finally, Mr. Brom came and I'm glad.
He has a big name, he's been in good clubs, he's been training for a lot of decades, he's a former good player.
He'll move us up.
What are you bringing?
This team is going to fight, which is my position.
I like to fight, I like to heckle and I like to get opportunities in a not-so-stell-to-toe team.
I have been in Příbram for two years, but Ústí is a bigger challenge than being in the sixth team because it starts from the bottom.
You mentioned foreigners, in Ústí the Australian Boehm is already coached.
How's he looking?
I happen to know him, we played against each other in a group at the Universiade.
And we had a few conversations there together, sometimes we sat together in the evening after the games, so we already know each other in a friendly way.
We beat them 3-1, I fed it to him right away at the start of the summer training in Ústí.
He has a Slovak girlfriend, he's a charmer.
The American Nadazdin and the Brazilian Ze will arrive.
Do you know anything about them?
I texted with the American, he looks like a nice boy, the Brazilian who knows how to speak English.
You contacted the American?
It seemed like a good idea.
I'm a recording artist, I mean, whoever's creating, so I should communicate with everyone.
I immediately researched what kind of player he was, I found him on the internet, how he was playing, I'd seen some videos.
He seemed pretty cool, the kid jumps, he's tall.
We wrote some messages on Facebook, he seemed like a joker, he'll fit in with us.
How do you look forward to the number one recording position?
I didn't want to take anything else.
I'm going to be twenty-four, after all, and I don't have the temperament to go to rotate.
I'd rather be at the center of things, I'd rather run the team than have someone else leading the team.
I probably wouldn't want to play anymore if I were to be like a second recorder and devote myself to it at full time. When something isn't done to the fullest, it sucks.
How many times have you been number one?
A half-year in the Potters, when it didn't go to Kusto as captain, got hurt, then there were money problems and he left.
We've been climbing ever since then, and I've played all the time.
In Brno, of whom I am a striker, I alternated number one and a B.
Excellent year was in the Old Town, after which I had a lot of offers and it was Příbram that chose.
That's where the Budejovice wanted me, I stayed, but I didn't finish the season because of the embolism.
Now it's a new beginning.
Gold number 22.
The short half-op remains Phelps' domain.
"Being on the podium again and hearing the anthem is as sweet as ever," Phelps laughed, his eyes full of tears again.
His fiancée and mother cheered in the audience again, with son Boomer sleeping peacefully with his headphones on his ears.
I'm having an incredible week at the end of my career.
It's crazy - I started swimming competitively 20 years ago and it'll be over in a few hours, he said, touched.
In the final, silver Japanese Kosuke Hagino trailed Phelps by nearly two seconds, winning a long half-half.
The bronze went to China's Wang Shun, a bronze medalist in this discipline at last year's World Championships.
After Al Oerter (disc) and Carlo Lewis (distance), Michael Phelps is the third athlete to have won the same discipline at four consecutive games.
For most of the race, another American, Ryan Lochte, and the home side's Thiago Perreira, were in the lead.
While the defending gold champion deployed in the final frog 50 to the crushing finish, they fell out of the medal position.
The American superhero will have at least one more chance to expand its unique medal collection in Rio.
Shortly after the semifinal's ceremony, he advanced to the final of the 100-meter butterfly.
The leggney Ryan Murphy, who won the signing double, could not be overshadowed by the Legend - he won the double in Rio after the 100.
He trailed 37 hundredths for Australian swimmer Mitchell Larkin in the final, with Yevgeny Rylov's Russian third.
While last year's World Championships Murphy has only fifth place in the 200, he became the sign-hander in Rio.
He dethroned Larkin, who made the same double at last year's world championships, to be taken the same.
At the Olympics, however, he won a medal only now.
The scanthdown hundred was shared by Canadian Penny Oleksiak and American Simone Manuel.
For 16-year-old Oleksiak, it was the fourth medal at these Games, and for Manuel, it was the second to the relay.
She won the swimming gold at the Olympics as the first African-American woman in history.
I believe I can be an inspiration to others.
This medal is for all those who come after me, sport becomes a love for them and they get to where I go, a tearful Manuel said.
The third was Sweden's Sarah Sjöström, who won the 100 metres butterfly in the world record in Rio and has silver in the 200-seat skate.
The sixth was the world record holder, Australia's Cate Campbell.
The Brethren 200 was won by Japan's Rie Kanet, for whom it is her first Olympic medal at the age of 27.
She has no precious metal or World Championships, her best being fourth in the event in 2013.
The second silver in Rio was won by Russian Yulia Yefimova, who is struggling with the hostile of spectators and rivals to start at the Games despite her doping past.
I made a big mistake once.
But I won in court, and I don't know why I should answer these questions all the time.
I'm so tired of it, said the Russian swimmer.
She won the Rio start right up to a special panel of the CAS sports arbitration just before the start of the Games.
They were looking into my appeal, and I won.
Whether someone likes it or not, or if they have a different opinion, whether they go to the arbitration court, she added.
Hermann: Disappointment, we could have won.
And take off at midnight?
I don't remember.
The Czechs had a special day.
It was only less than an hour before the game that they learned who they were going to start against.
They had to master tactical preparation in a flash.
And then, at the unconventional time, the game started on a small No.1 court.
They did not start well in the first set, then drew the advantage of the opponents, but at 19:19, they did not manage the end game.
In the second they were clearly better and drew level, but the decisive tie-break failed.
In particular, a number of broken service stations meant a 10:15 loss and a farewell to the Olympic tournament.
"We could have beaten the Russians," Hermann said.
How would you evaluate the match?
Hermann: After an unfortunate start before I played out, we got into the game beautifully.
In the end, I missed the reception I'd gotten used to before in the last balloon.
We lost the set, which was the key.
In the next set we came to them with a flourish on the pitch, a different defence and we pushed the service.
There were terribly rotten submissions in the tie-break, there we took it down on this side.
It was a disappointment because we could have beaten the Russian.
Sluková: Pity to start the first set, that's where we missed it.
We were able to pull it down, but the points were missing.
The second set was great and in the third he was deciding the service.
We made too many mistakes.
We gave them five points and the five of them, we hesitated a lot there.
It's a shame, because the Russian was playable.
How did you play on the little court number 1?
Sluková: Similar to China's secondary backyards.
The environment and atmosphere were different.
It was one o'clock at night, complete in silence, music not playing, nothing.
That was the difference with the center.
We would not choose such conditions, but we cannot choose.
What was the preparation for the match when you found out the opponent's names an hour before the game?
Hermann: She was special.
We started to warm up for the game without us knowing the opposing team, so we couldn't do tactical preparation like the other teams.
But Simon (Kid Nusch) had set up a tactic for almost all the possibilities that were there.
He had a lot of tactics ready to be made, so on this side we were pretty well prepared.
Do you remember ever starting a game at midnight?
Hermann: Probably not.
We played at 10:30, but not at 12.
Russian Birlov's block in the playoff round at the Rio Olympics.
Beach volleyball players Markéta Sluková and Barbora Hermann in a hug in the play-off round at the Rio Olympics.
Was it uncomfortable?
Sluková: Having played the last two matches in the group from ten, we had the regime shifted earlier.
This was two hours more.
It's strange, I can't imagine that another sport has athletes who have to perform their best performance at 12 o'clock.
But I think we prepared the best we could.
We knew it would be, but it's not quite typical, and it's probably not my favorite time to play.
How do you rate the Olympic experience?
Hermann: Since advancing from the group was our goal, it's okay on the one hand, good.
We did what we said.
But now after the game, I'm sad.
Sluková: I will sleep with it and from tomorrow I will only remember the Olympic tournament positively.
Big Brother is here, the first peeping SIM.
You're not escaping it.
The new rules are to apply to all persons without a Thai passport who decide to purchase a SIM of one of the local operators when they are in Thailand.
That is, not only to tourists, but also to people with long-term visas who work in or have married in Thailand, for example.
The Secretary-General of the National Broadcasting and Telecommunications Commission, Takorn Tantasith, informed that there would be no exceptions.
The SIM sales plan exclusively to foreigners was unveiled by the national telecoms regulator in early August.
The new measure to enable the monitoring of their location is planned to be implemented by the authorities within six months.
According to Tantasith, it is a means of preserving national security that will enable foreigners to deal with the criminal activity committed.
In addition, the so-called tourist SIMs are intended to help detect those who are overstaying the authorised stay.
For retailers, a special SIM for foreigners should appear alongside SIM exclusively for ThaIs within half a year.
The periodic detail will be the tracking feature that will be permanently on for cards for people without a Thai passport.
It won't be possible to turn it off.
"This SIM function is not for Thais, because we can always easily track them," Tantasith said.
It should be added that in Thailand the pre-payments are not anonymous as in the Czech Republic.
The seller requires identification.
On the other hand, for several years, one of the operators gave away free starter SIM to tourists at airports.
They were fully anonymous.
The introduction of the same measure as Thailand is being considered by ten telecoms regulators from other Asian countries including, for example, Malaysia or Singapore.
They also currently have a mandatory SIM registration, but legal use of the tracking system is not possible.
However, the forthcoming measure does not imply an obligation for foreigners to acquire a local operator when entering the SIM country.
They can, of course, use roaming services with their own home SIM, in which case the Thai authorities will be short for them.
The operators of that country know only the relevant network information after crossing the border, that is to say, after the SIM has come forward with a request for a network.
They therefore know the telephone number, but not the information about the owner.
However, the difference in roaming prices over the rates of local operators is so abysmal that even most tourists start looking for local SIMs during their stay in Thailand.
The authorities' efforts to have the surveillance of the movement of foreigners have been lawfully received immediate criticism from foreigners living in Thailand.
Tantasith calms the situation and, in the context of privacy protection, compares the forthcoming system to the obligation to provide a residential address in immigration documents.
In addition, the police will need a court order if they need to monitor a specific person.
Any abuse of the system will face an unspecified punishment.
"If the service provider follows the SIM position without a court order, he or she will be charged with a crime," Tantasith added.
In addition, the system should maximize the use of prepaid cards.
While a specific figure will currently be recycled only after the 90-day deadline for the SIM not to sign up for the network, the number could be restored after 15 days in the event of leaving Thailand.
The luxury apartment in the new building in Vinohrady has a swimming pool and a hot tub on the terrace.
Why did you choose an apartment in a new building?
We were looking for a carefree apartment where most of the property's care is provided by the caregiver.
The condition was enough parking spaces and a lift in the house, which basically disqualified the older development.
Not to mention problematic acoustics in old houses, problems with the rocking of the floor, high energy intensity and the like.
The condition was also for large terraces, which the old building is not able to offer.
More interesting visits can be found in the magazine Modern Apartment.
The whole interior was designed for you by architect Lenka Langerová with her colleague Kamila Poláková from the Artiga studio.
Why did you just approach them?
Would you recommend working with a specialist for everyone?
We would recommend cooperation with the architect to everyone, if he designs an apartment from the beginning, because it is a very complex technical process.
The second plane is the interior design itself: the designers have a significantly better idea of the range of possible materials and are able to match the interior appropriately based on the client's wishes.
We had already collaborated with the architect Lenka Langerová on our mountain apartment, then on the basis of the personal recommendation of another client, and since everything worked well, the obvious choice for us was also during the reconstruction of our new apartment in Vinohrady.
What were your practical and aesthetic requirements?
We wanted a generous socio-residential space with a corresponding background for a family of four, conceived as a modern but not a cool interior.
The priority was to achieve the connection between the apartment and the terraces and implement the intelligent home control.
And, of course, it was necessary to check the quality of the design.
Have you left everything to the experts, or have you yourself interfered with the final form of the interior?
We approved all the designs, including technical drawings and samples of materials, but the design always came from the architects.
At the beginning, we set out what we expect from the design and showed some interior elements that we would like to incorporate into the design, such as carpets or paintings.
I think it was our collection of mostly Czech authors that, including works by Karel Malich, Karel Vysušila, Václav Špála or Otto Gutfreund, helped the architect to navigate our taste.
The combination of black, white and walnut wood was also the architect's idea as well as individual pieces of furniture, walls, floor, lighting, carpets, textiles, art, etc. Whether they are fine-tuning everything together, we then verified together through visualizations.
Have there been any complications in the realisation of which you had to give up the original ideas or, on the contrary, accept new ones?
Perhaps only in the initial phase of the project, when we came to the construction at the moment when it was first possible to climb to the height of our floor, and found that the views we had planned actually shade the surrounding buildings.
That's when we changed the layout literally overnight from scratch.
On the kitchen counter and for the lining of the fireplace wall, granite was used.
The interior is dominated by wooden surfaces complemented by leather, for example on the upholstery of the Norma bar and bar chairs by Arper.
How would you characterize the interior?
Are you going to make any changes or is there anything you wish for otherwise today?
I believe that it is a modern airy interior, which, above all, fulfils its purpose.
We are not going to make changes, most of the modifications after moving in took place in the plane of shielding and the living of the terraces.
Perhaps the only complaint is to the floor, when the nut wood turns out to us to be too delicate to the household with the dog.
The word architects, Ing. arch. Lenka Langerová and MgA. Kamila Hornychová, author of the realization.
The apartment is on the last floor of the new building, so it was possible to perform a completely new layout solution and several other modifications as part of the construction.
For the interior, the placement of sun tunnels in the ceiling of the corridor and the main toilets are an important feature.
This gave us daylight into the darker space of the apartment.
Also direct access from the main bathroom to the roof terrace to the USSPA pool is one of the building modifications that was very beneficial for the function of the entire apartment.
There is also a swimming pool and a hot tub.
You are not negative compared to the French, says a Muslim woman living in Prague.
You come from France.
Where did you live before you moved to Prague?
My parents are originally from Algeria.
I was born in the south of France, just off the Spanish border.
I've moved quite a bit.
I lived in Toulouse, Lyon and Marseille.
I studied journalism in France, which would allow me to work in a magazine.
So why did you decide to move out of the country?
I was beginning to feel like I was choking in France.
I just didn't want to live there anymore.
Mostly because of the atmosphere among the people.
I felt like every Frenchman was terribly negative.
People in France are negatively attuned in general, but it has gotten even worse lately.
It's interesting that you mention negativity.
Some people rate the Czech character in this way.
Believe me, you are not negative compared to the French.
It may not seem that way to some people when they come to France, because they don't see it as much as tourists.
But it was too much for me.
The big issue is money.
People feel they have little money, yet the minimum wage in France is fifteen hundred euros, which I think is enough.
Now there is a problem with people's behavior towards Muslims.
This is completely incomprehensible to me.
For example, in the street in which I lived, my non-Muslim neighbour started looking at me through his fingers just because I was a Muslim.
Like I'm evil.
That's why I didn't feel comfortable in France.
But my family stayed there.
So you decided to go to another country.
Why did you choose the Czech Republic?
I was looking for a job pretty much anywhere else and came across a vacancy at Air France here in Prague.
I confess that I did not know Prague at all at first.
I knew something about the Czech Republic, my father even told me about what was happening in Czechoslovakia, but I didn't know what to expect from Prague.
I've been here three years now, and I can't imagine not living here.
Was it a big difference when you moved from France to Prague?
Mostly because of a completely different atmosphere.
Maybe it's because I don't speak Czech, so I can't pick up any negative reactions or swearing, but I feel like people are freer here.
That I can do anything, dress however, and no one will judge me.
In France, you're always uncomfortable with someone looking at you, like when you have special clothes and the like.
In Prague, I started to feel really free.
Praguers don't care about such things, I think.
Where do you work now?
After a job at Air France, I worked for a travel website for a while.
Then a friend and I set up a website on which people offer and look for shared housing.
We are only operating in Prague so far, but we would like to extend this to the whole of Central Europe.
Do you have any Czech friends in Prague?
I have two very close friends here who are half Czechs, and two other Czech friends.
I must say that the next specificity of the Czechs is that they keep their distance more at first.
He's not letting anyone get to the body.
That's quite the difference from where I grew up.
To the south, everyone hugs and kisses on the cheek.
It's different here, but I understand it's a cultural thing, so I'm trying to adapt.
You mentioned that you don't speak Czech.
Is the language barrier a problem for you?
On the contrary, it is quite simple in Prague, because perhaps everyone here speaks English.
Even in convenience stores or in food.
I'd like to learn Czech, but I don't have that much time.
And by being able to communicate at least a little in English, I have no such need to learn the language quickly.
And every time I have a problem, there's someone to help me.
Have you encountered any negative reactions?
Like because you're Muslim?
No, basically.
Perhaps it is also because I work in an international environment that is more tolerant.
One experience comes to mind.
My supervisor, the Czech, once told me about the French football team and said something along the lines of: They are not French, they are Africans.
That was quite offended.
But that anyone would have a problem with being a Muslim, that hasn't happened to me yet.
This was despite the fact that a colleague once drew my attention to some anti-Muslim demonstrations.
He said not to go downtown, they'd call me names.
The anti-Muslim demonstrations are partly linked to the terrorist attacks.
How does the current situation affect you?
Are you afraid, for example, that something similar to Paris, Nice or Brussels can happen in Prague?
I feel safe in Prague.
But the problem is, anything anywhere can happen these days.
Until recently, I might not have imagined something like this happening in France.
And it's not just about Muslims.
Moreover, Islam does not recognize the violence at all.
To me, the people who kill aren't Muslims.
The Koran says that man has no right to kill because he is not God.
How do you feel about terrorists being cherished by your faith?
It's very hard.
I feel shame and guilt, though I shouldn't feel that way at all.
I try not to watch the reports of violence much, but every time I read something, I have a need to apologize for something that's not really my fault.
I'm a completely different person, so why should I apologize for the terrorists?
We met at George Square.
On Wednesday, Czech Muslims, along with Christians, demonstrated against the violence.
Did you register it?
I didn't know about that.
But I take it that these people feel the need to prove that they don't agree with the violence.
I don't think they'd have to do that.
Why should they feel guilty for something they didn't do?
Do you meet other Muslims in Prague?
My associates, for example, are from Egypt and other Muslim countries.
They are a little more religious than I am, so sometimes we have quite wild discussions about Islam because we all see it a little differently.
I come from France, so I went through a different education, they might have learned Islam at school.
We have different approaches, but we respect each other.
People sometimes associate Islam with the subordinate of a woman's status.
How do you feel about that?
I don't feel subordinate in any way.
Rather the opposite.
I'm a woman, I'm strong.
It has to do with the fact that you don't wear any headgear.
A hijab, for instance?
And it's the main sign of the way I was raised.
My mum, for example, is a truly principled Muslim.
He praises himself five times a day, but he just doesn't wear a scarf.
She always taught me that faith was a purely personal thing.
It's up to everyone how they interpret it.
When you read the Koran, you should make up your own mind about the things.
So when I read a passage in the Koran that says that God told the Prophet to hide his women from the eyes of others, I said to myself: I am not the Prophet's wife, so why should I hide?
On the other hand, I respect that, and if I come to, say, Iran or Saudi Arabia, where they require scarves, I will marry him.
Are you planning to stay in Prague?
So far, yes.
Nowhere else did I feel so good.
I thought about Poland for a while, but I'm great at Prague.
I can even imagine raising my own children here.
Prague is the ideal city for this, I think.
Czech Muslims, along with Christians, demonstrated against the violence.
Yachtsman Kozelska's Fenclova wind in Rio was blown into the runners-up spot.
Friday's sea rides in Rio de Janiero, Brazil, were released by Czech yachtswoman Veronica Kozelska Fencl.
In the Laser Radial class, she moved up to tenth place before the final two races.
That would give the Czech woman a spot in the final run.
Collect the packages as pokémon.
They want to compete with the carriers.
The idea to use the planned shipment trips are the TV director Matěj Liška and the manager of the Prague music club Marek Greger.
With the idea, life was breathed into a trio of apps with different geographic reach.
We launched the national application The transfer was launched in May.
There are 1,000 cities uploaded at the moment, and we'll be expanding the network.
In the Czech Republic, we first want to learn this than we will focus more on abroad, says the 41-year-old manager in an interview with iDNES.cz.
How does the Swipt App work and who can benefit from it?
You download it and register for free.
Then you can enter the route and the data on how big a package you can manage to move and how much you want in return.
Someone might be requesting a transfer on that day.
When the route and delivery time suit, it is paired and both of them come with mutual notifications.
That's when the cottage opens, where the pair arrange a handover.
How many people do you think would have to register for each package to always find their courier?
I do not know the ideal condition, I cannot estimate how many registered and how many journeys it takes to make coverage quite optimal and each supply to be paired with demand.
It already works on the main draws and it is logically easier than, say, on the way between the villages.
The more people, the greater the potential for speed and accuracy.
People are also building trust in the meantime and finding that no one can escape with the package.
So far, have you not had to deal with such a case?
How many users has the service after two months of launch?
At the moment, we have about 5,000 to 6,000 people who create the roads.
We consider this a success and we believe that others will pack.
Isn't there a danger that the sender will wait too long?
We hope to be competition for the big conglomerates just because we are able to deliver the item on the same day and for a fraction of the price.
At a large company, you will pay several thousand for delivery within two hours.
Here you'll pay a hundred or less, because that's the road someone's already in business.
Should traditional hauliers be worried about a possible decline in customers in the future?
We hope it will be.
The market has enormous potential, the huge multinational carriers are fed here, as well as retail chains, where they all started shopping and gradually found that the quality was not the responsibility for what they paid for.
No one wants to find a note in the mailbox saying to pick up the package at the branch, not before that day after 7 p.m.
By this time I had needed the package for six hours and I was waiting at home because it was important.
We want a better, faster, functional service that doesn't annoy anyone and sends a signal to the competition to try.
Marek Greger (41) and Matěj Liška (39).
Neither has ever worked in the field of information technology.
Marek Greger works as a music club manager, Matěj Liška as a television director.
In 2014, they began preparing the Shippansee LTD app, which uses the already scheduled travel between the world's metropolises to transport packages, primarily by air.
In 2015, they commissioned a project to process the company that created applications for example for MALL.cz, Jobs.cz or ČSFD.
The programming took three quarters of a year and the app was launched in March 2016.
The application Převeveu started to develop in December last year and released in May this year.
It is a local version of Shippansee adapted for the Czech market.
The Mesík and Mesík Profi app was developed from this January and made available to users at the end of July 2016.
The intention was to do all these apps from the start, which one day would merge into one.
In the Czech Republic, they want to fine-tune the app and then focus more on the global market in cooperation with a strong investor.
The shared economy has been a topic lately, and this is a service like AirBnB or Uber.
Aren't you worried about being in an area that no one can say much about yet, where is the sharing line and where the shadow economy is?
It's the same, except a different product.
We understand that if it's a success and we go up with it, we'll be the next thorn in the side through the grey economy.
But even if someone spides and makes a profit, it is not the intention to circumvent the tax authorities and tax inspections.
Every user, either side or the other, will be encouraged to tax their income if they make the proceeds of it.
What do you think the service has such great potential?
The sender saves and earns the transfer, or reduces the cost of the trip.
Therein is the powerful idea that combines interest on both sides.
In the age of social networks that divide people, we'd like this to get this one closer together.
They can make nice stories, people are happy to help someone and talk about it.
Maybe someone's gonna bring you forgotten glasses, keys or pills.
People, in my opinion, have been missing a personal approach for a long time, we're saying about this app that it's a service to people to people.
So how do you guarantee that the courier with the package will not flee?
Each user of the app, together with the registration, will scan the ID card and enter the bank connection, payment or credit card.
These are channels that give the service and the person credibility.
Couriers also collect stars based on the peer reviews.
We will also offer insurance, the details are still being tuned.
The uninsured shipment is guaranteed by a courier in the event of loss or damage, but does not take responsibility for the content under criminal law if there is anything illegal inside and he does not know about it.
If the police stop him and find a machine gun or ten kilos of hashish in a closed package in his suitcase, he falls over the criminal liability on the sender.
Is there a danger of misuse of sensitive data from the database?
Registered are, if necessary, traceable by the administrative body, which is the only one to have the opportunity to consult it, nor are we ourselves able to see it, the data is against the misuse protected.
How much money does a courier get in the hands of a successful delivery?
The courier determines the price and gets the full amount he asks for.
The sender is charged an extra few percent for facilitating the contact.
This money is our profit, but it's only a few percent because we want to push for volume.
A courier can't be accused of not delivering the package when he actually delivered it, both receiving and delivering is verified using QR codes.
Are there any limitations?
Whether in relation to the size or content of the package?
You can take anything.
We have three sizes, small as a cube of butter, medium as a platoum of eggs and the size of a bass of beers.
After that, there is no further restriction and if someone has a place in the car, they will transport the fridge.
Plus, the sender has the option to take a picture of the package in the app, so the courier sees what he wants.
You don't even have to pack the thing unless you want to hide the contents outright.
You put the forgotten sweatshirt in the courier's hand, and that's it.
Who came up with the idea and how long did it take to run the service?
A friend got an idea for him more than two years ago, back then I didn't pay much attention to it.
Then he showed me a demo app with a transnational reach that mainly targets airline passengers.
That's when I told him I wasn't going to look for an investor, but I'd like to become one myself and put savings into it.
The next year took a development than we founded Shippansee LTD in London due to the greater credibility of the whole product.
But this is not the version you are now focusing on in the first place.
No, we focused the marketing on the Czech Republic, where we try to retroactate the app because the whole thing was in labor pain and there is still something to deal with and improve.
We are trying to respond to feedback from customers and we are not so concerned about the foreign market at the moment.
We know it's a long shot, but we're not in a hurry, we want to create a really good product for people.
Shippansee LTD was a basic and most expensive application, the other two were in a way an upgrade.
The transfer was created when we said that the national segment could be much more interesting and that we would at least learn it in the Czech Republic.
The third Mesík app is local, for the city.
But he can send a package to an exact address to the other end of the world.
It works for the sender as well as I will Převez, but the difference is that as a courier, you see the shipments in the form of the points on the map closest to you, thanks to the geo-locator on your mobile.
We called the apps for couriers who want to make a living from this, we called Mesík Profi.
So can anyone make a full profit by picking up packages around the city?
Exactly, the last app will be downloaded in Prague by a taxi driver, a student, a mother on parental leave, someone who wants to make the trip to work.
As everyone's fooling around with the pokemon right now, they can collect this just as much.
You see where there are commissions around the city, you come to it, click and see when it has to be delivered and the package is transported.
It's set up cheaper than competing services.
At the moment, we are still making a web interface that will be central to companies for sending shipments, on the web they will fill in their data about them, or create points on the map.
We are then able to create the use of the service for them every month.
Are you now engaged in the project full-time?
It's forcing us, but we're normally on the job to feed and develop the project.
We're not backed by a strong multinational investor, we're two guys, one of whom had a brilliant idea, and the other one jabed in with more suggestions and ideas.
We are now looking for an investor strong enough to manage to coax with us not the Czech market, but who should, with the pardon of the ball, go with us to a global product and become another huge market player like AirBnB and Uber.
The story part of Titanfall 2 is intended to bring almost forgotten variety.
This will be corrected by the second episode and the solo game in it will be more colourful than in the Call of Duty, according to the first information.
The length will be around the standard eight hours and the filling is to be based on the concept of network wrestling in the first part.
It is therefore possible to enjoy the freedom of movement, which in addition to running includes the possibility of using the combat titan.
In addition to the action passages, the game will also include levels focused on skilful movement.
They will be reminded of platformers and include puzzles.
To overcome them, therefore, for example, double jumps, running on the walls and a rope slide are essential.
Sometimes, in addition, it will be necessary to eliminate enemies.
There will also be maps reminiscent of maze and levels with special concepts.
In one, for example, it will be possible to lift and slice platforms and close massive doors.
You will thus adjust the shape of the battlefield.
The pace of the game should oscillate between furious action and calmer moments for exploring the unknown planet.
We'll play for a pawn Jack Cooper dreaming of a career as a pilot.
Cooper, at the start of the campaign, together with Captain Lastimosa, will be shipwrecked on the alien planet Typhon, which is inhabited by enemy soldiers.
And it won't be lenient with the wilderness there.
In addition, lastimosa takes the fatal blows in the crash, and Cooper is therefore tasked with getting the captain's titan into operation.
His dream of a career as a pilot will come true sooner than he'd expected.
But the first step will be to steal the battery necessary for the robot repair.
The Cooper's calls to the titanium will also be significant.
Players will be used as a source of information about the soldier's past, but at the same time, humorous moments will be created by robot-based communications.
For example, if the titanium dryly lists all the injuries that Cooper faces in his planned jump.
The first information about the campaign in Titanfall 2 was reported by the Polygon server.
In addition, the result will be possible to assess in just two months and Bonusweb will bring you your first impressions of the network game after Gamescom.
Titanfall 2 is released on 28. October, for PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
The THQ brand comes to life, but the original label remains dead.
Swedish company Nordic is changing its name to THQ Nordic.
After the collapse of THQ, in 2013, it acquired a number of its brands and the right to use the company's logo and the name of the company.
As a result, Nordic released the Darksiders 2 Deathnitive Edition and the Red Faction Collection package.
In addition, 23 more games are being created for the publishing house, and 13 of them have not yet been revealed by the company.
Thirty years ago, while I retired, my wife, after 30 years of marriage, found a younger man, our neighbor, to be twenty years younger.
I knew it from the beginning - first she was obviously trying to get him for a long time, then they got together.
He's such a big guy, probably her type, because she dated a similar one before me.
She went crazy for him.
Her voice even changed in those first days, she had a little girlish, amorous voice.
But when I told her I knew what was going on, she was denying it.
But I was watching the whole thing.
He would come home from work at 3:30 at the time, so she always left for three to go shopping.
Every day she tried to get her to at least see him.
Later, I found out that they were seeing him in his house, in the laundry.
How many times did I know they were there.
I got my keys, decided to catch them there.
But I don't know why, I always stayed at home in the end.
I could never go there, to take that decisive step.
You may laugh at me, but I believe my wife thoughtfully controlled me.
I soon found out I was manageable, to do what she wanted to do.
And I actually did.
Maybe I'm just a little bucket.
At the same time, my neighbors suggested to me that they knew about it, too.
I was such a jerk that I never asked them what to do.
I was afraid that if it all broke, it would be bad.
That it would affect everyone in the family was something only the daughter suspected.
So I always put it off, on and on.
But I went to his apartment once to see him, saying I needed help with something in the laundry room.
He went with me, and I told him that I had received an anonymous call, that he was seeing my wife and that everything was suggesting.
I asked him what he said.
He stood there, shrugged, looked at the ground, and said no word.
Then, too, at that time, I met his wife on the way from the store.
I told her, but she didn't believe it.
She didn't respond to it, and she didn't tell me either.
Nobody told me anything at the time.
I'm the kind of person who never went out much, who has a hard time meeting someone, let alone find a woman.
So I didn't even think about the divorce.
I kept relying on it to end one day.
I thought I'd forgive her for all this and life would go on.
That wasn't the case.
And I've basically never come to terms with it all.
I still have it in me.
I used to show it to her a lot, but in the end I gave it up for the rest.
He lives in the house next door, and I continue to live with her.
It's just rather than my wife my housekeeper.
At home, she always did everything - cooked, washed, cleaned.
She's hard-working.
I always think she's always tried to have no other reason to complain.
And you could say she's good, too.
But sometimes I'd like to pet her, hug her, and she won't.
We go for walks and shopping together, and they all think about our happy marriage.
But she once told me she never loved me.
That she liked me and loved me, but that she didn't love me.
And I see she loves him to this day, he's her god.
And I'm not enjoying this life.
Even then, when it started and I carried it very badly, I once told her that I didn't want to live and I asked what she would say if I ended it.
I wanted to know if she'd agree or not.
And I wanted to hear her say yes or no.
But she thought about it, and finally said, "But there's plenty of room."
Prime Minister Manuel Valls wants to set up a new French Islamic Foundation to serve as a bridge between the state and its Muslim residents.
Following the terrorist attacks, France is escalating the fight against radical Islamists, and the government is calling for help from the local Muslim minority.
"If the Muslims themselves do not help the state against those who violate public freedom, it will be increasingly difficult for France to guarantee the freedom of their religion," Prime Minister Manuel Valls said.
He intends to ensure that only spiritual educated in France preach in the country.
It also wants to stop the financing of mosques from abroad, with money often coming in for preachers inoculated with jihad.
By October, Prime Minister Valls wants to establish a new French Islamic Foundation to serve as a bridge between the state and its Muslim residents.
The new institution will replace the current French Foundation for Islam, which was founded in 2005 by then-Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin.
Even then, it was to contribute to making the financial flows between the mosques and the countries that finance their construction.
But she was soon struck by internal contradictions, and it never worked properly.
"It's a total failure," Valls said.
Former Interior and Defence Minister Jean-Pierre Chevènement, who is known as a supporter of the secular state, is expected to head the new foundation.
There are some 2,500 mosques and prayers in France, about 120 of them serving radical Islamism.
Since 2012, French authorities have expelled some 80 Islamic clerics from the country, and for several dozen more, they have been considering the move.
This week, German police also cracked down on the jihadist clerics.
The Imams reportedly recruited fighters for the Islamic State.
One of them ran a space where the faithful allegedly radicalized and later attacked the Sikh temple in Essen.
Immediately after the attacks on Charlie Hebdo in January 2015, a debate erupted in France over a new institution to replace the dysfunctional foundation.
All was hastened by other terrorist attacks carried out by radical Islamists in the name of the Islamic State.
The new foundation will have two main challenges - to ensure the funding of mosques from indigenous sources, as well as to oversee imams.
But it is not yet clear where he will receive the funding, even though several proposals are being considered.
One is a special charge for halal food, that is, mainly for meat from slaughterage under Islamic principles.
This tax would in practice be paid by the sellers of halal food, for the provision of the permit.
Some of the money would then go to the foundation's budget.
The allowance of €10 to €20 could also be paid by French pilgrims who go to Mecca.
Every year, about 30,000 of them set off from France for the traditional pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia.
Moreover, French mosques should feature only preachers who have passed the educational programs at the universities there.
This should make their preaching in accordance with democracy.
The government is also closing radical mosques.
"We have closed 20 of them since December and others will follow," said Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve.
"There is no place in France for those who preach hatred and do not respect the principles of our country, such as equality between women and men," he said.
Zaragoza.
An unidentified shooter was badly injured by his ex-wife on Friday morning in a shopping mall in northern Spain's Zaragoza, the Independent reports.
The shooting occurred after the woman and her daughter left the garage area in her car.
The man waited in the car outside the mall, from where he also started shooting.
According to witnesses, the man then turned the gun on himself, the Independent reports.
The woman was taken to the hospital by an uninjured daughter, and an ambulance had to arrive for the man in critical condition.
The crime took place around 11.00 in the central part of the metropolis of the autonomous region of Aragon, near the local university.
Citing the Spanish Europa Press, the Independent writes that the motive was probably the unresolved recent divorce of the two partners.

Summer wishes for light, well-diverable meals, but we Czechs are rebels and have our cravings and our heads.
So the summer gardens smell like grilled neck, brisket, pork knee.
Nothing very healthy, nothing too light, so occasionally with the exception of lettuce or toasted vegetables.
True, barbecue is economical for both time and crockery, plus it's a social issue and no one has to be locked up in the kitchen.
But there are other alternatives to make good with delicacies that make special dining, their preparation represents a small ritual, but at the same time there is no need to cook, bake, fry or choke at all times.
And they will contribute to our health.
Whether it's homemade sushi or sashimi, where quality ingredients and a few well-adapsed grifts are enough to make the preparation fun and food a real exotic delicacy itself.
As well as even easier rolls in rice paper from today's recipe.
Here, there is even no more time-consuming cooking and cooling of rice.
The paper can only be softened into the water for a moment, and then it's up to the chef's imagination how he intends to play with the fillings and accessories.
There's no kelp like an algae.
The advantage of a number of dishes of Asian cuisine today is that the raw materials are usually already commonly available.
Including pickled sweet-and-sour ginger, which is one of the basic delicacies accompanying sushi or fresh rolls.
You can also make it at home, but the real pink giard has a unique spicy sharp and delicious taste thanks to a secret recipe that mixes from several types of vinegar and ginger.
All you have to do is buy a bag of the appropriate size, and the attachment with the demonstrable antibacterial effects, which support both digestion and resentment of cough or flu, is ready.
Banana leaves.
They are used mainly in Buddhist and Hindu cultures when serving and decorating dishes as part of a variety of festive occasions and rituals.
The long ribbed leaves of the banana tree are widespread in a number of countries in Asia or South America as well as a "help" to prepare a variety of roast, cooked and fried foods that are packed in them much like foil.
The banana leaf will then pass on to the dish with a specific flavour.
We can be bought in stores with exotic fruit and vegetables, even pre-cutting in the shape of wheels.
But select only the leaves of the rich green and therefore healthy - unscathed and unscathed.
Similarly easy is the preparation of the salad from the wakame, sesame and sesame oil.
It can be bought again frozen.
Those who often eat or prepare sushi will probably know especially the kelp of nori.
In Japan, it is one of the most important types of seaweed, from which it is made by chopping, pressing and drying the so-called nori leaves - the plates designed just to make sushi.
Wakame − a deep green algae growing in the waters around Hokkaido Island - is also eaten fresh and dried and is as popular as kelp nori.
By the way, who doesn't know miso soup with wakame, allegedly Asian women have used it since they've been using it for a post-birth recovery.
And this algae has almost miraculous effects.
It cleans blood, strengthens the circulation of blood, even supposedly prevents the graying of the hair and is literally charged with minerals.
Dried and disassembled wakame also serves as a spice, for example, to season it with rice.
Fresh algae are first allowed to leak in the water, then rinse, placed in the boiling water and cook for half a minute.
It is then cooled in the icy water, cut out the centre ribs and continue to be treated as a favourite salad.
But buying it already in the finished, freezing, is the easiest solution.
All that remains is to skim the roll with the easy vegetable filling, delicious and light, full of healthy tastes.
Such a longevity bombshell.
If you resist and don't throw in an extra grilled brisket.
Eat healthy, easy and summer.
The Asians know how to do it.
Just a few special ingredients and a little bit of skill, and you have an interesting fresh meal that delicately combines flavours.
And finished in no time.
Four pieces of rice paper, 40g carrots, 40g white radish, 100g green asparagus, 60g salad cucumber, 60g wakame algae and 60g sweet chilli sauce.
A handwell of chopped coriander, a teaspoon of black sesame, a teaspoon of sriracha chilli sauce, 20 g of manga and 40g pickled ginger, a little pine nuts.
First, we'll get the rolls ready.
Soak the sultietnx for five seconds in cold water.
Then remove it and wait for it to soften.
In the meantime, cook briefly in the hot water with the asparagus sprouts, then quickly cool them down into the icy water after about three minutes to avoid losing the colour.
Place the vegetable filling on the permitted paper and pack.
Prepare the filling from white radish, carrots and salad cucumber, which are cut into delicate noodles, mix them with the sweet chilli sauce, add the chopped coriander, mix thoroughly and put on the rice paper.
Place the asparagus shoots on the banana leaf, add the rolls and at the end finish with the entire dish decorate with wakame, a pickled ginger, a slice of mango, sprinkle with black sesame and add a few pine nuts.
Britain must be content with silver in seven-seat rugby, selection Fiji takes gold
Great Britain's impressive performance in the seven-school rugby ended with a devastating hitchhike at the last hurdle, with Fiji beating the British in the final game on Thursday night at the Deodoro Stadium here in Rio, a 43-7.
The Fijians performed a master lesson in the processing, the landfill, the evasions, the support game, the line-up and the brutal power - and won gold, their first Olympic medal ever.
The defeat came with an undisguised consolation prize in the form of a silver medal - for Britain the third on the day - and the British could be proud of their performances in the inauguration Olympic Rugby Rugbys Olympic tournament, beating New Zealand, Argentina and the Republic of South Africa.
A win over the South Africans 7-5 in the semifinals that same day, she may have froze them in the final.
However, Fiji, in his form, would also be beaten by a 15-man team in full health.
It's not a consolation for the British, but they can rejoice at the fact that at least one of them will have a gold medal around their necks tomorrow: the Fijjan's lead coach is Ben Ryan, the former England boss at Wimbledon.
Great Britain has come a long way.
Eight years ago, under Ryan, they lost every game at the Adelaide Sevens.
Here they lost only one.
This defeat hurts, but progress is undeniable.
The Fiji began spectacularly, reflecting the intersections of the British for their joy.
For captain Tom Mitchell and the other teammates, it was like running behind a line of buses on the move, and the World Cup champions were leading 5-0, when Osea Kolinisau emerged from the corner.
The timer showed four minutes, and Jerry Tuwai added another down on the right flank, which was a conversion.
12-0 and Britain had a hard time touching the ball.
The brilliant Mitchel tried to stop the huge Leon Nakarawa and prevent him from scoring for the third time, but only slowed the Fijians down.
In the seventh minute, Yas Veremalua threw a touchdown in the right corner and the British trailed 17-0.
Nakarawa added another on his return, and there was still more than 1 minute left in the clock ... from the first half.
Vatemo Ravouvou then penetrated through the languid British and rushed to the line where he scored.
The conversion to a 29-0 lead was followed by a break.
It was as if Fiji had been born for the Rugby 7s, while the British were still learning to hand in their handover.
This is exactly what it is.
The British made mass changes after halftime and stopped the Fijian surge ... for the whole four long minutes, which was good compared to the first half until after the brilliant interlude of Fiji Josua Tuisov made no further.
Dan Norton tried to get an opportunity for the British, throwing a touchdown to the left corner to make it an an an.6-7. But the game was won long ago by the Pacific Islanders, and their fans on the stands sang, waved flags and danced.
It was hard not to admire the utterly emboldened approach of the Fijians.
In the final moments, Mata Viliame sweetened the Fijians' victory with another attempt.
The whistle heard from, the Fiddans embraced, and the British fell on the turf completely downholstated.
Earlier that day, Fiji had beaten Japan 20-5 in the semifinals, and the UK beat South Africa in a tight semi-final - one conversion.
Kyle Brown took the lead in the first half for the South Africans, but Dan Norton, thanks to his dazzling footwork, broke through the defensive line and scored under the hook in the second half.
The brilliant late-haul dump of Marcus Watson, brother of Anthony of the 15th-seeded England team, secured victory - and, ultimately, a silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning to win the rowing race were inspired by the cancer coach's battle
You won't find more emotional gold on these Games - and that's what to say.
From the first shot to the last, during the 220 punishing breaths in history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found another significance in their golden moment at Estacio de Lagoa.
Though there were two of them sitting by the merry, there were three voices in the ship. As the boat whizzed down the surface to the second consecutive Olympic gold in the women's doubles race, the voice of the still-present coach, Robin Williams, was still present with them in the ship. They are the first women in the history of British sport to achieve such a result.
Their superiority was absolute, overall it was their 39th race, in which they remained unsurpassed.
What we see - two excellent athletes flying across the water with the elegance of the swans - does not reflect the nature of the victory entirely.
Behind every gold medal of rowing is a battalion of the auxiliary hands, which, piece by piece, make a difference. And no hands were more helpful than the hands of a coach who didn't know 30 months ago whether he would live to see that day when he was diagnosed with cancer.
In his words, it was uncertain.
I suffered from bladder cancer that can be operated on, and I underwent this surgery.
Without the surgery, anything could happen.
It would be a very bad situation.
It changes your perspective.
The cancer was detected by Williams in December 2013.
The lucky part of the trio was that he could have taken treatment at the beginning of 2014, in the off-season, and thus reduce the blackout to a minimum - if that's what we can call it in circumstances like this.
I needed to make money, so I had to get back together quickly.
That was the impetus.
I was in the hospital and I was walking around the room - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at the time they said a few steps was enough.
That's how it started.
Rowing in itself is a journey, but this was a bit more challenging.
Immediately after the victory, their first thoughts were on Williams, who was very nervous this morning, talking less than usual as he tried to manage his own unease.
Stanning, captain of the Royal Artillery Regiment, who has had a mission in Afghanistan, said, "I've been at the bottom of my emotions this week, maybe it's a little extreme, but it means so much."
It reiterates how much it means to me, how much Helen and I worked, and so did Robin.
Up until now, it's been three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin, we wouldn't be anyone, so he deserves a huge thank you, he's the best coach in the world.
I couldn't ask for a better person for training, or a better coach.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost a single race in five years.
The pair had put on a stunning rhythm that their rivals could not match.
Even in the final 500 metres, when the crews from New Zealand and Denmark began to approach, Stanning and Glover had a very large reserve.
At most, we were concentrating at the moment.
Helen shouted, "Don't stop, stop."
It's really important not to get carried away.
We had a good start and at the same time we had no desire to achieve anything famous.
We didn't look forward to today's fireworks, we just wanted to cheer well, go out and win the race, which we did.
The pair take a year to think about it before deciding what to do next.
Glover is getting married next week, her husband-to-be is TV adventurer Steve Backshall.
Now he wants to savor that moment.
I didn't want to say it would be my last race.
That would mean too much pressure.
It took London to find out that I was the Olympic champion.
It was all so new and I was so stressed.
It took about four minutes here.
I feel a lot better about it,' she said.

Prison?
It's more like driving people over for free, says Taximafie hunter Rubeš to the groundbreaking indictment.
Six taxi drivers and a former municipal official in Prague are, as reported by TIME, the defendants.
You have filmed a series of stories in which you have uncovered fraudulent practices as well as those who are to be in the group that will stand trial.
You faced a few awkward skirmishes with the exposed players because of it.
How much is the report on the indictment of the members of the organized group for you?
I expected there to be a trial.
I'm mainly curious about the verdict.
I don't think they should be in jail, though.
It's no good.
Primarily, they should return all the stolen money.
And they should return them by driving all the people for free.
This is a rather peculiar solution.
Does this mean, then, that you do not see any punishment as effective enough?
What's enough for me is that some of them are so afraid they're not doing the job anymore.
For example, one does a pingla, another delices pizza, and one gave up on it altogether.
The defendants could theoretically receive two to eight years in prison.
Do you think that's an adequate rate?
In general, I have a problem with imprisonment.
I consider it a bad punishment.
Arresting someone in jail, especially in that case, is nonsense.
Such people should return to the companies they took from it.
For a quarter of a century they were committing to destroying our country's name and scolding people.
So let them make a good card now and deliver people for free.
I can't imagine it any other way.
It would work as community service.
As someone goes to pick up garbage, they'd get a car and drive people around Prague for free.
No, I really think they're going to get probation in the end, and they won't care.
They'll find another way to cheat somewhere.
He studied at the Film Academy of Miroslav Ondříček in Písek and subsequently at the Tomas Bata University in Zlín.
It is one of the people who started with viral videos and videos directly for the web in the Czech Republic.
He works as an editor for the internet television network Stream.cz, where he participates in a number of programmes, now he is preparing the Prague Guide programme, which is intended primarily for foreign viewers.
For them, Rubeš advises them in the form of short stories about the services in Prague and what, on the contrary, he recommends to use without fear.
Previously, he'd filmed a series called How To Do It, The City of Fraud?, A Life in Luxury, And Enough! and Prague vs. Money.
The indictment refers to them as an organized group.
Police had been following her for months.
Can such a network of fraudulent taxi drivers be described as mafia?
They're such cute mobsters, not the likes of the Godfathers.
They are more about mafiosi - juniors, but they are certainly organised.
Just in guarding each other's relay (the Taxikar stations).
Prague is all cut.
I have traced that the main railway station, for example, is not liked by Paris, Pařížská does not like with taxi drivers waiting at Karlovy Lázně (disco club)
Everybody just watches over their little place, and each group is kind of organized.
It appears to be a convoluted network.
But the defendants are joined by only seven people, six taxi drivers and one former magistrate who warned the driver against checks.
As you say, the undesirable phenomenon has not gone off the streets.
Which percentage of the Prague fraudsters in the taxi service are, according to your estimate, about?
It's a very small percentage.
The worst are still on the street.
I'm talking about Ales Ryjáček, for example.
This is a man who is really dangerous - he drives a telescopic baton in his car, and every Friday and Saturday they stand at the Charles Bridge and bring people.
The last time I rode with him, he asked me for seven hundred in three kilometres.
His police did not detain for some reason.
They've only picked a few people from the whole big group.
However, the situation is the same in other locations in Prague.
The indictment of seven people, therefore, will find it hard to eradicate the already famous Prague mishap, which appears to be much larger in size.
It's no good, of course.
It will help, but all evil is not eradicated, that is true.
Do taxi drivers who steal from foreign tourists perform at the same places you showed in the reports, the Charles Bridge or in Pařížská Street?
Yes, that's right.
In these locations, they stand every day and violate ordinances every day.
This is ignored by both the city's police and the Prague Municipality.
It's not even a cat anymore, it's total indifference.
Business of Prague taxi drivers in numbers
Yet some of them, even if it are only part of the group, will be brought to justice.
It's a break.
I must therefore ask: do you feel vindicated?
If I took it as a satisfaction, it would be wrong, because my goal was, is and always will be for the centre of Prague to improve.
And even if I feel like it's a little bit better, I'll continue to do so.
You need to push the door from the other side.
Even if the last thief stays there, we should still be doing something to remove him.
That's not enough to be content.
But it's not the same, there are of course more.
Are you still trying to confront them in the cabs?
I do test rides sometimes, and I have to say it's still bad.
Just last week, I caught a cabbie, from the same group, by the way, and was very surprised to see me again.
He charged CZK 560 for three kilometres, although he then claimed it was CZK 56 (he took advantage of a trick with a decimal).
He had a receipt for it, the cops came, and this cab driver was so cheeky, he was still going to the cops and asking them when someone would finally give him the 56 kroner.
A similar case.
The taxi driver on the meter taped the decimal and robbed the tourists of 357 crowns.
Can you say that the insolence of the fraudulent taxi drivers did not back down even after you showed the faces of those who charged pointless sums for a short ride?
Their insolence is still incredible.
What happened to the taxi driver at the £56 claimant?
The police sent him away, saying they could not argue with him at the scene because he had issued a receipt.
And that, I think, will be a problem in that court (six taxi drivers and one ex-official).
On one side there will be a taxi driver with his receipts, on the other side of the police.
But according to the Supreme Administrative Court's ruling, the magistrate may not use secret recordings from a taxi service vehicle as evidence in court.
When I was filming episodes about their scams, the taxi drivers themselves alerted me to this precedent.
I've only ever wanted to use the footage in a story.
Are you concerned that this fact could also protect them from the court?
I hope that any judge will understand that no taxi driver could drive for six or ten crowns per kilometre, because he would not be able to support himself.
You spoke of a trick with a decimal, which is being moved especially in front of foreign clients by underwater taxi drivers.
Is it still relevant, or are they worried about continuing to use this trick after the publication of your stories?
I think we've made this trick broadcast of the show popularized.
I was driving with a cab driver the other day, bragging in front of me to say he was the honest cab driver.
But then I noticed that a black cardboard was taped to the side of the meter.
When I asked him what it was, he said, "You know what it is."
When the fines didn't work too well on the taxi drivers-fraudsters, can they be warned about by the court with their colleagues?
Is there anything that can deter them from fraud?
You talked about how you think they'd always find the way to cheat.
I don't think anything can put them off.
But someone can push them out of those places.
And these are fair taxi drivers who should fight harder to get them out of there.
From my experience, I have to say that the fair taxi drivers in Prague are fortunately outnumbered.
But do they want to go against those who spoil the reputation of their services?
They have a taste, but they miss the art.
They don't know how to walk around in it, and they can't say exactly what they'd like.
When they held the demonstration (because of the proposal for a full-scale restriction coming from Mayor Adriana Krnáčová's office), it didn't sound very clear what they wanted.
They once said they weren't protesting against Uber, that they just wanted to have the same conditions as this service, then they said they wanted more than Uber.
It turned out that they just blocked Prague and it was just the best possible advertisement for Uber.
Overall, how do you evaluate the approach of the Prague Municipality in solving the issue of overcharging fares?
You can see that the criminal police had to step in to get something sorted out.
The magistrate was short on it.
They had a mole that was leaking information, which means the taxi department was doing its job for several years for nothing.
I hope they'll charge the official to the last check-up of all the thwarted checks to realize what he's done.
That's what I find the worst part of it.
I was even on one of the control runs with him, which I found out only subsequently from their roster.
It has been several months since the series' last episodes were published.
What's the response?
I think especially with foreign viewers, than the series is actually the most focused.
Every time I have friends from abroad, I play the videos for them.
And then when we walk up the Old Town Square, it's a surprise that the same people who can be seen in the footage are really standing there.
The infamous Prague celebrities.
But really.
I'd put a fling around them for people to look at them.
Museum of Communism right on the street.
My last question is clear.
Do you take a cab when you need to?
Sure.
I go with services where I don't have to pay cash, but with a card.
I use services like Uber or Liftago, where there is no possibility of fraud.
But there are also many dispatchers that are fair.
I've only taken a cab on the street once since.
The driver said to me after getting in the car, "Well, you've got guts."
Bam in disguised as an Italian tourist.
The fraudulent practices of taxi drivers were reported as far back as 2005.
The former Mayor Pavel Bém set off in the same year for a control ride in disguised as an Italian tourist and, on the first attempt, the driver cheated him for two hundred.
But the editor, Rubeš, had worse experience.
The taxi drivers charged him CZK 820 for driving from the Old Town Square to Wenceslas Square, which comes to about CZK 195 per kilometre, as the report makers calculated.
The Prague Municipality set the maximum price at CZK 28 per kilometre.
There are also other surprising sums in the recorded story: for example, a two-kilometre journey from Pařížská Street to joiners cost the tourist 400 crowns.
Expensive rides were also provided by taxi drivers waiting at the Charles Bridge.
They charge even six hundred crowns for the Angel ride, which has 2.5 kilometres.
Marble is washed mostly with clean water, as much as possible without chemistry, and the longer, the better.
The impurities come from it well, although sometimes the dirt has to be given down by a scalpel, it needs to be excreted from the folds.
It's not easy and it's not going fast, the restorer Vanesa Trostová from Oldřichov in the Grove approached her work.
Hats off to her: the tombstone is surrounded by scaffolding, on which you must climb and climb down again.
"The treadmill should be meticulous, patient, and undemanding to the working environment," she said.
In Frýdlant, this is far from the first of its restoration work.
Thanks to it, for example, the stone elements of the facade in the back of the Frýdlant town hall were restored, it also restored the statues of St Mary Magdalene in Zátiší, St John of Nepomth in Frýdlant, Pietu in Frýdlantská Okružní Street, the Marian Column in Frýdlant or atlants in the front of the spa in Nové Město pod Smrkem.
The restoration of the tombstone of Melchior, Christopher and Catherine of Rederne began in Frýdlant in 2011.
Now the surface of the stone elements is being cleaned from the embankment of the impurities and crusts, the loose stone parts are secured against the fall and shift; either they will be anchored to the wall or to each other.
They are also expected to be treated and preserved of the surface.
The inscriptions on the tomb will be gilded again.
"Then it will begin with the gilding of the inscriptions on the marble slammings with pure slice gold," said Věra Sobotová, the State Monument Care Officer of the State Monument Care Office in Frýdlant.
There are no records from the past of the tombstone to undergo any repairs.
On closer inspection, they take the holes drilled in the marble columns.
They are hundreds of years old and are the remains of the tombstone for the decoration.
It was richly decorated, unfortunately after the raid by the Swedes during the Thirty Years' War everything disappeared.
Literally, the tombstone was slashed, Sobotová noted.
In the Church of the Finding of the Holy Cross, the restorers are at home with a mild exaggeration.
After the flood in 2010, it was necessary to put in order the tombstones that were under the water, restored by the baptismal font, the mural paintings in the tomb and now the tombstone.
"We would like to get into the stained glass in the future as well," Sobotová revealed.
The church is otherwise in very good condition, we put money into maintenance and repairs every year.
Restoration work to restore the redneck tombstone will cost a total of CZK 128,000.
They will be covered by subsidies, the city will not put any of its money into this part of the renewal.
One hundred thousand crowns will go from the winnings in the regional round of the Historic City of the Year 2015 competition, the remaining CZK 28,000 is then a contribution from the Ministry of Culture, clarified the mayor of Frýdlant, Dan Ramzer.
The release of the winnings to restore the tombstone was decided by the council.
Experts' opinions on future developments in selected foreign markets tracked through indexes and comparison with the Czech capital market (PX) at a one-month and a half-year horizon.
The markets are dominated by low volatility and growth.
Who would have thought it was earlier in the year?
The US S&P500 index, which was undergoing a 12% correction in February, is now at a new all-time high, accounting for 7 percent since the start of the year.
This reaffirms the iron rule that traders should never go against the interest of central banks, which have so far always achieved their own.
In a situation where US equities are at an all-time high, the volatility rate that is currently at its lowest since 2014, when markets grew contentedly and without fear by the US central bank's quantitative easing, and where, like today, the volatility index (VIX), it remained stable below the 12 percent mark.
And they don't.
Although the Fed continues to prepare markets for a gradual rise in interest rates, quantitative easing in both Europe and Japan is in full swing, and last week the Bank of England has also lent a hand to the work, buying £70 billion of bonds in the next six months.
The new wave of quantitative easing is therefore pushing already low yields even lower and contributing to the near-complete elimination of risk and fear of the future.
How long will this condition last?
That, of course, is a million-dollar question.
But there are no risks in sight at the moment, the world economy is undergoing almost constant growth without major fluctuations, the situation in the commodity market and in China stabilises, and Brexit is basically no longer a topic, so we should not be too surprised if US equities continued to hold out in a similarly calm regime.
Too bad Juncker isn't studying Klaus!
I am very pleased that my friend Michel Barnier has accepted this important and challenging task.
I wanted an experienced politician for this difficult job, said the head of the European Commission, Juncker, when the French politician (really experienced, as he has been proliferating through so many diverse transnational political functions that a better example of the so-called European elite would be difficult to find) was the European Commission's chief negotiator of the terms of the UK's departure from the EU.
Juncker's selection has been blown out by the hope that it is in the EU's grave interest to look for forms of future friendly coexistence with Britain.
However, most British media took the name Barnier as the Juncker War Act.
Barnier is a European rock-solid federalist.
He hates the Great Britain.
As the European Commissioner for the Internal Market (2009-2014) he was in charge of reforming European banking law.
It was taken in the way that only he could have embraced it: a hardened enemy of the Anglo-Saxon concept of the free market and the model of capitalism.
Proponents of multilateral regulations co-authored the concept of the so-called Banking Union, and he pushed through legislation with exorbitant hard regulation by financial sector and services.
So this Michel Barnier, the representative of Paris in the dispute with London, will be a tough, adamant and, apparently, reckless negotiator.
I guess that's not good news.
In this context, how not to recall the calm and friendly division of the Czechoslovak federation, to which the balance sheet, the overview and capacity for the empathy of Prime Minister Václav Klaus contributed so much.
That is also why today, Czechs and Slovaks and Slovaks can be the closest friends and allies.
It is a pity that Juncker did not learn the lessons from Václav Klaus - at least in this one.
It would be for everyone's sake!
Earthquake around Putin?
The ruler of the Kremlin dismissed his close Ivanov.
Russian President Vladimir Putin fired Sergei Ivanov from the post of president's chief of staff on Friday.
His place will be taken over by Anton Vajno.
Russian media reported the news, citing a report by the Kremlin's press service.
Putin has indicated that he is releasing Ivanov at his own request.
At a meeting broadcast on Rossiya 24, the president said he was reaching out to Ivan's wishes on the appointment of him for wanting to be the head of the presidential office for a maximum of four years.
At the same time, he announced that Ivanov would be his special representative for ecology and transport.
The news of the replacement at the head of the president's administration, which will now be led by Ivanov's previous representative, Vajno, is considered quite surprising.
Ivanov, who is 63, is described as one of Putin's closest associates.
For example, this former KGB officer has held the positions of Defence Minister and Deputy Prime Minister in the past.
He will now leave the chair of a member of the president's security council.
But Ivanov, in a meeting with Putin, said that he was actually a record-breaking length of time at the head of the administration of the head of state.
He lasted four years and eight months.
In this context, he recalled that in the 25 years since its establishment, 11 people have already taken turns in this post.
Neither Kvitova nor the debs Strýcová and Šafářová will play in the final.
So far, neither of the tennis matches on Friday has been converted to the final appearance.
Petra Kvitova lost her fight to the first time, succumbing to Monica Puig's Puerto Rican's surprise in sets 4:4, 6:1 and 3:6.
Kvitova was followed by Czech debs Šafářivá with Strýcová.
The Williams sisters' slayers were reaching for the win in the first set, but they missed two set points and the Russian eventually captured the set in a shortened game.
They lost the second set by a 4-6 margin.
Czech rowing rowing scores in the morning of the morning's Rio programme were recorded: skipper Ondřej Synek won his semi-final with a shot, beating second-placed Damiro Martin from Croatia, despite the slowdown at the end by almost a second.
Good today, the conditions were great, the wind calmed down.
I tried to save as much as I could, Sonny said.
Unlike him, his opponents had to fight for advancement.
So it took some away from them, that's what it might be easier for tomorrow.
But I'm not saying it will be easy, it's just playing into my hands, said the rower of the Prague Dukla.
Mirka Topinková-Knapková, however, did not follow in Snyka's footsteps.
The 35-year-old rowing cast fourth in today's semi-final in her run and will start in the B final and a battle for 7th to 12th place in the first place on Saturday.
Gold from London is not so defending.
I didn't make the final at the Olympics for the first time.
I'm a little bit sorry, but on the other hand I did a quality race and I gave it everything I could.
The competitors were just better, with Topinková Knapková bowing down in front of them.
She fought to the end and believed that she would make the top six at her fourth Games.
She gave up the fight just before the finish.
I knew the girls were even, that anyone could come out of that field.
I was surprised by the Chinese woman for having such a finish.
And I thought I could advance to the final through the Austrian.
Unfortunately, she was the race of her life today, she said the 2011 world champion.
Far behind the final gates in Rio, young shooter Filip Nepejchal, who failed to make his way out of qualifying for the second time, this time the crumbs in the lie.
In it, Nepejchal took 33rd place.
Qualifying was best for the Russians.
Sergei Kamensky advanced from the first to reach 629 points, the second by Kirill Grigoryan (628.9).
The Nephechal shot was worth 620.5 points.
Athletes also spoke for the first time in the Rio programme, among them the Czech seven-time women's seven-time players Kateřina Cachová and Eliška Klučinová.
Cach is ranked 11th after the second event of the Olympic competition, with Czech record holder Eliška Klučinová 22nd.
Leads Britain's Katarina Johnson-Thompson, who jumped to a height of 198 centimetres, as did the second Belgian, Nafissatou Thiam, in the lead.
Both took care of the historically best high-nake performance in the seven-ball.
They tried to jump 201 centimeters, but failed.
German, Russian, who's worse?
Leasuring the absurdity of the question so asked: German society has undergone deep self-reflection, whereas Russian society has not.
In both of Euro-South Asian nations, dictators were present in the 20th century, and regimes that were inhuman, brutal, and terrible came to power.
From 1917 to 1989, the Russian Bolsheviks contributed largely to the 94 million victims of communism, which is presented in the Black Book of Communism, whether it was daily individual repression, targeted famines, incompetent warfare or inhumatic experiments.
The Nazis wiped out around 6 million Jews in an inhuman manner, and the total victims of World War II were estimated at 60 million.
In the occupied or abandoned territories, the Germans and the Soviets carried out atrocities.
In Germany or the USSR, not only a few individuals were guilty, but a large part of the nation participated in these crimes, either actively, passively or just by cowardice or by sticking their heads in the sand.
This is not the specifics of these nations alone, we Czechs are similarly guilty.
In Germany, the imminent end of the war came the denacification, the Nuremberg Tribunal.
But the most important came later.
When the children grew up, they started to ask: Daddy, Grandfather, why did you attend such atrocities?
How could you have done that!
This has brought real reflection and healing society.
Until recently, the German elites cared mainly about the country's prosperity, the eradication of poverty, the well-being of their citizens.
Now they have other (often naively idealistic) goals, but they certainly don't care about tying back Alsace-Lorraine or someone - to revanch - militarily attack - perhaps everyone will recognize it.
After the lost Cold War in Russia, there was no major reflection.
The window of possible positive changes was finally closed at the turn of the millennium when a former KGB (sic!)Vladimir Putin officer came to power.
The often criminal past is celebrated in Russia today.
The policy of Putin's Russia is the revanche, the conquest of lost territories, the humiliation of the West.
Health, the prosperity and the future of their own people are no value to the faithful.
Bite theirs, and the strangers will be afraid.
I still believe that this is only those decades of despotic regime that the Russians are not genetically or culturally inferior - predestined to Asian (self) tyranny.
Who is benefiting from the rise in tensions around Crimea?
Ukrainian army.
In recent days and hours, the situation has worsened at the Ukrainian-Russia border in the Crimea region.
Who benefits from the growth of tension?
After a prolonged period of relative calm, relations between Ukraine and Russia were again in a further deterioration.
The pretext of the Ukrainian side became the Crimea peninsula, which was annexed to Russia more than 2 years ago and is part of its territory.
Of course, the reports from both rival parties contradict each other and it is difficult to verify independently, so do we only have the opportunity to think about the old familiar question who is benefiting?
According to reports from Moscow, there have been terrorist attacks on Crimea from the Ukrainian side, which Ukraine understandably rejects and, on the contrary, accuses the Kremlin of provoking.
Information about the arrest of Ukrainian Special Forces members on the territory of Russia came a well-known response from the pilot Savchenko case that they were allegedly abducted on the territory of Russia.
If we were to accept the Ukrainian version, in what way would Russia benefit from a deterioration in the situation around Crimea?
The simple answer is: in nothing.
The escalation of tensions around Crimea can only be damaged by Russia, mainly by the West in the form of further tightening of sanctions and intensifying the anti-Russian campaign.
In the last year, there has been a retreat of attention to the situation in Ukraine against the background of the immigration crisis in Europe.
The Ukrainian leadership has already lost credit to its residents, with the current support of President Poroshenko at around 15%.
Ukraine's economy would have been bankrupt long ago if it had not been for the EU's generous financial injections and, most importantly, the IMF.
In this situation, the Ukrainian regime needs to clamply attention to its country again in order to justify its further requests for financial assistance and to try to improve its reputation before voters in its own country.
President Poroshenko and other members of the leadership of the forces again want to prove themselves strong men who are not afraid to stand up to the great Russia as well.
It is to be hoped that all those who are attempting to spark an open conflict between Ukraine and Russia will eventually realize their enormous responsibility for the lives of not only the soldiers, but of all the ordinary people on both rival sides and will stop their hostile actions in time.
Bulgaria reports inflation for the first time in eight months
According to national statistics, the monthly inflation rate reached 1% in Bulgaria in July.
This is the highest in a few years (as of June 2012) and the first non-zero value since October last year, when a positive inflation rate of 0.2% was published.
The annual average inflation rate, as measured by the CPI index, over the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016) was -0.8% compared to the previous 12-month period (August 2014 - July 2015).
The consumer price index in July 2016 was 101.0% as of June 2016, i.
The inflation rate since the beginning of the year (July 2016 compared to December 2015) was -0.2% and the annual inflation rate in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -0.2%.
Compared to the previous month, a rise in the travel of the following consumer goods groups was recorded in July 2016: food and soft drinks (1.7%), transport (1.8%), culture and recreation (6.3%), restaurants and hotels (1.2%), other goods and services (0.3%).
Prices fell for clothing and footwear (2.2%), furniture, household goods and routine maintenance (0.5%), health (0.1%).
At the same level as the previous month, prices for alcoholic beverages and tobacco products, housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, remained at the same level.
The US Secret Service is said to have been tracking the Russian hacking attacks for a year.
Information about the Russian attacks became public last month, when the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) announced that it was looking into an attack on the deputy's party headquarters of the Democrats.
However, no official report is mentioned in Russia's involvement in the attack.
Moscow denied involvement in the attack.
The news of the surveillance of the alleged Russian attack was top secret, as it would reveal that the US Secret Service is monitoring the hacking attack and the way they do it and what sources they use could be detected.
The offensive action is said to have involved two Russian intelligence services.
New Counsella for Cybersecurity Advisory Forum
The material about the follow-up of the Russian trail was encrypted and only a small group of experts had access to it, Reuters wrote.
Of the public figures, only a small group of eight leading members of Congress were informed, called the US Gang Eight.
It is made up of the heads of both chambers, Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan, the Democratic leader in both chambers, Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid, and four members of the congressional conscription and security committees.
The incumbent Democratic Party leader, Donna Brazile, announced on Thursday that she was creating a cybersecurity advisory board to "promise future attacks and ensure the first-class protection of Democratic Party servers."
The smoked salmon of Albert was a dangerous parasite.
The chain apologized.
Based on the consumer's suggestion of health problems after consuming the food, the wild-smoked salmon - bits 100g, the expiration date 22.11.2016, the Prague health officials inspected the Albert stores on Wenceslas Square and the Bridge.
The inspection found that batch L23012562/T4 with a use-use date of 22.11.2016, which the customer pointed out, is no longer available and therefore the product of the same batch with the expiry date 11.12.2016.
Laboratory examination confirmed the presence of Anisakis spp. Anisakis simplex.
It is a parasitic worm of the digestive tract of the marine mammalian.
This is a danger to humans - larvae in the body cavity or muscle of the fish are a strong allergen and human-gained living larvae can enter the internal organs through the stomach wall, Šticha said.
We are very much apologetic to customers for the problems with this branded product.
We immediately withdrew the batch from sale and, as a precaution, we withdrew all other batchs of this item.
The misconduct occurred on the part of the supplier we are in negotiations with and at the same time we had this product tested ourselves, Albert spokeswoman Barbora Vanko told News.
If the customer bought this product, they can return it at any of the chain's stores and get their money back.
The larvae will be destroyed by frost and sufficient heat treatment
The seller was Nekton - the Grows.
The presence of the dangerous product was reported by the hygienists to the Prague and Central Bohemian Veterinary Administration.
According to the server, the free-at-authority-freepotin.cz people may get sick with anisakiosis, which occurs to severe abdominal pain, vomiting and nausea, or the disease can be done ash-free, the Czech News Agency reported.
The symposomethings will be given an hour to two weeks after eating of an insufficiently heat-treated infected fish.
After three weeks of the disease, the larvae usually spontaneously leaves the digestive tract.
Adult worms and larvae are sensitive to both higher and low temperatures, so they are killed with sufficient heat treatment of fish meat or when frozen.
Veterinarians have also currently checked the salmon with the recipients of imported goods in the Central Bohemian Region.
Three of the five samples examined had the parasite in them.
The shipment with 1700 products came to the Czech Republic according to the State Veterinary Administration (JRC) in early April.
It has been shipped out, in the vast majority to the Ahold chain, to date 919 packs.
The product's unsold stock is currently being withdrawn from the stores, SVS spokesperson Petr Pejchal told the Czech Press Agency on Friday.
Veterinarians immediately banned the sending of other products from the warehouse immediately after the discovery of the positive samples.
A 17-year-old British woman wanted to flee Raqqa, killed by a Russian air raid.
After the initial enthusiasm and quick marriage to the jihadist, who was soon killed, came a sobriz.
The expected paradise of the Caliphate for the British girls was transformed into a hell of a land from which there was no escape.
The girl was in contact with her sister, Hali, according to relatives.
She phoned her on the phone to Britain repeatedly and confided that she wanted to go back home.
Leaving the Islamic State is like trying to escape from Alcatraz.
They are ordered to shoot indiscriminately, The Telegraph quotes the lawyer for the late girl's family, Tasnim Akunjee.
The last tracks led to Raqqa, from there the girl heard from for the last time.
Then came only the news of her death, which could not be verified.
The family communicated with her from an apartment in East London.
Together they discussed how she could get out of Raqqa and cross the Turkish border.
There they hoped to meet the former student again.
But Kadiza was probably killed before she could escape, because the house she was in was flattled by the raid in May, the British ITV News reported.
The TV added that the bomb was apparently dropped by a Russian plane that was attacking an IS stronghold in Syria.
You'd take the blue from the sky just to get your child out of the dangerous area, said Tasnim Akunjee, the family's lawyer.
In the week (Kadiza) thinking about fleeing Islamic State territory, an Austrian woman was caught trying to escape and, according to the available information, she was publicly beaten to death.
I think she interpreted it (Kadiza) as a warning and decided not to take any risks, she says, according to the BBC Akunjee.
The family would do anything.
Kadiza Sutlana, along with 15-year-old school friends Shamima Begum and Auroa Abas, set off on the journey of 17. February last year.
At home, all they said was that they were going out.
But they focused on Gatwick Airport and from there through Turkey in IS-controlled territory.
According to the lawyer, the girl's family did everything in her power to get Kadiza back.
You'd take the blue from the sky just to get your child out of the perilous area and this family did all the best they could, to get their daughter home.
But it was impossible without risking them being caught themselves, the lawyer added.
The only positive, he says, is that the fate of Kadiza can serve as a deterrent for other girls or even boys who are fooled by Islamist propaganda.
"There are many instances of people going there, realizing how things are going there, they understood how different it is from the Islamic State's propaganda promises, and they wanted to come back," Akunjee said.
The fate of Kadiza's classmates is unknown.
But as they have also fallen silent, their families must accept that they are most likely dead.
To the prison for money.
In Scotland, you can go to jail without committing a crime.
For many centuries, the community of Inveraray was the county centre and the residence of the Duke of Argyllo.
Since the mid-18th century, the town hall has been held courts and the basement under the hall has served as a local prison.
The conditions in which the convicts dwelt were pathetic and many prisoners attempted to escape.
A lot of them and successfully.
That's why the city's representatives decided to move the prison premises to a new location.
The new building was completed in 1848 and was much more welcoming to the prisoners, with heating and gas lighting.
Either way, it was not in operation for a long time, its closure was already closed at the end of August 1889, as smaller correctional facilities were costly for operation and not paying much.
The story of the convicts and the hunt for ghosts.
The prison opened to the public for the public a century later, visitors can compare the old building with the new one to see for themselves how different conditions prevailed.
The guides in period costumes enhance the authentic experience.
There is also an appetite room in which visitors can learn what forms of punishment were applied to criminals, whether it was breaking fingers or burning marks on the body.
As part of the tour, tourists can be confined to one of the cells, mostly for a souvenir photo, or to create the feeling that the prisoners are experiencing behind bars.
In addition, the Inveraray prison is one of Scotland's most famous locations, where it is allegedly haunted.
Several groups of paranormal hunters have already set out there, and to this day the museum allows people to come to hunt for some spirits.
Such a night, however, will cost £300, which is roughly £9500.
In addition to this popular tourist attraction, the village also attracts to great food, the surrounding panoramas and history.
'Animé' effect on Snapchat is criticised as an Asian caricature
According to Snapchat, this filter is inspired by the animos, but some observers say it is racially insensitive.
Every day, the Snapchat app allows about 150 million users to change reality and toy with identities in ways that border on absurdity.
You can make yourself into a pineapple, a dog or a character that seems to have stepped out of Roy Lichtenstein's image.
Filters are simple tools that distort reality and generate more than 30 million improved selfies every day.
Any error will be made public immediately.
Snapchat filters have come in for criticism in the past, accusing the app promoting blackfacing or supporting white shades of skin as an ideal of beauty.
So when she offered users a filter this week that gave them slanted eyes, twisted teeth and inflated faces, some critics called it a racist caricature of Asians - "yellowface."
And they asked whether these repeatedly questionable issues were pointing to a larger problem in society - the diversity problem.
On Wednesday, Verge and Motherboard wrote about it, and the novelty and indignation quickly spread, and Snapchat said the next day that he had rescinded the job.
The company offered an explanation: The filter was intended as a manifestation of the bills to the characters of the animated ones, not as a caricature of Asians.
But to the observers who witnessed racism, the filter reminded of the painful stereotypes of action.
The others, bluntly, declined the comparison with the animos.
Grace Sparapani, an American art student from Korea whose tweet about the photos was widely shared, said in an email that the filter was "at least, harmful and embarrassing."
She added that "it is difficult to argue against comparing the obvious Asian cartoon and filter effects.
It turns out that the filter is not only about the yellow face (yellowface), but that the yellow face is dragged to the scorpable extreme.
Snapchat is not the only society that has crossed these cultural boundaries.
American culture seems to have an endless struggle for diversity and inclusion, from the sitting rooms in the corporations to the Holywood, and the facilities we all carry in our hands.
And a huge number of young people on Snapchat - who are more racially diversified than their older partners - may mean that even greater sensitivity can be expected.
"When one Snapchat filter creates a picture that is offensive to some user," Katie Zhu, 25, said in an interview on Thursday, "it's just very hard to go unnoticed today, as it was before."
Katie Zhu, the product manager and designer who works for Medium, decided on Thursday to delete her Snapchat account and invited others to do the same.
In an article for Medium and in an interview over the phone, she said she believed that racially motivated problems were reflected by the lack of diversity in the recruitment of workers in Snapchat.
Katie Zhu criticized the overwhelming white, totally male management of the company and finished the article with the hash tag: #DeleteSnapchat.
"It's either that they don't have any diversity among the staff and colorful people at the moment when these things are decided," said Zhu, who has a Sino-American origin, "or colored people work there, but not in positions to feel safe or pleasant to speak."
Other observers share her view - a complaint that Snapchat left largely unanswered.
The company does not disclose the numbers regarding the diversity of its employees, stating that it has the status of a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat declined to speak about the racial origins of its employees, but according to a spokesman, the company recently hired a recruitment officer to focus on the under-represented population and internal management of inclusion.
Zhuová adds: "I wonder if they really need other such users who can say that it is not okay," with the fact that they will keep their account cancelled.
Army officers misrepresented intelligence information about IS, says parliamentary committee
The parliamentary committee said in a report issued Thursday that officers from the central headquarters of the United States were changing intelligence reports to portray a more optimistic picture of the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and in Syria than the events provided from the country.
According to a preliminary report by the Task Force, compiled by the Republican chairman of the Armed Forces Committee, the Intelligence Committee and the Defence Subcommittee, "superfile discontent" among Central Intelligence Agency analysts found that their superiors changed their assessments of American efforts to defeat the Islamic State.
The Central Command, known as the CentCom, is the military central in Tampa, Florida, overseeing U.S. military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
The press release on the report reads: "The intelligence outputs approved by the Centcom's senior officers usually offered a more positive picture of the US counter-terrorism efforts than those confirmed by the facts on the ground and were consistently more positive than those obtained from other parts of the intelligence community."
"What happened at the Centcom is unacceptable - our fighters are harmed when a flawed analysis is presented to the superior policymakers," said Ken Calvert, a congressman and Republican from California.
Failure to run Centcom goes back to the top of the organization.
The 10-page report details the central staff's continuing problems in describing and analysing US efforts to train the Iranian forces in the 2014 and 2015 EuropeanOavt.
While there is no decisive evidence that the heads of the Obama administration have ordered the reports to be amended, the report states that the analysts felt that they were under pressure from the Centcom leaders to present a more optimistic view of the dangers posed by the Islamic State, or IS.
"In the first half of 2015, many of the Central Staff's press releases, statements and congressional statements were considerably more positive than what the events actually were," the report reads.
For example, a Centcom official has publicly stated that a major military attack to take over Mosul could begin as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city, remains under the control of the Islamic State.
"This is very clear after months of investigation," Representative Mike Pompeo, the Republican representative from Kansas, said in a statement.
From mid-2015 to mid-2015, the highest-ranking US Central Central Rescue Service Intelligence Service personnel manipulated the outputs of the staff's intelligence services in order to downplay the IS dangers in Iraq.
Republicans formed a task force after learning of analysts' concerns that intelligence information related to the Islamic State was being manipulated.
The report released on Thursday must be followed by further investigation into further investigation.
There is still another investigation in the Central Intelligence Service, led by the General Inspector General of the Ministry of Defence.
Democratic members of the Intelligence Committee released their own findings on Thursday, which corresponded to some of the Republican working group's conclusions.
"Between 2014 and 2015 Centcom created a very close process to compile the evaluation of information on IS and the security forces of the Iraqi security," Representative Adam B. Schiff, the Committee president and the representative of the Democrats.
In Adam Schiff's words, the process "to distort the output of the intelligence services," it damaged morale among analysts and "insufficiently taken into account of dissenting views."
However, Schiff and the Democrats say they found no evidence that the White House was trying to press Centcom analysts to adjust their findings to "a draft or political situation."
Preliminary results of the parliamentary inquiry were released in the Daily Beast on Tuesday.
Last August, the New York Times reported on an ongoing investigation by the Pentagon inspector general, which was opened following complaints from Centcom analysts.
Lieutenant Commander-in-Chief Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, said in a statement that the Defense Ministry would not comment on the parliamentary report as the Inspector-General's investigation was still ongoing.
But he said that "experts sometimes disagree on the interpretation of comprehensive data, and that the intelligence community and the Ministry of Defence welcome a sound dialogue on these fundamental national security issues."
The investigation has implications beyond the question of whether the US-led bombing in Iraq and Syria is successful (a statement that now declares an increasing number of defense officials).
Nevertheless, last year's accusations have raised question marks about the extent to which President Obama can rely on the central staff to honestly evaluate military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, and other crisis sites.
Criticism of Islamic State coverage has been aloof for more than a decade of the years, when Centcom intelligence analyst Gregory Hooker wrote a research paper stating that President George W. Bush - despite the objections of many analysts - defended a small unit in Iraq and devoted little time to reflecting on what would be followed by the 2003 invasion.
Hooker also played a key role in opposing the Islamic State's intelligence services.
Last year, authorities announced that Hooker's team had concluded that despite public statements to the contrary, aerial strikes conducted against the Islamic State refineries did not significantly weaken the financial resources of the terrorist group because the group had built temporary refineries and sold oil on the black market.
The Times reported in September that the findings but had not been forwarded outside the central staff.
Centcom commander, gene. Lloyd J. Austin III, was then criticized for the past year after many lawmakers found the Senate's testimony to be over-reported to war.
General Austin resigned in April and was replaced by a gene at Centcom. Joseph L. The boiler.
The U.S. won the field hockey game in the fourth game in a row, so today a deciding game will be played in the UK team
Katie Bam scored three goals in the match against Japan, which ended in a 6-1 victory, and scored the first two goals of the first two goals of the game for the American men's hockey team on Thursday.
Five tackles in two matches is a success of remembering, but Bamova (27) said she was not sure if she had ever managed to do so.
"I have no idea," she said.
I'm not one of those who write down their goalposts.
But this is what he knows: The American's Olympic tournament lead to 4-0 matches and shares first place in the group with the UK, who remained unbeaten on Thursday after Japan's 2-0 defeat.
The UK and the United States will face the final match of the first round on Saturday.
Both teams qualified for the quarter-finals and the match will determine who from the group of six teams will finish in first place and who in second place.
The first-place team will avoid the strong Danes, who are at the top of the second group, a little longer.
However Saturday's game ends, the Americans caused a stir here with their surprise drive, four years after they finished among the 12 teams at the London Games.
There was also Bam on that team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and first picked up a hockey stick for field hockey when she was 3 years old (her older twins played in Drexel) and entered the national team when she was 16 and became his youngest player ever.
The 2008 Olympics eluded her because she did not make it to the final roster.
Then came 2012, when neither she nor the members of her team was doing very well.
The next year, the England's Craig Parnham was appointed as coach and things began to change.
"Cultural change, mental change, physical change," Bam said.
We didn't have the pace of work in London as we have today.
We made a complete turnaround.
On Thursday night, Bamova started in the first half by scoring a goal with a bekend.
India entered the match without winning the tournament, but the team proved surprisingly tough and kept the scoreboard 1-0 until the end of the third quarter when Bam seized the opportunity.
She escaped down the left side of the field, then slipped through to the centre and scored the ball in the goal to take the Americans ahead 2-0.
Melissa Gonzalez added the final goal in the middle of the fourth quarter.
The elimination of the American goaltender, Jackie Briggs, who helped one goal in each of the three victories, was the first ever of the tournament.
He's in excellent shape.
Just like Bam.
"We're in a good place now," Parnham said, but how good it is will depend on the outcome of Saturday's game.
Zen trampolines in the middle of the Olympic rampage
No matter where you are, it doesn't matter what time it is - is the Olympics.
From the events in Rio de Janeiro, there is a sense of persistent, indescribable and biased alternating between competition and effort.
It is how the Olympic torch itself would be a hot relay stunt handed over from the champerer to a swimmer, a gymnast and a triathlete.
You can't turn on the TV, read the paper, or listen to your neighbor's interview in the coffee shop in the café without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the animosity between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there's Logan Dooley.
Dooley, the upcoming darling of women with mines in the face, is at the Olympics for the first time, and could also be among those whose names will be heard in prime-time homes between advertising and spots of sponsors if he were a swimmer, a gymnast or even a swordsman.
But Dooley (28) of Lake Forest, California, is vying for Olympic gold in trampoline jumping.
The Olympic Fire is not shining in all competitions the same way.
Farther from the center, a little in the shade are sports that are not universally recognized: air pistol shooting, archery, badminton, taekvondo.
We will always have success in the classic swimming style - and it will probably rule for a long time.
But if I may name my extraordinary favourite, let me draw my attention to the inconspicuous charm of the trampoline.
Although jumping at the trampoline has been an Olympic sport since 2000, when they were first performed at the Sydney Games, the sport remains almost unnoticed after 16 years of interventions - many of the people I have questioned have not even known that this is an Olympic sport.
This could be regional indifference.
The USA never won a medal in the trampoline jumping, and none of the athletes made it to the finals until 2012.
The awards in the men's category are usually shared between China and Russia and in the women's category between China and Canada.
This year, the gold medals from London will be huging Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada.
But the trampoline jumps are yet to be unlucky, partly because the uninitiated's ear is more likely to be suited to clowning university than the Olympics.
I must confess that I am not an expert, but merely an enthusiast watching from the ground.
It has a comic potential - the comic-book vibration of endless bouncing - but also the grace of gymnastics and diving, the two sports it combines.
The word "trampoline" is derived from the Spanish "el trampolín" which means "jumper's plate."
The inspiring champions jump on a huge trampoline that shoots them up to a height of up to almost 10 meters and perform sets with several elements (salta, screws and combinations) before finally landing on their feet again.
According to the official Olympic programme, they are evaluated according to the design, difficulty and "a-to-air" meeting.
In Rio, there will be competition from athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women.
The usual trajectory of the Olympic track is forward.
The gold medalists must go on, faster and even higher, sometimes to the end, sometimes back and forth, up and down.
It seeks to catch up not only with the finish line or the starting wall, but, as the TV news bulletin board, also a different imaginary line: a world or Olympic record.
This unanimous endeavor is classy, admirable, a little fanatical - and sufficient to bring the audience to tears.
But I think it's also a bit exhausting when you're watching the Olympics.
The trampoline jumps bring relief in this respect.
The track of the athlete on the trampoline is upwards.
The point is not to move forward.
He or she blush as if they were in a state of weight without weight like astronauts, flying up, then down, and then again effortlessly upwards.
Without competition and, of course, the difficulty of it is not possible, but for the duration of the set-up there is no furious struggle to achieve the goal, no distance ameasha, but only a perfect, graceful spring of time and gravity.
This is just the closest, when the Olympics and the zen will come closer.
The women's qualification and final takes place on Friday afternoon, at 1 p.m. Eastern time, and the men's competition on Saturday at the same time.
NBC will broadcast the final as part of the afternoon block, which starts both days at 2 p.m.
In the midst of the Olympic madness, they promise calm, pleasant moments that you will probably miss through the other fights.
And if the only thing to get is to get attention is that male athletes will be the subject of in love-minded and materialized - as the US Gymnasium recently designed, according to the Wall Street Journal - then Logan Dooley is merely waiting for his new fans to breathe.
'Protesting Generations' in Ethiopia, a longtime US ally
Violent protests in Ethiopia
Demonstrators demanding political changes in Ethiopia have encountered violent opposition from the government.
Witnesses say many protesters were shot dead during the clashes with police.
Is there a threat of war in Ethiopia?
In the past decade, it has been one of the most stable nations in Africa, a solid Western alliance with a fast-growing economy.
Over the past months, however, the country has been engulfed in anti-government unrest, which is spreading to more and more areas.
In the last week alone, thousands of people have taken to the streets demanding major policy changes.
According to human rights organizations, the government's response was ruthless.
Witnesses say officers shot dead and killed crowds of unarmed protesters.
The circulating videos of the protests, which probably come from the close of last year or the beginning of this year, are depicted by members of the security forces beating young people with sticks after being forced to stand against the wall on their hands.
The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights is now calling for a thorough investigation.
"It has always been difficult to keep this country together and taking a step forward will be even harder," said Rashid Abdi, the Horn of Africa project leader for the International Crisis Group research group.
Ethiopia is the second most populous nation in Africa after Nigeria, and its stability is supported by the West.
U.S. military and intelligence services are working closely with the Ethiopians to remove the danger of a terrorist attack in the area, especially in Somalia, and few of African countries, if any, are receiving such assistance from the West.
Ethiopia's economy has evolved at an impressive pace.
Its infrastructure has improved significantly - there is even a new suburban train in the capital, Addis Ababa.
And the streets of the city are typically quiet, safe and clean.
But Ethiopia is hardly described as a model for democracy - the human rights organization talksutically of government repression - the opposition in the country has been suppressed, dissidents effectively silenced.
Many have been expelled, imprisoned, killed or driven far into the desert.
But that may change.
"When you choke people and they have no choice but to protest, there will be a break," said Seyoum Teshome, who lectures at the University of Central Ethiopia.
He's protesting all the youth.
Protests a whole generation.
There are many complaints, and they relate to everything from land disputes to absolute control of the power of the ruling coalition.
After last year's election, which was widely criticised, the ruling party and its allies won the last seat held by the opposition and now controls 100 percent in parliament.
At the same time, pressure is mounting at the border with Eritrea. The conflict along this inaccurately marked, disputed border claimed hundreds of lives in June.
Anyliters fear that the separatist groups that have been more or less suppressed over the past few years, such as the Oroman Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, may try to use the confusion to rearm.
There are several factors explaining why, after years of smoldering beneath the surface, these bitter sensations have now flared up again.
The first is seemingly innocuous: smartphones.
Many Ethiopians can communicate through social networks for the last few years, when cheaper smartphones have become commonly available and the provision of internet services has improved.
And even if the government bans access to Facebook or Twitter, as is normally the case especially during protests, many people can still communicate through the Internet proxies that hide the location of these people.
Several young Ethiopians spoke about how they were gathering for the protests.
There is also greater solidarity between the Oromy and the Amhary, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia.
The Oroms and the Amhara are not natural allies.
For ages, the Amhhars, largely from the Christian peaks of Ethiopia, excelled in politics and commerce, using the Oromy, many of whom are Muslim and live in the lowlands.
But that's changing, too.
"We are on our way to a unified leadership," said Mulatu Gemechu, the leader of the Oroms.
The biggest protests were in the areas inhabited by Amhary and Oroma.
Many Amhars and Oroms believe that Ethiopia is wrongly dominated by members of the ethnicity of the Tigrai, which make up around 6 per cent of the population and control the military, intelligence services, trade and policy.
The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.
Zenawi, the former rebel leader, was Ethiopia's prime minister for 17 years until his death in 2012, when he succumbed to an unmarried illness.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could see around the corner.
Analysts say he was particularly masterfully able to uncover the initial signals of discontent and used emissaries to process the opponents and get him on his side.
"The current regime lacks basic knowledge," said Abdi, an analyst at the conflict.
The new Prime Minister of Ethiopia, Hailemariam Desalegn, was drawn from relative unfamiliarity to replace Zenawi.
Unlike Zenawi, who originated in the Tigrai region of northern Ethiopia, Hailemariam comes from the south.
Analysts say he has no confidence in the Tigrejci-controlled security services.
Many fear that the result will be a further shedding of blood.
The last time Ethiopia experienced such unrest was in 2005 after thousands of people protesting what analysts described as an election that the government screwed up and then stolen.
This was followed by a crackdown, during which many protesters were killed - albeit less than in the past few months - and this period of unrest passed relatively quickly.
Development experts praised Ethiopia's leaders for visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new suburban train and measurable progress in combating poverty.
However, it is quite clear that the gradual increase in disputes within the Ethiopian government has not been stopped by this.
And there is dangerous ethnic formation.
Last month, protesters in the Arabic city of Gondar attacked Tigrejci-owned trading firms, and a social media grudge against Tigres was becoming more common.
Analysts say the protests are putting the US and other Western allies in the uncomfortable situation.
The US government is using Ethiopia as a base for drone flights over neighboring Somalia, although it recently said it had been closed.
While the West clearly wants to support democracy, it does not want its ally to break up in an already volatile area.
"That," Abdi said, "is a very sharp edge of the blade."
Donald Trump explains his statement about Obama and IS funding as a "sarkasm"
Donald J. Trump tried on Friday to downplay the latest controversy flooding his campaign by saying he didn't mean it when he insisted several times this week that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the "founders" of the Islamic State terrorist group.
The explanation raised new questions about the Republican presidential nominee's ability to speak clearly to the US public.
He also puts his supporters in an awkward position, who have been struggling to defend him in the turbulent time and must explain that he may not have been serious about his comments.
Following this motion at a meeting on Wednesday night, Trump confirmed the statement on Thursday, insisting in interviews that he had indeed not intended to say that the President and H. Clinton created IS.
However, in a Twitter post on Friday morning, Trump said he was merely sarcastic.
The post was the opposite of the claim, which was only one day when Trump said in several interviews that he was serious about his accusation.
When conservative radio anchor Hugh Hewitt tried to help Trump's remark to be avenged by recalling that Obama was seeking to destroy IS, the Republican nominee did not respond to the president.
The latest storm comes when Trump attempted to focus his campaign's attention on the economy, while his preference in the polls is falling.
Trump and Clinton participated in Michigan this week in a duel on economic issues.
On Friday, Trump tried to revisit the subject.
He warned on Twitter again that Clinton's proposals were linked to a tax increase, stating that he thought her speech was boring.
Trump has used the defense with sarcasm before.
At the end of July, when he drew a wave of criticism when he came forward with the suggestion that the Russians should be hacking into Clinton's e-mails, he later explained his remark, saying, "I'm sarcastic, of course."
This approach allows Trump to push the boundaries of political statements and temper them as needed.
"I think it's his way of testing the extent to which some of the messages have a response from his supporters to find out how they react, and according to the reaction, he "given the explanation" in one way or another, said Ruth Sherman, a communications specialist who followed the language the two candidates used.
But I also think he is dexterfied in his statements and knows that they are vague enough to be explained differently.
As the poll results in his favor continue to decline, Trump has adopted an even more snorting tone in recent days, instead of tempering things for general voters.
A new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist, published Friday, showed that Tump is behind Clinton in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado, and very close behind in Florida.
Trump is even attempting to avoid apologies for the provocative statements he calls, but he often accuses his critics of misinterpretations of his words or misunderstanding his sense of humor.
But along with Trump facing increased attention in the closing months of the presidential campaign, Trump's jokes have put Trump's jokes in the awkward position of his devoted followers, who must stand by him publicly, no matter how provocative his remarks.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former mayor of New York City, who is one of Trump's most prominent supporters, had to defend the candidate extensively in an interview with CNN on Thursday.
"I believe what he says is a legitimate political comment," said Giuliani, when asked about the credibility of Trump's claim that Obama and Clinton had founded the Islamic State.
This is true in the sense that before Obama, IS was almost unknown, a small organization, which he wrongly called a newcomer. And it came about because he withdrew his troops from Iraq.
Most ordinary Republicans are attempting to argue that the Obama administration, in which Clinton served as Secretary of State, allowed IS to ramp up and fail to manage the situation in the Middle East aggressively.
Ahead of Friday's rallies in Pennsylvania, Trump continued to feed the media on Twitter for mourning every word and being biased to him.
He laughed at the "pleask, pathetic" TV scholars who are trying to understand him and said, "They can't do it!"
Several Democrats have grimlaged Trump's apology, saying it was just another piece of evidence that he was not fit for the presidency.
The café was pushed out of the market by prices. He is now returning to Greenpoint
The Verb Cafe was a shabby place in Williamsburg, where you could only pay cash, without Wi-Fi, but where the coffee had been served for 15 years.
Naturally, it was forced out of the front of the house on Bedford Avenue.
Soap Cherie - a shop that Verb replaced in the summer of 2014 - sells cupcake soaps.
The locals mourned it as the last loss of the burgeoning city.
The artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter: 'New York is a change, I know, but I still can't believe that CBGB is dead, Chelsea Hotel was out-of-fired and Verb's a soap shop now.'
But if New York is a change, it's also rediscover.
The resurrected Verb Cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of its original location.
The new Verb has wifi and receives credit cards, but some of the original employees work there and there is a similar, modest atmosphere.
Coffee is still good, too.
The manager of the new Verbo is Cisco Rodriguez, a longtime employee of the original café who is also the owner and managing director of the new post.
He started at Verb in 2001 and stayed until the end.
When one of the customers offered to pay for the move to the new post, he said he would do it with pleasure.
Rodriguez (36) left a lot of things as they were.
Verb still has the same baking tray supplier and bought the same model of the espresso machine.
He even used the lighting from the old Verbo again.
But Rodriguez said he also wanted to try something new.
He started using new ingredients.
The menu includes ham, egg and cheese sandwiches, and toppings such as capers and fried onions.
You'll also find bowls of brown rice.
The café no longer serves beer, but offers fresh fruit juices.
Nine months later, Rodriguez noted the steady influx of the original regulars.
"Many of the original customers also had to move out of Williamsburg for the prices," he said.
Last Sunday, one of those customers, Rebecca Oliveira, was here.
Mrs. Oliveira (34) lived in Williamsburg and went to the Verb Cafe often.
She even came after the cafe moved to Greenpoint.
She said that when Verb closed, she stopped drinking coffee for a while.
"I found out that what I like was the coffee and culture in the Verbo," she said.
Now he drinks his coffee again, but on that day she gave herself a mixed chai, another novelty, instead of her usual iced coffee.
Tom Rosenthal, another longtime customer, has been loyally attending the Verb since 2003.
He comes before work and orders the same thing.
"At a quarter and eight, every day, like clockwork, I come in and they're already preparing my bun with everything and butter," he said.
Photo: Rodriguez said he wanted to try something new and add new ingredients to the menu.
Mr. Rosenthal continues to order what he usually does, but occasionally he lets bacon, eggs and ham put on his bun with everything.
Rodriguez said he was not sorry for the soap deal that took his old place.
The truth is that the owners of Soap Cherie offered to make special soap for Verb and use filtered coffee from the café as an ingredient.
"I think we could still use it," said Rodriguez.
The traditional Polish residents of the Greenpoint also received the café well.
One of the new customers translated the offer to Polish, and Rodriguez said he wanted to find a place to put it on display so that his new neighbors would feel at home.
The new place has other advantages.
The local fruit juic producer wants to bottle and sell filtered coffee.
There is a possibility for the cafe to be extended to the neighbouring building.
It is enough for many customers to get their old favourite back.
Joseph Whitt was a regular customer, and when the cafe closed, he said, it broke his heart.
Mr. Whitt says that when the cafe reopened, walk in and have coffee is like coming home.
"I missed the smell," he said.
Depressing food from the time of the crisis - in the "Square Meal"
Shortly after joining the presidency in March 1933, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat in the Oval Office and was having lunch.
The Elbologist, President Roosevelt enjoyed selected dishes from 5th avenue, such as goose jade pâté and Maryland turtle soup.
But his menu for the day was more modest: a diabolical-style egg in a tomato sauce, a potato puree, and a plum pudding for dessert.
"It was an act of cookery solidarity with the people who suffered," said Jane Ziegelman.
Her husband, Andrew Coe, added, "It was also a message to the Americans how to eat."
The couple, who live in Brooklyn Heights, devote themselves to gastronomic history.
Andrew Coe's latest book, "Chop Suey," was about Chinese cuisine in America, while Jane tells the life story of a residential home on the Lower East Side through food in his book "97 Orchard."
Their new joint work of "A Square Meal," which will be published by Harper on Tuesday, is the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression.
They themselves showed cooking solidarity and met with a reporter for dinner at the Eisenberg's sandwich shop, a small austere buffet in the Flatiron district, which has been in operation since the crisis.
Jane (54) ordered cream cheese and a sandwich with chopped olives, and Andrew (57) had a turkey, a mash potato and mixed vegetables.
The reporter ordered a meatball, which the couple said was well suited to the food conversation during the crisis.
"The Arabs were very popular," said Miss Ziegelman.
It was sold with peanut, liver and bean meatball.
They were made from that admixture and other cheap foods that set the ingredient.
Remove a number of peanuts you'd have to eat for dinner.
Andrew Coe grimaced.
"They'd be lying in your stomach like lead," he said.
In the years before the crisis, American cuisine, especially in rural areas, was served in the form of a buffet to eat what you eat.
The women's teams were cooked for farm workers and breakfast, lunch and dinner were served freshly baked pie.
It was the Americans who sent food to the hungry Europeans during the First World War. "A Square Meal" follows the ways the nation was dealing with the fact that it was suddenly not a land of abundance.
"It was a time when food became a central, feared point for the American people," Coe said by way of explaining why he and his wife decided to write about it.
Just as feared was the new budget diet: mysterious foods were expanded, such as meatballs and casinar food, as "an amazing way to use the remains," Ziegelman said, as the chefs could hide non-aesthetic ingredients under a layer of creamy sauce.
Fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dried fruit.
The meat - for years the central point of American food - has become an economical-estedized luxury.
The strange mixtures that were to serve as a caloric and nutritional filler took precedence over taste or even common sense in cooking.
During the book explorations, which contains the recipes, Miss Ziegelman prepared a period meal of baked onions filled with peanut butter.
"It wasn't a popular addition to the evening table," said Andrew Coe.
Jane Ziegelman emphasized, "It was surreal."
Peanut butter with roasted onions doesn't go together.
It was typical of a lot of home recipes.
As never before and before, the domestic economists - among them Louise Stanley, the shrink of the Federal Office for the Home Economy from 1923 to 1943 - directed the country's eating habits.
They published recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, urged women to take the reins of the budget, and the slopes, such as cream spaghetti and carrots, converted into tasty meals.
The book "A Square Meal" is a celebration of historical delicacies.
In particular, desserts arose in the government's response to its hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover's pose, "I'll grind my pie."
While publicly praising the simple Iowa farmer's cuisine of his childhood, he dined as the chosen millionaire he had become.
"He was happy to eat continental cuisine like fish with cucumber sauce," said Andrew Coe.
He ate in a nearly gilded room, wearing a tuxedo.
He was incredibly old-fashioned.
President Roosevelt would probably have made the same mistake if his wife, Eleanor, had not induced him to set an example with his own stomach.
As the book tells me, Mrs. Roosevelt hired a housekeeper who was not interested in the taste. This led to the White House being "not just served the most expensive food in all of Washington, but also in the most dismal-faced."
A number of food habits from the crisis subsided as soon as the country got back on its feet.
The reference remained in our constant examination of calories and nutritional values, says Miss Ziegelman, and in the way science is applied to cooking.
The couple says they've better understood the eating habits of Miss Ziegelman's mother while writing - why, perhaps, she couldn't throw out the food.
"She was really afraid of wasting food," Andrew said to Coe.
Ziegelman recalled, "She made the people sick."
There was an accident with wreaths.
When Eisenberg's clean tables were clean, she and Mr. Coe pulled out the dessert they had prepared at home: the plum dessert that President Roosevelt had eaten for lunch.
"It's called plum cream," Ziegelman said, adding that the usual trick was to give humble recipes to elegant names.
There was no cream, just plums, some flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Each reluctantly plunged the spoon into the thick brown mass.
Surprisingly, it was wrong.
Andrew added Coe, and then again.
And, as a good treasurer, he told his wife, "A little chopped-up walnut would be good."
Europeans: Migrants are going for benefits.
Most of the refugees who are rolling in for Europe come for economic reasons.
Young Russians make fun of themselves.
This is what the shows would look like if we were making them.

Gilead is entitled to reimbursement of the legal representation cost in the patent against hepatitis C against Merck
The district court judge ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc was entitled to the reimbursement of the lawyers' fees incurred by her in the process of patenting C jaundice against the drug manufacturer Merck & Co Inc.
In June, a conviction was overturned in June to pay Gilead for damages for breach of two Merck's patents in connection with the very successful drugs of Gilead, Sovaldi and Harvoni, after a federal judge had repeatedly found illegal conduct on the part of Merck, among other things, a lie under oath and other unethical practices.
Federal Judge Beth Labson Freeman said in the file on Thursday that Gilead was entitled to waive the fees that arose in connection with the representation in the case.
Merck is trying to catch up with Gilead, which dominates the market for new-generation anti-liquilence C drugs, which can cure more than 90 percent of patients with this liver disease.
The case dates from 2013, when Gilead and Merck sued each other, claiming to be the owner of basic laboratory research for sofosbuvir, the active ingredient of Gilead's drugs.
US-backed military forces claim to have gained full control of the city of Manbij
U.S.-backed military forces gained full control of the northern city of Manbij, near the border with Turkey, after the last Islamic State fighters fled the city, a spokesman for the group said on Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) is now scouring the city after the departure of the rest of the group of radicals hiding in the city.
The troops liberated over 2,000 civilians who were being held by the militants, Sharfan Darwish of the SDF alliance and the Manbij Military Council told Reuters.
"The city is now fully under our control, but we are still searching it," he told Reuters.
The Clintons earned $10.75 million in 2015 and paid the federal tax rate of 34.2 percent
Hillary Clinton released her 2015 tax return on Friday on Friday, which states that the Democrat presidential candidate and her husband had received $10.75 million in revenue in that year and paid a real tax of 34.2 percent.
The Clintons donated $1 million to charity in 2015, mostly to the Clinton Foundation. Ex-President Bill Clinton contributed a nearly $5.3 million fee to the joint coffers for lectures, and the former secretary of state awarded an income of $3 million from Simon & Schuster for her book on his time at the State Department.
Clinton's running mate, US Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, along with his wife Anne Holton, has released 10 years' tax returns.
They paid the actual tax of 20.3 percent in 2015.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to be a model of financial transparency," Jennifer Palmieri, who helped Clinton with the campaign, said in a statement.
Against this, Donald Trump hides behind false excuses and retreats from his earlier promises to publish his tax returns.
It is customary for US presidential candidates to publish their tax returns, even if the law does not impose it on them.
Trump, a businessman from New York, and his lawyers cited the audit of the IRS Treasury Department as a reason for his refusal to disclose the tax returns.
"Your move," campaign aide to Hillary Clinton said on Twitter, following on the Democratic nominee's tax returns.
Michael Cohen, a special Trump aide, told CNN on Thursday that he would not allow Trump to publish his tax returns until the audits were completed.
According to Trump's critics, who include 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney and other Republican party members, they agree that his rejection raises questions about his net profit, charity donations, business transactions, and various other relationships, including relations with Russia.
Clinton is strongly in the question, posting a video on Friday in which she recalls the high-ranking republicanization of Trump is urging to publish his tax returns.
On Thursday, raise the question in your speech on economic issues in Michigan.
"He refuses to do what all the other candidates for the presidency have done for decades - to publish their tax returns," she said to the people.
Politico reported that Trump has paid no or very low taxes in the last two years of the 1990s, and the New York Times columnist has quoted a number of tax advisers and accountants who claim, which may be the case today.
Federal tax rates have become a topic in the election of the president.
Clinton is pushing for a rule named after billionaire Warren Bufett, which would ensure that all those who make more than $1 million in a year will pay a tax of at least 30 percent.
President Barack Obama also supports the proposal.
Last week, at a Clinton rally in Omaze, Nebraska, where Buffet's conglomerate, Berkshire Hathaway, called for Trump to meet and exchange tax returns.
Buffett said he had also received an IRS audit, and that Trump was "not "unfailur"in the IRS, but the electorate.
Clinton's campaign was released by tax returns retroactively until 2007.
The Clintons, now living in Chappaqua, New York, paid an average of 32 percent federal tax between 2007 and 2014 and a combined tax of about 40.5 percent.
The Clinton tax return for 2015 shows that, unlike most Americans, their wages are just $100 in their income.
Their main investment was a low-cost mutual index fund from which the Clintons listed income in dividends and interest rates of $109,000.

Condoms filled with chilli or fireworks to protect elephants in Tanzania
Conservationists in Tanzania use an unorthodox way to prevent elephants from going to people's homes - throwing condoms filled with a powder of chilli.
This procedure has worked well, and the Honeyguide Foundation, which came up with the idea a few years ago, together with the American environmental organization The Nature Conservancy, is promoting this process and training volunteers in the villages of the north of Tanzania, how to use this nonviolent advance in four steps to protect their homes and crops without harming the animals.
Many of them used spears in their defense.
Friday is the World Elephant Day, which is dedicated to the protection of these animals.
"Since they've been developed by this ... set of tools, we've seen a change in the behavior of these communities. People are much more confident that they can keep the elephants out of their fields without hurting them," Honeyguide Foundation Executive Director Damian Bell said in a statement.
The first and second steps are to shine a flashlight on the passing elephant and start the horn.
If this does not deter him, it will be the discard of the so-called "chooling of chilli."
The chilli powder mixed with the salt with the firecracker is wrapped in a condom, its end being smoked to only look out of it by a wick.
After detonating, the condom explodes and a fine chilli powder is scattered into the air.
Usually one whiff is enough and the elephant goes in a different direction.
The last option is to launch a fireworks display that will trigger a loud, clear explosion.
The Jewish director leaned on the Berlin hotel for removing the code for calling Israel to "request" of Arabs - RT News
The Jewish-born French film director caused a stir in the media after discovering that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin did not have the code for calling to Israel, in the words of the employee, on the basis of an Arab client's "requirement" to him.
Claude Lanzmann, the author of the documentary about the Holocaust "Shoah," aviated his frustration with the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin in an open letter to the German daily FAZ.
During his recent stay, Lanzmann attempted to find Israel in the hotel's list of phone calls codes.
However, the state was not listed among the countries to which it is possible to call directly from the room.
How is it possible that in 2016 Israel was removed and deleted in Berlin, the capital of Germany?
Written by Lanzmann.
Hotel Kempinski Bristol instead offers the possibility of calling Israel via its own call centre.
The director was looking for an explanation and turned to the hotel reception with the problem.
The answer he received, Lanzmann, in his words, was "shocking."
The hotel staffer replied that the measure had been ‘determined after the management of Kempinski Hotels’s management’.
The reason for this move has further irritated the director.
"Most of our guests are Arabs, and they have demanded that Israel's callcode be erased," Lanzmann quoted the employees as saying in his letter.
According to Suddeutsche Zeitung, Israel's ambassador to Germany, Yakov Hadas-Handelsman, called the case a "great embarrassment."
The event was horrified and shocked.
On its own, it's a huge embarrassment.
The fact that this happened in Germany and, moreover, in such a hotel chain, is an even greater shame.
No further explanation is needed.
We expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions," he said.
The event provoked a strong reaction online, with people calling it scandalous.
Some believe that the Kempinski hotel has simply "lost" its claims of Arab customers.
"You mayhem," reads another post, which points out that the hotel, located in the classy Kurfurstendamm street, is located near the synagogue.
According to the Spiegel daily, the hotel itself quickly dismissed any accusations by calling the event a "overloft" and "recognizing" Lanzman.
"No direct order has been issued" to include Israel in the list of call codes, the Suddeutsche Zeitung quotes a representative of the Kempinski Hotel.
It adds that the call code was added to the list.
Police use tear gas and rubber bullets against protesting Brazilian students
The clash between students and police took place in San Paulo, Brazil, on Thursday when the students met for a demonstration against government reforms in the public education system.
Police used tear gas and rubber bullets against the protesters.
The problem escalated when government riot services tried to disperse the students, which ended with the police using rubber bullets and tear gas.
The demonstration was attended by several hundred students to express their concerns about the plans.
Among the proposals of Sano Governor, Gerald Alckmin, to save money, is also the closure of nearly a hundred public schools and the relocation of 300,000 students.
Some of the demonstrators could be seen spray-painting signs against interim President Michel Temer on the wall.
The latest protest comes only days after the demonstrators took to the streets en masse in support of deposed President Dilma Rousseff when the country's senate decided to indict her.
Trade between Russia and Iran increased by 71% - RT Business
According to the Russian ambassador to Iran, Levan Dzhagaryan, trade turnover rose by 70.9 percent in the year-on-year comparison after the lifting of sanctions between Moscow and Tehran.
As the ambassador said, since international sanctions against Iran were lifted, there has been an increase in interest from Russian firms that do business in the country.
Russian companies are renewing existing ties with Iran, while new firms are ready to enter the market.
Further trade expansion is, of course, one of the top priorities for bilateral cooperation with Iran," Dzhagaryan said.
He noted that during the first five months of 2016, trade turnover between Russia and Iran grew by 70.9 percent compared to the same period for 2015 and reached $856 million.
In particular, Russia's exports to Iran jumped 91.5 percent to reach $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 percent to $158 million.
The jump in trade has been provided by supplies of machinery, land vehicles and weapons," the ambassador said.
The Dzhagaryan also expects Russia to be visited by a record number of tourists from Iran this year.
In the past year, the Russian diplomatic mission in Iran has issued around 35,000 visas to Iranian citizens, mostly travelers.
In addition, Iran has reached the top 20 countries for the first time, depending on the number of tourists arriving in Russia.
It is safe to say that the record numbers of tourists from Iran to Russia from last year will be surpassed," he said.
At the same time, Iran is visited by a relatively small number of Russians. The ambassador hopes there will be a change.
"Personally, I can recommend a visit to the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, where the preserved monuments of the ancient Persian civilization are preserved," he said.
Callum Skinner rushes home after Britons win gold in cycling
Callum Skinner of Scotland entered the Hall of Fame last night in the men's team sprint at the Rio velodrome when the VB trio defended their London 2012 title.
The 23-year-old from Glasgow was in the brake role taken for his Scotsman Sir Chris Hoy, and the young man delighted the legend when he rushed to the finish and stole the victory from the hands of the favoured New Zealand.
Britain surprisingly won four years ago and Hoy won the fifth of his six Olympic gold medals.
And they repeated the same trick after finishing a modest sixth at the world championship in track cycling in March, although Hoy had ended his career in the meantime.
The problem between Beijing and London was a replacement for specialist opening racer Jamie Staff.
So the Hindes appeared just in time.
After the departure of Hoye, a vacancy was also vacant, which Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton attempted to fill.
Skinner was the man of British coaches and the search for potential has now been confirmed.
Kenny Hindes - who, along with Hoy, was champion four years ago - and Skinner scored the Olympic record in qualifying, but took the jersey in the first round of New Zealand.
And the British trio won gold in the team sprint.
The Hindes were slightly behind on his lap, but Kenny pushed the team forward and Skinner held the lead.
The change in strategy was a large part of the transformation, when Hindes went to a higher gear to slow down and allow Kenny and, in part, Skinner to keep up the pace.
Hoy watched the race from his position as a BBC commentator, and when Skinner, Kenny and Hindes took to the podium, he kept his eyes on them.
Twenty-three-year-old Skinner, a native of Glasgow, said, "It's a flattering comparison."
I'm here to get the best out of myself and honor my name.
We set an Olympic record in the final and we beat the best.
It was just unbelievable.
There's no better way to win this.
After a triumph alongside Kenny and Hoy in London in 2012, Hindes admitted that he deliberately fell to the track after a weak start.
He later withdrew the remake, and Britain's rivals had no way to appeal.
This time around this victory there was no such problem.
Hindes said, "With all the British flags in the stands, I felt like I was in London."
In the last three months, we've all come together as a team.
We've lost in a lot of world races, so winning the Olympics again is just amazing.
It is one event, one gold medal for the nation, which has won seven of the ten competitions in Beijing and London.
If this is to be an indicator of progress over the past five months, then we will have a successful five days at the velodrome.
With the form Kenny performed, it is not unthinkable that he would repeat Hoy's success and win three gold medals at the same time at one Olympics.
That would then be a birthday for Kenny - who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who is exactly on the day, it would also be a dream on March 23 (this date seems to be sacred for British sport, with Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister) also celebrating his birthday on that day - a total of six gold and one silver medal.
As well as how much Hoy got.
Next up, Kenny will take part in the sprint, which starts today and will last for the next three days.
The 28-year-old from Bolton said, "I'm enjoying this one.
A team race is always the best.
You win with the others.
To tell you the truth, winning for myself is a little lonely.
Hindes said, "If he wins two more gold medals, he should get a knighthood."
That was the only medal race that day, but there was more good news for Britain.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified as the fastest in the team pursuit at the four-kilometer team.
They finished with a time of 3:51.943.
The world record set in London in 2012 is 3:51.659.
The first round and the final (22:42) are held in today's second day of the race, which will surely be the focus of Wiggins.
Yesterday before the qualifying race, he debated with the commissioners when the judges called for a height to be measured.
In a similar women's race, which continues and finishes tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie reached the world record with a time of 4:13.260.
The VB team relied on their strong track cycling team and dominated the mid-range of the Olympic Games and won a lot of medals.
After truly exceptional performances, demonstrating the sheer upper hand in Beijing and London, it has decreased in the run-up to Rio's expectations.
Dramatic events unfolded in the background, last but not least, the resignation of technical director Shane Sutton in April over allegations of sexism and discrimination, and the end of the career of greats such as Hoy or Victoria Pendleton.
However, as evidenced by the first night of the velodrome races, it seems that the legendary reputation that the Great Britain team can deliver a top-of-the-range performance with perfect timing could be reaffirmed.
Ensure future of the Tearers in Portland after the end of the energy supply contract
The future of the Portland aluminium smelter in Victoria - and the jobs of hundreds of workers - is uncertain because of the power plant that supplies the company with electricity and which reported the intention of one of the owners of the smoky plant to terminate the electricity supply contract. All electricity supply contracts are expected to be shortened.
This step is being taken after the government of Victoria earlier this year decided not to extend the provision of subsidies that keep the business going.
The fixed 20-year grant expires in November.
Alcoa Portland can be at risk for up to 2,000 jobs.
When closed, up to 2,000 jobs - direct or indirect - may be at risk.
And because the smelter consumes around 10 percent of the total electricity produced in Victoria, there may be more avalanche impacts.
Alcoa closed the Torchor Point Henry in 2014, which led to the closure of the Anglese power plant last year.
Alcoa's tavire at the company in Portland is unprofitable and in danger of being closed.
The move follows several years of speculation about the future of the business, initially in response to the strong Australian dollar and recently because of the price of plant production.
The AGL, which supplies electricity to the large melting aluminium with electricity from the Loy Yang A power plant in the Latrobe Valley Valley, said it expected one of the other three owners to also decide to terminate the contract.
The majority of the plant is the joint venture between Alcoa and Alumina, with the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp holding the small shares.
"AGL expects the Portland plant to continue to work, in other words, that the demise demand for electricity from the smelter will continue," she said.
The AGL stated that the contracts were so-called "surance contracts" that were to enter into force from November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month notice period, so that they will actually expire in 2017.
"AGL continues to assume that the contracts will contribute to the profit for fiscal year 2017," the plant said.
Any potential impact on the profits of the AGL since the 2018 fiscal year, furthermore, is currently limited due to the strong outlook for the commodity market for wholesale electricity prices.
The AGL stated that it had already drawn up the value of the contracts according to its books of $187 million ‘in the event that the termination took place.’
Alcoa stated that the contract's decision to terminate "does not have an impact on its ... capacity to operate a refurbishline or to secure the electricity supply to the smulter."
The American company said it entered into a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010 to start in return to start in November of this year, although it still has to explain why it withdrew from the contract.
Analysts are very cautious about the possible closure of the Portland smelter in both Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle as a result of a weak sector economy.
AGL Operations Manager Stehpen Mikkelsen, who approached analysts earlier this week, said Portland consumes around 600 megawatts of electricity a year and Tomago around 900 megawatts.
If both of these firms were to withdraw from the market, it would mean a substantial reduction in demand in the [electricity energy] market.
It wouldn't be good for us as a manufacturer," he said.
Kendall is not only the star of the Kardashian real TV show - now the cover of the September Vogue
Kendall Jenner (20), model and fourth daughter of Kris Kardashian-Jenner's mother-manager, appeared on the cover of the September edition of the American magazine Vogue.
Kendall, ambassador of the brand Estee Lauder, who was showing off at Fashion Week in Milan, Paris and New York, announced the news on her Instagram account on Thursday.
"In a room full of people I love, looking at this front page, I want to cry," Kendall wrote.
The unveiling of the front page was followed by a bizarre (or simply a sequel to the Kardashian's?) video, starred in which the entire Kardashian-Jenner family (binary rioters Rob and Caitly, along with all the popular showbiz uncle, Keeping Up producer Ryan Seacrest). They forgot about their sister's cover, only for the scene to end in a classic turnaround: they're setting up a secret party.
It's a bygone story line for almost every "birthday" episode of a children's TV show (Seacrest says, "Did you think we've forgotten you?" with the honesty of a cartoon rabbit on the eight o'clock in the morning show), but Kris somehow needed to make sure the other girls could feed on this publicity.
Because when we look at the September issue of Vogue magazine, we've definitely entered the new era of the Kardashian.
The older sister, Kim, may have pushed Kendall to the cover of Vogue (she was co-legged with her husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the title of the magazine's September issue is a different league.
The September issue of Vogue magazine is the best-selling number of the year.
The release, which in terms of thickness resembles a book for advertising purposes rather than a fashion magazine, attracts a number of advertisers (Fashionista calculated that there were 615 pages with advertising content from 832 pages in last year's edition).
The unveiling of the star appearing on the front page is eagerly awaited, so it is no wonder that the magazine's pictures have leaked before its official publication in the past two years.
Women who have appeared on the cover in the past are Naomi Campbell, Linda Evandelist or Kate Moss.
In recent years, the front page has certainly shown up more of the "celebrities that make models" than "the tunics that are celebrities."
Jennifer Lawrence, an Oscar winner and Dior ambassador, appeared on the cover in 2013, a year later, Laga Gaga's honor.
But while it is highly unlikely that Kendall - described by the magazine as the "breakhom model" of her generation - will fall into the first category, she will be in very good company.
These celebrities are not related to well-known people, nor of the stars of real estate shows, or the children of today who know how to make a well-schedened video (although Jenner presents all of this).
They are demonstrably talented women who excel in the entertainment industry.
Beyoncé, who appeared on the cover page last year, had one of the most powerful years of her career thanks to the release of the album Lemonade.
Of course, not everyone is happy about Jenner's success.
Her position in the world of fashion will always be difficult because of her participation in a reality show.
In June, Stephanie Seymore, the original Victoria's Secret model, criticized Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid and called them "the girls of the moment."
These feelings flared up again, with the news that Jenner would appear on the cover of Vogue.
But this dissatisfaction is misplaced.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of September's Vogue.
She's a supermodel in the true sense of the word.
He's doing the trick for Mark Jacobs.
He's selling you make up by Estee Lauder.
She and all her sisters are selling you pictures of themselves on their own paywalls.
She sells pictures of her daughter, Cindy Crawford, who she took for LOVE magazine.
And in her spare moments, she performs on a reality show, perhaps only as one way to see Kourtney and her children.
Community legal aid centres reject 160,000 people a year
More than 160,000 of the most people at risk are rejected each year in community legal aid centres, and they are poised for repercussions in the sector itself, with further caps on funding for already overloaded services.
In Queensland, three out of five people - mostly people of advanced age, immigrants, at-risk workers, victims of violence, and people with no financial means to fight an unjust eviction and the like - are already being rejected as soon as they are seeking free legal aid and representation.
The community's legal services, which are already so tense to bursting, are preparing for more cuts.
From June next year, these legal aid centers will lose another 30 percent of federal funding.
The director of the Queensland Community Legal Aid Centres, James Farrell, said that according to the latest summary report by the National Association of Community Legal Aid Centres, five thousand people were found to be rejected each year.
Mr Farrell said that without the federal government's decision to be overturned, the situation would get worse.
"Communal legal centres in Queensland are chronically underfunded, which means that thousands of people are being refused the vital services they need," he said.
People who have escaped from relations with the rapist, people with excessive and crippling debts, families coming through the detention, workers who are unjustly released - all of these people have problems with legal dimensions, and this report shows that they have no chance of getting the help they need.
The federal government will cut funding by 30 percent from June 2017, leading to thousands more atrosed people atrosed from Queensland having to navigate the complex legal problems without help.
We call on the Attorney General and the Queensland Senator George Brandis to prevent this shortening of funds immediately to get people the help they need when they get into legal trouble.
In the past year, the government of the state has lived up to its commitment to secure the financing of legal aid up to the national average.
Now is the time to look at the needs of the community's legal aid centres and the communities of their clients, and the Palaszczuk government must invest in this important work.
Donald Trump's campaign lawsuit after a staff member allegedly pointed a gun
New York: Donald Trump's campaign was sued for alleged inaction after being told that the director of operations in North Carolina in February aimed a weapon at a crew member while riding a jeep.
The incident was described in a court file handed to Vincent Bordini, a former campaign software trainer in the state court in the state, on Wednesday.
Bordini said he waited months for months to resolve the situation internally before he came to the conclusion that "it will not happen."
Director Earl Phillip "carried the gun, put his right index finger on the trigger, and pointed the barrel at Vincent's cane," Bordini said in the lawsuit.
The file said that Bordini, following a complaint with the local and regional campaign leadership, found that at least four other people had experienced the same with Phillip.
"The weapons do not have to fire to cause damage," Bordini said in the lawsuit.
The lawsuit comes just two days after the Republican presidential nominee caused an uproar when he told voters in North Carolina that gun owners and holders could take action (which is regulated in the US in the Second Amendment) if his opponent, Hillary Clinton, was elected and could appoint her judges.
Trump's campaign says the media has taken his words out of context and that Trump has not defended the violence.
In the lawsuit, Bordini is seeking compensation from the campaign for negligent supervision and from Phillip for endangering personal safety, the unlawful use of violence and the infliction of emotional harm.
Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks did not respond to the report for comment immediately.
Attempts to get a statement from Phillip were unsuccessful.
The WCCB, a local news agency in Charlotte, announced that Phillip had recently left the campaign.
No one responded to his consultancy Innovative Consulting Services in a short time.
Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump is leading a controversial election campaign.

Britain must spread the Olympic spirit and expand the Heathrow
Heathrow will also be a source of recovery and prosperity not only for our local communities and across London, but throughout the country.
For me, Heathrow is in a tremendous way attractive, just as London 2012 was when we made an extraordinary effort to ensure that all our nations and regions can benefit from the Olympic Games.
The Olympic Games marked huge benefits for both Startford and the East End.
And we're going to do it again by creating opportunities for local people and companies near Heathrow.
For our local communities alone, we will create 10,000 new teaching places, 40,000 new jobs and put an end to youth unemployment around the airport.
As before the 2012 London Olympics, there will be those who will think that Heathrow's expansion is too great.
I was told that Britain would never be ready for the Olympic Games and that we would be ridiculed on the world stage.
Doubters were wrong in 2012, and even in the case of Heathrow, it turns out they were wrong.
It will always be necessary to overcome obstacles, but Heathrow can answer any question that concerns him.
Like the Olympic Games, the Heathrow is an infrastructure project involving many people and companies, not just a few.
The expansion is an opportunity to create 180,000 new jobs, economic growth of £211 billion, to leave the inheritance in the form of skills and employment both around the airport and across the UK.
We have a great team at Heathrow that, on the deadline and with the budget set out, has implemented an £11 billion infrastructure investment programme, starting with the T5 terminal - which was voted the best terminal in the world for five years in a row, after the T2 Terminal, which was built between the two busiest runways in the world.
They are now ready to deliver the third runway, which is backed by £16 billion of private investment.
The London Games in 2012 were a huge success for the UK and I am convinced that the Heathrow expansion will be so.
It is time for us to continue to spread the spirit of the Olympic Games and to expand Heathrow, to secure trade for the future, and to leave the skills and employment legacies that Britain can be proud of.

Adblock Plus - Facebook in a cat and mouse game in the ad-locking
Experiments to bypass advertising-blocking programs have become a game of cat and mouse for companies that make money from online marketing. At least that's what one of the companies that program such software says.
On Thursday, that is, only two days after Facebook announced that it would block advertising filters on its desktop pages, Adblock Plus posted a post on its website stating that users could update the filters in their program and re-determine advertising on this social network.
Facebook said on Tuesday that its desktop website will change the encoding around the ads to make it more difficult for advertising filters to see which parts of the site are advertising.
Adblock, however, now claims to have bypassed the new codes.
Adblock spokesman Ben Williams wrote in a blog post that "this kind of war between the open source prevention community of blocking ads and those who try to bypass them has been insistent since the blocking of the ads was invented," and that Facebook is likely to come up with another repair of its own.
The fact that the company owning the world's largest social network has joined the war only proves just how much of a problem blocking ads has become for the industry.
According to the study, the tkerou was conducted by Pagefair and Adobe used advertising filters worldwide worldwide by around 200 million people - almost four times the case in 2013.
Mobile advertising now accounts for 84 percent of advertising profits on Facebook, with 1.03 billion active users visiting Facebook from mobile devices every day.
The spokesman said the company was going against advertising filters on desktops, however, because mobile advertising filters for mobile apps for the social network and Instagram do not work.
Advertisements for desktops still represent a profit high enough for Facebook to decide to invest in it.
Facebook also said on Tuesday that it will update the "adenset" tool to give people the opportunity to better control how advertisements are displayed to them.
On Thursday, Facebook said the new Adblock filters were worrying them, as they could also block content on the site that was not related to advertising.
"This is not a pleasant experience for people and we want to solve this problem," a Facebook spokesperson said in an email statement.
Blocking advertising is an insensitive tool, so we preferred to focus on building tools like Ad Preferences that give control to people.
Woman hit by car of Swiss motorway
The victim was on the highway in the middle of the night.
Police are looking for witnesses to the event in which a woman was run over on the motorway in the early hours of Thursday morning on the motorway and was believed to have attempted to commit suicide.
The accident occurred on the A1 motorway near the Morges in the Vaud canton shortly after midnight on Thursday.
Police in Vaud said in a statement that the "desperate act" was lying in the dark on the road and was run over by several cars.
It is clear that the victim, a woman aged 49, wanted to kill herself and was hit by several cars, including a truck.
She died at the scene.
Several drivers have already been interviewed, but police say they have still not all been identified. Police are urging these drivers and any other people who witnessed the accident to come forward.
A criminal investigation was opened, a "logical" step in a situation like this, the attorney, Gilles Hofstetter, told the Le Tribune de Geneve.
It is still necessary to determine whether any of the drivers involved will face any charges.
Was it possible to prevent the impact?
This is what the prosecutor has to find out," Hofstetter said.
Based on two similar cases from the past five years, it appears that drivers will not be held responsible.
In both cases - one of which was a person going down the highway - it was decided that motorists could not expect a pedestrian crossing the highway in the middle of the night, as the newspaper reported.
Last year, a police officer was cleared for vehicular manslaughter after she was hit and killed by a man lying on the A1 motorway near Paynerne on the night of August 2014.
The court heard that the victim, aged 22, was drinking alcohol and fainting on the road.
The court found that the police officer - who responded to the emergency call - was driving in a proportionate manner and that the presence of the man on the road was "a completely exceptional and unpredictable situation," the judge said.
Anyone with information about Thursday's incident at Morges should come forward to the police on the phone numbers 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
Tolerant city.
Prague is a popular destination for the LGBT community.
The Association of Czech Travel Agencies and Agencies (ACC) expects up to 20,000 visitors to come to Prague as part of Prague Pride.
On Friday, the Executive Director of the AČCKA, Kateřina Petříčková, said so.
The sixth edition of Prague Pride began on August 8, with the festival bringing to light the lives of lesbians, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT).
Last year, about 35,000 people attended the event.
"Prague is one of the most popular destinations of the LGBT community, for the high level of tolerance and a wide range of specialised enterprises," Petříčková said.
According to a survey by the organizers, festival-goers spend an average of CZK 3100 per person per day.
For gay tourists, special maps of Prague are available to support their travel, with a complete list of Prague's gay and gay-friendly barns, clubs, cafes and restaurants in the form of mobile apps, etc.
"For tourism in general, LGBT clientele is very lucrative, is interested in stays in higher price ranges with a high standard of travel services and spends more than others," Petříčková said.
As part of the festival's programme, the first Pride Tourism Symposium is being held this year.
It is leveraged by LGBT tourism industry experts from Europe, the US and China.
The festival continues until Sunday, August 14.
The main theme this year is love, but the event will also focus on several thematic areas, which are family, AIDS prevention and transgender issues.
The highlight of the festival will be on Saturday the traditional parade with floaters with floaters, which will go from Wenceslas Square to Letna.
The procession, which has been attended by thousands of people in recent years, will this year observe a minute's silence in memory of the victims of the June nightclub attack in Orlando, where the attacker shot dead 49 people, mostly homosexuals.
Pat and Mat are celebrating forty years.
The unreplaft handymen Pat and Mat, whose efforts usually end in disaster, have entertained small and large viewers for forty years.
The pilot episode of this evening series by director Lubomír Beneš premiered on 12 August 1976.
Behind the creation of this animated series, which is now known to viewers in more than 100 countries around the world, were cartoons of the artist and director Lubomír Beneš, which he invented for the magazine with two hilarians of the clerks of Mr Ouholíček and Sedlec.
Beneš then invited the dramaturge Jiří Kubíček and the artist Vladimír Jiránek to collaborate and together they created the film Kuťáci.
Today's appearance with a yellow and red trick and a backdrop and a radios were given to the characters in 1979, when a series for Slovak Television began to be created in Short Film Prague.
The names Pat and Mat were then given to the DIY in 1985, this time it was already being shot directly for Short Film Prague.
In 1990, Lubomír Beneš founded his own studio of the animated film AIF Studio in Prague and Zurich, where other episodes were made.
After his death in 1995, more episodes continued with other creators, many of whom were co-written by Benes's son Marek.
There are now over ninety episodes with the stories of these handymen, which are sprinkled under their hands, but they are never angry with each other and are always full of optimism, ideas and DIY enthusiasm, and in the end they are satisfied with their work, which they will testify with a familiar gesture "...and that is it!".
Pat and Mat have even moved from TV screens to books, DVDs, and to the theater, and characters, or other toys with the depiction of Pat and Mat, are a hit for any toy store.
A fairy tale for Fiji as well as for two-year-old Harmony.
The end of the week is in the wake of fairy tales, we have chosen one sporting and one of your life for you.
They both have a good ending.
Let's go see.
Fiji has achieved historic success.
What is the reason for the joy of the whole country?
A two-year-old British girl has an identical friend and is happy with her.
And what are the most things people spend at airports on?
That's Friday's review from the world's websites.
First medal of the Olympic Games.
The historic success is celebrated by the island state of Fiji.
The rugby selection of this archipelago was defeated by the United Kingdom team in the final of the Olympic Rugby Rugby tournament.
It is the first ever medal to win for itself by Fiji at the Olympics.
Waiting to win the first valuable metal took sixty years since the first expedition to the Olympic Games was sent.
Much of the credit for the success goes to coach Fiji.
But it is ironic that he is the Brit Ben Ryan.
He has led the team since 2013, and after the final as a British citizen, he could be happy, unlike his countrymen.
"Let's play free and easy and see if we can make the biggest game in our history," the coach said before the finals.
Fiji eventually dominated him, and the small state of 900,000 inhabitants is now experiencing an Olympic fairy tale.
The news was reported by the French newspaper Le Monde.
A new friend and happiness for a little girl.
2-year-old Harmonie-Rose Ivy Allen, who has lived without arms and legs since 11 months.
A doll that looks like her.
"Mom, she's like me," the two-year-old rejoiced, as her mother told ABC News.
She added that her daughter likes to take off the doll's arms and legs and then sit together without prostheses.
Harmony was diagnosed with meningitis type B in less than a year of life, with doctors giving it only a 10% chance of survival.
There's nothing I don't love about her.
She's beautiful, she's smart, she's funny, and she never gives up.
He has insight.
I saw her presenting herself to other children with the words Hello, I'm Harmony and I don't have hands, my mother added.
Look at the joy the doll has attracted.
Are we spending the most at the airport?
CNN provides a finding that people at airports spends the most on bottled water.
The Hudson's travel extras essential stores have released data for the past year, summing up 10 products that customers buy most often at its stores at airports.
The water was the first.
Drinks were generally very popular, with eight in the top ten.
The ninth place was occupied by a large pack of M&M sweets with coconut flavour.
And can you guess who closes the top ten?
You can't eat the only one of the above things.
CNN reports it's The Wall Street Journal.
Other popular newspapers sold at airports include: the New York Post, The New York Times USA Today.
Among the magazines are US Weekly, In Touch and The Economist.
Rowing sovereigns.
We're just going to win, Murray and Bond were laughing.
Rowers Eric Murray and Hamish Bond of New Zealand have been reigning the category of deuce without a helmsman for seven years and have confirmed their dominance at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
At first glance, the disparate pair switched to a smaller crew after the Beijing Olympics and have been crushing the competition since 2009.
On the lagoon, Rodrigo de Freitas, they claimed their 69th win in a row in Thursday's final.
What are we different from the others?
We are simply nicer, joked Murray during the Olympic regatta when he was asked to answer questions about the dominance of the New Zealand pair.
Frankly, we're not doing anything different from the others.
We just train hard, very hard.
And we're constantly trying to improve our technique, that's our philosophy, Murray said more seriously.
Their domination is also remarkable because they are physically different.
Murray is a nearly two-metre and 300-pound chaser, the academically-looking Bond is five centimeters shorter and 15 kilograms lighter.
Moreover, they are of a different nature.
Bond is studying and attending to finance, with Murray having a charity boxing match, for example.
That's also why they don't spend much time together outside of rowing.
Eric's getting on the boat basically saying we can't lose.
Let's just go win.
I tend to think about what might go wrong, admitted Bond, who even at the press conference demonstrated that Murray was dominant in the garrison.
It was he who always answered first, and Bond waited for his chance.
On the water, however, it destroys the opponent with a calm force.
They are on their pace, and while they are often still in the lead at the halfway point, their gradual acceleration has yet to be found by the opponents.
We race on a two-kilometre course and we never wanted to go the first kilometre above the top.
We're just trying to ride a pace that no one else can do.
We know what we have to do to win, said Murray, 34.
With his four-year-old partner, he won seven gold medals at the World Championships.
They also triumphed in 2007, when both were members of the golden four without a helmsman.
It was after the unexpected failure of the larger crew at the Beijing Olympics a year later that they decided to switch to number two without a helmsman.
At the London Olympics, they probably atoned for the biggest defeat of their careers and confirmed their dominance in Rio.
London was very intense.
We did everything the coach told us to do, and they didn't ask questions.
This time it was a little more fun.
We knew it was going to be a hell of a hard time, and we had to make sure we were mentally well off, Murray said.
We know that everyone wants to overthrow us from the throne.
The target is on our backs all the time.
But we are trying to be half a step ahead of everyone, he added.
NASA's climate model: Venus was once habitable
According to projections of NASA's new climate model, Venus was once habitable.
Scientists at NASA's Goddard Institute for the Study of Space developed a model to explore Venus using tools and algorithms similar to those used by climate science researchers.
The model was designed to determine whether once on Venus, whose surface is hot, without water and sized by CO2, conditions could have prevailed similar to those on Earth.
Scientists have previously suggested that the low rate of rotation of Venus can be explained by its dense atmosphere.
But according to the latest simulations, it seems that Venus once boasted a sparse Earth-like atmosphere, turning slowly.
The model also dealt with the earlier topography of Venus.
On the planet, the areas were probably drier than on Earth, but once there was enough water and geographic diversity to give life to reign on it and provide protection against rapid evaporation.
Venus previously also used the Sun, which was 30 percent more muted.
"In the simulation of the GISS model Venus, he exposes his day-to-air to the sun for almost two months at a time during the slow rotation," GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio explained in a new report.
This way the surface is heated and the formation of the rain, which creates a dense layer of clouds that behave like an umbrella and shield the surface from too much solar heat.
The result is a climate with average temperatures that are actually slightly lower than they are currently on Earth.
The model compiled the story of Venus, a similar evolution previously hypothetically compiled by planetary scientists.
Though Venus was probably habitable in the past -- over several billion years -- it was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet radiation.
Its oceans evaporated and the water vapor were burned by the ultraviolet light.
Hydrogen escaped, leaving only the dense atmosphere of carbon dioxide with the lethal effect of the greenhouse gas -- that's Venus as we know it today.
The researchers published their results from the new climate model Venus in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy resigns as coach of the Colorado Avalanche
Patrick Roy resigned his post as coach and vice president of hockey operations of the Colorado Avalanche team on Thursday, citing the impossibility of participating in the decision-making process on team issues as the reason.
Colorado's executive vice president/general, Joe Sakic, confirmed the move and said the club would begin looking for a new coach immediately.
"I've been head coach and vice president of hockey operations for the Colorado Avalanche for the last three years, with energy, passion and determination," the 50-year-old Roy said in a statement.
I have long and intensely thought about how I can improve the team during the summer, give it the depth it needs and get it to a higher level.
To achieve this, it is imperative that the vision of the coach and vice president of hockey operations is in line with the organization's vision.
They must also be able to participate in decisions that have an impact on the performance of the team.
These conditions are not currently met.
Sakic, who accepted Roy on 23 May 2013, thanked him for his team's contributions.
"Patrick informed me of his decision today," Sakic said.
We appreciate everything he's done for our organization, and we wish him good luck in the future.
Roy was nominated for a win for Jack Adams as the league's top coach during his first season with the Avalanche 2013/2014.
He led the team to a gain of 112 points and a first-place finish in the Central Division. But Colorado struggled with Minnesota in the first round of the playoffs, and during the last two years, the games each season failed to work out.
The Avalanche's team scored 39:39-4 in the 2015/2016 season and were five points away from winning a second wildcard in the Western Conference.
Goalie Roy, who entered the Hall of Fame, won the Stanley Cup four times -- twice with the Montreal Canadiens and twice with the Avalanche.
Workers on the North Sea oil rig resume talks and suspend strike
The leaders of the negotiating parties said the strikes over wages for oil rig workers were suspended while all parties to the dispute met for a new round of negotiations.
The strikes against the Wood Group oil field services were sporadically occurring on the North Sea platforms operated by Royal Dutch Shell.
"The Wood Group and the trade unions Unite and RMT can confirm that they have agreed to renew the process to address the current disagreement," the statement read.
Starting next week, we will have a series of all-day meetings over the next few weeks, where we will try to look at the problems from new angles.
According to the trade unions, their recent event, which they say was the first in more than 25 years, is up to 30 percent in protest against wage cuts.
Wood Group cut rates this year and paid out about 9 percent less to its North Sea suppliers due to negative market pressure.
The reduction in company rates comes after a 10% reduction for coastal companies in 2014.
The company argues that further cuts would give companies room to cope with the market decline.
On the other hand, Shell removed thousands of people from its payroll and announced plans to abandon operations in the field of oil and gas as far as 10 countries to modernise its processes - immediately after the mega merger with the British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure from low oil prices, the economic situation associated with Britain's decision to leave the European Union in June.
A member of Parliament from Scotland, Dave Anderson, met with union leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest working disagreements of an entire generation that led to the North Sea strike.
The North Sea, he said, is vital for the region's economy.
"In the North Sea and across the country, we need an economy that operates for all, not just for some," he said in a statement.
By comparison, in 2016, nearly $1.4 billion is expected to be made in new projects in the North Sea, while the average over the past five years was around $7 billion.
Kepler measures star rotation rate in Pleiades
The latest Kepler Space Telescope mission to help astronomers is to get an almost complete list of the speed of star turning from the Fear cluster.
The new data helps astronomers understand why stars in the cluster revolve at different speeds, as well as how the turning time is related to the formation of the planet.
"We hope to compare our results with other star clusters to learn more about the relationship between star material, its age and even history in its solar system," said Luisa Rebull, a research fellow at Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, in a new report.
The Roof of the Pleiades is located 445 light-years from Earth.
Many stars in the cluster are now in the maturity state and have been created for about 125 million years.
Now he's turning fast.
At the peak turning points, these teenage stars release vast amounts of stellar winds.
Because these winds move along the magnetic fields of the stars, they have a slowing effect on them.
Along with the star's ageing, its turning rate slows down.
Kepler measures the rotation rate of each star by measuring the time between discovering the distinguishable points on the stars -- like the sun's spots.
According to the latest data on the speeds of rotation, larger stars are turning slower to the slower than the less massive stars.
Rebull compares stars to dancers, bigger pirouettes make them slower than the smaller ones.
"In the "bun" of the 'Bralet's Plening, we see that the slower-rolling stars are more massive, while the fastest-great-glocator are usually very light stars,' Rebull said.
Because the Folders cluster is so close, it serves as the ideal space laboratory to compare star quality and rotation speeds.
"The drones give us an anchor for theoretical models of star rotation in both directions, both younger and older stars," Rebull said.
There's still a lot to learn about how, when, and why stars slow down their rotation rate and, to say, "hang out their nail dance shoes."
Rebull and her colleagues detailed the latest analysis of the speed of the Fall rotation in three studios, which will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal.
Is the qualification agreement necessary?
If I didn't sign up, then the qualification agreement would not be concluded and after a few months I could go to another hospital?
Is it even possible to work after graduation without signing up for specialisation education?
My point is that in the field I would like to work in, there is now a vacancy only in a slightly more distant hospital, but in about half a year, a place in another could be made available, where I would like to work afterwards.
So I don't know how to deal with the situation for about that six months, the inquiry continues.
Math is answered. Lenka Vlková.
No legislation provides for an obligation to conclude a qualification agreement with the employer - the hospital.
The Qualification Agreement is a legal institute governed by the Labour Code and can be concluded between the employee and the employer in order to ensure the recovery of the costs incurred in the increase or deepening of the employee's qualifications.
In the area of health care, there is long-term pressure to avoid concluding these agreements with a view to ensuring the occupational mobility of healthcare professionals, and not all hospitals currently require this agreement.
Under Law No. 95/2004 Coll., on the conditions for obtaining and recognising competence and specialised competence to practise the medical profession of doctor, dentist and pharmacist, it is explicitly the case that participation in specialisation education is considered to be a deepening of the qualification (not as its increase).
This means that a qualification agreement can be concluded under the Labour Code only if the costs amount to at least CZK 75,000.
No legislation or provide for an obligation to apply for specialisation training.
The law only lays down the conditions of an application for inclusion in the field of specialisation training.
However, the doctor is legally entitled to pursue the profession of doctor by the law thanks to the necessary university studies, albeit under the conditions of law (under the professional supervision of a doctor with specialised capacity in the relevant field).
The law foresees a situation where professional experience completed in another field of specialisation may be included in the specialist training of the doctor, provided that its content and scope correspond to the relevant education programme.
In theory, it would be possible to factor the time worked elsewhere, which would correspond to the interviewer's situation.
However, in view of the fact that I do not know the circumstances of this case, it is advisable to consult the relevant Department of the Ministry of Health (science and medical professions) as the Ministry of Health provides by law a consultancy and consultation service related to the inclusion in and running into specialisation education.
The consultancy service is also provided free of charge by the Czech Medical Chamber, of which every doctor must be a member.
Doctors from the Syrian Halab are requesting intervention by the US.
The United States has not made any effort to end the siege (the city's reaches of government troops) and did not use its influence to promote the protection of civilians, AFP quoted from a letter to the White House.
"We do not need tears, compassion, and even prayers; but we desperately need to create a no-fly zone over eastern Halab to stop attacks, and we need an international action to ensure that Halab will not be surrounded again," the doctors said.
Russian forces, which support the army loyal to President Bashar al-Assad, have announced that they will stop strikes in the Halab area for three hours from today to allow safe passage of humanitarian convoys.
From 9 a.m. to 12:00 GMT, all military activities, aerial attacks and artillery fire are to be stopped.
While the head of UN humanitarian operations, Stephen O'Brien, the head of humanitarian operations, stressed the need for at least a two-day ceasefire.
The letter to Obama was approached by 15 of the 35 doctors who work in the eastern part of Halab, which is controlled by the rebels, in the letter.
It says that during the five-year war, they witnessed the violent, cruel deaths of the innate, friends and colleagues.
The world watches and notes how complex Syria is, but it does little to protect us.
Recent offers of evacuation of residents from the Syrian regime and Russia sound like only slightly veiled threats, said pediatricians, surgeons and other doctors.
Doctors said that in the past month, there have been 42 attacks on medical facilities in Syria, including 15 at the hospitals they work in.
We are most saddened by the fact that we have to decide who lives and who dies.
We have young children coming to the emergency room with injuries so serious that we have to choose between them those most likely to survive.
And sometimes we don't even have the necessary material to help them, the doctors described.
Two weeks ago, four newborns suffocated when the blast cut off the oxygen supply to their incubators.
They gasped for breath, and then their lives ended - before he could actually begin, they reminded them.
The army loyal to President Bashar al-Assad, backed by Russian forces, has in recent weeks surrounded the insurciation-dominated eastern part of Halab, with over 200,000 people in the inside without food supplies.
The rebels, who are under constant strikes from the Russian and Syrian Airships, managed to break the siege and launch the counter-offensive after three weeks on Saturday.
Both sides were then added reinforcements in and around the city.
