The 28-year-old chef found dead in a store in San Francisco
The 28-year-old chef, who recently moved to San Francisco, was the steps of a local store this week.
But the victim's brother says he can't think of who would hurt him, adding, "He's finally started doing well."
The body found at the Westfield Mall on Wednesday morning was identified as a 28-year-old San Francisco resident, Frank Galicia, the medical examiner's office said.
The San Francisco Police Department said it was a violent death and an investigation was underway.
The victim's Louis Galicia's brother told ABC KGO in San Francisco that Frank, who was formerly a regular chef in Boston, had earned his dream job as a chef at the Sons & Daughters restaurant six months ago.
A spokesman for Sons & Daughters said they were "shocked and destroyed" by his death.
"We have a small team that works as a closely connected family. We will miss him very much," the spokesman said.
In this difficult time, our thoughts and grief are to Frank's family and friends.
Louis Galicia said that Frank had first slept in the hostels, but that "he had finally started to do well."
“He found an apartment, he's been dating a girl,” Louis Galicia said to KGO.
Louis Galicia said he couldn't think of who would hurt his younger brother.
He had a kind soul and a great heart.
When he wanted to get in touch with his family, he always cooked us a meal, made us dinner," Louis Galicia said.
He never wanted to be in any argument.
He was a brother who took things for the way they are.
"Even if everything else in the world was wrong, he was the uncut-circuit diamond he lit up every day," he said.

Czech Railways has invested over 31 billion in vehicle modernisation.
They have air conditioning and new toilets.
In the last six years, the state carrier has invested over CZK 31 billion in the modernization of vehicles.
A third of the cars are currently equipped with air conditioning, with about half of the trains having a new system of closed toilets.
However, the amounts for the modernisation in individual years, with the exception of 2012, are gradually decreasing.
In the last six years, Czech Railways has invested over CZK 31bn in the modernization of vehicles.
A third of the cars are currently equipped with air conditioning, with about half of the trains having a new system of closed toilets.
The money spent was reflected in a reduction in the average age of two years for locomotives and separate units and six years for classic carriages.
A larger share of the investment was given to the carrier in regional transport, where around 60 per cent of the money was directed, and 40 per cent was invested by the company in the renewal of long-distance vehicles.
The average age of locomotives and units is currently 19 years.
However, the upgraded older vehicles are counted as brand new in this indicator.
If the vehicle upgrades were not counted, the average age of ČD's traction vehicles would increase by ten years.
On average, the passenger cars are slightly older, with an average age of 23 when the upgrades are combined.
If only the age from the date of manufacture was taken into account, the average age of these vehicles would be 33.4 years.
However, classic sets made up of carriages and pulled by a locomotive have been gradually disappearing from the Czech and global railways in recent years and are being replaced by motoring or electric units.
Between 2011 and 2015, locomotives fell from 280 to 223 pieces, and the number of classic carriages fell from 2716 in 2011 to 2132 in the middle of this year.
The carrier was particularly disposed of old vehicles equipped with leatherette seats and doors without the possibility of blocking the opening during the journey.
From January to July, the carrier had 110 of these cars scrapped.
From the investments planned for the vehicle fleet by ČD in the near future, it is possible to mention, for example, the purchase of 50 carriages for speeds up to 200 kilometres per hour, which the carrier plans to deploy on the international line Praha - Bratislava - Budapest, or a framework contract for the purchase of electric units for domestic fast tracks.
The contract provides for the collection of up to 30 pieces of motorised and 20 pieces of electric units.
Authorities know about illegal advertising for a quarter of a year, they can't get rid of it.
We are utterly helpless, they admit.
For a quarter of a year, the editorial office of the online daily Aktuálně.cz has been following the story of a billboard in southern Bohemia, which now attracts motorists to visit Lipno, where not only is a tourist-interest walk in the treetops, but also an Olympic park.
The highway managers know they're standing there black, but they say there's nothing they can do about it.
There are hundreds of such ads across the country, maybe thousands.
According to officials, the guilt is to the guilt of a flimsy law, which makes it impossible to remove the illegal mobile billboards immediately.
What is needed first is a complex bureaucratic lap.
In the meantime, however, the company changes its name and the bureau is short on it.
Or just move the ad a few yards, and the official process has to start over.
The Road and Motorway Directorate admitted a quarter of a year ago: an offshoot from České Budějovice to Lipno is an advertising billboard on our land by the state road.
But even three months were not enough for the officials to get rid of the unauthorized portable design with a giant ad poster.
It was as if no one minded that he was standing right next to the roadway, in a 50-meter protection zone where, for safety, nothing could stand.
Road managers say they can't simply cope with the billboard because of the leaky law.
Maybe pick it up and take it away.
"We must not afford that," says the Road and Motorway Directorate spokesperson, Nina Ledvinová, referring to the complex bureaucratic wheel that the removal of the billboard must precede under the law.
The case of this particular billboard, the fate of which began to be followed in detail by the online daily Aktuálně.cz in the spring, is not unique and points to a general problem that the state and the authorities cannot deal with effectively and quickly.
In South Bohemia alone, the editorial office counted dozens of similar mobile advertisements placed against the rules just off the roadway or in its vicinity.
So are the other counties.
"We have difficulty forcing companies to remove the banners," confirms the head of the transport department of the České Budějovice regional office, Jiří Klása, whose colleagues are dealing with similar stories.
According to Klása, the leaky law that binds officials to blame.
First, he has to challenge the billboard owners in a difficult way to put the ad out.
But business executives are often elusive or know the trick that Aktuálně.cz has described in the past when it became more of an interest in the issue: just move the mobile advertising stand a few metres away, and officials can throw the previous call to remove black advertising.
That's because the bureau has to pinpoint exactly where the illegal billboard is.
"If someone moves it and the coordinates suddenly disagree, it is viewed as a new facility and we have to reach out to the owner again," explains Jiří Klása.
The new law won't help.
A new law could have brought about the change, banning motorway billboards and restricting them at Class I roads from September next year.
Critics point out that the rules for tackling illegal and easily portable ads will remain the same as before.
And the authorities don't get so relieved.
Companies can thus continue to earn tens to hundreds of millions of crowns a year from rentals of illegal areas, and no one can access them.
For example, a billboard attracting Lipno to be owned by Commerz Billboard.
Officials know it well: the České Budějovice Municipality is currently conducting three administrative proceedings with it for black-built billboards.
The company faces a 300,000 fine in each proceeding.
There are several advertisements that were placed without permission in the protection zone of the class I road.
The proceedings are not yet complete, says Jaroslav Mráz, head of the Transport Department of České Budějovice Municipality.
The advertisement, which Aktuálně.cz is of interest to Aktuálně.cz, is not yet among these cases, but it will most likely be added to them soon.
According to the spokesperson of the RMD Nina Ledvinová, the company did not respond to repeated written calls for removal, and the case would be placed on the regional and then probably the municipal officials.
Commerz Billboard is one of those suspicious firms that can't be contacted.
It does not take up mail and the official headquarters in Žižkov was cancelled more than six years ago.
It is not even clear who is behind it.
In the past, the company's post office went to South Bohemian entrepreneur Anton Fischer, who was famous for his sharp dispute with the head of the Czech Hyundai brand's representation.
But Fischer, whose Euro Billboard rents and offers to advertisers, has rented the areas from the Comerz Billboard, has in the past rejected any link.
At the same time, at the same time, this spring, when the RMD began taking an interest in the advertisement of the Lipno advertisement, Fischer had state officials send a letter to the mysterious company Commerz Billboard to his guesthouse, where the company is believed to be based.
Of course, no one has heard from this address either to this number of highway managers to this day.
Futile fight.
Such silence or opaque changes to settlements are not uncommon.
We gradually fined one company for CZK 2 million a few years ago.
But she changed the name and the IČO and there was nothing to deal with.
The bailiff returned the case, the ads kept standing, perhaps in other places.
We are quite powerless against such firms and their business practices.
It's like fighting windmills, one of the officials admits on condition of anonymity.
The amendment to the law has not yet been addressed in this regard.
Aktuálně.cz spoke to several MPs who were intrigued by the problem.
But they have not yet developed any activity.
On the contrary, there were MPs who wanted to extend the deadline for keeping the billboards for the main Czech roads.
The government rejected it.
Billboards are not only a very sensitive and somewhat schizophrenic topic for national but also of regional and municipal politicians.
On the one hand, they know about the social demand for their restrictions; on the other, they need them themselves for advertising in election campaigns.
I don't hold the rather established impression that if something doesn't work, you need to change the law.
Farmers will harvest less grain this year, but more rapeseed and poppy, statisticians estimate.
According to estimates by the Czech Statistical Office, the cereal harvest will be 6.7 percent lower this year than last year.
Yet this year's crop is above the average over the last five and a decade.
On the contrary, the rapeseed harvest (by 3.9 per cent) and poppy (2.5 per cent) will be higher.
The cereal harvest will be 6.7 percent lower this year than last year.
Farmers harvest 7.2 million tons of grain.
This is based on an estimate that is as of 15. July published by the Czech Statistical Office.
The initial estimate a month ago was more pessimistic and projected a one-tenth drop from last year.
Last year's cereal harvest, however, was above average.
This year's crop is above the average for the last five and a decade.
On the contrary, the harvest of rapeseed and poppy seed will be higher this year.
Rape growers will harvest 3.9 percent more than they did a year ago, when they got 1.256 million tonnes under the roof.
This year's poppy crop could be 2.5 percent higher than last year's.
The projected decrease in cereal production is due to both a 3.7 per cent reduction in the hectare yield to 5.71 tonnes per hectare and a decrease in the sowing area.
Farmers have sowed three percent fewer fields this year.
The winter wheat, which is the most important grain for the Czech Republic, will be up 3.3 percent less this year, according to an estimate.
The farmers planted it in more fields.
But the drop is to be hit by a lower hectare yield, which will drop to 6.04 tonnes.
The statisticians predict a decrease of about one-fifth of the spring barley, which is most often used for beer production.
The reduction in the crop is due to a reduction in crop space by 15.2 per cent, but also a lower hectare yield.
The barley of winter, on the other hand, is 6.3 percent more.
There will also be a harvest of rye.
Rape crop is estimated by statisticians at 1.305 million tonnes, which is more than last year.
As the areas area expanded by 7.3 percent.
But the hectare yield will be 3.2 percent lower than last year.
This year's rapeseed crop will exceed the 10-year average by 13.3 percent, with a one-third more extensive on the sowing area than it was a decade ago.
In the last four years, there has also been more poppy appoomnia.
This year, farmers planted it on 35,543 hectares.
But compared to 2008, when poppy was grown on a record 70,000 hectares in the Czech Republic, the fields are half.
Thanks to the expansion of the sowing areas, this year's poppy harvest will be richer.
It will rise 2.5 percent against last year to 27,423 tonnes.
But the hectare yield will be 6.1 percent lower.
Olomouc police officers charged two men for a knife and machete attack, and the court remanded them into custody.
Police have charged two attackers who attacked a 35-year-old man with a knife and a machete on Tuesday in the centre of Olomouc.
"Although the attacker tried to escape, they caused a cut and cut injury that required hospital treatment and other treatment," police spokesperson Marie Štrbáková said.
The two apparent perpetrators were apprehended immediately after the attack by police officers.
The prosecutor filed a motion for the court to take them into custody and was granted by the court on Friday.
Both men face between three and ten years in prison.
Officers charged two detainees with assaulting a 35-year-old man in the centre of Olomouc with a knife and a machete.
The attackers caused him with schievous and cuts, and the man ended up in the hospital.
The attack was preceded by an incident between two groups of people, which happened at noon on Tuesday at high noon on the Liberty avenue, police said.
The perpetrators ended up in custody, Olomouc police spokeswoman Marie Štrbáková reported.
A mass scuffle between two families took place in the area of the garden in front of the Tratorie bar in the immediate vicinity of the centre of Olomouc.
After an aggressive verbal dispute, two attackers attacked a 35-year-old man with a knife and a machete.
Although the attacked man tried to escape, he was injured in a cutlery and cut injury, which required hospital treatment and other treatments, a police spokesperson said.
The scuffle, which attracted a lot of attention in the city centre and for which several police patrols and constables had to intervene at the scene, it was a family dispute.
Forensics charged a 34-year-old man from Slovakia and a 37-year-old man from Olomouc with attempted grievous bodily harm and disorderly conduct.
The prosecutor filed a motion with the court to remand them in custody and the court granted it on Friday, the spokesperson added.
The machete was also used in the centre of Olomouc in a mass brawl by the attackers five years ago, it happened then only a few dozen metres further, in front of the disco of Varna in Riegrova Street.
Officers said at the time that a group of around ten foreigners carrying weapons attacked the company's guests in front of the entrance.
Police said they had knives, canes and machetes in their hands.
The court then sentenced the two attacking foreigners with a suspended sentence.
Abandoned and empty houses in the centre of Prague.
You'll be surprised, you may walk around them every day.
One of the most glaring examples of an unused and empty house is the sprawling building of the former IPB residence in the middle of Senovážné Square.
It should have operated as a hotel a long time ago.
But still nothing.
That you need to build new and new apartments and offices in the metropolis?
What about using the existing, often architecturally valuable and protected?
Directly in the centre of Prague in the immediate vicinity of Wenceslas Square there are several apartment buildings which, despite their location, size and often monument protection, are only fainted and empty.
We chose the properties in the centre using the project Prázdnédomy.cz, which maps long-term empty properties in the Czech Republic.
Houses are usually victims of their owners' financial problems, opaque relationships among companies, or are a state that can't or won't get rid of them.
There are more empty houses in the Czech Republic than homeless.
Let the owners pay a special tax for them, the initiative wants

Mr and Mrs Clinton earned $10.6 million last year.
Trump refuses to release his tax return.
Hillary Clinton and her husband, ex-President Bill Clinton, made $10.6 million last year.
More than $1 million was donated to the Clintons for charity.
Most of the Clintons' income - over $6 million - is for their speeches.
Trump refuses to publish his tax returns.
U.S. Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton released her tax statements on Friday, increasing the pressure on her Republican opponent, Donald Trump, to do the same.
Hillary Clinton and her husband, ex-President Bill Clinton, made $10.6 million last year, the AP reported.
Most of the Clintons' income - over $6 million - is for their speeches, largely from before April 2015, when Clinton launched her campaign for the run-up to the election.
The tax report showed that Mr and Mrs Clinton paid a federal income tax of 34.2 percent last year, and then a federal income tax of nine percent.
In total, they paid 43.2 percent of income in taxes.
But Trump has a problem with a similar move, and has not yet committed to the release of his tax return.
There is a possibility that Donald Trump pays no tax at all, Clinton tweeted a few minutes after the release of her confession.
Clinton has repeatedly returned to secrecy over Trump's income, among other things to raise doubts as to whether her opponent is really as rich as she claims, the AP reported.
Trump's fortune is estimated to be worth billions of dollars.
Lower earnings would damage the Republican nominee's reputation as a successful businessman.
Senator Tim Kaine, who is running for vice president in tandem with the former First Lady, today released a report on his tax collections over the past decade.
He and his wife, Anne Holton, gave 7.5 percent of their earnings to charity, and paid 25.6 percent of their earnings in taxes last year.
In Nigeria, polio broke out again.
Boko Haram Islamists defended a rigorous vaccination and killed doctors.
In Nigeria, cases of polio have reappeared.
In the northeast of the country, the government declared an extraordinary vaccination there, as two children infected with the disease were paralyzed.
The vaccines were flown by helicopters.
In the affected area, Islamist Boko Haram terrorists were active, defending the vaccination and even killing doctors.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the virus circulated there undetected.
In northeast Nigeria, an extra vaccination of children against polio will begin, as two children infected with the disease have paralyzed there.
In Africa, polio was last diagnosed two years ago in Somalia.
The Nigerian government has announced that one million children will be inoculated in the state of Borno and another four million in the surrounding states.
Nigerian military helicopters on Friday, according to the AP, quickly delivered polio vaccines to the affected northeastern part of the country, where Islamist Boko Haram terrorists are active.
The World Health Organization (WHO) said the virus had been circulating undetected in the area for many years.
Boko Haram extremists have prevented vaccinations in the past and even killed doctors.
Their attacks also made it impossible on Thursday for doctors to reach areas where children with polio were identified.
Both affected toddlers came with refugees from part of Nigeria newly freed from Boko Haram.
The WHO section director responsible for eradicating polio, Michel Zaffran, told the BBC that vaccination in Nigeria would begin as early as next week.
The Islamic radical group Boko Haram has long been active in Borno state.
The area was not made available to international organisations and the government until early this year, when Boko Haram managed to weaken in this part of the country in a major way.
Nigerian Health Minister Isaac Adewole has admitted that new polio cases are a major disappointment for the country, as Nigeria wanted to report next year that polio had been eradicated in it.
The WHO pointed out that it was possible that although the disease had not appeared for two years, it was still spreading among the children.
Children under the age of five will now be vaccinated.
In 2012, Nigeria accounted for half of all cases of polio in the world.
While polio was still in 125 countries in 1988, it now persists in only three areas - Afghanistan and Pakistan and the north of Nigeria.
The Pope met former prostitutes in Rome.
He listened to the troubled stories of the fallen women.
Pope Francis met with 20 former prostitutes who were leaked from a gaffe gang thanks to the police.
The Pope heard their difficult life stories and urged them to look with confidence to the future.
With this meeting, Francis wanted to draw attention to human trafficking and call for an amplification to the fight against him.
In Rome, Pope Francis met with 20 former prostitutes who were freed from the power of a pimp gang by the police.
The head of the Catholic Church listened to the troubled stories of the fallen women for more than an hour and subsequently urged them to look confidently to the future, a Vatican spokesman said.
Among the former prostitutes visited by Francis were six women from Romania, four from Albania, seven from Nigeria and one from Tunisia, Italy and Ukraine.
Their average age is around 30.
All were subjected to severe physical violence during the Vatican's forced prostitution.
By visiting, Francis wanted to draw attention to human trafficking and call for a stronger fight against him, the Pope's spokesman said.
Francis often draws attention to the fates of people on the fringes of society.
On Thursday, for example, he had lunch with Syrian refugees who arrived at the Vatican in April this year and in June thanks to his personal invitation.
France will hit the Jihadi plant.
Without the help of Muslims, it will not be possible.
France is to be helped by the Muslims themselves in the fight against radical Islamism.
In addition, the government of Prime Minister Manuel Valls is making major changes to the functioning of the mosques and the education of clergy.
Since last December, we have closed 20 mosques and prayer rooms.
And others will follow, the Home Secretary announced.
There are over a hundred Jihadi producers in the country.
"If Muslims do not help the state in the fight against those who violate public freedom, it will be increasingly difficult for France to guarantee freedom of this religion," said Prime Minister Manuel Valls.
In particular, he intends to ensure that only the imams who were educated in France mosques and prayer rooms are preached.
At the same time, it wants to stop the financing of mosques from abroad.
At the moment, about 20 percent of the money is coming from abroad for the construction of new mosques, the most from Morocco, Algeria and the Gulf countries.
This, too, is then brought to the mosques by preachers who can sow radicalism in France.
"Our country must show that Islam is compatible with democracy," the prime minister added.
The key to ensuring that he fulfils these goals will be the new French Islamic Foundation.
This should act as a bridge between the secular state and the Muslim minority.
No more money from abroad.
The country is now the French Foundation for Islam, founded in 2005 by then Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin.
Even then, the foundation was to contribute to making the financial flows between the mosques and the countries that finance their construction.
But the institution was soon hit by internal divisions and rivalries.
"It's a total failure," Valls said recently.
On the French political scene, after the attack on Charlie Hebdo magazine in January 2015, a debate about a new institution to replace the dysfunctional foundation erupted.
It was all hastened by further terrorist attacks in France carried out in the name of the Islamic State by radicalised Islamists.
French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve recently let it be known that a new foundation will be created in October this year.
It will have two main challenges - to secure the funding of mosques from home sources, as well as to oversee the imams.
For now, it is unclear where he will take the money not only to build new mosques, but also to various educational centres.
But several proposals are being considered.
One is a special fee or a tax on halal food.
This would be paid for in practice by the sellers of halal food, for providing certification.
Some of that money would then go to the foundation's purse.
The allowance of ten to twenty euros ($270 to 540) could then be paid by French pilgrims who go to Mecca.
Every year, about 30,000 go there for the traditional pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia.
And not only that.
According to the prime minister, in the future only preachers who have passed through special education programs at French universities should be active in the mosques.
This should ensure that the sermon is in line with democracy.
Radical mosques will be closed.
The French government is also in a campaign against the militants.
Others will follow, the Home Secretary recently announced.
There is no place for those who preach hatred in mosques and do not respect some of the principles of our country, such as equality between women and men.
The country is estimated to have about 2,500 mosques and prayers.
It is estimated that about 120 of them are under the influence of radical Islamism.
Since 2012, the authorities have expelled some 80 imams, and for several dozen more, they are considering it.
But not everyone thinks the government's actions can make a significant impact against radicalism.
Those who want to be radicalised will do it the same way.
This is not the case in mosques, young people are radicalised online, said Severine Labat, an expert at the National Center for Scientific Research.
Track coach Kelemen lost in the first round of the sprint to the star Baugém.
The Czech track cyclist must fight for the last eight in the repair rides.
After advancing from the sprint qualification in the top 18, the run-up to the top 18, the runner-up to the top 18 lost the match against French great Grégory Baugé, the defending silver champion from the previous Games in London, after advancing from the sprint qualifiers.
He must fight for the last eight in the final rounds.
The start of the royal discipline on the course was set by 27 riders and the best Czech trainee of the day claimed the 14th best time.
He made the 200 with a flying start in 9.969 seconds.
In the main knockout stage, he was expected to be in qualifying for fifth-placed Baugé, who already has bronze in the team sprint from Rio.
Kelemen was pushing the experienced Frenchman in the end, but he kept an eye on the progress.
A brilliant performance was flashed by the defending gold champion, Jason Kenny.
The 28-year-old finished the third fastest 200 in history and won the qualification in an Olympic record of 9.551.
He was also easily able to cope with the last advancing, which was German Maximilian Levy, as expected.
The British quartet also flourished in the line-up with Bradley Wiggins, who set a new world record of 3:50.570 in the 4km pursuit and advanced to the final.
The previous best (3:51.659), which was four years since the London Olympics, was improved by more than a second by the British.
Young doctors push: They want fresh wind in the industry
Representatives of the young doctors were gathered to approve the new steps in their dispute over the new contract.
The Council of Junior Physicians (JDC) at the British Medical Association (BMA) must seek the full advice to support further industry events in early September.
JDC says ministers have failed to resolve the issues about the treaty.
In July, young doctors and medical students voted to reject a contract agreed with the BMA.
58% of its members who participated in the election were rejected.
In a letter to members posted on Twitter on Thursday night, JDC Chairwoman Ellen McCourt said the government remained "quietly silent" on the issues, which is very much to dismiss the contract.
She said: "In this light, the executive body of the executive arm of JDC voted to reject the proposed new treaty in full and to request new formal negotiations on all issues."
In response to the government's silence, the Executive Board of the JDC formally requested a special meeting of the BMA board to approve a running programme of heated trade events in early September.
The dispute led the young physicians to announce up to six strikes this year, including the first general strikes in the history of the NHS.
Leader of the young doctors at BMA, Dr. Johann Malawana, resigned after the decision to reject the agreed terms of the contract recommended by the BMA.
He told the BMA members at the pre-growing meetings in front of 54,000 young doctors and medical students that the agreement was good and should be adopted.
After the vote, the health minister said the treaty would put a burden on the medics in England.
Russia and Turkey: An alliance of the "incompatible"?
It was a gesture that ended in a crisis.
Leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to shake hands and announce a formal end to the eight-month war of long war and economic sanctions.
But while Vladimir Putin welcomed the Turkish counterparty to the sumptuous hall of the palace in St. Petersburg, I had the impression that Ankara wanted more of this reconciliation.
There were hands on, yes.
But Putin did not smile, and he was hardly warm-hearted, even by his aloft standards.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, has repeatedly spoken of his "dead friend" to Mr. Putin - five times, as one of the reports says.
I didn't count.
He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their pre-crisis level, but would be even better.
The next day, one of the local newspapers wrote that Erdogan had acted as if nothing bad had ever happened.
To me, his enthusiasm betrayed the exact opposite.
But the lingering chill that emanated from Putin showed that the Russian leader had forgotten nothing.
The real cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his opening statement: Shooting down a Russian fighter jet by Turkey on the Syrian border.
Moscow's response at the time was furious.
Putin was throwing punches around him, accusing Ankara of driving a knife in the back of Moscow.
The outrage was all the greater because it came from a supposed friend.
It will be difficult, perhaps even impossible, to rebuild real trust.
Russian public opinion has also changed since December.
For months, the state-controlled media ran a massive nationwide campaign against Ankara.
Suddenly it looked as if the Turks were to blame.
More serious were the allegations from top state officials that Erdogan's own family benefited from the illegal oil trade in parts of Syria controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He strongly denied this.
But in St. Petersburg came the official message that it was time to move on.
After all, this meeting was only because Putin received an apology he had asked for from President Erdogan.
Russia could have declared some victory.
For Ankara, the benefits of declaring a truce are clear.
In the first place, Erdogan was almost stripped of power during the failed coup last month and therefore needs all his friends.
The repeated terrorist attacks in Turkey have visibly shaken him as well.
There is also an economic motive.
Russia's sanctions have had a harsh impact - mainly the cancellation of charter flights, which are transported annually by several million Russian tourists to the coast of Turkey.
This number has decreased by almost 90%.
As for Russia, tour operators and charter companies will surely be relieved when flights are resumed.
They make money from the Mediterranean tourism industry at the end of the season.
Even this week, state television promised cheaper fruit and vegetables when agricultural commodity imports from Turkish are allowed again.
"Tourists there, tomatoes back here," as the news in the Vedemosti newspaper reported.
But the visit had other political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry at the West for what it sees as a feeble response to the coup attempt.
In addition, the long-lasting animosity of the lengthy talks on joining the EU and the accession of Putin - eager to be able to use the cooling and break Turkey's ties with the West.
The Russian leader certainly scored bonus points when Ankara asked him to help the elected authorities after the attempted coup.
You must understand that for Moscow, which has a deep-rooted fear of regime change, it is a given.
So the summit in this pompous, seaside palace to Russia and Turkey allowed to demonstrate what one analysts described to me as "the alliance of the incompatible": how the forces of two countries that feel rejected and used by the West join forces.
However, despite publicly showing mutual reconciliation, there are fundamental differences between the two countries.
The first is Syria, where Moscow recently stood as a peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey stand on opposite sides.
You could say that after the nearly three-hour initial interviews, the two presidents said at a press conference that they had not even mentioned the issue.
The Turkish president deliberately avoided answering the question of the differences between them, while Putin decided to highlight these differences.
There is no clear agreement on the basis of which both states can find common ground on the issue of Syria.
But after months of open hostility - and the risk of a total disaster when a NATO member Turkey shot down a Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better that the two leaders are at least talking to each other again.
Royal Bank of Scotland disappears for customers outside Scotland
According to the bank's managing director, the RBS brand is to be suppressed in the role of the back office.
Royal Bank of Scotland is lost to customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was linked to the bank's global ambitions.
It eased off it when it almost disappeared eight years ago and had to be bought out of debt.
At the time, the strategic brands used "RBS" to protect other consumer finance brands.
It was backed by millions of pounds spent on sponsoring international sport, from the Rugby championship of the Six Nations to the champion of Winbledom's Andy Marray.
But it has now been decided that it is better to give more of the national brands to stand out.
Royal Bank of Scotland will be used with Scottish customers but will not launch new stores.
All references to RBS in England and Wales, with the exception of headquarters and stock codeing, will be changed to NatWest.
Customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland are already in use by the Ulster Bank brand.
There are other, smaller private banking brands that come to the fore more - Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond, and Holt's Military Bank.
During his travels to customers and employees in Inverness-shire, McEwan answered the questions from Ross McEwan.
BBC Scotland told the BBC: ‘The RBS brand will cease to be our investor brand and the brand that our employees work for, because we are now much more branded.'
As the bank itself became a global brand, it also became a global brand for RBS.
I now say that we no longer have global aspirations, we have efforts focused on the domestic scene.
Each of these brands will mean something completely different in its own communities, and our workers will work under these brands.
RBS has already said it will not continue its sponsorship of the Six Nations Championships, preparing the profile of individual sports sponsorship brands.
"Is it a good time for us to move on to the brand's bank, because the basic question (which we ask) is how to focus on becoming a better bank for customers?" said the CEO.
Three years ago, it would have been very cynical to say that we would become a great bank for customers and introduce those brands.
But along with the way we focused on customer needs and not on our own, I think there are a lot of changes.
We can recall these marks, I think the time has come.
Frankie Dettori in Newmarket horse Predilection to reach the finish line of 3000th
Dettori sprays champagne after double victory in Newmarket earned him 3,000 victories
Jockey Frankie Dettori secured his 3000th victory in Britain in Newmarket on Friday.
He reached this milestone with his second victory of the night on his local track - a Predilection horse, coached by John Gosden.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to achieve such a result in the flat races.
His predecessors are Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson.
The three-time chorus of Dettori, who had previously won a horse on his horse by Ghayyar, said, "It's strange."
I'm very touched because my family is here too
I am extremely glad that this happened in Newmarket, because this is where I docked 30 years ago.
It's not a tremendous event, it's not the Royal Ascot - it's Friday night on the ground with 20,000 people.
I'm relieved and I'm very grateful.
Dettori collects congratulations as Predredilection brings in Predilection
Two jockeys reached that milestone in the hurdleship - champion jockey Richard Johnson and 20-time retired champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who have taken more than 4,300 winners to the finish line during his career breaking records.
Lester Piggott, nine-time Derby winner, 4,493 career winners
Frankie is one of the best jockeys of the modern age and it is no surprise that he reached the milestone, which was reached by only a few riders before him.
He is stylish and strong, but it is his tactical frazzler who distinguishes him from the other drivers in the weighing room.
He is a fantastic ambassador for the race, his enthusiasm and charisma attracted fans to this sport for years.
A few weeks ago, I told Frankie in Epsom that if he hadn't only ridden on weekends and big races, he'd already have 6,000 winners!
However, the truth is that Frankie rode the winner in the UK for the better part of his 30-year career, and that is really something.
It has a vivid nature, which is good for the British racing sport. But more importantly, he's an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated his success with his famous fleeting jump
From his summer finishes to his fleeting jumps - Frankie Dettori, the messenger of the British flat-rate races has been for two decades.
It was like a roller coaster ride.
An unpleasant number of winners of the big races, including his well-known "great seven" in Ascot. But he also survived the plane crash and was banned from taking off for drugs.
Three years ago, he stagnated for the first time when he returned after a 6-month launch ban, but he showed incredible inner strength and returned to all the doubters in the best of shape in spite of him.
And maybe it won't be the last time - Dettori has previously stated that he would like to continue racing until at least 50.
Russian President Putin Releases Presidential Office Chief Sergey Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin abruptly dismissed Sergei Ivanov as head of the presidential office on Friday.
Ivanov has been one of Putin's closest associates for many years.
The 63-year-old Ivanov was appointed special representative for ecology and transport.
A statement from the Kremlin said that Putin "recalled Ivan from his services to the head of the Russian presidential office," but no reason was given.
His place will be taken over by Anton Vajno, who had been Ivanov's deputy since 2012.
Vajno, 44, was previously a diplomat.
Born in Estonia's capital, Tallinn, in 1972, graduated from the prestigious State Institute of International Relations in Moscow (MGIMO) and worked at the embassy in Tokiya.
The website (in Russian) states that he later served as head of the presidential protocol and the presidential office.
When he was appointed to Putin, he said, "Thank you for your confidence."
I believe that the most important role of the administration is to support your activities as the Head of State's activities in the sense of draft laws and the control of the extent to which your guidelines are respected.
Putin told the Russian television station on Friday that Ivanov had asked him to be relieved of the post and recommended that Vajno replace him.
Will he convince the smiles?
This move has completely mystified Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov was one of Vladimir Putin's closest associates for the long term, and like Putin, he worked for the KGB.
As head of the presidential office, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin broadcast on state television, both men said he was leaving the presidential office's post at his own request.
But the smiles for the cameras were only convinced by a few people - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.
So is this a result of some kind of power struggle?
No one knows yet.
But the official claim that a man who was once thought of as a possible president is suddenly eager to pursue Russia's environmental policies has been met with a lot of mistrust.
The Kremlin's website quotes remarks made to Putin, in which Ivanov states: "It is true that in 2012, in an interview I asked you to give me for four years in a very demanding post, you might say a problematic post.
I seem to have been chief of the presidential office for four years and eight months.
Ivanov took up the post in December 2011.
Prior to that, he served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and previously, like Putin, worked for the State Security Committee (KGB).
In the late 1990s, when Putin was in charge of the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation (FSB), which replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed as his deputy.
When Putin came to power, he appointed Ivanov to one of his five closest associates.
Indeed, it was speculated at the time that Ivanov might succeed Putin at the head of state after his second term, because the third term would be unconstitutional for Putin.
But this post was taken over by another close associate of Putin's collaborator, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became prime minister just three and a half years later before returning to the presidency.
Thomas Gibson, star of The Ideas of the Crime Scots, was released after being hit by the director
Gibson was involved in a physical exchange of views on the scene in Los Angeles last month.
ABC and CBS, which produce the series, announced his release in a joint statement.
Gibson, who played Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, apologized on Thursday before the announcement of his firing.
There were creative differences in the scene and disagreements.
I'm sorry that's happened," he said in a statement.
According to a statement from ABC and CBS, the details of how the character of Gibson disappears from the series, which follows the stories of the FBI's team of a team of ABC and CBS, is the details of how the character of Gibson disappears from the series, following.
The 54-year-old actor, made famous for his lead roles in the sitcom Dharma and Greg, has starred in the series since the first series in 2005.
"I love the Thoughts of the Criminal, and over the last 12 years I have given the heart and soul to them," Gibson said in his statement issued on Friday.
I was hoping to be in it until the end. But that will not be possible now.
I would like to express my thanks to the authors, the producers, the actors, our amazing team and, above all, the great fans that this show has ever been hoping for.
The series is expected to return to the 12th series on September 28.
In the city of Banff, fish have mysteriously landed in the garden
A man from the town of Banff asked for help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden.
Kevin Bain believes that 75 fish may be the sand eel left behind by the water whirlwind.
Bain, who lives about 500 metres from the sea, posted a short film of his find on the Periscope Canal, believing that someone might help him explain how the 5-centimetre fish got into his garden.
Queensferry Crossing: The bridge now connects to Fife
£1.35bn project to be completed by May 2017
Engineers have connected the northern platform and the Queensferry Crossing and the viaduct - so the bridge now connects with Fife.
This is the first of the four caps between the "swimmers of the platform" that are now almost completed around each of the three pylons of the bridge.
Part of the bridge from Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tonnes.
It features 10,000 tonnes of iron and 20,000 tonnes of concrete and 46 suspension ropes.
The £1.35bn project is due to be completed by May 2017.
Economic Secretary Keith Brown visited the construction today and was among the first to come from the mainland to the bridge.
He said, "This is a historic moment and a symbolic moment of building a Queensferry Crossing.
On this project, we all see how the civil engineers on an impressive scale used more than 30,000 tonnes of concrete and steel to construct this part of the bridge.
Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the cap between the viaduct and the platform of the bridge was a delicate operation that required extraordinary accuracy.
There is now a total of more than 79% of the total area of the bridge in its place, the concrete for the last part of the platform is now being flown in Rosyth, so the entire platform is ready to be raised for the bridge.
Michael Martin, the project leader of the Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors project, said: "The first closure for the construction of each bridge is always an important milestone.
On this amazing project, this closure represents the top of the building building.
After installing the last part of the road platform and its connection to the North Tower expansion plateau, we then had to close the last gap on the north side - towards the mainland.
We did this by extending the northern approach viaduct 700 millimetres south.
This was a massive and, at the same time, very delicate operation.
Massive because the viaduct is 222 metres long, weighs about 6,000 tonnes and was necessary to drag it with a climb of about 3%.
Delican because the tolerances the team worked with were very small - only a few millimetres in each direction.
Fortunately, everything was going very well.
Saving in Moelfre Bay: Three men are 'happy to be alive'.
The three men are "happy to be alive" after being washed away by the water from their fishing boat off Anglesey.
The Moelfre RNLI Rescue Boat Station ran the alert at 1:20 p.m. on Friday, British summer time, after the crew saw the incident at Moelfre Bay.
All three men tried to swim to safety, while their boat continued unguided.
"We saw their boat circling in their vicinity, and we thought of the worst of it," said the helmsman of the rescue boat, Mopler Vince Jones.
"Fortunately, the strong wind blew him away from them before we left," he added.
Two men were rescued by a local fishing boat, a third man aged 60, found without a life jacket exhausted holding on to the buoys.
All were transferred to the deck of the Coast Rescue Deboat and take them back to the rescue boat station
Jones said, "Three men toppling into the water are happy to be alive and completely unhurt.
The ship's engine had a rope for an emergency shutdown, but somehow it was disconnected from the person who was driving the boat when the overturning.
Someone from above was holding a protective hand over the boys.
The judge refuses to hear the case over Tluchor's wife.
Petr Tluchoř is one of three deputies who, according to the indictment, were to receive a political tobacconist from Prime Minister Nečas and his then cabinet chief Jana Nagy, a lucrative post for a political concession.
In 2012, it was the approval of the tax package.
Šnajdr, Fuksa and Tluchoř allowed him to resign by their resignations.
Then they appeared in influential posts in state-owned companies.
That is why they also faced suspicion of a bribe and ended up in custody for a month.
According to the court, however, they were wrongfully, and they received compensation of almost CZK 2 million.
Tluchoř is now a witness in the case, following the intervention of the Supreme Court.
His wife works in the courthouse on the Fruit Market and is dealing with civil disputes.
Yet Judge Helena Králová wants to be cautious (he addresses criminal matters) and avoid possible objections.
The case will probably be put in charge of another Prague judicial district.
The king has already twice exonerated Jana Nečas, formerly Nagy.
It was an alleged misuse of military intelligence to track down the first wife of Prime Minister Nečas Radka.
In this case, Tluchoř was not featured.
According to the lawyer, Jaroslav Ortman, this is an unnecessarily exaggerated reaction.
I think that impartiality cannot be interpreted in this way for a court to be excluded if the witnesses have a wife or relatives in the court.
I'm afraid there's no way to judge at all, he noted to the Journal.
"It seems crazy," he added.
Roman Boček, a former official, is also charged with the case of political newsagents.
According to his lawyer, Petr Toman, however, a possible objection would have a chance of success.
The District Court for Prague 1 heard on 13. June the indictment of the former head of the cabinet of Prime Minister Petr Nečas, Jana Nagy (now Nečas) and other accused in the case of abuse of Military Intelligence.
In the picture, Nečas and her husband come to court.
Tluchor was to address the statements about Peroutka.
The ex-president's wife, for example, was to try President Miloš Zeman's remarks about the democratic pre-war journalist Ferdinand Peroutka.
Zeman said he had sympathized with Adolf Hitler.
One of the schoolgirls is already dead!
The girl apparently died in an air raid by the Allied forces.
She flew to Syria, along with her two girlfriends of their same age, from London's Gatwick Airport last February.
The British Home Office did not comment on the news of her death.
Young Londoners who had fled home were secretly taken to Syria via the Turkish border, according to police.
Shamima Begum, Amira Abase and Kadiza Sultana have headed for their other former classmate at the Bethnal Green Academy in London, according to the media.
The case drew a huge wave of attention last year, as did tensions in relations between Britain and Turkey.
British security forces estimate that about 600 British Muslims have so far travelled to Syria, about 50 of them young women and girls.
A number of them joined the militants of IS and other groups.
Those who return home pose a terrorist threat to Britain.
Dreaming work for a $1,000 salary.
A well-paid job that you don't even need college for.
This is what the I.T. job looks like at first glance.
And often the other one.
The advantage is not only an extremely high salary for Czech standards (you earn up to CZK 180,000 in IT work in Prague), but also extreme benefits.
This is due to the huge shortage of IT specialists.
There are thousands of specialists missing.
It is estimated that nearly 20,000 IT specialists are missing in the Czech Republic.
The most wanted, according to statistics from the staffing agency Grafton, are programmers, developers, network engineers and application specialists.
Candidates can choose between several job offers.
So the candidates will not compete for the job position, but the jobs for the candidates, comments Jitka Součková, marketing manager at Grafton Recruitment.
College is not a necessity.
College education is not a necessity for I.T.
Higher education means a good foundation and is an overall indicator of the candidate's intelligence and education, but it often has little to do with knowledge of development.
Developers have to constantly learn new things, which will not be replaced by a graduate college, says Petr Kubačka, director of Monster Career CZ.
The most earned is in Prague.
I.T. wages everywhere are high above the Republic average.
The most money will come in Prague and Brno, it is not such a hit parade in the regions.
"The wage conditions in Brno are comparable to those of Prague," confirms Kubačka.
The highest earnings will be achieved by the technical directors.
In Prague and Brno they can come to 120,000 - 180,000 CZK.
In other regions, the salary is lower, but it will not fall below CZK 80,000 there either.
IT project managers are also in demand.
When they start, they can earn CZK 60,000 - 100,000.
There is also a fight for graduates.
While in some professions graduates often have to go straight to the employment office, this is not the case with I.T.
In fact, if companies are to be poached and overcharged by an expert from another company, they will be happy to reach for a graduate.
They can raise him their own.
They can't do without language.
Knowledge of a foreign language is useful in every profession, but with I.t.T. people, at least decent English is necessary.
Knowledge of at least one foreign language is a must for some IT positions.
On the other hand, we see a number of cases where companies look for a particularly well-educated and experienced person, and is content to do with only the average knowledge of English.
However, if, for example, the support worker controls more foreign languages, he is of interest to his employer because it can serve more customers from different countries, adds director Kubačka.
Yeah at Google, there's a paradise.
They can only quietly envy the Czech workers of the employees at Google.
Of course, there is flexible working hours, the possibility of working from home or various part-time jobs, not just for mums.
"The company provides new dads with four extra weeks of leave after the birth of the child," says Martina Jonek, a Google spokesperson.
The covertisation also involves health care for the staff and the family, meals, transport, training, wellness or massages directly at the workplace.
Whoever wants to be educated has the green light and no matter what new one wants to learn.
But the benefits don't stop there.
Such a full free fridge is definitely not bad either.
A healthy lunch (both breakfast and dinner in some locations) are available on site every day.
In addition, there are so-called micro-kitchenettes in all offices, where people always find a healthy snack, the speaker reveals.
And to avoid getting fired, if nothing is to be asked, he puts in boxes that employees can take home in the evening.
And the reason for these unbelievable advantages for Czech standards?
Create a creative and motivating environment!
"It is not important for Google that employees sit in the office for eight hours a day, but the results of initiatives or projects, a shift or development, ideas and innovative solutions," the spokesperson adds.
The UN has sharply criticized Bulgaria for criminalising refugees.
On Thursday, Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein, the UN Human Rights Commissioner, accused Bulgaria systematically violating human rights by criminalising refugees.
The official strategy of the Bulgarian government "poises serious concern about Bulgaria's failure to comply with international law," warned Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein in a statement.
He pointed out that "it is particularly disturbing to witness how important and influential public figures publicly express support for the criminal armed fighters who are boldly hitting refugees on the border between Bulgaria and Turkey."
"One of the most serious problems is that almost all people who cross to Bulgarian territory are automatically arrested in an irregular manner," Zeid pointed out.
What's worse is she - they are often prosecuted and imprisoned - for a year or more - if he tries to leave the country.
Their attempts to leave the country are criminalised despite the fact that everyone has the right under international law to leave any country, including their own.
Bulgaria has detained 14,000 migrants this year, 2100 in the same period last year.
Pokémon Go - chasing health and happiness that pays off
It's fascinating to see the world change.
Many people have lamented over the last decade that teenagers and children are no longer playing outdoors, preferring to spend their free time in front of screens.
Pokémon Go lifts people out of the sofas and leads them to activity.
Time spent in front of screens was originally shrouded on television, later for video games and, most recently, smartphones.
It's great to see that technology and activities out there are no non-reachies.
I am, of course, talking about the fashion, which is Pokémon Go, an app based on characters that first appeared in video games in the late 1990s (later a cartoon series, playing cards and more).
As with many cultural phenomena, there was a decline in interest before the launch of this new play at the beginning of July in the US, Australia and New Zealand.
The launch in other countries was then postponed due to the massive interest that led to the overload of servers.
Pokémon Go has attracted more users than Tinder and almost as many users as Twitter in a matter of days.
How does it work?
In short, the smartphone players go out to find the Pokémon, which they follow with GPS, and when they find them, they can "take them" (pass the screenshot on the phone) or "catch."
Mania has gripped a generation that played the game at a younger age, lifts it from its seats and drives out to look for Pokémon.
In the US, thanks to this game, there has been a significant increase in the number of steps that the "average" person does every day.
Apple's smartwatch Cardiogram app, which tracks 35,000 users, recently told the Washington Post that within two days of the start of the game, the number of people being watched to practice for 30 minutes has jumped from 45 to 53 percent.
The company has no information about who is playing Pokémon Go - they see only rough data about the exercise levels.
Many public campaigns to make people "find 30," "get off the couch" and "are active every day" fall to barren ground, because most of the public health-related messages are boring and designed for people who don't look good.
Yet the importance of exercise must not be underestimated.
Those who exercise regularly reduce the risk of cancer or depression.
Physical activity is involved in controlling weight, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that we cannot fully mention here.
But the beauty of Pokemon Go is that people go out and do something they enjoy.
You cover three pillars of health - movement, fresh air and sunlight. And fun.
Some people even make new friends in the pursuit of pokemons.
As is usually the case, there will be, of course, some boring patrons who are looking for any excuse to complain.
And, yes, someone could walk in the door.
So what, like?
There's a breakthrough.
In their day, smartphone apps, like the Fitbit, could track our activity, but gave us no reason to do something like this game did.
The news is being seen and the interest in it begins to fall off at some point.
However, thanks to the success of Pokémon, other games will emerge that will combine apps and virtual reality with activity in the real world, helping a number of people hunt for activity, health and a better form.

Simone Biles wins gold in multi-event gymnastics women
Forget the pressure.
Forget the excitement.
Simone Biles is immune to all this.
Dynamic to jump.
No effort on the beam.
In the floor, everyone was speechless.
Excellent in everything.
And now, finally, the Olympic champion.
The 19-year-old American gymnast went straight for the title in the all-around on Thursday, and overcame the others on the full line below the Olympic floodlights.
The overall result of 62.198 was clearly confirmed by her lead over the silver medalist and team member of the "Final Five" team, Aly Raismanova, and the Russian bronze medalist, Alia Mustafin.
Simone Biles (USA) on Thursday during a cache appearance in the final of the individual's multi-fight in sports gymnastics at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
Biles became the fourth American in a row to win the multi-fight, and fifth overall, when she confirmed her reputation as the best gymnast of her generation and perhaps the best ever.
When her overall final standings were on the scoresheet and her long journey to that end until that moment, tears came to her face.
This success ranks her in the same league of singular athletes of his time as Michael Phelps, who have added a new dimension to their sport:
Biles has dominated her sport for the last three years, winning 15 medals at the world championships - including 10 golds. Her stunning line-ups are a mixture of ambition and precision, and the 1984 Olympic champion, Mary Lou Retton, called her "the best gymnast she's ever seen."
The final test awaited her in Brazil, not so much between Biles and the rest of the competitors, but between her alone and the burden of too much expectation.
Anything other than a return home to his family in Spring, Texas, with a hand full of gold medals, would be seen as a disappointment.
Simone Biles (USA), on the left, and Aly Raisman are embracing the golden and silver medal in the final of the women's multi-fight at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on Thursday.
Biles won the first one on Tuesday, when she was an exclamation point in celebration of outgoing national team coordinator Martha Karolyi.
Biles insists that she never looked forward to the top during her long journey to the top, which is not entirely true.
Part of her lineup in the floor - the one that contains a typical triple, double-turnover flip-flop - is set in Latin music that would have just come home, to the streets outside the Olympic arenas in Rio.
It's not a coincidence.
The girl was adopted by her grandparents as a toddler, and her talent was discovered by the mother of coach Aimee Boorman on her way to the gym, where Boorman was training and where she gained strength.
She has not lost the competition in the multi-event since the summer of 2013 - this is a succession of victories that can continue as long as Biles wants.
Even though Mustafin took over in the short lead through two swivels, it was just an illusion.
The Kladina and the floor - where Biles is defending the world championship - is waiting.
She went back to the lead with 15.433 points on the beam - and completed with 15.933 points in the floor.
Raisman hugged her gently as she waited for the final score - a mere formality - and Biles' tears appeared around the glittering red, white, and blue shadows when she had fulfilled the wish she had once written in her diary as a child.
Raisman's performance was a bit of a payback for the Olympics four years ago, when she shared a third-place finish with Mustafin, but then she eats bronze for the sum of the top three.
This time, the 22-year-old team captain the Americans call "grandmother" was way ahead.
After her floor, she sent the crowd airy kisses, conquered by a return that seemed unsteady at times.
For Biles, the post this 19-year-old athlete posted on Twitter this week, where he became a complete hit, has a whole new meaning:
Police: Three victims in serial killer case shot while listening to music in car
According to a police report released Thursday, two women and a girl, aged 12, died during the most underperpetrated attack of the decade, the first serial killer in Phoenix. They were shot while sitting in the car, talking and listening to music.
Authorities reported that Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefania R. Ellis and Ellis' daughter Maleah were shot 12 on 12 June in a car parked in the driveway.
The report states that the armed man was on the passenger's side and fired eight rounds from the handgun. He then fled in another vehicle.
According to police, the robbery is not worth the triple murder because the assailant did not take his wallets, nor the amount of $2,900 that one of the adult victims was carrying.
A spokesman for the Phoenix police, Sergeant Jonathan Howard said investigators were investigating whether the shooting was related to any of the previous four attacks.
In two mostly Hispanic neighbourhoods, there were a total of nine attacks in which seven people were killed and two others were injured in four months.
"It's happening in the residential area in front of the houses," Howard said earlier this month for a CBS-based KPHO branch.
Police believe the suspect used several cars, including a brown Nissan from the late 1990s, a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
Investigators declined to reveal what evidence led them to conclude that the attacks were related and were carried out by the same killer.
Ellis (33) was taken to the hospital, where she later succumbed to her injuries.
Linerová (31) and Ellis' daughter Maleah died at the scene.
A witness told the police that it was not uncommon for the women to sit in a parked car and listen to music.
Authorities also released a police report on the shooting, the target of which was an empty van just half an hour before the triple murder. Police believe it was the serial killer.
Investigators found the cartridges and from the remnants of bullets in the seat and from under the hoods of the engine, they put a bullet.
Mother of a six-year-old child with microcephaly: ‘His condition is improving’
Edmund Picciuto, like most of the children of his age, loves to sing, toys and, of course, his mother.
But unlike his peers, he suffers from microcephaly, which is the result of a genetic disorder that his mother, Elizabeth Picciut, was unaware of during her pregnancy.
When he first came home, it was the first time I thought I couldn't do this.
I can't do this.
I'm not ready for this.
Which is not true at all - of course you are ready for it,' she said.
She and her husband, Vincent, had learned that Edmund might never have known them, and that he might not have survived.
Some doctors even suggested that he be placed in an institution.
"My first reaction was that I thought people didn't do this anymore," Picciut explains.
Edmund comes with the help of a walker.
Until the age of three, he couldn't sit or crawl. And he still doesn't.
But it is already slowly filling some milestones.
He walks with help and rides a bike.
He also loves to play with his two brothers and loves to sing.
Elizabeth performs a sign language with which Edmund says "please, sing to me."
"We're teaching him a sign language," Picciut told CBS News.
But it's not a common sign language - he says that Edmund made up some of the characters himself.
Microcephalics can emerge from a number of different states: genetic, as is the case with Edmund, and in infections in pregnancy caused by viruses such as measles or Zika.
Symptoms and prognosis may differ in a substantial way.
It's too early to say the impact of the Zika virus on the lives of the infected.
Picciut recalls the emotional tax that takes away from an uncertain future.
I keep asking, "What's next?"
What's next?
And she's still not sure.
In fact, I never asked what the overall prognosis was, because I don't expect anyone to tell me.
But Picciut has an encouraging report for the mothers of all the children who suffer from birth defects caused by the Zika virus.
The situation is improving.
Know that it will be better.
You will love your child and your child will love you.
Heavy rains and floods required to be salvaged by salvage work in Louisiana, Mississippi
Heavy rain and widespread flooding in Louisiana prompted the governor to declare an emergency on Friday. More rains are expected in the state on Saturday.
The National Weather Service (NWS) reported that after extreme downpours, a number of rivers in southeastern Louisiana and southern Mississippi would pour out of their shores and threaten massive flooding.
Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards said civil servants were in constant contact with local authorities and assistance was already on their way to the affected areas.
Mike Steele, a spokesman for the Governor's Office for National Security and Emergency Standards for Emergency Situations said they were receiving vehicle requests for water, boats and sandbags.
Steele said that the Tangipahoa precinct alone asked for ten thousand sandbags.
Flood patrols will remain in most of southern Louisiana to work until Saturday.
The Meteorological Service said in a statement that about 8 to 13 more centimers may rain over the sea.
In southern Alabama, the flood patrol was on alert Friday as the rains continued in the Mobile area.
According to the forecast, the Comite rivers at Baton Rouge and Amite are expected to peak at Denham Springs this weekend.
Meteorologist Alek Krautmann said both said they could flood a number of houses in suburban areas of the Baton Rouge.
He further said that the danger was flooding downstream in the Ascension district, when these swollen flows would be sunk into Lake Maurepas only slowly.
The Tickfaw River, slightly further south of the Mississippi state of Liverpool, Louisiana, reached the highest levels recorded at the top levels at 9 a.m. local time on Friday morning.
Rescuers are still picking up people from the torrential waters of the city of Amite and Wilkinson in the southwest of the Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and stepson were previously among the Protected at Gloster on Friday.
Hansford (62) said that the water from Beaver Creek, which is normally more than 120 metres from his house, rose quickly overnight.
He said he was alerted by his other stepson, who lives nearby.
"We woke up and the water was coming," Hansford said.
It was up to the waist.
According to his wife, this is the highest level she has ever experienced on the stream in the last 48 years.
Hansford said that he and all the members of his family are disabled and he is the only one who can swim.
Hansford said that emergency workers had rescued all three of the military-style huge trucks and taken to the fire station in the Gloster, where they remained covered on Friday.
Krautmann said that as heavy rains continue, the flooding is "fast spread" and authorities were considering evacuation.
According to Krautmann, the observer near Livinstol announced that 35 centimetres of rainfall had fallen from midnight to Friday to morning.
Krautmann said the attic had been heavily soaked since Wednesday.
Authorities said heavy rain and paid trips required the rescue of residents from their homes in Tangipahoa district and the cancellation of instruction in five school districts.
The CBS branch of the WWL reported that 200 homes were inundated, according to the elder of Tangipahoa.
Residents have been evacuated to two churches, both of which are now inundated.
The mayor of the municipality, Robby Miller, said the authorities rescued 72 people and seven domestic animals that were imprisoned by the high water.
In the municipality of Amite and in the town of Hammond, shelters were set up for those who were evacuated.
"They'll be able to come home when the water starts to fall," he said.
In the Tangipahoa precinct in the city of Hammond, more than 20 streets were closed due to the flood, and local residents were given bags of sand to pick up and try to protect their homes and businesses from the water.
"The last major flooding was in March," said the city manager, Lacy Landrum.
These floods appear to be similar.
Rupert Lacy, the crisis crisis manager at Harrison, Mississippi, said that persistent rain was continuing on the Gulf coast.
He said a few houses were called flooding on Thursday, but none of them appeared in the report on Friday.
Keith Townson, head of the Shopper Value Foods in Amite, has lived in the area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in a few places I've never seen before," Townson said, "and it's still there."
Mahaj Brown (6) - 'boy shot up as siege', surviving shooting in Philadelphia
According to police, a 6-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia. This week, this is the second shooting at a child aged 6 in the city.
The child's grandparents identified him for CBS Philadelphia as Mahaj Brown.
Grandparents say the boy suffered several gunshot wounds, including the groin, leg, arm and abdomen, but he was conscious when transported to the hospital.
'He took a lot of it, his little body was shot through like a sizable one,' his grandmother, Delores Melendez, told the station.
I can't believe it.
The boy is in critical condition at the hospital and has undergone several operations.
The family told the station that the boy should recover.
He was to enter the first grade of primary school.
Mahaj Brown is among four people who were shot in the Germantown section.
Three other men were shot: two at the age of 29 and one at the age of 32.
One of the men, aged 29, is in critical condition, with two more victims in stable condition, according to CBS Philadelphia.
According to the station's reports, the child was found to have been shot in the front seat of the vehicle, along with a 29-year-old man in critical condition.
The other two victims were not in the car, and police are examining whether any of the injured men could be the shooter.
Investigators at CBS Philadelphia said there was likely to be a shootout between several armed men.
Casing was found at the scene from the offensive-type weapons belonging to various offensive weapons.
By all accounts, it was most certainly an ongoing battle.
There were shell casings on either side of the side of the sidewalk on the street.
So it appears that there were several armed combatants who were actively involved," Philadelphia Police Captain Anthony Ginaldi said.
Several houses and vehicles in the area were also affected.
No one has been detained and police are reportedly examining video footage from the CCTV.
Another six-year-old child, this one girl, was shot in the arm by a stray shot on Tuesday in front of a house in the West Oak Lane neighborhood.
The girl is recovering and police are still looking for a suspect.
Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
This is how I imagine the women's gymnastics team for this year's Olympic Games, for several reasons.
First, I've been to every Summer Olympics since 1984, and the U.S. has never been so dominant.
And second: There are three gymnasts in this team, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas, and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who have inspired so many young colorful girls.
Everyone is proud to make up this team, which is complemented by Aly Raisman, who is of Jewish origin, and the Catholic Madison Kocian.
We finally have a team that looks like America.
He also cemented the presence of black women and Latin American women at the top of the sport.
The number one Gymnashenka in the past four years has been an African-American woman.
Simone and Gabby were in first and second last year.
That means something.
At the last Olympics, Gabby Dougals surprisingly became Olympic champion, and America cheered.
Now the world could have witnessed the incredible performance of three-time world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, who had produced the unexpected but masterful gymnastics figures.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth American to win gold in the women's individual competition.
And team member Aly Raisman won silver.
We are witnessing a sporting highlight, but it doesn't look like it in gymnastics class in the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie made the same journey to the Olympic team as Aly and Madison.
They are the "final five" because the gymnasts' team for the next Olympic Games will only be made up of four athletes, and this is the last year of Marta Karolyi's training.
But the reality is that gymnastics is a costly sport, and gymnasts train mostly in private gymnastics clubs, which keep parents who pay the cost of training, equipment, travel, jerseys, competition fees, hotel accommodation (for their charges and their charges and families). And that's far from all.
Most of these sports clubs are in rich areas in the suburbs that can support activities.
In these clubs, the gymnasts have all the training sessions and for the families of gymnasts and gymnasts it is a costly and long-term commitment.
Aimee Boorman, coach of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, the trainer at Laurie Hernandez, both trained athletes at the time they began in gymnastics.
It is our duty to bring in gymnastics training, which are more accessible and accessible communities of countless young girls who were inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie.
I started the Gymnastics Foundation 20 years ago.
In my organizations, where we offer gymnastics for free or at low cost at Harlem for more than 15,000 young people within the city (especially of black and Hispanic origin) and we have trained national and international champions.
In September, we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) where we will provide quality gymnastics to young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Gymnastics develops the strength, flexibility and coordination of the body and hard work, discipline and determination of the mind.
This combination means lifetime benefits for good health, successes at school and at work.
It is the inspiration of this team that will be sent to us by thousands of young girls who will want to do gymnastics. And that's great.
Participation in this sport is very important, especially for girls.
It's a very exciting time.
Thank you, Simon, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison, for demonstrating "girlpower" and winning the Olympic team gold. And thank you for motivating so many young girls of all backgrounds to set off on a journey to becoming healthy, strong and successful young women.
After Jeremy Hunt's proposal is rejected, young doctors are ready to enter more strikes
Ministers hoped that after the reworked contract with representatives of the British Medical Association (BMA), disagreements over the changes would be terminated. But 58 percent of the 37,000 junior doctors who took part in the election rejected the contract.
Hunt in July revealed plans to force the contract, saying the NHS was in a "no-no-man's-land" and further delays would have a detrimental impact on staff and patients.
The first young doctors have already signed a new contract that involves changes to night and weekend working practices to improve care in non-social hours.
In a statement last night, doctore for the BMA, the doctor at the BMA's Young Physicians, said: "Young doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, particularly in the sense that there will be an increase in the current labor force crisis and thus a fair treatment for all doctors."
Only eight weeks before the first group of doctors reaches the new contract, it is necessary to make progress and time is running out.
The BMA's efforts to resolve disputes through negotiations have been met with a reluctance to involve dr and often deafening silence on the part of the government.
This is despite Jeremy Hunt's promise last month that the possibility is still open.
"Jeremy Hunt must now act, push for enforcement and resolve the concerns of the young doctors."
If this does not happen, then the young doctors are ready to take the next steps.
During the last strike at the end of April, nearly 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 visits were postponed as nurses and specialists were called to the centre of doctors who were among the protesters.
Ministers had hoped that after the reworked treaty with representatives of the British Medical Association (BMA), disagreements will be struck on the changes.
BMA wants higher payments for work on a weekend for 54,000 young doctors who would be the subject of a contract.
Daniel Mortimer, chairman of the NHS employers, called on young doctors not to take the strike.
Mortimer said: "Nothing or nothing is achieved with the eye action, but there will be pressure on already overloaded teams and services and there will be increased concerns, exhaustion and disruption for patients, nursing staff and their families."
Over the past two months, we have been in talks with the Young Physicians' Board of Directors and the Ministry of Health and the others to respond positively to them about the role of the supervisor and the informant.
Employers hoped that the continued positive involvement on other important issues - such as workload, flexibility in training, further training for those returning after a career break, training costs, mutual recognition of subjects, sabotage sabotage and gender pay gap - was a testimony of how seriously employers, the Health Education England and the Ministry of Health took the agreements reached with the BMA in November, February and May.
A cure for sixty crowns per day can reduce the risk of a heart attack
Thousands of patients at risk of heart attack will be able to take a drug that costs around sixty crowns (two pounds). The authorities recommend administering it to more patients for a longer period of time.
The drug to the precipitation of the blood Ticagrelor reduces the risk of a seizure occur again in people with heart disease.
The medicine is now being taken over a heart attack for 12 months to reduce the risk of stroke or other seizure.
NHS watchdog NICE recommends that the drug be administered to people for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
But now NHS watchdog NICE recommends that it be given to people for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
In England, about 140,000 people suffer a heart attack every year, and a quarter of them suffer another seizure or heart attack.
Heart attack and stroke are caused by the accumulation of fat, which creates a continuous layer on the walls of the arteria.
If this layer is discharged, a blood clot can be formed, a blockage of the blood's access to the heart and a heart attack can be blocked.
If the clot is released, the bloodstream can continue through the bloodstream, blocking the blood supply to the brain and cause a stroke.
People who have already had a heart attack are at a higher risk of another seizure.
Ticagrelor, manufactured by the British firm AstraZeneca, which is sold under the trade name Brilique, reduces the risk of the formation of coagus less likely.
The draft NICE Directive, published today, recommends that patients receive 90 mg of ticagrelor for 12 months and then 60 mg together with aspirin, twice a day for the next three years.
Professor Carole Longson, director of the NICE Health Technology Evaluation Center, said: "Despite the availability of effective secondary preventive treatment, there are a quarter of patients who have had a heart attack and who will have another heart attack or stroke - often with devastating consequences."
Fear of repetition can have a significant negative impact on the patient's quality of life.
It is proven that Ticagrelor, in combination with aspirin, is effective in reducing the risk of other heart attacks and strokes in people who have already suffered a heart attack.
We are delighted to expand the preconditions for Ticagrelor's preliminary recommendation of the treatment that are available to many thousands of people who will benefit from it.
As information on the efficacy and safety of Ticagrelor - especially about the risk of bleeding - beyond three years, is not recommended in the proposal for treatment above this time.
With computer culture, fraud in Muslim areas began to flourish
Tower mayor Lutfur Rahman of Tower of Towerflight was removed from office last year for corruption, which was linked to a government report
The culture of political correctness has led to the disregard for the spread of fraud in Muslim communities, a government report says today.
Ex-minister Sir Eric Pickles sharply criticizes the police, election inspectors and town halls for ignoring voter abuse for "excitation to ethnicity and religion."
The former secretary of the community, now the ruler of the anti-corruption crackdown, said that intimidating voters on the basis of their religion was so bad that the police should make cordons and protect the frightened voters outside the polling stations.
He recommended that voters take their identity document with them and be able to prove who they are at the polls.
At present, voters need only give their name and address.
The report also proposes to apply indelible ink to the fingers of the people when casting their voice to the voice to avoid being voted twice.
Whistleblowers should have more protection, Pickles says.
It calls for the press to be given greater access to the meeting documents and to decisions taken by the unofficial committees or group workmanship.
"This is not only about protecting against electoral fraud, but also about protecting the local government from the wider corrupt environment and the financial fraud that goes hand in hand with it," he said.
The report was requested by Downing Street as a result of the election scandal at the Tower Hamlets in West London.
Last year, a special electoral court ruled that the incumbent mayor of the city, Lutfur Rahman, should be removed from his post after being charged with corruption and illegal practices.
The court found that Rahman had "cynically intervened" with the religious sensibilities of his Muslim community and silencing his critics with accusations of racism and Islamophobia.
Rahman, he says, "has led his campaign to be a religious duty of loyal Muslims, to vote for him."
Up to 300 votes were questioned or as a result of identity theft, when a person votes and sets out to her from someone else.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud throughout the country.
He expressed particular concern about the fraud of the correspondence vote - which is claimed to have been put under pressure by the elderly members of the Muslim community to vote for the candidate they had elected.
Sir Eric, in the picture, made several recommendations on how to clean up the electoral system, including the presentation of an identity document
Its report states: "There has been evidence to be provided that vulnerable members of certain ethnic minorities, in particular women and young people, were pressured to vote at the will of the elders, in particular in communities from Pakistan and Bangladesh."
"There were fears that . . . state institutions had turned their eyes at such behavior because of the "politically correct" hypersensitivity to ethnic origin and religion."
Sir Eric made 50 recommendations on how to clean up the system, including for political activists to be banned from manipulating the correspondence votes to prevent "enforcement of votes."
The report, now being assessed by Theresa May, also asks for more thorough checks on registrations to prevent the use of the electoral lists for immigration fraud and benefit fraud.
Consider the possibility of asking voters to provide an identity document before the vote.
Using indelible ink on the fingers of people in voting to prevent someone from voting twice.
Implementation of systematic checks of the nationalities of the nationalities to ensure that they are allowed to vote.
Restricting applications for automatic correspondence voting to a period of three years.
Forbiting political agitators and activists to manipulate the correspondence votes cast and the ballot envelopes.
Give the police the authority to create cordons around the polling stations.
Change the laws to make it easier to prosecute those who exert illicit coercion under the 1983 Reform Act.
Ban the taking of photographs at the polling stations.
To require that only the English work at the polling stations (except for Wales).
Strengthen training and ensure that workers observe the rule that voters go to the ballot box office individually.
Sir Eric criticizes the London police and says it is "surprising" that no criminal charges have been brought after the Tower Hamlets case.
"The Electoral Court ruled out Lutfur Rahman and his agent for the litany of corruption and illegal practices," he said.
For a number of reasons, he was found guilty beyond reasonable doubt - in the force of proof of the crime.
He also criticises the fruitless "check of the check box" in the council's registration departments.
Sir Eric said, "Last year's court decision in the Tower Hamlets case waking up.
Our nation has the proud legacy of the cradle of parliamentary democracy, but the worrying and covert spread of electoral fraud and the state of rejection by some are threatening this reputation.
The fading with the cycling doppelganger of Duchess Kate and other doppelgangers of well-known personalities at the Rio Olympics
Fans of the 2016 Rio Olympic Games went crazy this week for French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, who is strikingly similar to the Duchess of Cambridge.
But the 24-year-old Olympian is far from the only athlete aiming to win gold this year to boast her own double from a ranks of well-known personalities - at least not according to social networks.
To celebrate the Olympic Games in Rio and all the well-known personalities currently appearing on our screens, the FEMAIL women's column has compiled a list of Olympians who are more than remotely like Hollywood celebrities.
As hunted game: U.Schroman men's team member Brady Ellison (left) has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since
Next to the Kate doppel on the cycling track, a number of people online quickly pointed out that a certain archer could be the twin of star Leonardo DiCaprio.
The competitor from the American archer team, Brady Ellison, caused a thunderstorm on Twitter after his pictures surfaced, with a striking resemblance to the Wall Street wolf.
Braddy himself had noticed the media frenzy and admitted to hearing about his similarities with Leo since he was a little boy.
"He doesn't see much of a similarity myself, except perhaps the beard," Brady told the Huffington Post.
"He's cool and he's looking good, so I think it's a compliment."
One of the most popular London 2012 comparisons will no doubt be highlighted even more this year: a striking appearance between the British long jumper Greg Rutherford and the popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
Russian gymnast Aliy Mustafin was said to be a copy of Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And when we look at the swimming pool, South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared to the star of the series, Gell Matthew Morrison, for several years.
And for a change: The user thinks that Nathan with an "atletic version" of the actor from Origin (Inception)
Another long-standing comparison is the comparison of tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, who have similarly thick eyebrows and lips.
Russian silver swimmer Yulia Efimova boasts not only the same dark bandwidth and blonde hair as Annalynne McCord. And of Nathan Adrian of Team USA, fans say he looks like the "athlete version of Joseph Gordon Levitt."
Fitting women: Football star Hope Sol (left) and actress of the series Dexter Jennifer Carpenter (right) have a similar face-shaped shape and eyes
Not just one: Twitter's user was very pleased that the similarities were noticed by others
On the wave of theory: According to this user, there may be a reason behind similar pairs' appearance
A Twitter user recently expressed her satisfaction on the site that "the rest of the Internet thinks Hope and Jennifer Carpenter are true of the truth."
Soccer star Hope Sol and the show's actress, Dexter Jennifer Carpenter, have an incredibly similar shape to face and eyes.
Among the other popular comparisons are Kerri Walsh-Jennings and her smile, which is almost identical to the smile of actress Laura Linney, or the gold medalist for gymnastics champion Gabby Douglas, boasting her wonderfully wide smile, who seemed to follow the smile of Gabrielle Union, the star of Bravo Girls,!
CBC Olympic Games commentator apologizes for saying of the Chinese swimmer that she "bumped out"
Viewers of Wednesday's live broadcast of the Olympic Games on the CBC were outraged by an analysis of the performance of 14-year-old Ai Yanhan by commentator Byron MacDonald. The swimmer finished in fourth place in the women's 4x200m free-to-air relay
The Canadian CBC station was forced to apologize after one of its commentators said the 14-year-old Chinese swimmer had "taken like a stink" during the race and "bumped out."
Commentator Byron MacDonald thought his microphone was off when he began to churp out his own opinions at the end of the final of the women's 4x200 metres freestyle.
MacDonald, who was supposed to bring a "lift" to the CBC commentator's team, said, among other things, "The little 14-year-old from China gave up on it, you fool."
Too much excitement, it stretched like a stink, exploded.
Thanks.
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan (14) swam the second relay of the race at 1:57.79 - 1.61 seconds slower than Canada's Taylor Ruck, to allow the Canadians to drag China's.
Viewers in Canada quickly began to speak online and were appalled by the tone and language the commentator used
Emmett Macfarlane wrote on Twitter: "Walked the CBC announcer that a 14-year-old swimmer from China "bumped out"?????"
The idiot didn't notice he was still on the air.'
Ai Yanhan of China in the final of the women's 4x200-meter freestyle relay was described as: "The little 14-year-old from China gave up, you fool."
Byron MacDonald's criticism on Twitter came from all sides and many demanded his appeal
When Twitter users learned how insensitive Byron MacDonald he was, they didn't hold back
Another user, Sarah Paradis, wrote: 'Wow #ByronMacDonald.
You represent the CBC and Canada, and it sounds like we'd be a bunch of racists.
Soon after, Scott Russel, who hosted the CBC broadcast, apologized for MacDonald's lively comment, saying, "We apologize for the comment on the swimmer's performance that had leaked on the air."
It was an unfortunate choice of words, we're sorry to see that happen."
CBC finally apologized to people who tweeted in response to the comment
Associate Agent Scott Russel had to apologize on behalf of MacDonaldo
The CBC then copied and placed their apology in response to more than 90 Twitter users who complained to the MacDonald's comments
The station also quickly apologized and made a statement.
He sincerely regrets the fact that the words were spoken, she should not have made it to the air.
We quickly apologized to our viewers on the air and those who watch us on social networks.
To be clear, Byron's comments were about the performance of the swimmer, not the swimmer herself.
In other words, this was an inappropriate and unfortunate choice of words. Byron is deeply apologetic for what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, Byron MacDonald apologized on live television and attempted to explain his remark by claiming that he did not want to sound like a personal attack.
"I would like to apologize now for the comment I made last night after the women's relay," he said on the CBC Olympics broadcast.
"I was referring to the performance of a swimmer and not the person of the swimmer as such."
"There's no need to say that I had no intention of disrespect, and I'm very sorry."
Customers in Primark scandalized by a woman who was shamelessly trying to dress up underwear in the middle of the store
When the woman took off her clothes to try out her panties on the sales floor in the middle of Primark, the shoppers were not sure which way to look.
To make it even worse, she tried to see her size fit, to take off her panties, and put them back on the shelf.
She continued to browse, and finally tried four pairs of panties at the Bouverie Place shopping centre in Flokestone.
Primark store at the Bouverie Place shopping centre in Folkestone, where the woman tried on her panties before returning them to the shelf
The mother-of-two, Jenny Davidson, who was in the store at the time, said the mysterious woman, after trying her underwear, "dressed over and out of the store without buying anything."
She said, "People couldn't believe their eyes."
She stood in the middle of the store, took her panties off the shelf, took off her own tights and panties, and put them on.
"She didn't even try to find a discreet place - she was just standing there, rude as a monkey."
"Everyone just stared at her panties taking her panties off again, and evidently they didn't like them because she put them back on the shelf."
She did the same with three others before she finally decided she didn't like anything, got dressed again and left.
"She didn't seem to mind who was watching-or think of the man who might be buying the panties she was trying to."
Miss Davidson (33), who lives in Kent, said, "The idea of someone taking home the panties that someone else was wearing and not being cleaned. That's gross.'
The incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon.
Miss Davidson added, "When she left, I gathered up things that she was clearly trying to get them off sale - what's the only right one, too."
"I'd be impressed by the idea of bringing new panties home and finding out that they were worn by another woman, who took them off, and they weren't washed."
A spokesman for the trade, Primark, said, "The car knows about the incident that occurred at our store at Folkestone on Tuesday, August 9."
All of the products in question were withdrawn from sale.
How to defend against a gun attack with Krav Maga
The world out there is dangerous, but this Dailymail.com video could make it a little safer for you.
We spoke with Rhone Mizrachi, the grand master of the Krav Magy Federation, based in New York, to see how to cope with armed robbers at a close range of distances.
This video will show you how to suddenly gain the upper hand over the rapist, whether he comes nearing the front or the back.
If they come near the back of you, Mizrachi says, then the first thing you have to do is turn around to see your attacker and "had the free path of the missile."
You will then seize the weapon between your forearm and shoulder just before you hit it in the face with a free elbow.
Then the knee follows the gards into the groin, and as the attacker writhes in pain, you wriggle the weapon out of his hand, punch him in the main face and begin to retreat, keeping the gun pointed at him.
If an armed man is approaching from the front, it's a similar technique - get your body out of the firing line, grab the gun and rouse it so the villain can't shoot.
At the same time, put the force in the gun and strike the attacker in the chest, then roch the weapon from his grasp and start retreating, still aiming at him.
Does that sound complicated?
Watch the video, where you'll see exactly how Mizrachi does it.
But remember, the safest way to get out of the ambush - unless you're the grand master Krav Maga - is to hand over all the cash.
Traveller Ian Wright olises the dirtiest places in Europe to the travel guide
The British traveller decided to give a heavy test to his immune system and a haystick reflex - licking the dirtiest and most disgusting places in Europe.
Moderator and travel writer Ian Wright (51), originally from Suffolk, dressed in a euro bill with his tongue, as a token of the power of his immune system, the railing at Piccadilly Circus, the flushing button on the toilet on the train, and the Russian public phone.
Before wearing each object, he used a luminometer to show himself and to all of us what he was getting into.
The experiment, on the basis of which Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength was made, however, yielded interesting results.
The idea to lick the flusher button on the train used by thousands of other people may seem absolutely repulsive, however, for example, there is actually much more harmful bacteria in the kitchen sink.
Throughout his trip around Europe, Ian Wright has spoken to health care doctors and specialists about boosting intestinal flora bacteria and his own health.
Fortunately, none of the licked left him any worse than a taste in his mouth.
Ian Wright is famous for testing the resistance of his intestines on the road around the world and eating strange and amazing things.
During this mission, he tested his immune system quite safely - from the public railings at the train stations to the flush
In the film he shot about it, he says, "I haven't cared much for my health since I was a kid, and I've been putting everything from clay to eating worms and muddy water."
In the film, he certainly confirmed his reputation.
The only thing he refused were the dirty public toilets in Russia.
After a simple luminometer swab, the luminometer showed a value of more than 4000 units.
For comparison, freshly washed hands should have less than 60.
But one public toilet in Russia refused to lick it after his luminometer showed more than 4000 units, while freshly washed hands have less than 60
Ian Wright and Finnish dairy manufacturer Valio made a traveler's film called The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, which shows the numbers of bacteria in various places, such as in the bathroom
In the film, he said, "This is almost the ugliest I've ever felt in the bathroom."
Nothing dirtier than this doesn't exist!
I'm not licking anything because it's disgusting.
The film Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength was shot in collaboration with Finnish dairy manufacturer Valio.
The company provided Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains lactic acid and vitamins C and D, which help to strengthen the gut bacteria and the immune system in humans.
Niko Vuorenmaa, senior vice president of Valio for refreshments, juices and new categories, said: "We wanted to offer consumers something really new.
Something to watch the fascination and, at the same time, allow us to explain the benefits of probiotics.
We've devised a lot of crazy ideas that ended with the idea of "let's call Ian."
They say that interest in bowel health is becoming a global phenomenon.
Instead of just talking about the products, we wanted to put them in a broader context - good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of bowel health and how it is linked to the immune system.
The growing interest in healthy gut is a global phenomenon and through this paper we have brought more detailed information to consumers in an interesting way.
I also think there is a great sense of humour in the film!
Tom Hakala, who directed the film, adds, "Let's put it this way, Ian would lose my respect if he licked up some of what I wanted him to do - like that disgusting Russian toilet that appears in the film."
Licking some things was naturally easier for Ian, others pretty hard.
I'm glad we filmed the lick of some of the dirty stuff."
Valio conducted a survey in 2015, according to which 84 percent of respondents associated with lactic acid bacteria primarily with stomach and gut health, and 58 percent of respondents said they at least occasionally use products containing added bacteria of lactic acid.
A family of socially needy manshed a municipal building in the town of Saltash in Cornwall before the eviction
The family of the socially needy left £50,000 worth of damage to their municipal house after being accused of terrorizing their neighbours.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were evicted from a house in Saltash, Cornwall, after a long series of complaints against them.
After their forcible evictions from the house, housing co-op officials were shocked to discover that the property was in a state of disrepair.
There were holes in the walls, the floor covering was torn, garbage was litched on the floor, and the walls were scrawled.
The family has already moved out and is considered to be living in private accommodation
Donna McEvoy, director of housing at Cornwall Housing, said she was worried about whether the house could be rescued.
She said, "It was a nightmare for the people here, and I don't think people should live like this.
A number of circumstances need to be considered, because this property will probably come into the consciousness of "not such a nice part" of Cornwall.
The family is notorious, and their names are notorious.
The couple has three sons who sometimes stayed in the house, and police said that the family's terror-hitting was a street fight using baseball bats, intimidating surrounding residents, drug use of drugs, and loud shouting, quarrels and curses.
Skeldon (47), whose name was on the lease, was given a penalty in June for anti-social behaviour.
In several rooms in the house, which may be demolished, smelly garbage were found.
The house from which the drugs were distributed in the past were torn out by the floor coverings
Neighbors say they've been seen fighting in the street, and people have called the police regularly
Cornwall Housing forced her and her partner out of the house this week after receiving an additional period of 11 weeks to move out voluntarily.
Neighbors who were relieved welcomed the eviction, saying that their lives were a living hell.
One of them said, "They didn't care about anyone at all."
We lived next to them for 20 years and it's always been like this.
How many times we've seen the police here, you can't count at all.
"We couldn't sleep this morning."
We got up because it was incredibly quiet here - we're not used to that!
It'll be nice here when they're finally gone.
Adam Fitzpatrick, the Neighbourhood Neighborhood Manager, Adam Fitzpatrick said the family had failed to work with local authorities.
The family lived in the house for 20 years, the police were regularly called to the house
Garbage and old toys were lying in the overgrown part of the municipal house
He adds: "It is a shame that the tenant failed to take responsibility for her own behaviour and for the behaviour of her family. The eviction is always the last step that Cornwall Housing is considering.
This was a very complex case because their behavior was extreme and their actions, according to the witness, had to be terrifying her neighbors.
I appreciate all the work done by my team, the Devon and Cornwall police, and the members of the local community who bravely informed us.
I hope that this move will bring a little comfort to the neighbours, and at the same time carry with it the message that we will not tolerate unsocial behaviour.
Fitzpatrick said that all three of the tenants' son who lived in the house at different times was about 20 years old.
A polluted mattress left on the floor of one of the bedrooms in the house after the eviction
Workers will now have to remove the piles of garbage left around the house
In 2014, the shelf in the house raided the house and found over 70 grams of cannabis, weights, equipment and £1,700 in cash.
Skeldon was fined when she was found guilty of possession of Class B drugs that she wanted to sell.
She claimed that the money was intended for the foundations of the house for her son, Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
Tanya and her partner are now believed to be living in private accommodation in Plymouth after the eviction.
The walls in many of the rooms of the house were painted with graffiti.
Police say they will seek to evict tenants who break the rules of their lease agreements
Angela Crow of the Den and Cornwall Police Department said the eviction was a clear send of a clear message to other tenants who would continue to break the rules.
"This is a message to all those who think they can behave with impunity and those who would like to follow such behavior," she said.
The police of Den and Cornwall will never tolerate criminal and unsociable behaviour and will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal terrified after low-level military jet over the beach
Tourists enjoying the sun's rays in Aveil, Portugal, were terrified to death
Portuguese Air Force P-3C aircraft flew over the air force to an incredibly low
The Air Force said it was a training flight and insisted that there was no threat to the safety of the safety
By the time the low-flying jet had descended on the crowded beach, the frightened tourists were seized by panic.
The dramatic footage shows the military aircraft getting a distance of almost a touch from the sunshine people on a sandy beach near the town of Aveiro in northern Portugal.
Tourists began to rise after being disturbed by the noise of the jet's engines without seeing what would emerge from the clouds.
The incident occurred yesterday afternoon on Costa Nova near the town of Aveiro.
Daniel Fernandes, one of several holidaymakers who posted video recordings of a dramatic flyover on social networks, said, "The plane flew twice really low and at one point it seemed to crash."
Nuno Arroja adds, "I surfed, and I really thought the plane would fall on my head."
Tourists on a beach in Aveil were horrified when a plane flying low-hitting a plane came out of the darkness
The Portuguese Air Force today said that the P-3C Orion pilot was on a training flight to identify the fishing boat off the coast and had to bear low because it was the only way to check the ship.
The aircraft was reportedly flying a little lower than usual due to poor visibility caused by smoke from the nearby forest fires. However, the Air Force insists that the safety of the people has not been compromised.
Forest fires destroyed part of mainland Portugal this summer, killing four of the lives on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese Air Force today declared that the pilot had to fly low because of the thick fog and smoke from the fires that prevented him from seeing him
The aircraft was on a training flight and the pilot was asked to identify the fishing boat as part of his training.
Half of the funeral services are not complying with the regulations.
Half of funeral service providers do not comply with the legislation.
The Czech Trade Inspection Authority (ČOI) found this during inspections in the second quarter.
Funeral services are most likely to not inform survivors of their prices or issue a written acknowledgement of the order to take over.
The CHOI imposed 41 fines for a total value of CZK 73,000.
This was reported today by its spokesman, Jiří Fröhlich.
Inspectors found errors in 47 of the 95 inspections.
In addition to not informing prices and missing certifications, some funeral services also sold products or provided services at prices other than those agreed.
In five cases, the products sold were not properly labelled and once the seller used an officially unverified gauge.
The inspection therefore prohibited the sale of 23 products for a total of CZK 7077.
It involved urn wrappers, candle covers and vases that were not properly marked with the required information.
"Given that the law is still in violation of the law in this specific area of services, the auditing action will continue in the next quarter of this year," Fröhlich added.
London schoolgirl who joined IS killed in Syria
It has been reported that Kadiz Sultana, one of three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join IS, has died in Syria.
Tasnime Akunjee's attorney said the family learned of her death in Raqqa, Syria, a few weeks ago.
ITV News reported on Thursday that it was likely to be killed during a Russian air attack in Raqqa, a stronghold of the country's group.
The sultana was 17 years old and, according to her family, she died just as she was preparing to flee the war-torn country and to return to Britain.
"It is to be believed that the only good thing about the whole thing - as a message and a warning to others that these are the real dangers of going to the war zone - is that it discourages people from ever making a decision," Akunjee said.
Sultana and two other schoolgirls from the east of London boarded a flight to Turkey in February 2015 and then a bus to the border with Syria.
The Sultana family learned that she had married an IS fighter in Syria - and was widowed within a few months.
Reid says that if Clinton is elected, she will keep Garland as a Supreme Court candidate.
Senate leader for the Democratic Democratic Party, Harry Reid, says he believes the Democratic presidential candidate, Hillary Clinton, will nominate Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court in the event of her election.
Republicans in the Senate blocked Garland's appointment, although President Barack Obama nominated him as early as March.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnel says the person to replace the late Supreme Court judge will be elected by a future president.
Reid said during a conference call on Thursday that he believes Clinton would select Garland "with a degree of credibility."
Reid's spokeswoman later said that he did not speak directly to Clinton about whether she would nominate Garland and that he was merely speculating.
He praised Garland and said that Clinton's team would not want to "swhip the ship to go "swoln" by choosing someone else.
Garland is the president of the federal appeals court in Washington.
Reid said the republicans that block Garland's appointment were "sanders" and "cup-court" Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump.
He said Trump didn't fit in with the job.
According to Treats magazine, nude calendars are for "women and for men"
Treats is working closely with photographer David Bell on the 2017 calendar, inspired by the 1970s Pirelli calendar.
But instead of revealing well-known figures, he tries to find the next generation of top models for his 2017 NU Muses calendar.
Treats president Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his magazine full of nakedness was different from the old-school Playboy because "Playboy is for men."
I do it for the women.
He clearly believes the calendar is as well.
"We have to go back to depicting timeless and classical nudity, with both women and men feeling comfortable and being inspired by photographs of the female body," Shaw said in a press release for the calendar.
Women want to be part of this project because it's a wonderful piece of art.
Models can send their images online or in person during open auditions in Los Angeles and New York.
Where is the vinyl going: who really buys the gramophone records?
Vinyl is loved by lone middle-aged men.
Before you decide to overwhelm the section with peprn notes under the pseudonym Not allaller The YoshiIn the Director of the Observatory, we note that this statement is based on actual data.
According to YouGov, the much-discussed resurrection of the gramophone records is associated with the boom of millennials who want to enjoy the originality of the physical subject but with the nostalgia of the middle age.
Those who have recently bought a vinyl album are most likely to be people between the ages of 45 and 54.
Young people aged 18-24 are the least likely.
It's not really about the accumulation of an enthusiastic fan either - the whole thing has an emotional dimension: older people who buy gramophone records are more likely to want to retain their feelings (56% versus 53%) and are happy to be themselves (69% versus 66%).
But are YouGov's results true?
If this blog were broadcast as a TV report, I would be watched by a camera setting out on a busy Soho street, dressed in a decent gray suit, and gesturing widely. Then I'd stop by, take out my arms and say something authoritative, like, "Let's take a look at it."
Let's take a look at it.
As Soho's heart is slowly fading from the heart of his charm and charm - the buildings once occupied by independent vendors, hotels, restaurants, and cafeterias, ready-to-face, and office supplies - a few of the fantastic specialist gramophone board stores are still left.
I'd probably ask the camera to stop filming for a while. I will stand close to the various men in these shops and try to see what their age and emotional mood is.
Stuart (55), a native of Glasgow who I follow from Sister Ray (tubs: two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (twelling: eight middle-aged men, one woman around 20) has a meeting in London in the afternoon and looks at the shops to fill out a few hours of time.
I ask him if he is a collector.
"I think so," he says.
I have about three or four thousand recordings.
All the recordings line the walls of his living room - in the picture on top (he e-mailed the photo to me, I didn't follow him home).
He also has this huge number of albums and singles because he can afford it: he can now buy record labels he couldn't afford when they were coming out originally, and he's buying again what he sold in his youth and didn't even have a peninsuble.
"A lot of what I buy is from the late '60s and early '70s. These are things that would be published when I was 11 or 12. I was too small then and I couldn't get it," he says.
He agrees that those who buy the recordings are probably introverts who like the company of themselves. He adds, "I don't smoke or drink much.
This is my sin.
Wez (25) works at Sister Ray and also thinks that many of the customers he meets in the YouGov profile.
He also noted a new influx of people affected by the media wave. People who had heard of the comeback and felt forced to buy their old recorders back.
According to my interviews, people got rid of their collections most often between 1998 and 1999.
Customers who once sold their record labels and bought CDs are now selling their CDs to buy their record labels back," he says.
This could explain the boom in gramophone lovers of a certain age.
But what about the alleged emotional importance of the gramophone records?
It takes you no more than a few seconds to find out in a shop like Phonica that in the music shops you will find a pleasant community of people with similar sentiments.
According to Wez, some older customers are particularly scandalized by the contactless payment system.
Some fans of the gramophone records may feel overwhelmed in the digital world and have opted for the familiar setting of the record labels, things that evoke memories of peaceful adolescence.
"I think that filling in a gap or owning something material can bring some comfort," Wez says.
I'm a collector myself, I do, and I think a lot of people do, too.
It's an easy way to fill a spot in your head.
"We're all like their social workers!" the coworker says from a pile of record-breakers.
A survey by ICM in April revealed that nearly 50% of people who bought a vinyl album a month earlier had not yet listened to it.
According to the survey, 41% of those surveyed have a record player who never uses, while 7% of those who buy gramophone records do not have a record player.
At this point of the story, he was probably very concerned about walking through the pile of compilations bossa nova.
The "troofha" and the resurgence of interest is something that Jonny (42) noted, who works in Sounds of the Universe (number: three middle-aged men).
"Someone came in recently and said, "I don't have a record player yet, but I want to buy it on the Radiohead board so we can display it on the shelf,"" he says.
The percentage of these is not great, but it is.
It's more about the product side than the music.
We have people coming in who say, "I don't have a gramofon."
These are the younger people, not the older, the grown-up teenagers who are getting into it.
Fopp, where almost a full floor is currently reserved for gramophone records, has much more diverse visitors when I arrive.
There are pairs of 70-year-olds, tourists who take pictures, teenagers and middle-aged women.
While the atmosphere is not as relaxed as the shops used to be - the latest Wild Beasts pop is heard from the speakers instead of the pull-out jazz, it is good to see various customers.
None of them look particularly alone, but it's hard to gauge mental trauma to be around when you're standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora (27) walks in Fopp for a few minutes and looks at the various gramophone records at the discount.
She is one of those who looks at the windows rather than spend feverishly.
He says he doesn't make much money, so it's out of the question that she collects gramophone records.
It costs a lot of money.
It's easy to listen to music on a computer or something. But the gramophone records have their charms . . ."
I can't explain it - it's unique.
My last stop is a store that supposedly inspired a new generation of gramophone lovers: Urban Outfitters.
I pretend to be very interested in the calves of the girls in the tight jeans and watch a group of teenage girls who are currently congregating around Polaroid cameras. Then the father and daughter decide to buy the gramophone Crosley.
To the left is a staircase whose wall is covered by the record labels Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary and classical music, the basis of any average collection of phonograph records.
No one's looking at them - perhaps because they're just for decoration, and some are so high on the wall that they can't be reached.
It's a purely "vinyl trick."
But because any attraction to it could mean more money for the industry and send a few customers to the depths of Soho for more, there's not much to complain about.
It is no surprise that the demographic area, where there is more time and money is more likely than in other areas, is also the one where it is most spent on the most luxurious goods that vinyl is sure to be.
But while I find that YouGov's results appear to be accurate - at least in the gramophone board stores, they do not take into account a large number of collectors and vinyl lovers who actually exist, in the gramophone board stores and online forums.
These people probably work hard in schools or offices.
He's certainly not spending a quarter of a mornings wandering around the gramophone board stores on Berwick Street, going through the recordings, and avoiding looking at a strange, 30-year-old fake TV presenter hiding behind the backs of unsuspecting middle-aged men.
Greenlandic shark is the longest living vertebrate - a video reportage
According to scientists, the Greenlandic shark has the longest life expectancy of any vertebrate on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, who studies sharks, says the recording shows the female, whose age is estimated to be between 272 and 512 and measuring five metres
Court in France refuses to demolish shops in Jungle refugee camp
A court in France has rejected the order of the authorities in Calais to demolish dozens of makeshift shops and restaurants in the Jungle camp where thousands of refugees live.
During a court hearing this week, authorities in Calais argued that the state should be able to cancel a total of 72 makeshift shops where people sell goods inside the camp, from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer hair-cutting, selling tea for 50 cents in makeshift restaurants or basic dishes for several euros.
The prefect's office in Calais argued that the sites needed to be demolished because they pose a parallel economy that does not pay taxes, and because they pose a risk of fire and health risks.
Humanitarian organizations told the court that shops and restaurants were vital and that free meals offered by state-sponsored associations and other groups did not provide a food supplement for the growing numbers of refugees in the camp.
The disputed makeshift shops and restaurants often provide shelter and free food to those in need.
The court in Lille ruled that there was no legal basis to prevent people from operating 72 makeshift shops, but stated that Prefect Calais's objections were ‘completely understandable’.
Judge Jean-François Molla said grocery stores, cafes and restaurants have a much bigger role to play in the food than simply feeding food to people who "live in extremely desperate conditions."
He said the premises provided peaceful places to meet refugees and volunteers.
One of the sites facing demolition was a café in the camp, Jungle Book Kids, run by a nonprofit organisation that offers 200 meals, English and French lessons a day, and asylum counseling for hundreds of endangered unaccompanied minors in the camp.
A petition to protect the "child" cafe was signed by more than 170,000 people.
The Guardian received a letter saying that the closure of the café would "be a disaster for these children, some of them being only 8 years old."
The charities Help Refugess and L'Auberge des Migrants estimated on Friday that the camp's numbers rose to more than 9,000 after a steep increase in arrivals during the summer - the highest ever so far.
He thought he was dead.
Ulch is editing himself and the volleyball Mouth.
"I could train normally from March," he said at the start of the summer training in full force.
What was wrong with you?
I had a bilateral pulmonary embolism, then my heart problems.
Because when I was at the Universiade in Korea, I didn't know I had any blood problems.
So the trouble was caused by a long flight to Asia?
I had a clot in my calf for two years, and I didn't know it.
I was hurt, no one found me anything.
Then the clot went up.
There's a damaged vein in the calf, it's going to hurt all the time, especially when the weather is working or changing.
But nothing that would limit me, more of an aesthetic thing.
Were you concerned for your life?
He did.
Last year at the summer tournament in Dřevěnice, I didn't know I had an embolism, and I couldn't move there at all.
I threw up blood in the evening.
The doctors told me it was a different story, I was finished for five days.
I really thought I was dead in Dřevěnice, and my girlfriend and family.
I've seen myself somewhere else.
How did you deal with that?
I guess I had to go through it, now it's just going to go up.
I know I have some blood problems, that I have to watch myself more when I go somewhere.
But you can do everything with it.
Only when I wanted to return to the preparation of Příbram last year, there were still problems with my heart.
It's all good now.
Since March, I have been fitness-prepared myself at home to be able to play again.
I'll knock it, physically, I'm better at it than before.
What do you expect from Ústí?
I'm excited, the gang looks good, I know most of the guys.
I'm curious about the other two strangers coming.
Perhaps we'll sit down humanely to make it fit.
Will you lift the Ústí?
It had a reputation for being a toupee, but every season is different.
Brno was eighth two years ago, now it came second.
There's a new team in Ústí, with only a few players left.
It was the last one in the extreme, so there's plenty of room to improve.
How we use it is up to us.
We'll see who's toupee after the first rounds, we'll hopefully not.
Is Coach Brom a guarantee of success?
He's already experienced and has been through a lot, he'll be thinking of better than last place.
But my coming was unrelated to him, I made a deal earlier.
There were other coaches in the game, I'm a big friend with one of them and it was agreed that he would operate here.
I'm not calling a name.
Finally, Mr. Brom came and I'm glad.
He's got a big name, he's been in good clubs, he's been training for a lot of decades, he's a former good player.
He'll move us up.
What will you bring?
This team is going to fight, which is my position.
I like to fight, I like to heckle and I like to get opportunities in a not-so-strike team.
I was in Pribram for two years, but Ústí is a bigger challenge than being in the sixth team because it starts from the bottom.
You mentioned foreigners, in Ústí is already coached by Australian Boehm.
What's he like?
I happen to know him, we played against each other in a group at the Universiade.
And we had a few conversations there, sometimes we sat together in the evening after the games, so we already know each other in a friend.
We beat them 3-1, I put it right on him at the start of the summer training in Ústí.
He has a Slovak girlfriend, he's a charmer.
The American Nadazdin and the Brazilian Ze will arrive.
Do you know anything about them?
I wrote to the American, he looks like a nice boy, the Brazilian who knows how to speak English.
You contacted the American?
It seemed like a good idea.
I'm a recording artist, I mean, whoever creates, so I should communicate with everyone.
I immediately found out what kind of player he was, I found him playing on the internet, seeing some videos.
He seemed pretty cool, the kid jumps, he's tall.
We wrote some messages on Facebook, he seemed like a joker, he'll fit in with us.
How do you look forward to the number one recording number one position?
I didn't want to take anything else.
I'm going to be twenty-four, after all, and I don't have the temperament to take turns.
I'd rather be at the center of the action, I'd rather run the team than be led by someone else.
I guess I wouldn't want to play anymore if I had to be like a second recorder and devote myself to it at full time. When something's not done to the fullest, it sucks.
How many times have you been number one?
A half-year in Pribram, when it didn't go to Kustov as captain, got hurt, then there were problems with the money and he left.
We've been climbing ever since, and I've been playing all the time.
In Brno, of whom I am a devotee, I alternated number one and a two.
Excellent year was in the Old Town, after which I had a lot of offers and chose Příbram.
The Budejovice wanted me from there, I stayed, but I didn't finish the season because of the embolism.
Now it's a new beginning.
Gold number 22.
The short half-op remains Phelps' domain.
"Being on the podium again and hearing the anthem is as sweet as ever," Phelps laughed, his eyes full of tears again.
His fiancée and mother cheered again in the audience, and this time his son Boomer slept peacefully with his headphones on.
I'm having an incredible week to finish my career.
It's crazy - 20 years ago I started swimming competitively and in a few hours it will be over, he said touched.
In the final, Phelps was trailed by nearly two seconds behind silver Japan's Kosuke Hagino, who won the long half-half.
The bronze went to China's Wang Shun, a bronze medalist in this event from last year's World Championships.
After Al Oerter (disk) and Carl Lewis (Distance), Michael Phelps is the third athlete to take the same event at four consecutive games.
For most of the race, he and Phelps were led by another American, Ryan Lochte, and home-grown Thiago Perreira.
While the defending gold champion deployed in the final scorer's 50 to a crushing finish, they fell out of the medal position.
The American superhero will have at least one more chance to expand their unique medal collection in Rio.
Shortly after the semifinal's ceremony, he advanced to the final of the 100-meter butterfly.
The leggney, Ryan Murphy, who won the signing double, could not be overshadowed by the Legend - he won the double track in Rio after the 100.
In the final, he trailed 37 hundredths for Australian swimmer Mitchell Larkin, with Russian Yevgeny Rylov in third.
While Murphy's only fifth place in the 200 from last year's World Championships, he became the B signing king in Rio.
He dethroned Larkin, who made the same double at last year's world championship, dethroned from the imaginary throne.
At the Olympics, however, he won a medal only now.
The freestre hundred was shared by Canadian Penny Oleksiak and American Simone Manuel.
For 16-year-old Oleksiak, it was the fourth medal at these Games, and for Manuel, second after the relay silver.
She won the swimming gold at the Olympics as the first African-American woman in history.
I believe I can be an inspiration to others.
This medal is for everyone who comes after me, sport becomes love for them and they get to where I go, a tearful Manuel said.
The third was Sweden's Sarah Sjöström, who won the 100-meter butterfly in a world record in a world record and has yet to have silver in the 200-seat scorer.
It was the sixth to go to world record holder Australian Cate Campbell.
The Brethren 200 was won by Japan's Rie Kanet, for whom it is the first Olympic medal at the age of 27.
She has no valuable metal or World Championships, her best being fourth in the event in 2013.
The second silver in Rio was won by Russia's Yulia Yefimova, who faces hostile from spectators and rivals for the start at the Games despite her doping past.
I made a big mistake once.
But I won in court, and I don't see why I should answer these questions all the time.
I'm so tired of it, the Russian swimmer said.
She won the Rio start due process at a special panel of the CAS sports arbitration just before the start of the Games.
They were looking into my appeal, and I won.
Whether someone likes it or not, or if they have a different opinion, whether they go to the Arbitration Court, she added.
Hermann: Disappointment, we could have won.
And take off at midnight?
I don't remember.
The Czechs had a special day.
It was only less than an hour before the game that they learned who they were going to come up against.
They had to master tactical preparation in a flash.
And then, at the unconventional time, the match began on a small No.1 court.
The first set did not start well, then drew the advantage of the opponents, but failed to make the final at 19:19.
They were clearly better in the second and drew level, but the decisive tie-break failed.
In particular, a number of broken service stations were a 10:15 loss and a farewell to the Olympic tournament.
"We could have beaten the Russians," Hermann said.
How would you rate the game?
Hermann: After an unfortunate start before I played out, we got into the game beautifully.
In the end, I missed the reception I had gotten used to in the last balloon.
We lost the set, which was the key.
In the next set we took them with an overview on the pitch, a different defence and we pushed the service game.
There were awfully rotten submissions in the tie-break, where we took it down on this side.
It was a disappointment because we could have beaten the Russians.
Sluková: Pity about the start of the first set, it got away from us.
We could pull it off, but we missed the points.
The second set was great and in the third he was deciding the service.
We made too many mistakes.
We gave them five points and the five were, we hesitated a lot there.
It's a shame, because the Russian was playable.
How did you play on the little court number 1?
Sluková: Similar to China's secondary backyards.
The environment and atmosphere were different.
It was one o'clock at night, complete silence, music not playing, nothing.
That was the difference with the center.
We wouldn't choose such conditions, but we can't choose.
What was the preparation for the match when you found out the opponent's names an hour before the game?
Hermann: She was special.
We started to warm up for the game without knowing the opposing players, so we couldn't do the tactical preparation like the other teams.
But Simon (Dask Nusch) had set up a tactic for almost all the possibilities that were there.
He had a lot of paperwork with tactics, so on this side we were pretty well prepared.
Do you remember ever starting a game at midnight?
Hermann: Probably not.
We played at 10:30, but not at 12.
Russian Birlov's block in the playoff round at the Rio Olympics.
Beach volleyball players Markéta Sluková and Barbora Hermann in the embrace in the play-off round at the Rio Olympics.
Was it uncomfortable?
Sluková: By playing the last two matches in the group from ten, we had the regime shifted before.
This was two more hours more.
It's strange, I can't imagine that another sport has athletes who have to perform their best performance at 12 o'clock.
But I think we've prepared the best we could.
We knew it would be like that, but it's not quite typical, and it's probably not my favorite time to play.
How do you rate the Olympic experience?
Hermann: Since advancing from the group was our goal, it's okay on the one hand, good.
We did what we said.
But now after the game, I'm sad.
Sluková: I will sleep with it and from tomorrow I will only remember the Olympic tournament positively.
Big Brother is here, the first SIM of the SIM.
You're not going to escape it.
The new rules are to apply to all persons without a Thai passport who decide to purchase a SIM of one of the local operators when they are in Thailand.
That is, not only to tourists, but also to people with long-term visas who work in Thailand, for example, or have married in marriage there.
The Secretary-General of the National Broadcasting and Telecommunications Commission's Office, Takorn Tantasith, informed that there would be no exceptions.
The SIM sales plan for exclusively foreigners was presented by the national telecoms regulator in early August.
The new measure to enable the monitoring of their location is planned to be implemented by the authorities within six months.
According to Tantasith, it is a means of preserving national security that will enable the criminal activities committed to be dealt with by foreigners.
In addition, the so-called tourist SIMs are intended to help detect those who are over the authorised length of stay.
For retailers, a special SIM for foreigners should appear alongside SIMs exclusively for ThaIs within six months.
A distinction will be the tracking feature, which will be permanently on for cards to persons without a Thai passport.
It will not be possible to turn it off.
"This SIM function is not for Thais, because we can always easily track them," Tantasith said.
It should be added that in Thailand the subscription is not anonymous as in the Czech Republic.
The seller requires identification.
On the other hand, for several years, one of the operators gave away a free starter SIM to tourists at airports.
They were so fully anonymous.
The introduction of the same measure as Thailand is being considered by ten telecoms regulators from other Asian countries, including Malaysia and Singapore.
They are also currently in force for SIM registration, but the legal use of the tracking system is not possible.
However, the forthcoming measure does not imply an obligation for foreigners to acquire a local operator when entering the SIM country.
They can, of course, use roaming services with their own home SIM, in which case the Thai authorities will be short on them.
The operators of that country know only the relevant network information after crossing the border, that is to say, after the SIM has been registered with their network.
They therefore know the telephone number, but not the information about the owner.
However, the difference in roaming charges compared to those of local operators is so abysmal that even most tourists start looking for local SIMS during their stay in Thailand.
The authorities' efforts to have oversight of the movement of foreigners have been legally criticised by foreigners living in Thailand.
Tantasith calms the situation and, in the context of privacy protection, compares the forthcoming system to the obligation to provide residential addresses in immigration documents.
In addition, the police will need a court order if they need to monitor a specific person.
Any abuse of the system will face an unspecified punishment.
"If the service provider follows the SIM position without a court order, he or she will be charged with a crime," Tantasith added.
In addition, the system should also maximise the use of prepaid cards.
While a specific figure will currently be recycled only after the 90-day period for which the SIM did not sign up for the network, the new number could be restored after fifteen days in the event of leaving Thailand.
The luxury apartment in the new building in Vinohrady has a swimming pool and a whirlpool on the terrace.
Why did you choose an apartment in a new building?
We were looking for a carefree apartment where most of the property's care is provided by the caregiver.
The condition was enough parking spaces and a lift in the house, which basically disqualified the older development.
Not to mention the problematic acoustics in old houses, problems with rocking the floor, high energy intensity and the like.
Large terraces were also a condition, which the old development is not able to offer.
More interesting visits can be found in the magazine Modern Apartment.
The whole interior was designed for you by architect Lenka Langerová with her colleague Kamila Poláková from the Artiga studio.
Why did you just reach out to them?
Would you recommend working with a specialist for everyone?
We would recommend cooperation with the architect to everyone, if he designs an apartment from the beginning, because it is a very complex technical process.
The second plane is the interior design itself: the designers have a significantly better idea of the range of possible materials and, based on the client's wishes, are able to match the interior appropriately.
We collaborated with the architect Lenka Langerová on our mountain apartment, then on the basis of the personal recommendation of another client, and since everything worked well, it was an obvious choice for us even during the reconstruction of our new apartment in Vinohrady.
What were your practical and aesthetic requirements?
We wanted a generous socio-residential space with a corresponding background for a family of four conceived as a modern but not a cool interior.
The priority was to achieve the connection of the apartment with the terraces and implement intelligent home control.
And, of course, it was necessary to control the quality of the design.
Did you leave everything to the experts, or did you yourself interfere with the final interior?
We approved all the designs, including technical drawings and samples of materials, but the design was always made by the architects.
At the beginning, we set out what we expect from the design and showed some interior elements that we would like to incorporate into the design, such as carpets or paintings.
I think it was our collection of mostly Czech authors that, including works by Karel Malich, Karel Vysuil, Václav Špála or Otto Gutfreund, helped the architect to navigate our taste.
The combination of black, white and walnut wood was also the architect's idea as well as individual pieces of furniture, walls, floor, lighting, carpets, textiles, art, etc. Whether everything is tuning together, we then verified together by visualisations.
Have there been any complications in the realisation of which you had to give up the original ideas or, on the contrary, accept the new ones?
Perhaps only in the initial phase of the project, when we came to the construction site at the first time it was possible to climb to the height of our floor, and found that the views we had planned would in fact shade the surrounding buildings.
That's when we changed the layout literally overnight from the ground up.
On the kitchen counter and for the lining of the fireplace wall, granite was used.
The interior is dominated by wooden surfaces complemented by leather, such as Arper's Arper's bar and bar chairs.
How would you characterize the interior?
Are you making any changes or is there anything you wish to have differently today?
I believe that this is a modern airy interior, which, above all, fulfils its purpose.
We are not going to make changes, most of the modifications after moving in took place in the plane of shielding and housing the terraces.
Perhaps the only rebuke is to the floor, when the nutty wood turns out to be too delicate for the household with the dog.
The word architects, Ing. arch. Lenka Langerová and MgA. Kamila Hornychová, author of the realization.
The apartment is on the last floor of the new building, so it was possible to make a completely new layout solution and several other modifications within the construction.
For the interior, the placement of the sun tunnels in the hall ceiling and the main toilets are an important feature.
This gave us daylight into the darker space of the apartment.
Also, the direct entrance from the main bathroom to the rooftop terrace to the pool from USSPA is one of the building modifications that was very beneficial for the function of the whole apartment.
There is also a swimming pool and a Jacuzzi.
You are not negative compared to the French, says a Muslim woman living in Prague.
You come from France.
Where did you live before you moved to Prague?
My parents are originally from Algeria.
I was born in the south of France, just off the Spanish border.
I've moved quite a bit.
I lived in Toulouse, Lyon and Marseille.
I studied journalism in France, which then gave me a job in a magazine.
So why did you decide to move out of the country?
I was beginning to feel like I was choking in France.
I just didn't want to live there anymore.
Mainly because of the atmosphere among the people.
I felt like every Frenchman was terribly negative.
People in France are negatively attuned in general, but it's gotten even worse lately.
It's interesting that you mention negativity.
Some people rate the Czech character in this way.
Believe me, you're not negative compared to the French.
It may not seem that way to some people when they come to France, because they don't see it as much as tourists.
But it was too much for me.
The big issue is money.
People feel they have little money, yet the minimum wage in France is fifteen hundred euros, which I think is enough.
Now there is a problem with people's behaviour towards Muslims.
This is completely incomprehensible to me.
For example, in the street in which I lived, my non-Muslim neighbour started looking at me through his fingers just because I was a Muslim.
It's like I'm evil.
That's why I didn't feel comfortable in France.
But my family stayed there.
So you decided to go to another country.
Why did you choose the Czech Republic?
I was looking for work pretty much anywhere else, and I came across a vacant job with Air France here in Prague.
I confess that I did not know Prague at all at the beginning.
I knew something about the Czech Republic, my father even told me about what was happening in Czechoslovakia, but I didn't know what to expect from Prague.
I've been here for three years now, and I can't imagine not living here.
Was it a big difference when you moved from France to Prague?
Mostly because of a completely different atmosphere.
Maybe it's because I don't speak Czech, so I can't pick up any negative reactions or swears, but I feel like people are freer here.
That I can do anything, dress however, and no one will judge me.
In France, you're always uncomfortable looking at, like when you're wearing special clothes and stuff like that.
In Prague, I started to feel really free.
Praguers don't care about such things, I don't think.
Where do you work now?
After a job at Air France, I worked for a travel website for a while.
Then, a friend and I set up a website on which people offer and look for shared housing.
So far we only operate in Prague, but we would like to extend this to the whole of Central Europe.
Do you have any Czech friends in Prague?
I have two very close friends here who are half Czechs, and two other Czech friends.
I have to say that the next specificity of the Czechs is that they keep their distance more at first.
They're not letting anyone get to the body.
That's quite the difference from where I grew up.
To the south, everyone hugs and kisses on the cheek.
It's different here, but I understand it's a cultural thing, so I'm trying to adapt.
You mentioned that you don't speak Czech.
Is the language barrier a problem for you?
On the contrary, it is quite simple in Prague, because perhaps everyone here speaks English.
Even in convenience stores or in food.
I'd like to learn Czech, but I don't have that much time.
And by being able to communicate at least a little in English, I have no such need to learn the language quickly.
And every time I have a problem, there's someone to help me.
Have you encountered any negative reactions?
Like because you're Muslim?
Not really.
Perhaps it is also because I work in an international environment that is more tolerant.
One experience comes to mind.
My leader, the Czech, once told me about the French football team and said something about: They're not the French, they're Africans.
That touched me quite a bit.
But that anyone would have a problem with being a Muslim, that hasn't happened to me yet.
This was despite the fact that a colleague once drew my attention to some anti-Muslim demonstrations.
He said not to go downtown, he said they'd call me names.
The anti-Muslim demonstrations are partly linked to the terrorist attacks.
How does the current situation affect you?
Are you afraid, for example, that something similar to what may happen in Prague in Paris, Nice or Brussels?
I feel safe in Prague.
But the problem is, anything anywhere can happen these days.
Until recently, I might not have imagined something like this happening in France.
And it's not just about Muslims.
Moreover, Islam does not recognize the violence at all.
To me, the people who kill aren't Muslims.
The Koran says a man has no right to kill because he is not God.
How do you feel about the terrorists being backed by your faith?
It's very hard.
I feel shame and guilt, though I shouldn't feel that way at all.
I try not to follow the reports of violence much, but every time I read something, I have a need to apologize for something that's not really my fault.
I'm a completely different person, so why should I apologize for the terrorists?
We met in the George Square of Poděbrady.
On Wednesday, Czech Muslims, along with Christians, demonstrated against the violence.
Did you register it?
I didn't know about that.
But I understand that these people feel the need to prove that they disagree with the violence.
I don't think they'd have to do that.
Why should they feel guilty about something they didn't do?
Do you meet other Muslims in Prague?
My associates are from, for example, Egypt and other Muslim countries.
They are a little more religious than I am, so we sometimes have quite wild discussions about Islam because we all see it a little differently.
I come from France, so I went through a different education, maybe they were taught Islam at school.
We have different approaches, but we respect each other.
People sometimes associate Islam with the subordinate of a woman's position.
How do you feel about that?
I don't feel subordinate in any way.
Rather the opposite.
I'm a woman, I have the strength.
It has to do with the fact that you don't wear any headgear.
A hijab, for example?
And it's mostly the way I was raised.
My mother, for example, is a truly principled Muslim.
He praises himself five times a day, but he just doesn't wear a scarf.
She always taught me that faith is a purely personal thing.
It's up to everyone how they interpret it.
When you read the Koran, you should make up your own mind about the things.
So when I read a passage in the Koran that says that God told the Prophet to hide his wives in the eyes of others, I said to myself: I am not the Prophet's wife, so why should I hide?
On the other hand, I respect that, and if I come to, say, Iran or Saudi Arabia, where they require scarves, I'll marry him.
Are you planning to stay in Prague?
So far, yes.
Nowhere else did I feel so good.
I thought about Poland for a while, but I'm great at Prague.
I can even imagine raising my own children here.
Prague is the ideal city for this, I think.
Czech Muslims, along with Christians, demonstrated against the violence.
Yachtsman Kozelska's Fenclova wind in Rio was taken to the standings.
Friday's sea rides in Rio de Janiero, Brazil, were released by Czech yachtswoman Veronica Kozelska Fencl.
In the Laser Radial class, she moved to tenth in tenth place before the final two races.
That would give the Czech a Czech a place in the final run.
You pick up the packets as pokémon.
They want to compete with the carriers.
The idea to use the planned shipment hail trips are the TV director Matěj Liška and the manager of the Prague music club Marek Greger.
With the idea, they inhaled life into a trio of applications with different geographic reach.
We launched the national application of the Transfer in May.
There are 1,000 cities uploaded at the moment, and we're going to expand the network.
In the Czech Republic, we first want to learn this than we will focus more on abroad, says the 41-year-old manager in an interview with iDNES.cz.
How does the Swipe App work and who can benefit from it?
You download it and register for free.
Then you can enter the route and the details of how big a package you can manage to move and how much you want for it.
Someone might be in demand a transfer on that day.
When the route and delivery time are comfortable, it is pawned and both of them will be a mutual notification.
That's when the cottage opens, where the pair arrange the handover.
How many people do you think would have to register for each package to always find their courier?
I do not know the ideal condition, I cannot estimate how many registered and how many paths it takes to be fully optimal for the coverage to be fully optimal and each supply to be paired with demand.
It already works on the main draws and it's logically easier than, say, on the way between the villages.
The more people, the more potential for speed and accuracy.
People are also building trust in the meantime and find that no one can get away with the package.
Have you not had to deal with such a case yet?
How many users has a service two months from the startup?
At the moment, we have about 5,000 to 6,000 people who create the roads.
We consider this a success and we believe that others will be packed.
Isn't there a danger that the sender will wait too long?
We hope to be a competition for the big conglomerates just because we are able to deliver the item on the same day and for a fraction of the price.
With a large company, you will pay several thousand for delivery within two hours.
Here you will pay a hundred or less, because that is a journey that someone is already doing business.
Should traditional hauliers be worried about a possible loss of customers in the future?
We hope it will be.
The market has enormous potential, with huge transnational carriers feeding here, as well as retail chains, where everyone started shopping and gradually found that the quality was not the responsibility for what they paid for.
No one wants to find a notebook in the mailbox with the note to pick up the package at the branch, not before that day after 7 p.m.
By this time I had needed the package for six hours and I was waiting at home because it was important.
We want a better, faster and functional service that doesn't annoy anyone and sends a signal to the competition to try.
Marek Greger (41) and Matěj Liška (39).
Neither has ever worked in information technology.
Marek Greger works as a music club manager, Matěj Liška as a TV director.
In 2014, they began preparing the Shippansee LTD app, which uses the package already planned to travel between the world's metropolises, primarily by air.
In 2015, they commissioned a project to process the company that created applications for example for MALL.cz, Jobs.cz or ČSFD.
The programming took three quarters of a year and the app was launched in March 2016.
They started developing the App on the Převez in December last year and released in May this year.
This is a local version of Shippansee adapted for the Czech market.
The Mesík and Mesík Profi apps were developed from this January and made available to users at the end of July 2016.
The intention was to do all these apps from the start, which would one day be merged into one.
In the Czech Republic, they want to fine-tune the app and then focus more on the global market in cooperation with a strong investor.
The shared economy has been a topic of late, and this is a service like AirBnB or Uber.
Aren't you worried about being in an area that no one has yet to say much about where the sharing threshold is and where the shadow economy is?
It's the same thing, except a different product.
It is clear to us that if it is a success and we go up with it, we will be the next thorn in the side through the grey economy.
But even though someone spares and makes a profit, it is not the intention to circumvent the tax authorities and tax inspections.
Every user, either side or the other, will be encouraged to tax their income if they make the proceeds.
What makes you think the service has such great potential?
The sender saves and the transfer earns, or reduces the cost of the trip.
That's the powerful idea that combines interest on both sides.
In the age of social networks that divide people, we'd like this one to get this one closer together.
They can make nice stories, people are happy to help someone and tell stories about it.
Maybe someone will bring you forgotten glasses, keys or pills.
People, in my opinion, have been lacking in a personal approach for a long time, we're saying this app is a service to people to the people.
So how do you guarantee that the courier will not flee with the package?
Each user of the app, together with the registration, will scan the ID card and the bank connection, credit card or credit card.
These are channels that give service to both the service and the plausibility.
Couriers also collect stars based on the rating of the senders.
We will also offer insurance, the details are still being tuned.
The uninsured shipment is liable to the courier in the event of loss or damage, but does not take responsibility for the content under the criminal law if there is something illegal inside and he does not know about it.
If the police stop him and find a machine gun or ten kilos of hash in a closed packet in his trunk, he falls over the criminal liability to the sender.
Is there a risk of misuse of sensitive data from the database?
Registered are, if necessary, the administrator, which is the only one who will be able to consult it, nor are we ourselves able to see it, the data is against the misuse protected.
How much money does a courier get in hand after successfully delivering the shipment?
The courier determines the price and gets the full amount he asks for.
The sender is charged an extra percentage for facilitating contact.
This money is our profit, but it's only a few percent because we want to push for volume.
The courier can't be accused of not delivering the package when he actually delivered it, both receiving and delivering is verified using QR codes.
Are there any limitations?
Whether in relation to the size or content of the package?
You can take anything.
We have three sizes, as small as a cube of butter, medium as a platoic egg and the size of a bass of beers.
After that, there is no further restriction and if someone has a place in the car, they will transport the fridge.
Plus, the sender has the option to take a picture of the package in the app, so the courier sees what he is asked to do.
You don't even have to pack the thing if you don't want to hide the contents outright.
You put the forgotten sweatshirt in the courier's hand, and that's it.
Who came up with the idea and how long did it take to run the service?
A friend had an idea more than two years ago, back then I didn't pay much attention to it.
Then he showed me a demo application with a transnational reach that mainly targets airline passengers.
At that moment, I told him I wasn't going to look for an investor, but I'd like to become one myself and put savings into it.
The next year took a development than we founded Shippansee LTD in London due to the greater credibility of the whole product.
But this is not the version you are focusing on now.
No, we focused the marketing on the Czech Republic, where we try to catch the app, because the whole thing was in labor pains and there is always something to deal with and improve.
We are trying to respond to feedback from customers and we are not so concerned about the foreign market at the moment.
We know it's a long shot, but we're not in a hurry, we want to create a really good product for people.
Shippansee LTD was a basic and most expensive application, the other two were in a way an upgrade.
The transfer was created when we said that the national segment could be much more interesting and that we would at least learn it in the Czech Republic.
The third application Mesík is local, for the city.
But he can send a package to an exact address to the other end of the world.
It works for the sender as well as the Převez I, but the difference is that as a courier, you see the shipments in the form of the points on the map closest to you, thanks to the geo-coding on your mobile.
We called the apps for couriers who want to make a living from this, we called Mesík Profi.
So can anyone make an outright profit by picking up packages around the city?
Exactly, the last app will be downloaded in Prague by a taxi driver, a student, a mother on parental leave, someone who wants to make the trip to work.
As everyone's fooling around with the pokemons right now, they can collect this just as much.
You can see where there are commissions around the city, you come to it, click and see when it has to be delivered and the package is transported.
It's cheaper than competing services.
At the moment, we are still making a web interface that will be central to companies for sending shipments, on the web they will fill in the data about them, i.e. it creates points on the map.
We are then able to make them use of the service to be made out by them every month.
Are you now in the full-time project?
It's forcing us, but we're normally on the job so we can feed and develop the project.
We're not behind us a strong multinational investor, we're two guys, one of whom had a brilliant idea, and the other jumped in with more suggestions and ideas.
We are now looking for an investor strong enough to manage with us to manage not the Czech market, but who should, with the pardon of the ball, go with us to a global product and become another huge player in the market like AirBnB and Uber.
The story part of Titanfall 2 is intended to bring almost forgotten variety.
This will be corrected by the second installment and the solo game in it will be more diverse than in Call of Duty, according to the first information.
The length will be around the standard eight hours and the filling is to be based on the concept of network wrestling in the first part.
It is therefore possible to look forward to the freedom of movement, which in addition to running includes the possibility of using the combat titan.
In addition to the action passages, the game will also include levels aimed at just skilful movement.
They will resemble platformers and include puzzles.
To overcome them, therefore, for example, double jumps, running on the walls and a rope slide are essential.
Sometimes, it will be necessary to eliminate enemies as well.
There will also be maps reminiscent of maze and levels with special concepts.
In one, for example, it will be possible to lift and slice platforms and close massive doors.
You will thus adjust the form of the battlefield.
The pace of the game should thus oscillate between furious action and calmer moments for exploring an unknown planet.
We'll play for the pawn Jack Cooper dreaming of a pilot's career.
At the start of the campaign, Cooper, along with Captain Lastimosa, crashes on the alien planet Typhon, which is inhabited by enemy soldiers.
And it won't be indulgent for the wilderness there.
In addition, lastimosa kills the crash, and Cooper is therefore tasked with getting the captain's titan working.
His dream of a career as a pilot will come true sooner than he expected.
But the first step will be to steal the battery necessary for the robot repair.
Cooper's calls to the titanium will also be significant.
Players will be used as a source of information about the soldier's past, but at the same time humorous moments will be created by the robot-decersonic communications.
For example, if the titanium is dryly listing all the injuries that Cooper faces in his planned jump.
The first information about the campaign in Titanfall 2 was reported by the Polygon server.
In addition, the result can be assessed in two months and Bonusweb will bring you your first impressions of the network game after Gamescom.
Titanfall 2 is released on 28. October, for PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
The THQ brand comes to life, but the original label remains dead.
Swedish company Nordic changes its name to THQ Nordic.
After the collapse of THQ, in 2013, it acquired a number of its brands and the right to use both the logo and the name of the company.
This has made the likes of the Darksiders 2 Deathnitive Edition and the Red Faction Collection package.
In addition, 23 more games are being developed for the publishing house, and 13 of them have not yet been revealed by the company.
Thirty years ago, while I retired, my wife, after 30 years of marriage, found a younger man, our neighbor, to be twenty years younger.
I knew it from the beginning - first she obviously tried for him for a long time, then they got together.
He's such a big guy, her type, because she dated a similar one before me.
She went crazy for him.
Her first days even changed her voice, she had a little girl's, a love-beating voice.
But when I told her I knew what was going on, she was denying it.
But I was watching the whole thing.
He'd come home from work at 3:30 at the time, and she always left for groceries at three.
Every day she tried to make her see him at least.
Later I found out that they were meeting at his house, in the laundry.
How many times did I know they were there.
I got my keys, he was determined to catch them there.
But I don't know why, I ended up always sitting at home.
I could never go there, to take that decisive step.
You may laugh at me, but I believe my wife thoughtfully controlled me.
I soon discovered that I was manageable, that I would do what she wanted to do.
And I actually did.
Maybe I'm just a little bucket.
At the same time, my neighbors suggested to me that they knew about it, too.
I was such a jerk that I never asked them what to do.
I was afraid that if it all broke, it would be bad.
That it would affect everyone in the family, only the daughter suspected something.
So I always put it off, on and on.
But I went to his apartment one day to see him, saying I needed help with something in the laundry room.
He went with me, and I told him that I had received an anonymous letter saying that he was seeing my wife and that everything was telling.
I asked him what he said.
He stood there, shrugged, stared at the ground, and said no word.
Then, at that time, I met his wife on the way from the store.
I told her, but she didn't believe it.
She didn't respond to it, and she didn't tell me either.
Nobody said anything to me at the time.
I'm the kind of person who never went out much, who has a hard time meeting someone, let alone find a woman.
So I didn't even think about the divorce.
I kept relying on it to end one day.
I thought I'd forgive her all this and life would go on.
That's not the case.
And I've basically never come to terms with all this.
I still have it in me.
I used to show it to her quite often, but in the end I quit for the rest.
He lives in the house next door, and I continue to live with her.
It's just rather than my wife my housekeeper.
She always did everything at home - cooked, washed, cleaned.
She's hardworking.
I always think she's tried to make no other reason to complain.
And you could say she's a good one.
But sometimes I'd like to pet her, hug her, and she won't let go.
We go for walks and shopping together, and we all think about our happy marriage.
But she once told me she never loved me.
That she had me and loved me, but that she didn't love me.
And I see he loves him to this day, he's her god.
And I don't enjoy that life.
Even then, when it started and I carried it very badly, I once told her that I didn't want to live and I asked what she would say if I was done.
I wanted to see if she'd agree or not.
And I wanted to hear from her: Yes or no.
But she thought about it, and finally said, "But there's plenty of room."
Prime Minister Manuel Valls wants to set up a new French Islamic Foundation to serve as a bridge between the state and its Muslim residents.
After the terrorist attacks, France is escalating the fight against radical Islamists, and the government and the local Muslim minority are calling in to help.
"If the Muslims themselves do not help the state against those who violate public freedom, it will be increasingly difficult for France to guarantee their freedom of religion," said Prime Minister Manuel Valls.
He intends to ensure that only spiritual educated in France preach in the country.
It also wants to stop the financing of mosques from abroad, with money often coming in for preachers inoculated jihad.
By October, Prime Minister Valls wants to establish a new French Islamic Foundation to serve as a bridge between the state and its Muslim residents.
The new institution will replace the current French Foundation for Islam, which was founded in 2005 by then Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin.
It was already to contribute to making the financial flows between the mosques more transparent and the countries that finance their construction.
But soon she was struck by internal contradictions, and it never worked properly.
"It's a total failure," Valls said.
The new foundation is likely to be headed by former Interior and Defence Minister Jean-Pierre Chevènement, who is known as a supporter of the secular state.
There are some 2,500 mosques and prayers in France, about 120 of them serving radical Islamism.
Since 2012, French authorities have expelled some 80 Islamic clerics from the country, and have been considering the move for several dozen more.
This week, the German police also intervened against the jihadist clerics.
The Imams reportedly recruited fighters for the Islamic State.
One of them ran a space where the faithful were allegedly radicalized and later attacked the Sikh temple in Essen.
Immediately after the attacks on Charlie Hebdo in January 2015, a debate erupted in France over a new institution to replace the dysfunctional foundation.
All was hastened by further terrorist attacks carried out by radical Islamists in the name of the Islamic State.
The new foundation will have two main challenges - to secure the funding of mosques from indigenous sources, as well as to oversee imams.
However, it is not yet clear where it will receive funding, although several proposals are being considered.
One of them is a special fee for halal food, that is, mainly for meat from slaughterage under Islamic principles.
This tax would in practice be paid by the sellers of halal food, for the provision of the permit.
Some of the money would then go to the foundation's budget.
The allowance of between €10 and €20 could also be paid by French pilgrims who go to Mecca.
Every year, about 30,000 of them set off from France for the traditional pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia.
Moreover, French mosques should feature only preachers who have passed the educational programmes at the universities there.
This should make their sermon compatible with democracy.
The government is also closing radical mosques.
"We have closed 20 of them since December and others will follow," said Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve.
"There is no place in France for those who preach hatred and do not respect the principles of our country, such as equality between women and men," he said.
Zaragoza.
An unknown gunman was badly injured by an unknown gunman on Friday morning in a shopping mall in northern Spain's Zaragoza, writes the Independent.
The shooting occurred after the woman and her daughter left the garage area in their car.
The man waited in the car outside the shopping mall, where he also started shooting.
According to witnesses, the man then turned the gun on himself, writes the Independent.
The woman was taken to the hospital by an uninjured daughter, and an ambulance had to come for the man in critical condition.
The crime took place at around 11.00 in the central part of the metropolis of the autonomous region of Aragon, near the local university.
Citing the Spanish Europa Press, the Independent writes that the motive was probably the unresolved recent divorce of both partners.
Cendettles with asparagus, wakame algae, ginger and chilli sauce.
Summer wishes for light, well-deliable meals, but we Czechs are rebels and we have our tastes and our heads.
So the summer gardens smell like grilled neck, brine, pork cologne.
Not very healthy, nothing too light, with the occasional exception to the salad or toasted vegetables.
True, barbecuing is economical for time and dishes, plus it's a social issue and no one has to be cooped up in the kitchen.
But there are other alternatives to make good with delicacies that make special dining, their preparation is a small ritual, but at the same time there is no need to cook, bake, fry or choke at length.
And they will contribute to our health.
Whether it's homemade sushi or sashimi, where quality ingredients and some well-adased grifts are enough to make the preparation fun and the food itself a real exotic delicacy.
As well as the even easier rolls in rice paper from today's recipe.
Here, it even eliminates more time-consuming cooking and cooling the rice.
The paper can only be softened into the water for a moment, and then it is up to the cook's imagination how he intends to play with the refills and accessories.
There's no kelp like an algae.
The advantage of a range of Asian cuisine dishes today is that the raw materials are generally already commonly available.
Including the pickled sweet-and-sourgre, which is one of the basic delicacies accompanying the sushi or fresh rolls.
You can also make it at home, but the real pink gari ganim has a unique spicy sharp and delicious taste thanks to a secret recipe by which it is mixed from several types of vinegar and ginger.
So just buy a bag of the appropriate size, and the attachment with the demonstrable antibacterial effects, which both promotes digestion and cough or flu resistance, is ready.
Banana leaves.
They are used mainly in Buddhist and Hindu cultures in serving and decorating dishes as part of a variety of festive occasions and rituals.
The long ribbed sheets of a banana tree are widespread in a number of countries in Asia or South America as well as a "rebowoman" to prepare a variety of roasted, cooked and fried foods that are packed in much the same way as foil.
The banana leaf will then pass on to the dish a specific flavour.
Here, they can be bought in stores with exotic fruit and vegetables, even pre-cut in the shape of wheels.
But choose only the leaves of the deep green and therefore healthy - unscathed and spotless.
Similarly easy is the preparation of the salad from the wakame, sesame and sesame oil.
It can be bought again frozen.
Those who often eat or prepare sushi will probably know the kelp of nori in particular.
In Japan, it is one of the most important types of seaweed from which it is made by chopping, pressing and drying the so-called nori leaves - the plates designed specifically for the production of sushi.
Wakame − a deep green kelp growing in the waters around the island of Hokkaido - is also fresh and dried and popular as the kelp nori.
By the way, who wouldn't know miso soup with wakame, allegedly Asian women have used it for a repeat after childbirth.
And this algae has almost miraculous effects.
It cleans blood, strengthens circulation, even supposedly prevents hair greying and is literally charged with minerals.
Dried and disassembled wakame also serves as a spice, for example, to season it with rice.
Fresh eyelashes are first allowed to be leached in the water, then rinsed, placed in boiling water and cooked for half a minute.
It is then cooled in the icy water, cut out of the central beat and continue to be treated as a favourite salad.
But buying it already finished, freezing, is the easiest solution.
All that remains is to scatter the roll with the easy vegetable filling, delicious and light, full of healthy tastes.
Such a longevity bombsheet.
If you resist and don't throw in an extra grilled brisket.
Eat healthy, easy and summer.
The Asians know how to do it.
All you need is a few special ingredients and a little bit of skill, and you have an interesting fresh meal that delicately combines flavours.
And it's done in no time.
Four pieces of rice paper, 40g carrots, 40g white radish, 100g green asparagus, 60g salad cucumber, 60g wakame algae and 60g sweet chilli sauce.
A handwell of chopped coriander, a teaspoon of black sesame, a teaspoon of sriracha chilli sauce, 20g manga and 40g pickled ginger, a little pine nuts.
First, we'll prepare the rolls.
Soak the stuffing of the rhinestone in the cold water for five seconds.
Then remove it and wait for it to soften.
In the meantime, cook briefly in the hot water with the asparagus shoots, and after about three minutes, we quickly cool them down into the icy water to keep them from losing their colour.
Place the vegetable filling on the permitted paper and wrap it.
Prepare the filling from white radish, carrots and salad cucumbers, which are cut into fine noodles, mix them with the sweet chilli sauce, add the chopped coriander, mix thoroughly and put on the rice paper.
Place the asparagus sprouts on the banana leaf, add the rolls and at the end finish decorate the whole dish with wakame-kilting, a mango-knit, sprinkle with black sesame and add a few pine nuts.
Britain must settle for silver in seven-seat rugby, Fiji's selection takes gold
Great Britain's impressive performance in the seven-seat rugby ended in a devastating lead at the last hurdle, with Fiji beating the British in the final game on Thursday night at the Deodoro Stadium 43-7.
The Fijians performed a championship lesson in processing, a landfill, eveches, a support game, a line-up and a brutal force - and won gold, their first Olympic medal ever.
The defeat came with an unseeded consolation prize in the form of a silver medal - for Britain the third day on the day - and the British could be proud of their performances in the inauguration Olympic Olympic Rugby Rugby tournament, beating New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
A win over South Africans 7-5 in the semi-finals that same day, she may have froze them in the final.
However, Fiji, in his form, would also be beaten by a 15-man team in full health.
Best of all, it won't be a comfort for the British, but they can rejoice in the fact that at least one of them will have a gold medal around his neck tomorrow: the Fijan's head coach is Ben Ryan, the former England boss of Wimbledon.
Great Britain has come a long way.
Eight years ago, under Ryan, they lost every game at the Adelaide Sevens.
Here they lost only one.
This defeat hurts, but progress is undeniable.
The Fiji began spectacularly, reflecting the intersections of the British for their joy.
For captain Tom Mitchell and the other teammates, it was like running behind a row of buses on the move, and the World Cup champions were leading 5-0, when Osea Kolinisau emerged from around the corner.
The timer showed four minutes, and Jerry Tuwai added another down on the right wing, which was a conversion.
12-0 and Britain made a hard time touching the ball.
The brilliant Mitchel tried to stop the huge Leon Nakarawa and prevent him from scoring for the third time, but only slowed the Fijians down.
In the seventh minute, Yasa Veremalua threw a touchdown into the right corner and the British were downed 17-0.
Nakarawa added another on his return, and there was still more than 1 minute left in the clock ... from the first half.
Vatemo Ravouva then broke through the languid British and rushed to the line where he scored.
The conversion to a 29-0 lead was followed by a break.
It was as if Fiji had been born for rugby 7s, while the British were still learning the graduation ceremony.
This is exactly what it is.
The British made mass changes after halftime and stopped the onslaught of the Fijians... for the whole four long minutes, which was good compared to the first half until after the brilliant interlude of Fiji Josua Tuisov passed.
Dan Norton tried to get an opportunity for the British, throwing a touchdown to the left corner to make it 36-7. But the game was long overdue by the Pacific islanders, and their fans on the stands sang, waved flags and danced.
It was hard not to admire the Fijan's utterly embellished approach.
In the final moments, Mata Viliame, with another attempt to win the Fiajans, he sweetened.
There was a whistle, and the Fijjans embraced, and the British fell to the turf completely downholstaged.
Earlier that day, Fiji had been beaten 20-5 by Japan in the semifinals, and the UK overcame South Africa in the narrow semi-final - the difference of one conversion.
Kyle Brown put the South Africans ahead in the first half, but Dan Norton, thanks to his dazzling footwork, broke through the defensive line and scored under the hook in the second half.
Marcus Watson's brilliant late-season dump, Anthony's brother of the 15th England team, secured victory - and, in the end, a silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning to win the rowing race were inspired by the cancer coach's battle
You won't find more emotional gold on these Games - and that's a lot to say.
From the first shot to the last, during the 220 punishing breaths in history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found further significance in their golden moment at Estacio de Lagoa.
Though there were two of them at the mirth, there were three voices in the ship. As the ship whizzed down the surface to the second Olympic gold in a row in the women's doubles race, the voice of the still-present coach Robin Williams was still in the boat. They are the first women in the history of British sport to achieve such a result.
Their superiority was absolute, overall it was their 39th race, in which they remained unsurpassed.
What we see - two excellent athletes flying across the water with the elegance of the swans - does not reflect the nature of the victory completely.
Behind every gold medal of rowing is a battalion of the auxiliary hands, which, piece by bit, make a difference. And no hands were more helpful than the hands of a coach who, 30 months ago, did not know if he would live to see that day when he was diagnosed with cancer.
In his words, it was uncertain.
I suffered from bladder cancer that could be operated on, and I underwent this surgery.
Without surgery, anything could happen.
It would be a very bad situation.
It'll change your point of view.
The cancer was detected by Williams in December 2013.
The happiness for the whole trio was that he could have started treatment at the beginning of 2014, in the off-season, and reduce the shortfall to a minimum - if we can call it that under such circumstances.
I needed to make money, so I had to get back together quickly.
That was the impetus.
I was in the hospital and walking around the room - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at the time they said a few steps was enough.
That's how it started.
Rowing in itself is a journey, but this was a bit more challenging.
Immediately after the victory, their first thoughts were of Williams, who was very nervous this morning, talking less than usual, as he tried to cope with his own unease.
Stanning, captain of the regimental artillery regiment, who has had a mission in Afghanistan, said, "I've been at the bottom of my emotions this week, maybe it's a little extreme, but it means so much."
It reiterates how much it means to me, how much Helen and I worked with, and so did Robin.
Up until now, it's been three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin, we wouldn't be anyone, so he deserves a huge thank you, he's the best coach in the world.
I couldn't have asked for a better man for training, or a better coach.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost a single race in five years.
The pair put on a stunning rhythm that their rivals could not match.
Even in the final 500 metres, when crews from New Zealand and Denmark began to approach, Stanning and Glover had a very large reserve.
At most, we were concentrating at the moment.
Helen shouted, "Don't stop, don't stop."
It's really important not to get carried away.
We had a good start and at the same time we had no desire to achieve anything famous.
We didn't get excited about today's fireworks, we just wanted to go for a good crush, go out and win the race, which we did.
The pair will take a year to think about it before deciding what to do next.
Glover is getting married next week, her husband-to-be is TV adventurer Steve Backshall.
Now he wants to savor that moment.
I didn't mean to say it would be my last race.
That would put too much pressure on it.
It took approximately six months in London to find out that I was the Olympic champion.
It was all so new and I was so stressed.
It took about four minutes here.
I feel a lot better about it," she said.

Prison?
It's more like driving people over for free, says Taximafie hunter Rubeš to the groundbreaking indictment.
Six taxi drivers and a former municipal official in Prague are, as reported by TIME, the defendants.
You have filmed a series of reports in which you have uncovered the fraudulent practices of those who are to be in court in the group.
You've faced a few awkward skirmishes with the exposed players about it.
How much is the report on the indictment of the members of the organized group for you at a groundbreaking?
I expected there to be a trial.
I'm mainly curious about the verdict.
I don't think they should be in jail, though.
It's no use.
Primarily, they should return all the stolen money.
And they should return them by driving all people around for free.
This is a rather peculiar solution.
Does this mean, then, that you do not see any punishment as effective enough?
What's enough for me is that some of them are so afraid they're not doing the job anymore.
For example, one does a pingla, another makes pizza delivery, and one gave up on it altogether.
The defendants can theoretically receive two to eight years in prison.
Do you think that's an adequate rate?
In general, I have a problem with imprisonment.
I consider it a bad punishment.
Putting someone in jail, especially in that case, is nonsense.
Such people should return to the company they took from it.
For a quarter of a century they committed to destroying our country's name and stealing from people.
So let them make a good card now and deliver people for free.
I can't imagine it any other way.
It would work as community service.
As someone goes to collect garbage, they'd get a car and drive people around Prague for free.
No, I really think they'll get parole in the end and they won't care.
They'll find another way to cheat somewhere.
He studied at the Film Academy of Miroslav Ondříček in Písek and subsequently at the Tomas Bata University in Zlín.
He is one of the people who started out with viral videos and videos directly for the web in the Czech Republic.
He works as an editor for the internet television network Stream.cz, where he participates in a number of programmes, now he is preparing the Prague Guide programme, which is intended primarily for foreign viewers.
In the form of short stories, Rubeš advises them on the services in Prague rather avoid and what, on the contrary, he recommends to use without fear.
Previously, he filmed series with the titles How to Do It, City of Fraud?, Life in Luxury, And Enough! and Prague vs. Money.
The indictment is referred to as an organized group.
Police had been following her for months.
Can such a network of fraudulent taxi drivers be described as mafia?
They're cute mafiosi, not the kind we know from the Godfather.
They're more about the mafiosi - juniors, but they're organized for sure.
Just in guarding each other's relays (the Taxiking posts).
Prague is all divided.
I have observed that the main railway station, for example, is not liked with Paris, Pařížská does not like with taxi drivers waiting at Karlovy Lázně (disco club)
Everybody just watches over their spot, and every group is kind of organized.
It's obviously a convoluted network.
But the defendants are joined together by only seven people, six taxi drivers and one former magistrate official who warned the driver against checks.
As you say, the undesirable phenomenon has not disappeared from the streets.
Which percentage is the percentage among the Prague fraudsters in the taxi service, according to your estimate?
It's a very small percentage.
The worst are still on the street.
I'm talking about Aleš Ryjáček, for example.
This is a man who is really dangerous - he drives a telescopic baton in his car, and every Friday and Saturday he stands at the Charles Bridge and brings people around.
The last time I rode with him, he asked me for seven hundred in three kilometers.
His police did not detain for some reason.
Only a few people from the whole group have been selected.
However, the situation is the same in other locations in Prague.
The indictment of seven people, therefore, will find it hard to eradicate the already famous Prague mischief, which seems to be of much larger size.
It's no good, of course.
It will help, but all evil is not eradicated, it is true.
Do taxi drivers who steal from foreign tourists perform at the same places you showed in the reports, the Charles Bridge or in Pařížská Street?
Yes, that's right.
They stand in these locations every day and violate the ordinances every day.
This is also overdue by the municipal police and the Prague Municipality.
It's not even a cat anymore, it's total indifference.
Business of Prague taxi drivers in numbers
Yet some of them, even if it are only part of the group, will go to trial.
It's a break.
I must therefore ask: do you feel vindicable?
If I took it as a satisfaction, that would be wrong, because my goal was, is and always will be to improve the centre of Prague.
And even if I feel like it's a little bit better, I'll continue to do so.
You need to push the door from the other side.
Even if the last thief stays there, we should still be doing something to remove him.
That is not enough to be content.
But it's not that, there are more of them, of course.
Are you still trying to confront them in the cabs?
I do test rides sometimes and I have to say it's still wrong.
Just last week, I caught a cab driver, from the same group, by the way, and was very surprised to see me again.
He charged CZK 560 for three kilometres, although he then claimed it was CZK 56 (he had used a trick with a decimal).
He had a receipt for it, the cops came, and this cab driver was so endearingly rude to go to those police officers and asked them when someone would finally give him the 56 kroner.
A similar case.
The taxi driver on the taximeter taped the decimal and robbed the tourists of 357 crowns.
Can you say that the insolence of the fraudulent taxi drivers did not back down even after you showed in your footage the faces of those who charged meaningless sums for a short ride?
Their insolence is still incredible.
What happened to the taxi driver at the £56 claiming?
The police sent him away, saying they could not argue with him at the scene because he had issued a receipt.
And that, I think, will be a problem in that court (six taxi drivers and one ex-official official).
There's going to be a cab driver on the one hand with his receipts, the police on the other.
But according to the Supreme Administrative Court's ruling, the magistrate may not use secret recordings from a taxi service vehicle as evidence in court.
When I filmed the episodes about their scams, the taxi drivers themselves alerted me to this precedent.
I was just going to use the footage in the story.
Are you concerned that this fact could protect them from the court?
I hope that any judge will understand that no taxi driver could drive for six or ten crowns per kilometre, because he would not be a living.
You spoke of a trick with a decimal comma, which is being pushed forward especially by underwater taxi drivers in front of foreign clients.
Is it still relevant, or are they worried about continuing to use this trick after the publication of your stories?
I think we have popularised this trick by airing the show.
I was driving with a cab driver the other day, bragging to me that he was the honest taxi driver.
But then I noticed that a black cardboard was taped from the side of the meter.
When I asked him what was in it, he said to me, "You know what it is."
When the fines didn't work too well on the taxi driver-druff, can they be impressed with the court with their colleagues?
Is there anything that can deter them from fraud?
You talked about how you think they'll always find the way to cheat.
I don't think anything can discourage them.
But someone can push them out of those places.
And these are fair taxi drivers who should fight harder to get them out of there.
From my experience, I have to say that the fair taxi drivers in Prague are fortunately prevailing.
But do they want to go up against those who are ruining the reputation of their services?
They have a taste, but they miss the skill.
He can't walk around in it, and he can't say exactly what they'd like.
When they held the demonstration (because of the proposal for a full-scale restriction from Mayor Adriana Krnáčová's office), it didn't sound very clear what they wanted.
They once said they weren't protesting against Uber, that they just wanted to have the same conditions as this service, then they said they wanted more than Uber.
It turned out that they just blocked Prague and it was just the best possible commercial for Uber.
Overall, how do you assess the approach of the Prague Municipality in solving the issue of overcharging fares?
You can see that the criminal police had to step in to sort something out.
The magistrate was short for it.
They had a mole that leaked information, which means the taxi department was doing its job for several years for nothing.
I hope they'll charge the clerk to the last check-up of all the thwarted checks to realize what he's done.
That's what I find the worst part of it.
I even had a check-up with him, which I only found out subsequently from their roster.
It has been for months since the latest episodes of the series were published.
What's the response?
I think especially with foreign viewers than the series is actually the most focused.
Every time I have friends from abroad, I play the videos for them.
And then when we walk in the Old Town Square, it's a surprise that the same people who can be seen in the footage are really standing there.
The infamous Prague celebrities.
Seriously, though.
I'd build a fence around them to keep people looking at them.
The Museum of Communism right on the street.
My last question is clear.
Do you take a cab when you need to?
Sure.
I go with services where I don't have to pay cash, but with a card.
I use services like Uber or Liftago, where there is no possibility of fraud.
But there are also many dispatches that are fair.
I've only taken a cab on the street once since.
The driver said to me after getting in the car, "Well, you've got some guts."
Bam in disguised as an Italian tourist.
The fraudulent practices of taxi drivers were written in 2005.
Former Mayor Pavel Bém set out on a check-up drive in disguised as an Italian tourist in the same year and was cheated at the first attempt by the driver for two hundred.
But the editor, Rubeš, had worse experience.
The taxi drivers charged him CZK 820 for driving from the Old Town Square to Wenceslas Square, which is worth roughly CZK 195 per kilometre, as the report makers calculated.
The Prague Municipality set the maximum price at CZK 28 per kilometre.
There are also other surprising sums in the recorded report: for example, a two-kilometre journey from Pařížská Street to the Joiner cost the tourist 400 crowns.
The expensive rides were also provided by taxi drivers waiting at the Charles Bridge.
They charge even six hundred crowns for the ride to Angel, which has 2.5 kilometres.
The marble is washed mostly with clean water, as much as possible without chemistry and the longer, the better.
The impurities come from it well, although sometimes dirt has to be put down by a scalpel, it needs to be excreted from the folds.
It's not easy and it's not going quickly, the restorer Vanesa Trostová from Oldřichov in the Grove approached her work.
Hats off to it: the tombstone is surrounded by scaffolding, on which it is necessary to climb and climb down again.
"The treacher should be meticulous, patient, and undemanding to the working environment," she said.
In Frýdlant, this is far from the first of its restoration work.
Thanks to it, for example, the stone elements of the facade in the rear wing of the Frýdlant town hall were restored, it also restored the statues of St Mary Magdalena in Zátiší, St John of Nepomucky in Frýdlant, Piet in Frýdlant's Okružní Street, the Marian Column in Frýdlant or atplants in the facade of the spa in Nové Město pod Smrkem.
The restoration of the tombstone of Melchior, Christopher and Katerin of Rederne began in Frýdlant in 2011.
Now the surface of the stone elements is cleaned by the deposits of impurities and crusts, the loose stone parts are secured against the fall and shift; either they will be anchored to the wall or to each other.
They are also expected to be treated and preserved of the surface.
The inscriptions on the tomb will be gilded again.
"Then it will start with the gilding of the inscriptions on the marble slam gold with pure slice gold," said the official of the State Monument Care of the Municipal Office in Frýdlant, Věra Sobotová.
There are no records from the past about the tombstone going through any repairs.
On closer inspection, they take the holes drilled in the marble columns.
They are hundreds of years old and are the remains of the tombstone for the decoration.
It was richly decorated, unfortunately after the raid by the Swedes during the Thirty Years' War everything disappeared.
They literally cut the tombstone, Sobotová noted.
In the Church of the Finding of the Holy Cross, the restorers are at home with a slight exaggeration.
After the flood in 2010, it was necessary to fix the tombstones that were submerged, the baptismal baptismal, the mousseps in the tomb and now the tombstone were restored.
"We would like to get into the stained glass in the future as well," Sobotová revealed.
The church is otherwise in very good condition, we put money into maintenance and repairs every year.
Restoration work on the restoration of the rednome tombstone will cost a total of CZK 128,000.
They will be covered by subsidies, the city will not deposit any of its money into this part of the renewal.
One hundred thousand crowns will go from the winnings in the regional round of the Historic City of the Year 2015 competition, the remaining 28 thousand crowns is the contribution of the Ministry of Culture, clarified the mayor of Frýdlant Dan Ramzer.
The release of the winnings to restore the tombstone was decided by the council.
Experts' views on future developments in selected foreign markets tracked through indexes and comparison with the Czech capital market (PX) at a one-month and a half-year horizon.
The markets are dominated by low volatility and growth.
Who would have thought that earlier in the year?
The US S&P500 index, which went through a 12% correction in February, is now at a new historic high and has already scored 7 percent since the start of the year.
This reaffirms the iron rule that traders should never go against the interest of central banks, which in the end have always achieved their own.
In a situation where US stocks are at an all-time high, the volatility that is currently at the lowest rate since 2014, when markets rose contentedly and without fear thanks to the U.S. central bank's quantitative easing, and when, like today, the volatility index (VIX) remained stable below the 12 percent mark.
And he's not.
Although the Fed continues to prepare markets for a gradual rise in interest rates, quantitative easing in both Europe and Japan is in full swing, and last week the Bank of England has also lent a hand to the work, buying £70 billion of bonds in the next six months.
The new wave of quantitative easing is therefore pushing already so low yields even lower and contributes to an almost complete elimination of risk and fear of the future.
How long will this condition last?
That, of course, is a million-dollar question.
But there are no risks in sight at the moment, the world economy is undergoing almost constant growth without major fluctuations, the situation in the commodity market and in China is stabilising, and Brexit is basically no longer a topic, so we should not be too surprised if US equities continued to hold out in a similarly calm regime.
Too bad Juncker's not studying Klaus!
I am very pleased that my friend Michel Barnier has accepted this important and challenging task.
I wanted an experienced politician for this difficult work, said the head of the European Commission, Juncker, when the French politician (really experienced, as he has been proliferating through so many diverse transnational political functions that we would find a better example of the so-called European elite, we would find it difficult to find) the terms of the European Commission for the terms of the European Commission to leave the EU.
Juncker's selection has blown out indications of hopes that it is in the EU's grave interest to look for forms of future friendly coexistence with Britain.
However, most of the British media took the name Barnier as the Juncker War Act.
Barnier is a European rock-solid federalist.
He hates Great Britain.
As the European Commissioner for the Internal Market (2009 - 2014), he was in charge of the reform of European banking law.
He took it as he could handle it: a hardened enemy of the Anglo-Saxon concept of the free market and the model of capitalism.
Proponents of multilateral regulations co-authored the concept of the so-called Banking Union, and he pushed for a grudge against everything that comes from the City's London-based financial centre legislation through exorbitantly tough regulations by financial sector and services.
So this Michel Barnier, the representative of Paris in the dispute with London, will be a tough, adamant and, apparently, unscrupulous negotiator.
That's probably not good news.
In this context, how not to remember the calm and friendly division of the Czechoslovak federation, to which the balance sheet, the overview and capacity for the empathy of Prime Minister Václav Klaus contributed so much.
That is why today, Czechs and Slovaks can be the closest friends and allies.
It is a pity that Juncker did not learn from Václav Klaus - at least in this one.
It would be for everyone's sake!
Earthquakes around Putin?
The ruler of the Kremlin has dismissed his loved one Ivanov.
Russian President Vladimir Putin fired Sergei Ivanov from the presidential office's post on Friday.
His place will be taken by Anton Vajno.
This was reported by Russian media, citing a report by the Kremlin Press Service.
Meanwhile, Putin hinted that Ivanov was being released at his own request.
At a meeting broadcast on Rossiya 24, the president said he was reaching out to Ivan's wishes on the stand for taking office that he wanted to be head of the presidential office for a maximum of four years.
At the same time, he announced that Ivanov would be his special representative for ecology and transport.
The report on the replacement at the head of the president's administration, now led by Ivanov's previous representative, Vajno, is considered rather surprising.
Ivanov, who is 63, is described as one of Putin's closest associates.
For example, this former KGB officer has held the positions of Defence Minister and Deputy Prime Minister in the past.
He will now leave the chair of a member of the president's security council.
But in a meeting with Putin, Ivanov said that he was actually a record-breaking length of time at the head of the head of the state's administration.
He lasted four years and eight months.
In this context, he recalled that in the 25 years since its establishment, 11 people have already taken the turn of this post.
Neither Kvitova nor the debs Strýcová and Šafářová will play in the final.
So far, neither of Friday's tennis matches has been converted into the final appearance.
Petra Kvitova was the first to lose her fight, succumbing to Monica Puig's Puerto Rican's surprise in sets of 4:4, 6:1 and 3-6.
Kvitova was followed by Czech decathlete Šafářivá with Strýcová.
The Williams sisters were reaching for the win in the first set, but they missed two set points and the Russian eventually captured the set in the shortened game.
They lost the second set by a 4-6 margin.
The semi-final success rate in the morning programme in Rio was recorded by Czech rowing: the skater Ondřej Synek won his semi-final with a shot, beating second-placed Damira Martin from Croatia, despite the slowdown at the end.
Good today, the conditions were great, the wind has calmed down.
I tried to save as much as I could, Sonny said.
It was his rivals, unlike him, who had to fight for the advance.
So it took some of their strength away, that would make it easier tomorrow.
But I'm not saying it will be easy, it's just playing into my hands, said the rower of Prague's Dukla.
Mirka Topinková-Kpnapková, however, did not follow in Snyka's footsteps.
The 35-year-old rower placed fourth in today's semi-final in her run and will start in the B final and a battle for 7th to 12th place on Saturday.
Gold from London is not so defended.
I didn't make the final at the Olympics for the first time.
I'm a little bit sorry, but on the other hand I did a quality race and I gave it everything I could.
The opponents were simply better, with Topinková Knapková bowing down.
She fought to the end and believed that she would make it to the top six at her fourth games.
She gave up the fight just before the finish.
I knew the girls were even, that anyone could come out of that field.
I was surprised by the Chinese woman for having such a finish.
And I thought I could advance to the final through the Austrian.
Unfortunately, she was the race of her life today, she said the 2011 world champion.
Far beyond the final gates in Rio, young striker Filip Nepejchal remained, who failed to make his way out of qualifying for the second time, this time a small-caliber-left in the lie.
In it, Nepejchal took 33rd place.
Qualifying was best for the Russians.
Sergei Kamensky advanced from the top spot with 629 points, while Kirill Grigoryjan (628.9) came from the second.
Nepejk's shot was worth 620.5 points.
Athletes also spoke in the Rio programme for the first time, among them Czech seven-time women's seven-goal players Kateřina Cachová and Eliška Klučinová.
Cach is ranked 11th after the second event of the Olympic competition, with Czech record holder Eliška Klučinová 22nd.
Leads Britain's Katarina Johnson-Thompson, who jumped to a height of 198 centimetres as well as the all-time second-placed Belgian, Nafissatou Thiam.
Both took care of the historically best high-end performance in the seven-race game.
They tried to jump in 201 centimeters, but failed.
German, Russian, who's worse?
Leaving aside the absurdity of the question so asked: German society has undergone deep self-reflection, while Russian society has not.
In both of the great Eurasian nations, dictators were present in the 20th century, and regimes that were inhuman, brutal and terrible came to power.
From 1917 to 1989, the Russian Bolsheviks contributed largely to the 94 million victims of communism, which is presented by the Black Book of Communism, whether it was daily individual repression, targeted famines, incompetent warfare, or inhumane experiments.
The Nazis wiped out around 6 million Jews in an inhuman manner, and the total victims of World War II were estimated at 60 million.
In the occupied or abandoned territories, the Germans and the Soviets carried out atrocities.
In Germany or the USSR, not only a few individuals were to blame, but a large part of the nation participated in these crimes, either actively, passively or just by cowardice or by shoving their heads in the sand.
This is not the specifics of these nations alone, we Czechs are similarly guilty.
In Germany, the imminent end of the war came denacification, the Nuremberg Tribunal.
But the most important came later.
When the children grew up, they started to ask: Daddy, Grandfather, why did you attend such atrocities?
How could you do that!
This brought about a real reflection and a healing of society.
Until recently, German elites cared mainly about the country's prosperity, the eradication of poverty, the well-being of their citizens.
Now they have other (often naively idealistic) goals, but they certainly don't care to connect it back to Alsace-Lorraine or someone - to revanch - to challenge militarily - perhaps everyone will.
After the lost Cold War in Russia, there was no major reflection.
The window of possible positive changes was finally closed at the turn of the millennium when a former KGB (sic!)Vladimir Putin came to power.
The often criminal past is celebrated in Russia today.
The policy of Putin's Russia is the revanch, the conquest of the lost territories, the humiliation of the West.
Health, the prosperity and the future of their own people is no value for the faithful.
Brace theirs, and they'll be afraid of strangers.
I still believe that this is only those decades of despotic regime that the Russians are not genetically or culturally inferior - destined for Asian (self) tyranny.
Who is benefiting from the rise in tensions around Crimea?
The Ukrainian army.
In recent days and hours, the situation on the Ukrainian-Russian border in the Crimea region has deteriorated.
Who is benefiting from the growth of tension?
After a prolonged period of relative calm, relations between Ukraine and Russia were again in a further deterioration.
The pretext of the Ukrainian side was the Crimea peninsula, which was annexed to Russia more than 2 years ago and is part of its territory.
Of course, the reports from both rival parties contradict each other and it is difficult to independently verify them independently, so do we just have the opportunity to think about the old familiar question to whom it benefits?
According to reports from Moscow, there have been terrorist attacks on Crimea from the Ukrainian side, which Ukraine understandably rejects and, on the contrary, accuses the Kremlin of provoking.
For information about the arrest of Ukrainian Special Forces members on the territory of Russia, a known response from the case of the pilot Savchenko was reportedly abducted on the territory of Russia.
If we were to accept the Ukrainian version, in what way would Russia benefit from a deterioration in the situation around Crimea?
The simple answer is: in nothing.
The escalation of tensions around Crimea can only be damaged by Russia, mainly from the West in the form of further tightening of sanctions and the intensification of the anti-Russian campaign.
In the last year, there has been a retreat of attention to the situation in Ukraine against the backdrop of the immigration crisis in Europe.
The Ukrainian leadership has already lost credit to its residents when President Poroshenko's current support is around 15%.
Ukraine's economy would have long since gone bankrupt if it were not for the EU's generous financial injections and, most importantly, the IMF.
In this situation, the Ukrainian regime needs once again to force its attention to its country in order to justify its further requests for financial assistance and to try to improve its reputation in front of voters in its own country.
Once again, President Poroshenko and other members of the leadership of the power forces want to prove themselves to be strong men who are not afraid to stand up to the great Russia as well.
It is to be hoped that all those who are attempting to spark an open conflict between Ukraine and Russia will eventually realize their enormous responsibility for the lives of not only the soldiers, but of all the ordinary people on both rival sides and will stop their hostile actions in time.
Bulgaria shows inflation for the first time in eight months
According to national statistics, the monthly inflation rate in Bulgaria reached 1% in July.
This is the highest in several years (as of June 2012) and the first non-zero value since October last year, when a positive inflation rate of 0.2% was published.
The annual average inflation rate, as measured by the CPI index, over the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016) was -0.8% compared to the previous period of 12 months (Adund August 2014-2015).
The consumer price index in July 2016 was 101.0%, i.0%, i.e. 1.0% of the monthly inflation.
The inflation rate since the beginning of the year (July 2016 compared to December 2015) was -0.2% and the annual inflation rate in July 2016 was -0.2% compared to July 2015.
Compared to the previous month, a rise in the travel of the following groups of consumer goods was recorded in July 2016: food and soft drinks (1.7%), transport (1.8%), culture and recreation (6.3%), restaurants and hotels (1.2%), other goods and services (0.3%).
The price falls in clothing and footwear (2.2%), furniture, household goods and routine maintenance (0.5%), health (0.1%).
At the same level as the previous month, prices for alcoholic beverages and tobacco products, housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, communications and education remained at the same level.
The US Secret Service is said to have been following the hacking of the Russians for a year.
Information about the Russian attacks became public last month when the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) announced it was looking into an attack on the servers of the party's headquarters of the Democrats.
However, no official report is mentioned in Russia's involvement in the attack.
Moscow denied involvement in the attack.
The news of the surveillance of the alleged Russian attack was top secret because its disclosure would reveal that the U.S. Secret Service is monitoring the hacking attack and could also be detected by how they do it and what sources they use.
The offensive action is said to have involved two Russian intelligence services.
New Counsella for Cybersecurity Advisory Council
The material on the follow-up of the Russian track was encoded and only a small group of experts had access to it, Reuters wrote.
Of the public figures, only a small group of eight Congressional leaders, called the US GU, an eight-glay, was informed.
It is made up of the heads of both chambers, Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan, the Democrats' Democrats in both chambers, Nancy Pelosi, and Harry Reid, and four members of the congressional conscription and security committees.
The incumbent Democratic Party leader, Donna Brazile, announced on Thursday that she was creating a cybersecurity advisory board to "prevent future attacks and ensure the first-class protection of the Democratic Party's servers."
There was a dangerous parasite in the smoked salmon of Alberto.
The chain apologized.
Based on the consumer's suggestion of health problems after eating food Salmon wild smoked - bits 100g, expiration date 22.11.2016, the Prague health officials carried out a check at the Albert stores on Wenceslas Square and the Bridge.
The inspection found that batch L23012562/T4 with a consumption date 22.11.2016, which was pointed out by the customer, is no longer available and therefore the product of the same batch with the date of consumption 11.12.2016.
Laboratory examination confirmed the presence of Anisakis spp. Anisakis simplex.
It is a parasitic worm of the digestive tract of the marine mammals.
This is a danger to humans - larvae in the body cavity or muscle of the fish are a strong allergen and human-gained living larvae can penetrate through the stomach wall into the internal organs, Šticha said.
We are very much to apologize to our customers for the problems with this branded product.
We immediately withdrew the batch from sale and, as a precaution, we also downloaded all other bits of this item.
The misconduct occurred on the part of the supplier we are in the negotiations with, and at the same time we had this product tested by ourselves, Alberto spokesperson Barbora Vanko told News.
If the customer has bought this product, they can return it at any of the chain's shops and get the money back.
The larvae will be destroyed by frost and sufficient heat treatment
The seller was Nekton - the Rope.
The occurrence of the dangerous product was reported by the hygienists to the Prague and Central Bohemian Veterinary Administration.
According to the server, the unpaidpotravin.cz people after ingested the parasite can get sick with anisakiosis, which manifests itself in violent abdominal pain, vomiting and nausea, or the disease can be done ash-free, the Czech Press Agency reported.
The symptoms will be given an hour to two weeks after eating of an undercooked infected fish.
Three weeks after the disease, the larvae usually spontaneously abandons the digestive tract.
Adult worms and larvae are sensitive to both higher and low temperatures, so they are killed either with sufficient heat treatment of fish meat or when frozen.
Veterinarians have also currently examined the salmon at the recipient of imported goods in the Central Bohemian Region.
Three of the five samples examined had the parasite in them.
The shipment with 1700 products came to the Czech Republic in early April, according to the State Veterinary Administration (JRC).
Explanted, in the vast majority of the Ahold chain, to date there have been 919 packs.
The unsold stock of the product is currently being withdrawn from the stores, SVS spokesperson Petr Pejchal told the Czech Press Agency on Friday.
Veterinarians immediately after the discovery of the positive samples banned the sending of other products from the warehouse.
A 17-year-old British woman wanted to flee Raqqa, killed by a Russian raid.
After the initial enthusiasm and quick marriage to the jihadist, who was soon killed, there was a sobering sober.
The expected paradise of the Caliphate was transformed for British girls into hell on earth from which there was no escape.
The girl was in contact with her sister, Halima, according to relatives.
She made a call to Britain repeatedly and confided that she wanted to go back home.
Leaving the Islamic State is like trying to escape from Alcatraz.
They are ordered to shoot without thinking, the Telegraph quotes the lawyer for the late girl's family, Tasnim Akunjee, as saying.
The last tracks led to Raqqa, from there the girl heard from for the last time.
After that, all that came was the news of her death, which could not be verified.
The family communicated with her from an apartment in east London.
Together they discussed how she could get out of Raqqa and cross the Turkish border.
There, they hoped to meet the former student again.
But Kadiza was probably killed before she could escape, because the house she was lingering in raid was flattoned in May, the British ITV News reported.
The television added that the bomb was apparently dropped by a Russian plane that attacked an IS stronghold in Syria.
You'd take the blue from the sky just to get your child out of the dangerous area, said Tasnim Akunjee, the family's lawyer.
In the week (Kadiza) thinking about fleeing Islamic State territory, an Austrian woman was caught trying to escape and, according to available information, she was publicly beaten to death.
I think she interpreted it (Kadiza) as a warning and decided not to take any risks, she says, according to the BBC Akunjee.
The family would do anything.
Kadiza Sutlana, along with her 15-year-old school friends Shamima Begum and Amira Abas, set off on the road to the 17th. February last year.
At home, all they said was that they were going out.
But they headed to Gatwick Airport and from there through Turkey to IS-controlled territory.
According to the lawyer, the girl's family did everything in her power to get Kadiza back.
You'd take the blue from the sky just to get your child out of the dangerous area and this family did all the best they could, they'd tensed to get your daughter home.
But it was not possible without risking them being caught themselves, the lawyer added.
The only positive, he says, is that the fate of Kadiza can serve as a deterrent to other girls or even boys who are fooled by Islamist propaganda.
"There are many cases of people going there, realizing how things are, they understood how different it is from the Islamic State's propaganda, and they wanted to return," Akunjee said.
The fate of Kadiza's classmates is unknown.
But as they have also fallen silent, their families must accept that they are most likely dead.
Go to jail for money.
In Scotland, you can go to prison without committing a crime.
For many centuries, the community of Inveraray was the county centre and the residence of the Duke of Argyl.
Since the mid-18th century, courts have been held at the town hall, and the basement under the hall has served as a local prison.
The conditions in which the convicts dwelt were plaintive, and many prisoners tried to escape.
A lot of them and successfully.
That's why the city's representatives decided to move the prison premises to a new location.
The new building was completed in 1848 and was much more welcoming to the prisoners, with heating and gas lighting.
Either way, it was not in operation for a long time, its closure was already closed at the end of August 1889 as the smaller correctional facilities were costly for operation and not paying much.
The stories of the convicts and the hunt for the ghosts.
The prison opened to the public a century later, visitors can compare the old building with the new one to see for themselves how the different conditions prevailed.
The guides in period costumes enhance the authentic experience.
There is also an appetite room in which visitors can learn what forms of punishment the criminals were applied to criminals, whether it was breaking the fingers or burning the marks on the body.
As part of the tour, tourists can be confined to one of the cells, mostly for a souvenir photo, or to create the feeling that the prisoners are experiencing behind bars.
In addition, the Inveraray prison is one of Scotland's most famous locations, where it is supposedly haunted.
Several groups of paranormal hunters have already set out there, and to this day the museum allows people to come and hunt for some spirits.
Such a night, however, will cost £300, which translates into roughly £9,500.
In addition to this popular tourist attraction, the municipalities are also attracted to great food, the surrounding panoramas and history.
The 'Animé' effect on Snapchat is criticised as an Asian caricature
According to Snapchat, this filter is inspired by the animes, but some observers say it is racially insensitive.
Every day, the Snapchat app allows about 150 million users to change reality and play with identities in ways that border on absurdity.
You can make yourself into a pineapple, a dog or a character that seems to have stepped out of Roy Lichtenstein's image.
Filters are simple tools that distort reality and generate more than 30 million improved selfies every day.
Any error will be made available immediately.
Snapchat filters have come in for criticism in the past, accusing the app promoting blackfacing or supporting white shades of skin as an ideal of beauty.
So when she offered users a filter this week that gave the users their angled eyes, their teeth distorted and inflated faces, some critics called it a racist caricature of Asians - "yellowface."
And they asked whether these repeated contentious issues were pointing to a larger problem for society - the diversity problem.
On Wednesday, Verge and Motherboard wrote about it, and the novelty and indignation quickly spread, and Snapchat said the next day that he had rescinded the job.
The company offered an explanation: The filter was intended as a show of bills to the characters of the animated ones, not as a caricature of Asians.
But to the observers who witnessed racism, the filter reminded the painful stereotypes of action.
The others, without wrapper, declined to compare with the animes.
Grace Sparapani, an American art student from Korea whose tweet about the photos was widely shared, said in an email that the filter was "at least, and embarrassing."
She added that "it is hard to argue against comparing the obvious Asian cartoon and filter effects.
It turns out that the filter is not only about the yellow face (yellowface), but that the yellow face is dragged into the contemptuous extreme.
Snapchat is not the only company to cross these cultural limits.
American culture seems to have an endless struggle for diversity and inclusion, from the seating rooms in corporations to Holywood, and the facilities we all carry in our hands.
And a huge number of young people on Snapchat - who are more racially diversified than their older partners - may mean that even greater sensitivity can be expected.
"When a Snapchat filter creates a picture that's offensive to some users," the 25-year-old Katie Zhu said in an interview on Thursday, "it's just very hard to go unnoticed today, as it used to be."
Katie Zhu, the product manager and designer who works for Medium, decided on Thursday to delete her Snapchat account and invited others to do the same.
In an article for Medium and in an interview over the phone, she said she believed that racially motivated problems reflected the lack of diversity in the recruitment of workers in Snapchat.
Katie Zhu criticized the company's predominantly white, totally male management, and ended the article with a hash tag: #DeleSnapchat.
"It's either that they don't have any diversity among the employees and colorful people at the moment these things are decided," said Zhu, who is of Sino-American origin, "or colored people work there, but not in positions to feel safe or comfortable to speak."
Other observers share her view - a complaint that Snapchat left largely unanswered.
The company does not disclose the numbers regarding the diversity of its employees, saying it has the status of a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to talk about the racial origin of its employees, but according to a spokesman, the company recently hired a recruitment worker to focus on the under-represented population and internal management of inclusion.
Zhu adds, "I wonder if they really need more such users who can say that it is not okay," with the fact that they will keep their account cancelled.
Army officers misspelled intelligence on IS, says parliamentary committee
The parliamentary committee said in a report issued Thursday that officers from the central headquarters of the United States were changing intelligence reports to portray the more optimistic picture of the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and in Syria than the events provided from the country.
According to a preliminary report by a working group compiled by the Republican chairman of the Committee on the Armed Forces, the Intelligence Committee and the Defense Sub-Competition, "distinctive discontent" among Central Intelligence Agency analysts were found to have their assessments made by the military's assessment of US efforts to defeat the Islamic State.
The Central Command, known as the CentCom, is an army central in Tampa, Florida, overseeing U.S. military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
The press release on the report reads: "The intelligence outputs approved by Centcom's senior officers usually offered a more positive picture of the US counter-terrorism efforts than those confirmed by the facts on the ground and were consistently more positive than those obtained from other parts of the intelligence community."
"What happened on the Centcom is unacceptable - our fighters are harmed when a flawed analysis is presented to the superior policymakers," said Ken Calvert, a congressman and Republican from California.
The failure of Centcom's leadership goes back to the top of the organization.
The 10-page report detail the central staff's persistent problems in describing and analysing US efforts to train the Iranian forces in 2014.
While there is no decisive evidence that the heads of the Obama administration have ordered the reports to be amended, the report states that the analysts were under the impression that they were under pressure from the Centcom leaders to present a more optimistic view of the dangers posed by the Islamic State, or IS.
"In the first half of 2015, there were many press releases from the Central Staff, statements and congressional statements considerably more positive than what the events were," the report says.
For example, a Centcom official has publicly stated that a major military attack to take over Mosul could begin as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city, remains under Islamic State control.
"This is very clear after months of investigation," Representative Mike Pompeo, a representative of the Republican Party from Kansas, said in a statement.
From mid-2014, to mid-2015, the highest-ranking US Central Intelligence Service Intelligence Service Employees manipulated the outputs of the staff's intelligence services in order to downplay the IS dangers in Iraq.
Republicans formed a task force after learning about analysts' concerns that intelligence information related to the Islamic State was being manipulated.
The report released on Thursday must be followed by a more detailed examination.
There is yet another investigation conducted by the General Inspector General of the Ministry of Defence in the Centcom's intelligence services.
Democratic members of the Intelligence Committee released their own findings on Thursday, which corresponded to some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force's.
"Between 2014 and 2015 Centcom created a very narrow process to compile the evaluation of information on IS and the Iraqi security forces," representative Adam B. Schiff, the Committee president and the representative of the Democrats.
In Adam Schiff's words, the process "managed to distorting the outputs of intelligence services," it damaged morale among analysts and "insufficiently taken into account of dissenting views."
However, Schiff and the Democrats claim that they have found no evidence that the White House is trying to press Centcom analysts to adjust their findings to "a draft or political situation."
Preliminary results of the parliamentary inquiry were published in the Daily Beast on Tuesday.
Last August, the New York Times reported on an ongoing investigation by the Pentagon inspector general that was opened following complaints from Centcom analysts.
Lieutenant Commander Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, said in a statement that the Defense Department would not comment on the parliamentary report as the Inspector General's investigation is still ongoing.
But he said that "experts sometimes disagree on the interpretation of comprehensive data, and that the intelligence community and the Ministry of Defence welcome a healthy dialogue on these crucial national security issues."
The investigation has repercussions beyond the question of whether the US bombing led by the bombing in Iraq and Syria is successful (a statement that now declares a growing number of defense officials).
However, last year's accusations have raised question marks about the extent to which President Obama can rely on the central staff to honestly assess military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, and other crisis sites.
Criticism of intelligence about the Islamic State has been aloof for more than a decade of the years since Centcom intelligence analyst Gregory Hooker wrote a research work stating that President George W. Bush - despite the objections of many analysts - defended a small unit in Iraq and devoted little time to reflecting on what would be followed by the 2003 invasion.
Hooker also played a key role in opposing the Islamic State's intelligence services.
Last year, authorities announced that the Hooker team had concluded that, despite public statements to the contrary, aerial strikes conducted against the Islamic State refineries did not significantly weaken the financial resources of the terrorist group because the group had built temporary refineries and sold oil on the black market.
The Times reported in September that the findings had not been made outside the central staff.
Centcom commander, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was then criticized for the past year after many lawmakers found the Senate's testimony to an over-positive assessment of the war.
General Austin resigned in April and was replaced by a gene at Centcom. Joseph L. The boiler.
The U.S. won the field hockey in the fourth game in a row, so the deciding game will be played today in the UK team
Katie Bamo scored three goals in the game against Japan, which ended in a 6-1 victory, and scored the first two goals of the game for the American women's men's hockey team on Thursday.
Five tackles in two matches is a success to remember, but Bamova (27) said she was not sure if she ever did anything like that.
"I have no idea," she said.
I'm not one of those who write down their goalposts.
But he knows this: The American women's tournament in the Olympic tournament are 4-0 at the top of the group with the UK, who remained undefeated on Thursday after Japan's 2-0 defeat.
The UK and the United States will face the final match of the first round on Saturday.
Both teams qualified for the quarter-finals and the match will determine which of the six-team group will finish in first place and who will finish in second place.
The first-place team will avoid the strong Danes, who are at the top of the second group, a little longer.
However Saturday's game ends, the Americans caused a stir here with their surprise ride, four years after they finished among the 12 teams at the London Games.
There was Bam on that team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and first picked up a hockey stick for field hockey when she was 3 years old (her older twins played in Drexel) and entered the national team when she was 16 and became his youngest player ever.
The 2008 Olympics eluded her because she did not make it to the final roster.
Then came 2012, when neither she nor the members of her team did very well.
The next year, the England's Craig Parnham was appointed as coach and things began to change.
"Cultural change, mental change, physical change," Bam said.
We didn't have the pace of our work to be in London today.
We made a complete turnaround.
Bam started in the first half on Thursday night with a beck token with a beck toll from close range.
India entered the match without winning the tournament, but the team proved surprisingly tough and kept the scoreboard 1-0 until the end of the third quarter when Bam took the opportunity.
She escaped down the left side of the field, then walked through to the centre and scored the ball in the goal to take the Americans ahead 2-0.
Melissa Gonzalez added the final goal in the middle of the fourth quarter.
The elimination of the American goaltender, Jackie Briggs, who helped one goal in each of the three victories, was the first ever in the tournament.
He's in excellent shape.
Just like Bam.
"We're in a good place now," Parnham said, but how good it is will depend on the outcome of Saturday's game.
Zen trampolines in the middle of the Olympic rampage
It doesn't matter where you are, it doesn't matter what time it is - is the Olympics.
The events in Rio de Janeiro give you a persistent, indescribable and biased rotation of competition and effort.
It is how the Olympic torch itself would be a hot relay stake, passed from a chamander to a swimmer, a gymnast and a triathlete.
You can't turn on the TV, read the newspapers or listen to your neighbor's interview in the coffee shop in the queue without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the animosity between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there's Logan Dooley.
Dooley, the upcoming darling of women with dimples in her face, is at the Olympics for the first time, and could also be among those whose names will be heard in prime-time homes between advertising and spots of sponsors if he were a swimmer, gymnast or even a swordsman.
But Dooley (28) of Lake Forest, California, is vying for Olympic gold in the trampoline jumping.
The Olympic Fire doesn't shine at all competitions the same way.
Farther from the center, a little in the shade are sports that aren't universally recognized: air-lift gunfire, archery, badminton, taekvondo.
We will always have success in the classic swimming style - and it will probably rule for a long time.
But if I may name my extraordinary favourite, let me draw my attention to the inconspicuous charm of the trampoline.
Although the trampoline jumping has been an Olympic sport since they were first shown at the Sydney Games in 2000, the sport remains almost unnoticed after 16 years of interventions - many of the people I have questioned have not even known it's an Olympic sport.
It may be regional indifference.
The USA has never won a medal in trampoline jumping, and until 2012, none of the athletes made it to the finals.
The awards in the men's category are usually shared between China and Russia and in the women's category between China and Canada.
This year, the gold medals from London will be huging Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan of Canada.
But the jumps on the trampoline have yet another unlucky one, partly because the uninitiated's ear is more likely to be suited to the clown's university than the Olympics.
I must confess that I am not an expert, but merely an enthusiast watching from the country.
It has comical potential - comic-book vibration of endless reflection - but also the grace of gymnastics and diving, the two sports it combines in itself.
The word ‘trampoline’ is derived from the Spanish ‘el trampolín’, which means "jumper record."
The inspiring champions jump on a huge trampoline that shoots them up to a height of almost 10 meters and perform kits with several elements (salta, screws and a combination) before they finally land on their feet again.
According to the official Olympic programme, they are evaluated according to the design, difficulty and "air-air-air dwellings."
In Rio, there will be a competition of 32 athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women.
The usual trajectory of the Olympic track is forward.
The gold medalists must go further, faster and even higher, sometimes to the end, back and forth, up and down.
He tries to catch up not only with the finish line or the starting wall, but, as television news reports, another imaginary line: a world or Olympic record.
This unanimous endeavor is classy, admirable, a little fanatical - and sufficient to bring the audience to tears.
But I think it's also a bit exhausting to watch the Olympics.
Jumping on the trampoline brings relief in this respect.
The athlete's runway on the trampoline is upwards.
The point is not to move forward.
He or she bounces as if they were in a state of weightlessness like astronauts, flying up, then down, then back to the effortless.
Without competition and, of course, neither the difficulty can be done, but for the duration of the set-up there is no furious struggle to achieve the goal, no distance awards, but only a perfect, graceful spring of time and gravity.
This is the closest one, when the Olympics and zen will come closer.
The women's qualification and final takes place on Friday afternoon, at 1 p.m. Eastern time, and the men's competition on Saturday at the same time.
NBC will broadcast the finale as part of the afternoon block, which starts both days at 2 p.m.
In the midst of the Olympic madness, they promise peaceful, pleasant moments that you will probably miss through the other fights.
And if the only thing to achieve is to get to the point of attorneys for the love-minded and materialization - as the US Gymnastics recently proposed, according to the Wall Street Journal - then Logan Dooley is merely waiting for his new fans to gasp.
"Protesting Generations" in Ethiopia, a longtime US ally
Violent protests in Ethiopia
Demonstrators demanding political changes in Ethiopia have encountered violent opposition from the government.
Witnesses say many protesters were shot dead during clashes with police.
Is there a war in Ethiopia?
In the past decade, it has been one of the most stable nations in Africa, a solid Western alliance with a fast-growing economy.
But over the past few months, the country has been engulfed in anti-government unrest, which is spreading to more and more areas.
In the last week alone, thousands of people have taken to the streets demanding major political changes.
According to human rights organizations, the government's response was ruthless.
Witnesses say officers shot dead and killed crowds of unarmed protesters.
The circulating videos of the protests, which probably come from the end of last year or the beginning of this year, are captured by members of the security forces beating young people with sticks after being forced to stand against the wall on their hands.
The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights is now calling for a thorough investigation.
"It has always been difficult to keep this country together and taking a step forward will be even harder," said Rashid Abdi, the Horn of Africa project's head for the International Crisis Group.
Ethiopia is the second most populous nation in Africa after Nigeria, and its stability is supported by the West.
U.S. military and intelligence services are working closely with the Ethiopians to remove the dangers of a terrorist attack in the area, especially in Somalia, and few of African countries, if any, receive such assistance from the West.
Ethiopia's economy was at an impressive pace.
Its infrastructure has improved in a major way - there is even a new suburban train in the capital, Addis Ababa.
And the streets of the city are typically quiet, safe and clean.
But Ethiopia is hardly called a model of democracy - the human rights organization is, incessantly, referring to government repression - the opposition in the country has been suppressed, dissidents effectively silenced.
Many have been expelled, imprisoned, killed or driven far into the desert.
But that may change.
"When you choke people and they have no choice but to protest, there will be a break," said Seyoum Teshome, who lectures at the University of Central Ethiopia.
He protests all the youth.
He's protesting a generation.
There are many complaints, and they relate to everything from land disputes to absolute control of the power of the ruling coalition.
After last year's election, which was widely criticised, the ruling party and its allies won the last seat held by the opposition and now controls 100 percent in parliament.
At the same time, pressure is mounting at the border with Eritrea. The conflict along this inaccurately marked, disputed border claimed hundreds of lives in June.
Anyith fears that the separatist groups that have been more or less suppressed over the past few years, such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, may try to exploit the may exploit the may confuse the confusion and rearm.
There are several factors explaining why, now, after years of smolt-out under the surface, these bitter feelings have flared up again.
The first is seemingly harmless: smartphones.
Many Ethiopians can only communicate through social networks for the last few years, when cheaper smartphones have become commonly available and the provision of internet services has improved.
And even if the government bans access to Facebook or Twitter, as is usually the case primarily during protests, many people can still communicate through internet proxies that hide the location of these people.
Several young Ethiopians spoke about how they were gathering for the protests.
There is also greater solidarity between the Oromy and the Amhary, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia.
The Oroms and the Amhhars are not natural allies.
For years, the Amhhars, mostly from the Christian Hills of Ethiopia, excelled in politics and commerce, using the Oromy, many of whom are Muslim and living in the lowlands.
But that's changing, too.
"We are on our way to a unified leadership," said Mulatu Gemechu, the leader of the Orom.
The biggest protests were in the areas inhabited by Amhara and Oromy.
Many Amhars and Oroms believe that Ethiopia is wrongly dominated by members of the Tigrai ethnic group, which make up around 6 percent of the population and controls the military, intelligence, trade and politics.
The third reason for the riots is the death of Meles Zenawi.
Zenawi, the former rebel leader, was Ethiopian prime minister for 17 years until his death in 2012 when he succumbed to an unsafe.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could see around the corner.
Analysts say he was particularly masterfully able to detect initial signals of discontent and used emissaries to process opponents and get his side.
"The current regime lacks basic knowledge," Abdi, the conflict analyst, said.
The new Prime Minister of Ethiopia, Hailemariam Desalegn, was pulled out of relative unknowns to replace Zenawi.
Unlike Zenawi, who came from the Tigrai region of northern Ethiopia, Hailemariam comes from the south.
Analysts say he has no confidence in the Tigrejci-controlled security services.
Many fear that the result will be a further shedding of blood.
The last time Ethiopia experienced such unrest was in 2005 after thousands of people protesting what analysts described as an election that the government screwed up and then stolen.
There was a crackdown, during which many protesters were killed - albeit less than in the past few months - and this riot period passed relatively quickly.
Development experts praised Ethiopia's leaders for visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new suburban train and measurable progress in the fight against poverty.
However, it is quite clear that the gradual rise in controversy within the Ethiopian government has not been stopped.
And there is dangerous ethnic formation.
Last month, protesters in the amg-based city of Gondar attacked Tigrejci-owned business firms, and a social media grudge against Tigres are becoming more common.
Analysts say it puts the protests in the uncomfortable situation of the US and other Western allies.
The US government is using Ethiopia as a base for drone overdoses over neighboring Somalia, although it recently declared that the base was closed.
While the West clearly wants to support democracy, so at the same time it does not want its ally to break up in an already volatile area.
"It's," Abdi said, "is a very sharp edge of blade."
Donald Trump explains his statement about Obama and IS funding as a "sarcasm"
Donald J. Trump tried on Friday to downplay the latest controversy flooding his campaign by saying he didn't mean it when he insisted several times this week that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the "founders" of the Islamic State terrorist group.
The explanation raised new questions about the Republican presidential nominee's ability to speak clearly to the US public.
He also puts his supporters in an awkward position, who defended him hard in the tumultuous times and must explain that he may not have been serious about his remarks.
Following this motion at a meeting on Wednesday night, Trump confirmed the statement on Thursday, insisting in interviews that he had indeed not intended to say that the President and H. Clinton created the IS.
However, in a Twitter post on Friday morning, Trump said he was merely sarcastic.
The post was the opposite of the claim, just one day old, when Trump said in several interviews that he was serious about his accusation.
When conservative radio anchor Hugh Hewitt tried to help Trump's remark by commending that Obama was seeking to destroy IS, the Republican nominee did not respond to the president.
The latest storm comes when Trump attempted to focus his campaign's attention on the economy, while his preference in the polls is falling.
Trump and Clinton participated in Michigan this week in a duel on economic issues.
On Friday, Trump tried to revisit the subject.
He warned on Twitter again that Clinton's proposals were linked to a tax increase, and said that he thought her speech was boring.
Trump has used the defense with sarcasm before.
At the end of July, when he received a wave of criticism when he made the suggestion that the Russians should be hacking into Clinton's e-mails, he later explained his remark by saying, "I am, of course, sarcastic."
This approach allows Trump to push the boundaries of political statements and temper them as needed.
"I think it's his way of testing the extent to which some reports are echoed by his supporters to find out how they react, and, according to the reaction, "he gave an explanation" in one way or the other, said Ruth Sherman, the communications specialist who followed the language the two candidates used.
But I also think he is deft in his statements and knows that they are vague enough to be explained in different ways.
With the poll results in his favor continuing to decline, Trump has adopted an even more snide tone in recent days, instead of teasing things for general voters.
A new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist, published Friday, showed that Tump is well behind Clinton in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado, and very close behind her in Florida.
Trump is even attempting to avoid apologies for the provocative statements he is saying, but he often accuses his critics of misinterpretations of his words or misunderstanding his sense of humor.
But with Trump facing increased attention in the closing months of the presidential campaign, Trump's jokes have put Trump's jokes in the awkward position of his devoted supporters, who must stand up for him publicly, whichever way his remarks are provocative.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former mayor of New York City, who is one of Trump's most prominent supporters, had to defend the candidate extensively in an interview with CNN on Thursday.
"I believe that what he says is a legitimate political comment," said Giuliani when asked about the credibility of Trump's claim that Obama and Clinton had founded the Islamic State.
This is true in the sense that before Obama, IS was almost unknown, a small organization that he wrongly called a newcomer. And it happened because he withdrew his troops from Iraq.
Most ordinary Republicans are attempting to argue that the Obama administration, in which Clinton served as Secretary of State, has allowed IS to flourish and fail to manage the situation in the Middle East aggressively.
Ahead of Friday's rallies in Pennsylvania, Trump continued to crude the fire around the media for mirroring and biased to his every word.
He laughed at the "pleasement, pathetic" TV scholars who are trying to understand him and said, "They can't do it!"
Several Democrats have grinned to Trump's apology, saying it's just another piece of evidence that he's not qualified for the presidency.
The café was pushed out of the market by prices. He now returns at Greenpoint
The Verb Cafe was a shabby place in Williamsburg, where you could only pay cash, without Wi-Fi, but where the coffee was served for 15 years.
Naturally, it was forced out of the front of the house on Bedford Avenue.
Soap Cherie - a shop replaced by Verb in the summer of 2014 - sells cupcake soaps.
The locals mourned it as the last loss of the growing city.
Artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter: 'New York is a change, I know, but I still can't believe that CBGB is dead, hotel Chelsea was rented out and the shop is now a soap from the Verb.'
But if New York is a change, it's also rediscovering.
The resurrected Verb Cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of its original location.
The new Verb has wifi and receives credit cards, but some of the original employees work there and there is a similar, modest atmosphere.
Coffee is still good, too.
The manager of the new Verbo is Cisco Rodriguez, a longtime employee of the original café who is also the owner and managing director of the new post.
He started at Verb in 2001 and stayed until the end.
When one of the customers offered to pay for the move to the new job, he said he would do it with joy.
Rodriguez (36) left a lot of things as they were.
Verb still has the same bake supplier and bought the same model of the espresso machine.
He even used the lighting from the old Verbo again.
Rodriguez, however, said he also wanted to try something new.
He started using new ingredients.
The menu includes ham, egg and cheese sandwiches and toppings such as capers and fried onions.
You'll also find bowls of brown rice.
The café no longer breeds beer, but offers fresh fruit juices.
After nine months, Rodriguez noticed a steady influx of the original regulars.
"Many of the original customers also had to move out of Williamsburg for the prices," he said.
Last Sunday, one of these customers, Rebecca Oliveira, was here.
Mrs. Oliveira (34) lived in Williamsburg and went to the Verb Cafe often.
It even came when the cafe moved to Greenpoint.
She said that when Verb closed up, she stopped drinking coffee for a while.
"I found that what I like was the coffee and culture in the Verbe," she said.
Now he drinks his coffee again, but on that day she had given herself a mixed chai instead of her usual iced coffee, another novelty.
Tom Rosenthal, another longtime customer, has been a dedicated departure for the Verb since 2003.
He comes before work and always orders the same thing.
"At a quarter and eight, every day, like clockwork, I come in and they're preparing my bun with everything and butter," he said.
Photo: Rodriguez said he wanted to try something new and add new ingredients to the menu.
Mr. Rosenthal continues to order what he usually does, but occasionally he lets bacon, an egg and a ham put on his bun with everything.
Rodriguez said he was unhappy that the soap deal had taken his old job.
The truth is that the owners of Soap Cherie offered to make special soap for Verb and use the filtered coffee from the café as an ingredient.
"I think we could still use it," Rodriguez said.
The traditional Polish residents of Greenpoint also received the café well.
One of the new customers translated the offer into Polish, and Rodriguez said he wanted to find a place to display it soon to make his new neighbours feel at home.
The new place has other advantages.
The local fruit juic producer wants to bottle and sell filtered coffee.
There is a possibility for the café to be extended to the neighbouring building.
It is enough for many customers to get their old favourite back.
Joseph Whitt was a regular customer, and when the cafe closed, he said, it broke his heart.
Mr. Whitt says that when the cafe reopens, to enter and have a coffee is like coming home.
"I missed the smell," he said.
Depressing food from the time of the crisis - in the "Square Meal"
Shortly after joining the presidency in March 1933, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat in the Oval Office and had lunch.
The Eljumper president, Roosevelt, enjoyed selected dishes from 5th Avenue, such as goose jade pâté and Maryland turtled soup.
But his menu for the day was more modest: a diabolical-style egg in a rag sauce of rays, a potato puree, and a plum pudding for dessert.
"It was an act of cooking solidarity with the people who suffered," said Jane Ziegelman.
Her husband, Andrew Coe, added, "It was also a message to the Americans how to eat."
The couple, who live in Brooklyn Heights, are dedicated to gastronomic history.
Andrew Coe's latest book, "Chop Suey," was about Chinese cuisine in America, while Jane tells the life story of a residential building on the Lower East Side through food in his book "97 Orchard."
Their new joint work "A Square Meal," which will be published by Harper on Tuesday, is the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression.
They showed their own cooking solidarity and met with a reporter for dinner at the Eisenberg's sandwich shop, a small austere buffet in the Flatiron district that has been in operation since the crisis.
Jane (54) ordered cream cheese and a sandwich with chopped olives, and Andrew (57) had a turkey, a mash potato and mixed vegetables.
The reporter ordered a meatball, which the couple said was well suited to talking about food during the crisis.
"The Arabs were very popular," said Miss Ziegelman.
It was sold peanut, liver and bean meatball.
They were made out of that admixture and other cheap food that set the ingredient.
Remove the amount of peanuts you'd have to eat for dinner.
Andrew Coe grimaced.
"They'd be lying in your stomach like lead," he said.
In the years before the crisis, American cuisine, especially in rural areas, was served in the form of a buffet to eat what you eat.
The women's teams cooked for the farm workers and breakfast, lunch and dinner were served a freshly baked cake.
It was the Americans who sent food to the starving Europeans during the First World War. "A Square Meal" follows the ways in which the nation dealt with the fact that it was suddenly not a land of plenty.
"It was a time when food became a central, feared point for the American people," Coe said by explaining why he and his wife decided to write about it.
Just as feared was the new budget diet: mysterious foods were expanded, such as meatballs and dish of casters, casaders like "an amazing way to use the leftovers," Ziegelman noted, as the chefs could hide the non-aesthetic ingredients under a layer of creamy sauce.
Fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dried fruit.
The meat - the central point of American food for years - has become an economical-estedized luxury.
Strange mixtures that were to serve as a caloric and nutritional filler preferred to taste or even common sense in cooking.
During surveys for the recipe-appointed book, Miss Ziegelman prepared a period meal of baked onions filled with peanut butter.
"It wasn't a popular addition to the evening table," Andrew Coe said.
Jane Ziegelman emphasized, "It was surreal."
Peanut butter with roasted onions doesn't go together.
It was typical of a lot of home recipes.
As never before and never after, the domestic economists - among them Louise Stanley, the shrush of the federal office for the domestic economy from 1923 to 1943 - directed the country's eating habits.
They published recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, urged women to take the reins of the budget, and the bewettes, such as cream spaghetti with carrots, were converted into tasty meals.
"A Square Meal" is a celebration of historical delicacies.
In particular, desserts arose in the government's response to its hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover's pose "I'm going to eat a pie."
While publicly praising the simple iowa farmer's cuisine of his childhood, he dined as the chosen millionaire he had become.
"He liked to eat continental cuisine like fish with cucumber sauce," Andrew Coe said.
He ate in a nearly gilded room, wearing a tuxedo.
He was incredibly old-fashioned.
President Roosevelt would probably have made the same mistake if his wife, Eleanor, hadn't made him to set an example in his own stomach.
As the book tells me, Mrs. Roosevelt hired a housekeeper who was not interested in the taste. This led to the White House being "not just served almost the most buried food in all of Washington, but also in the most disheveled way."
A number of food habits from the crisis subsided as soon as the country got back on its feet.
The reference remained in our constant examination of calories and nutritional values, says Miss Ziegelman, and in the way science is applied to cooking.
The couple says that during the book's writing, they understood the eating habits of Miss Ziegelman's mother better - perhaps why she couldn't throw out the food.
"She was really afraid of wasting food," Andrew Coe said.
Ziegelman recalled, "She made the people of her sick."
There was an accident with wreaths.
When the clean tables were at Eisenberg's, she and Mr. Coe pulled out the dessert they had prepared at home: the plum dessert that President Roosevelt had eaten for lunch.
"It's called plum cream," Ziegelman said, adding that the usual trick was to give the modest recipes to elegant names.
There was no cream, just plums, some flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Each reluctantly dug a spoon into the thick brown mass.
Surprisingly, it was wrong.
Andrew added Coe, and then again.
And, like a good treasurer, he said to his wife, "It would be a little chopped-up of the walnuts."
Europeans: Migrants are going for benefits.
Most of the refugees who are rolling in for Europe come for economic reasons.
Young Russians make fun of themselves.
This is what shows look like if we made them.
A group of Russian artists calling themselves 2D Among Us make fun of their native country.
Using photoshop, he creates collages that jokingly show what it would look like if famous shows and films were made in Russia.
Gilead is entitled to reimbursement of the legal representation cost in the patent case against hepatitis C against Merck
The district court judge ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc was entitled to the reimbursement of the lawyers' fees incurred by the lawyer's trial in the C-ravening patent against the mercenary C against the drug maker of Merck & Co Inc.
In June, a conviction was overturned in June to pay Gilead for damages for breach of two Merck patents in connection with the highly successful drugs of Gilead, Sovaldi and Harvoni, after a federal judge had repeatedly found illegal conduct on the part of Merck, among other things, a lie under oath and other unethical practices.
Federal Judge Beth Labson Freeman said on Thursday that Gilead was entitled to waive the fees that arose in connection with the representation in the case.
Merck is trying to catch up with Gilead, which dominates the market for new-generation anti-lipoon C drugs that can cure more than 90 percent of patients with this liver disease.
The case dates back to 2013, when Gilead and Merck sued each other to claim to each other that they were the owner of basic laboratory research for sofosbuvir, the active ingredient of drugs from Gilead.
US-backed military forces say they gained full control of the city of Manbij
US-backed military forces gained full control of the northern city of Manbij, near the border with Turkey, after the last Islamic State fighters fled the city, a spokesman for the group said on Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) is now sweeping the city after the departure of the rest of a group of radicals hiding in the city.
The units freed over 2,000 civilians who were being held by the militants, Sharfan Darwish of the SDF alliance and the Manbij Military Council, told Reuters.
"The city is now fully under our control, but we are still searching it," he told Reuters.
The Clintons earned $10.75 million in 2015 and paid a federal tax rate of 34.2 percent
Hillary Clinton released her 2015 tax return on Friday, stating that the Democrat presidential candidate and her husband had $10.75 million in revenue in that year and paid a real tax of 34.2 percent.
The Clintons donated $1 million to charity in 2015, mostly to the Clinton Foundation. Ex-President Bill Clinton contributed a nearly $5.3 million fee to the joint coffers for lectures, and the former secretary of state admitted an income of $3 million from Simon & Schuster for her book on his time at the State Department.
The Clinton running mate, US Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia, along with his wife Anne Holton, has released 10 years' tax returns.
They paid the actual tax of 20.3 percent in 2015.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to be a model for financial transparency," Jennifer Palmieri, who helped the Clinton campaign, said in a statement.
Against this, Donald Trump hides behind false excuses and retreats from his earlier promises to publish his tax returns.
It is customary for US presidential candidates to publish their tax returns, even if the law does not impose it on them.
Trump, a businessman from New York, and his lawyers cited the audit of the IRS Treasury's tax office as a reason for his refusal to disclose the tax returns.
"Your move," campaign aide to Hillary Clinton said on Twitter, following on the Democrat's tax returns.
Michael Cohen, a special Trump adviser, told CNN on Thursday that he would not allow Trump to publish his tax returns until the audits were completed.
According to Trump's critics, who include 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney and other Republican party members, he is the one who agrees that his rejection raises questions about his net profits, charities, business transactional contributions, and various other relationships, including relations with Russia.
Clinton is strongly speaking on the issue, posting a video on Friday in which she recalls the high-ranking republican republicanism to press to publish his tax returns.
On Thursday, mention the question in your speech on economic issues in Michigan.
"He refuses to do what all the other candidates for the presidency have done for decades - to publish their tax returns," she said to the people.
Politico reported that Trump has paid no or very low taxes in the last two years of the 1990s, and the New York Times columnist has quoted a number of tax advisers and accountants who claim, may be the case today.
Federal tax rates have become a topic in the election of the president.
Clinton is pushing for a rule named after billionaire Warren Bufett to ensure that all those who make more than $1 million in a year will pay a tax of at least 30 percent.
President Barack Obama also supports the proposal.
Last week, at a Clinton rally in Omaze, Nebraska, where Buffet's conglomerate, Berkshire Hathaway, called on Trump to meet and exchange tax returns.
Buffett said he had also received an IRS audit, and that Trump was "not "unwitted" to the IRS, but the electorate.
Clinton's campaign was published retroactively by the 2007 tax returns.
The Clintons, who now live in Chappaqua, New York, paid federal tax on average between the ages of 2007 and 2014 at an average of 32 percent and a combined tax of about 40.5 percent.
The Clinton tax return for 2015 shows that, unlike most Americans, their wages are just $100 in their income.
Their main investment was a low-cost mutual index fund, from which the Clintons gave income in dividends and interest rates of $109,000.

Condoms filled with chilli or fireworks for the protection of elephants in Tanzania
Conservationists in Tanzania use an unorthodox way to prevent elephants from going to people's homes - throwing condoms filled with chilli powder.
This practice has worked well, and the Honeyguide Foundation, which came up with the idea a few years ago, together with the American environmental organization The Nature Conservancy, is promoting this process and training volunteers in the villages of the north of Tanzania, how to use this nonviolent advance in four steps to protect their homes and crops without hurting the animals.
Many of them used to use spears in their defense.
Friday is the World Elephant Day, which is dedicated to the protection of these animals.
"Since they've been developed by this ... set of instruments, we've seen a change in the behavior of these communities. People are much more confident that they can keep elephants out of their fields without hurting them," Honeyguide Foundation Executive Director Damian Bell said in a statement.
The first and second steps are to shine a flashlight on the passing elephant and lower the horn.
If this does not deter him, it will be the throw-out of the so-called "suit of the chilli."
The chilli powder mixed with the salt is wrapped in a condom with the firecracker, its end being smoked to be peeked out of it only by a wick.
After detonation, the console explodes and a fine chilli powder is scattered into the air.
Usually one whiff is enough and the elephant goes in a different direction.
The last option is to launch a fireworks display that triggers a loud, clear explosion.
The Jewish director leaned on the Berlin hotel for removing the code for calling Israel to "request" of Arabs - RT News
The Jewish-born French film director caused a stir in the media after discovering that the Kempinski Bristol in Berlin did not have the code for calling to Israel, according to the employee's words on the basis of the "demand" of Arab clients.
Claude Lanzmann, the author of the documentary about the Holocaust "Shoah," vented his frustration with the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin in an open letter to the German daily FAZ.
During his recent stay, Lanzmann attempted to find Israel in the hotel's hotel call codes list.
However, the state was not listed among the countries to which it is possible to call directly from the room.
How is it possible that in 2016 Israel was removed and deleted in Berlin, the capital of Germany?
Written by Lanzmann.
Instead, the Kempinski Bristol Hotel offers the opportunity to call Israel via its own call centre.
The director sought an explanation and addressed the problem at the hotel's reception desk.
The answer he received, Lanzmann, in his words, was "shocking."
The hotel staff replied that the measure had been "decided at the discretion of Kempinski Hotels's management."
The reason for this move has been even more irritated by the director.
"Most of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that Israel's callcode be erased," Lanzmann quoted the staff as saying in his letter.
According to Suddeutsche Zeitung, Israel's ambassador to Germany, Yakov Hadas-Handelsman called the case a "great embarrassment."
The event was horrified and shocked.
It's a huge embarrassment in itself.
The fact that this has happened in Germany and, moreover, in such a hotel chain, is an even greater shame.
No further explanation is needed.
We expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions," he said.
The event provoked a strong reaction online, with people calling it scandalous.
Some believe that the Kempinski hotel has simply "lost" in the demands of Arab customers.
"Shame on you," reads another post, which points out that the hotel, which is located in the classy Kurfurstendamm street, is not far from the synagogue.
According to the Spiegel, the hotel itself quickly defecated any charges by calling the event a "overlosset" and "recalled" to Lanzman.
"No direct order has been issued" to include Israel in the list of call codes, quotes Suddeutsche Zeitung as a representative of the Kempinski Hotel.
It adds that the call code was added to the list.
Police use tear gas and rubber bullets against protesting Brazilian students
The clash between students and police occurred in San Paul, Brazil, on Thursday when the students met for a demonstration against government reforms in the public education system.
Police used tear gas and rubber bullets against the protesters.
The problem escalated when government riot police tried to disperse the students, which ended with the police using rubber bullets and tear gas.
The demonstration was attended by several hundred students to express their concerns about the plans.
Among the proposals by the governor of Sano, Gerald Alckmin, to save money, are also the closure of nearly a hundred public schools and the relocation of 300,000 students.
Some of the demonstrators could be seen spray-painting inscriptions against interim President Michel Temer on the wall.
The latest protest comes only days after the demonstrators took to the streets en masse in support of deposed President Dilma Rousseff when the country's senate decided to indict her.
Trade between Russia and Iran increased by 71% - RT Business
According to the Russian ambassador to Iran, Le Levan Dzhagaryan, trade turnover rose by 70.9 percent in the year-on-year comparison after the lifting of sanctions between Moscow and Tehran.
As the ambassador said, since international sanctions against Iran were lifted, there has been an increase in interest from Russian companies that do business in the country.
Russian companies are renewing existing ties with Iran, while new firms are ready to enter the market.
Further expansion of trade is, of course, one of the main priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran," Dzhagaryan said.
He noted that during the first five months of 2016, trade turnover between Russia and Iran grew by 70.9 percent compared to the same period for 2015, reaching $856 million.
In particular, Russia's exports to Iran jumped 91.5 percent to reach $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 percent to $158 million.
The jump in trade has been provided by supplies of machinery, land vehicles and weapons," the ambassador said.
The Dzhagaryan also expects Russia to be visited by a record number of tourists from Iran this year.
In the past year, the Russian diplomatic mission in Iran has issued around 35,000 visas, mainly travel, to the citizens of Iran.
In addition, Iran made it to the top 20 countries for the first time, according to the number of tourists coming to Russia.
It is safe to say that the record numbers of tourists from Iran in Russia in last year will be surpassed," he said.
At the same time, Iran is visiting a relatively small number of Russians. The ambassador hopes there will be a change.
"Personally, I can recommend a visit to the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, where the preserved monuments of the ancient Persian civilization are preserved," he said.
Callum Skinner's Scot rush home after Brits won gold in cycling
Callum Skinner of Scotland entered the Hall of Fame last night in the men's team sprint at the velodrome in Rio when the VB trio defended their London 2012 title.
The 23-year-old from Glasgow was in the brake role taken for his Scotsman Sir Chris Hoy, and the young legend was delighted to climb to the finish and steal the victory from the hands of the favoured New Zealand.
Britain surprisingly won four years ago and Hoy won the fifth of his six Olympic gold medals.
And they repeated the same trick after finishing the humble sixth at the world track-side championship in track cycling in March, although Hoy had ended his career in the meantime.
The problem between Beijing and London was a replacement for specialist opener Jamie Staff.
So the Hindes appeared just in time.
After the departure of Hoye, a post that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton also made for it.
Skinner was a man of British coaches and the search for potential has now been confirmed.
Kenny Hindes - who, along with Hoyo, was champion four years ago - and with Skinner reached the Olympic record in qualifying, but took the jersey in the first round of New Zealand.
And the British trio won gold in the team sprint.
The Hindes were slightly behind on his lap, but Kenny pushed the team forward and Skinner held the lead.
The change in strategy was a major part of the transformation, when Hindes went for a higher gearbox to slow down and allow Kenny and, in part, Skinner to keep up the pace.
Hoy watched the race from his position as a BBC commentator, and when Skinner, Kenny and Hindes took to the podium, he kept his eyes on them.
Twenty-three-year-old Skinner, a native of Glasgow, said, "It's a flattering comparison."
I'm here to get the best out of myself and honor my name.
We set an Olympic record in the final and we beat the best.
It was just unbelievable.
There's no better way to win this.
After a triumph alongside Kenny and Hoy in London in 2012, Hindes admitted that he deliberately fell to the track after a weak start.
He later withdrew the rematch, and Britain's rivals had no opportunity to appeal.
This time around this victory there was no such problem.
The Hindes said, "With all the British flags in the stands, I felt like I was in London."
In the last three months, we've all come together as a team.
We have lost in a number of world races, so winning the Olympics again is just amazing.
It is one event, one gold medal for the nation, which has won seven of the ten competitions in Beijing and London.
If this is to be an indicator of progress over the past five months, then a successful five days are waiting for us in the velodrome.
With the form Kenny did, it is not inconceivable that he would repeat Hoya's success and win three gold medals at one Olympics at the same time.
This would then be the birthday of 23 March for Kenny - who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy - who is exactly on the day 12 years younger than Hoy (this date seems to be sacred for British sport, and on this day, Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister) - marked a total of six gold and one silver medal.
Still, how much did Hoy get.
Next up, Kenny will take part in the sprint, which starts today and will last for the next three days.
The 28-year-old from Bolton said, "I'm enjoying this one now.
A team race is always the best.
You win with the others.
To tell you the truth, winning for myself is a little lonely.
Hindes said, "If he wins two more gold medals, he should get a knighthood."
That was the only medal race of the day, but there was more good news for Britain.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified as the fastest in the team pursuit at the four-kilometer team.
They finished with a time of 3:51.943.
The world record, set in London in 2012, is 3:51.659.
The first round and the final (22:42) are held on today's second day of the race, which will surely be the focus of Wiggins.
Yesterday before the qualifying race, he debated with the commissioners when the judges called for a height to be measured.
In a similar women's race, which continues and finishes tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie reached the world record with a time of 4:13.260.
The VB team relied on their strong track cycling team and dominated the mid-range of the Olympic Games and won a lot of medals.
After really exceptional performances showing the absolute superiority in Beijing and London, expectations have been reduced in the run-up to Rio.
Dramatic events unfolded in the background, last but not least, the resignation of technical director Shane Sutton in April on charges of sexism and discrimination, and the end of the career of giants such as Hoy or Victoria Pendleton.
However, as evidenced by the first night of the velodrome races, it seems that the legendary reputation of the UK team being able to deliver a top-of-the-range performance with perfect timing could be confirmed again.
Uncertain future of the Tearers in Portland after the termination of the energy supply contract
The future of Portland's aluminium smelter in Victoria - and the jobs of hundreds of workers - is uncertain because of the power plant that supplies electricity to the company's intention to end the electricity contract of one of the owners of the smashing plant. All electricity supply contracts are expected to be truncated.
This step is taking place after the government of Victoria earlier this year decided not to extend the provision of subsidies that keep the business running.
The fixed 20-year grant expires in November.
Alcoa Portland may be at risk for up to 2,000 jobs.
When closed, up to 2,000 jobs - direct or indirect - may be at risk.
And because the smoky industry consumes around 10 percent of the total electricity produced in Victoria, there may be additional avalanche impacts.
Alcoa closed the Tavera Point Henry in 2014, leading to the closure of the Anglese power plant last year.
The Alcoa taviya taviya in Portland is unprofitable and is in danger of being closed.
The move follows several years of speculation about the future of the business, initially in response to the strong Australian dollar and recently because of plant production prices.
The AGL, which supplies electricity from the Loy Yang A power plant in the Latrobe Valley, has said it expects one of the other three owners to decide to terminate the contract as well.
The majority of the plant is a joint venture between Alcoa and Alumina, with the Chinese company CITIC and Marubeni Corp from Japan's Marubeni Corp.
"AGL expects the Portland plant to continue to work, in other words, that the depressing demand for electricity from the smashing room will continue," she said.
The AGL stated that the contracts were so-called "surance contracts" that were to come into force from November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month notice period, so that they will actually expire in 2017.
"AGL continues to assume that contracts will contribute to the profit for fiscal year 2017," the plant said.
Furthermore, any possible impact on the AGL's profits since the 2018 fiscal year is currently limited thanks to the strong outlook for the commodity market for wholesale electricity prices.
The AGL stated that it had already drawn up the value of the contracts according to its accounting books of $187 million ‘in the event of a termination.’
Alcoa stated that the contract's decision to terminate "it has no impact on its ... the ability to operate the smannic or secure the electricity supply to the melting plant."
The American company said it entered into a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010, which was to start in November of this year, although it still has to explain why it withdrew from the contract.
Analysts are very cautious about the possible closure of the Portland Tavi at Victoria as well as the Tomago plant near Newcastle as a result of a weak economy in the sector.
AGL Operations Manager Stehpen Mikkelsen, who approached analysts earlier this week, said Portland consumes around 600 megawatts of electricity and Tomago around 900 megawatts a year.
If both of these firms were to withdraw from the market, this would mean a substantial reduction in demand in the [electricity energy] market.
It wouldn't be good for us as a manufacturer," he said.
Kendall is not only the star of the Kardashian real estate TV show - now the cover of September's Vogue
Kendall Jenner (20), model and fourth daughter of clan's mother-manager Kris Kardashian-Jenner, appeared on the cover of the September edition of the American magazine Vogue.
Kendall, the band's ambassador for Estee Lauder, who was showing off at Fashion Week in Milan, Paris and New York, announced the news on her Instagram account on Thursday.
"In a room full of people I love, looking at this front page, I want to cry," Kendall wrote.
The unveiling of the front page was followed by a bizarre (or simply a sequel to the Humor in Kardashian's submission?) with a video in which the entire Kardashian-Jenner family (bark rioters Rob and Caitly, along with all the popular showbiz uncle, Keep Up producer Ryan Seacrest). They forgot about their sister's cover, only for the scene to end in a classic turn: they're setting up a secret party.
It's the bygone story line for almost every "birthday-loving" episode of a children's TV show (Seacrest says, "Did you think we'd forgotten about you?" with the honesty of a cartoon rabbit on the eight o'clock in the morning), but Kris somehow needed to make sure the other girls could feed on this publicity.
Because when we look at the September issue of Vogue magazine, we've definitely entered the new era of the Kardashian.
The older sister, Kim, may have pushed Kendall to the cover of Vogue (she was co-written with her husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the backdrop to the magazine's September issue is a different league.
The September issue of Vogue magazine is the best-selling number of the year.
The release, which is more like a book for advertising purposes than a fashion magazine, attracts a number of advertisers in its thickness (Fashionista reckoned that from 832 pages in last year's edition there were 615 pages with advertising content).
The unveiling of the star, which will appear on the front page, is eagerly awaited, so it is no wonder that in the past two years the magazine's pictures have been leaked before its official publication.
Women who have appeared on the cover in the past include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evandelista or Kate Moss.
In recent years, the front page has certainly shown more "celebrities that make models" than "the drachicies that are celebrities."
Jennifer Lawrence, an Oscar winner and Dior ambassador, appeared on the cover in 2013, and a year later, Lagy Gaga was honoured.
But while it is highly unlikely that Kendall - described by the magazine as the "breakhom model" of her generation - will fall into the first category, she will be in very good company.
These celebrities are not related to well-known people, nor the stars of the real estate shows, or the children of today who know how to make a well-schedened video (although Jenner represents all of this).
They are demonstrably talented women who excel at the entertainment industry.
Beyoncé, who appeared on the cover page last year, had one of the most powerful years of her career thanks to the release of the album Lemonade.
Of course, not everyone is happy about Jenner's success.
Her position in the world of fashion will always be difficult because of her participation in a reality show.
In June, Stephanie Seymore, the original Victoria's Secret model, criticized Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid and called them "the girls of the moment."
Those feelings flared up again with the news that Jenner would appear on the cover of Vogue.
But this discontent is out of place.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of September's Vogue.
She's a supermodel in the truest sense of the word.
He's doing for Mark Jacobs.
He's selling you make up by Estee Lauder.
She and all her sisters are selling you pictures of themselves on their own paywalls.
She sells pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter, photographed for LOVE magazine.
And in her spare moments, she performs on a reality show, perhaps only as one way to see Kourtney and her children.
Community legal aid centres reject 160,000 people a year
The more than 160,000 most people at risk are rejected each year in the community's legal aid centres, and they are poised for the effects of the sector itself, with further caps on over-worked services.
In Queensland, three out of five people - mostly people of advanced age, immigrants, at-risk workers, victims of violence and people with no means of funding to fight an unjust eviction and the like - are already being rejected when they are looking for free legal aid and representation.
The community's legal services, which are already so strained to bursting, are about to make further cuts.
From June next year, these legal aid centers will lose another 30 percent of federal funding.
Queensland Legal Assistance Director James Farrell said that according to the latest summary report by the National Association of Community Legal Aid Centres, five thousand people were found to be rejected each year.
Mr Farrell said that without the federal government's decision, the situation would be getting worse.
"Communal legal centres in Queensland are chronically underfunded, which means that thousands of people are being refused the vital services they need," he said.
People who have escaped from relations with a rapist, people with excessive and crippling debts, families passing through separation, workers who are unjustly dismissed - all of these people have problems with legal dimensions, and this report shows that they have no chance of getting the help they need.
The federal government will cut funding by 30 percent from June 2017, leading to thousands more at-risk people from Queensland having to navigate the complex legal problems without help.
We call on the Attorney General and Queensland Senator George Brandis to prevent this shortening of funds immediately to get people the help they need when they get into legal trouble.
In the past year, the government of the state has lived up to its commitment to secure the financing of legal aid up to the national average.
Now is the time to look at the needs of the community's legal aid centres and the communities of their clients, and the Palaszczuk government must invest in this important work.
Donald Trump campaign lawsuit after a staff member allegedly pointed to gun
New York: Donald Trump's campaign was sued for alleged inaction after being told that the director of operations in North Carolina in February aimed a gun at a crew member while riding a jeep.
The incident was described in a court file handed to Vincent Bordini, a former campaign software trainer in the state district in the state, on Wednesday.
Bordini said he had waited for months to resolve the situation internally before he concluded that "it will not happen."
Director Earl Phillip "marked the gun with his fingers, put his right index finger at the trigger, and aimed the barrel at Vincent's cache," Bordini said in the lawsuit.
The file states that Bordini, following a complaint with the campaign's local and regional leadership, found that at least four other people had experienced the same thing with Phillip.
"The weapons do not have to fire to cause damage," Bordini said in the lawsuit.
The lawsuit comes just two days after the Republican presidential nominee caused an uproar when he told voters in North Carolina that gun owners and holders could take action (which is regulated in the US in the Second Amendment) if his opponent, Hillary Clinton, was elected and could appoint her judges.
Trump's campaign says the media has taken his words out of context and that Trump has not advocated the violence.
In the lawsuit, Bordini is seeking compensation from the campaign for negligent supervision and from Phillip for endangering personal safety, the unlawful use of violence and the infliction of emotional damage.
Trump's spokeswoman, Hope Hicks, did not respond to the report requesting a commentary.
Attempts to get a statement from Phillip were unsuccessful.
The WCCB, a local news agency in Charlotte, announced that Phillip had recently left the campaign.
No one responded to his consultancy, Innovative Consulting Services, a call within a short time.

Britain must continue to spread the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will also be a source of renewal and prosperity not only for our local communities and across London, but throughout the country.
For me, Heathrow is in a huge way attractive, just as London 2012 was when we made an extraordinary effort to ensure that all our peoples and regions can benefit from the Olympic Games.
The Olympic Games posed huge benefits for both Startford and the East End.
And we're going to do it again by creating opportunities for the local people and companies near Heathrow.
For our local communities alone, we will create 10,000 new teaching posts, 40,000 new jobs and we will end the unemployment of young people around the airport.
As before the London Olympics in 2012, there will be those who will think that the Heathrow expansion is too great.
I was told that Britain would never be ready for the Olympic Games and that we would be ridiculed on the world stage.
The doubters were wrong in 2012, and even in the Heathrow case it will turn out to be wrong.
It will always be necessary to overcome obstacles, but Heathrow can answer every question that concerns him.
Like the Olympic Games, the Heathrow is an infrastructure project involving many people and businesses, not just a few.
The expansion is an opportunity to create 180,000 new jobs, economic growth of £211 billion, to leave for a book-length and occupation legacy both around the airport and across the UK.
We have a great team at Heathrow that, on the deadline and with the budget set out, has implemented an £11 billion infrastructure investment programme, starting with the T5 terminal - which was voted the best terminal in the world for five years in a row, after Terminator T2, which was built between the two busiest runways in the world.
They are now prepared to deliver the third runway, which is backed by £16 billion of private investment.
The London 2012 Games were a huge success for the UK and I am convinced that Heathrow's enlargement will be so.
It is time for us to continue to spread the spirit of the Olympic Games and to expand the Heathrow, to secure trade for the future, and to leave the skis and employment heritage that Britain can be proud of.

Adblock Plus - Facebook in a game of cat and mouse in ad blocking
Experiments to bypass advertising-blocking programs have become a game of cat and mouse for companies that make a profit for online marketing. At least that's what one of the companies that program such software says.
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced that it would be blocking advertising filters on its desktop pages, Adblock Plus posted a post on its website stating that users could update the filters in their program and re-dotnotate advertising on this social network.
Facebook said on Tuesday that its desktop website will change the encoding around ads to make it more difficult for advertising filters to see which parts of the site are advertising.
Adblock, however, now claims to have already bypassed the new codes.
Adblock spokesman Ben Williams wrote in a blog post that "this kind of war between the open source community of open source blocking of ads and those who try to bypass them has been insistent since the ads blocking was invented," and that Facebook is likely to come up with another repair of its own.
The fact that the company owning the world's largest social network has joined the war only proves just the big problem with blocking ads for industry.
According to the study, the tkerou was conducted by Pagefair and Adobe used advertising filters worldwide worldwide by around 200 million people - almost four times the case in 2013.
Mobile advertising now accounts for 84 percent of advertising profits on Facebook, with 1.03 billion active users visiting Facebook from mobile devices every day.
The spokesman said the company, however, was going against advertising filters on desktops, because the mobile advertising filters for mobile apps for social networking and Instagram do not work.
Advertisements for desktops still represent a profit high enough for Facebook to decide to invest in it.
Facebook also said on Tuesday that it would update the "ad preferences" tool to give people the opportunity to better control how ads are shown to them.
On Thursday, Facebook said they were concerned about Adblock's new filters, as they could also block content unrelated to the ad on the site.
"This is not a pleasant experience for people and we want to solve this problem," a Facebook spokesperson said in an email statement.
Blocking advertising is an insensitive tool, so we preferred to focus on building tools like Ad Preferences that give control to people.
Woman hit by car of Swiss motorway
The victim was on the highway in the middle of the night.
Police are looking for witnesses to the event in which a woman was run over on the motorway in the early hours of Thursday morning on the motorway by a woman who had probably tried to commit suicide.
The accident took place on the A1 motorway, near the Morges in the Vaud canton, shortly after midnight on Thursday.
Police in Vaud said in a statement that the "desperate act" was lying in the dark on the road and was run over by several cars.
It is clear that the victim, a woman aged 49, wanted to kill herself and was hit by several cars, including a lorry.
She died at the scene.
Several drivers have already been questioned, but police say they still haven't all been identified. Police are urging these drivers and all the others who witnessed the accident to come forward.
A criminal investigation was opened, a "logical" step in a situation like this, said the attorney, Gilles Hofstetter, to Le Tribune de Geneve.
It is still necessary to find out if any of the drivers involved will face any charges.
Was it possible to prevent the impact?
This is what the prosecutor has to find out," Hofstetter said.
Based on two similar cases from the past five years, it appears that drivers will not be held responsible.
In both cases - one of which was a person on the highway - it was decided that motorists could not expect a pedestrian who was crossing the highway in the middle of the night, as the paper said.
Last year, a police officer was cleared of charges for vehicular manslaughter after she hit and killed a man lying on the A1 motorway near Paynerne on the night of August 2014.
The court heard that the victim, aged 22, was drinking alcohol and fainted on the road.
The court found that the police officer - who responded to the emergency call - was driving in a proportionate manner and that the presence of the man on the road was "a completely exceptional and unpredictable situation," the judge said.
Anyone with information about Thursday's incident at Morges should report to the police on the phone numbers 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
Tolerant city.
Prague is a popular destination for the LGBT community.
The Association of Czech Travel Agencies and Agencies (ACC) expects up to 20,000 visitors to come to Prague as part of Prague Pride.
On Friday, the Executive Director of the AČCKA, Kateřina Petříčková, said so.
The sixth edition of Prague Pride began on 8 August, with the festival bringing the lives of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) to the life.
Last year, about 35,000 people attended the event.
"Prague is one of the most popular destinations of the LGBT community, for its high level of tolerance and a wide range of specialised enterprises," Petříčková said.
According to a survey by organizers, foreign festival-goers spend an average of CZK 3100 per person per day.
In support of their travel, special maps of Prague with a complete list of Prague's gay and gay-friendly bar, clubs, cafes and restaurants in the form of mobile apps, are available to gay tourists to support their travel.
"For tourism in general, LGBT clientele is very lucrative, is interested in stays in higher price ranges with a high standard of travel services and spends more than others," Petříčková said.
The festival's programme will also host the first Pride Tourism Symposzium this year.
It is presented by experts from the LGBT tourism sector from Europe, the US and China.
The festival continues until Sunday, August 14.
The main theme this year is love, but the event will also focus on several thematic areas, which are family, AIDS prevention and transgender issues.
The highlight of the festival will be on Saturday the traditional parade with allegorical cars, which will go from Wenceslas Square to Letna.
The parade, attended by thousands of people in recent years, will this year observe a minute's silence in the memory of the victims of the June nightclub attack in Orlando, where the assailant shot dead 49 people, mostly homosexuals.
Pat and Mat are turning 40.
The unreplaceable handymen Pat and Mat, whose efforts usually end in disaster, have entertained small and large viewers for forty years.
The pilot episode of this evening series director Lubomír Beneš premiered on August 12, 1976.
The emergence of this animated series, which is now known by viewers in more than 100 countries around the world, were cartoons of the artist and director Lubomír Beneš, which he invented for a magazine with two hilarians of Mr. Ouholíček and Mr. Sedlec.
Beneš then invited dramaturge Jiří Kubíček and artist Vladimír Jiránek to collaborate and together they created the film Kuťáci.
Today's likeness with a yellow and red trick and a ball and a radial were given to the characters in 1979, when a series for Slovak Television began to be created in Short Film Prague.
The names Pat and Mat were then given to the DIY in 1985, this time it was shot directly for Short Film Prague.
In 1990, Lubomír Beneš founded his own studio of the animated film AIF Studio in Prague and Zurich, where other episodes were created.
After his death in 1995, more episodes continued with other creators, many of whom were co-written by Benes's son Marek.
There are now over ninety episodes with the stories of these handymen, which are all pour under their hands, but never get angry and are always full of optimism, ideas and DIY enthusiasm, and in the end they are satisfied with their work, which is evidenced by the famous gesture "...and that is!".
Pat and Mat have even moved from TV screens to books, DVDs, and to the theater and characters, or other toys with the depiction of Pat and Mat, are a hit for every toy store.
A fairy tale for Fiji as well as for two-year-old Harmony.
The end of the week is in the wake of fairy tales, we have chosen one sporting and one of your lives.
They both have a good ending.
Let's take a look.
Fiji has achieved historic success.
What is the reason for the joy of the whole country?
A two-year-old British girl has an identical friend and is happy with her.
And what are the most things people spend at airports on?
That's Friday's review from the world's websites.
First Olympic medal.
The historic success is celebrated by the island state of Fiji.
Rugby selection of this archipelago defeated the Seventh Rugby team of Great Britain in the final of the Olympic Rugby tournament.
It is the first ever medal to win for Fiji at the Olympics.
Waiting to win the first valuable metal took sixty years since the deployment of the first expedition to the Olympic Games.
Much of the credit for the success goes to coach Fiji.
Ironically, however, he is the Brit Ben Ryan.
He has led the team since 2013, and after the final as a British citizen, he could be happy, unlike his countrymen.
"Let's play free and light and see if we can make the biggest game in our history," the coach said before the final.
Fiji eventually dominated him, and the small state of 900,000, is now experiencing an Olympic fairy tale.
The news was reported by the French newspaper Le Monde.
A new friend and happiness for a little girl.
2-year-old Harmony-Rose Ivy Allen, who has lived without arms and legs since 11 months.
A doll that looks like her.
"Mom, she's like me," the two-year-old rejoiced, as her mother told ABC News.
She added that her daughter likes to take off the doll's arms and legs and then sit together without prosthetic legs.
Harmony was diagnosed with B-type meningitis in less than a year of life, with doctors giving it only a 10% chance of survival.
There's nothing I don't love about her.
She's beautiful, smart, funny, and she never gives up.
He has insight.
I've seen her introduce herself to the other kids with the words Hello, I'm Harmony and I don't have hands, my mother added.
Look at the joy the doll has attracted.
Are we spending the most at the airport?
CNN provides a finding that people at airports spend the most on bottled water.
The Hudson's travel essential stores chain has released data over the past year, summing up 10 products that customers buy most often at its stores at airports.
The water was the first.
Drinks were generally very popular, with eight in the top ten.
The ninth place was occupied by a large pack of M&M sweets with coconut flavour.
And can you guess who closes the top ten?
You can't eat the only thing above.
CNN reports it's The Wall Street Journal.
Other popular newspapers sold at airports include: the New York Post, The New York Times USA Today.
Among the magazines, they are US Weekly, In Touch and The Economist.
Rowing sovereigns.
We're just going to win, they laughed at Murray and Bond.
Rowers Eric Murray and Hamish Bond of New Zealand have been reigning the category of deuces without a helmsman for seven years and have confirmed their dominance at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
At first glance, the disparate pair switched to a smaller crew after the Beijing Olympics and has been crushing the competition since 2009.
At the lagoon, Rodrigo de Freitas, they claimed their 69th win in a row in Thursday's final.
How are we different from the others?
We are simply nicer, joked Murray during the Olympic Regand when he was asked to answer questions about the dominance of the New Zealand pair.
Frankly, we're not doing anything different from the others.
We just train hard, very hard.
And we're constantly trying to improve our technique, that's our philosophy, Murray said more seriously.
Their domination is also notable because they are physically different.
Murray is a six-foot-tall and 100-kilter chaser, the academic-looking Bond is five centimeters shorter and 15 kilograms lighter.
Moreover, they are of a different nature.
Bond studies and finances, Murray has had a charity boxing match, for example.
That's why they don't spend much time together outside of rowing.
Eric is getting on the ship with basically not losing.
We're just going to win.
I tend to think about what might go wrong, admitted Bond, who even at the press conference demonstrated that Murray is dominant in the crew.
It was he who was the first to answer, and Bond waited for his chance.
On the water, however, it destroys opponents with calm force.
They are on their pace, and while they are often still in the lead halfway through the track, the opponents have yet to find a recipe for their gradual acceleration.
We race on a two-kilometre course and we never wanted to go the first kilometre to the top.
We're just trying to ride a pace that no one else can do.
We know what we have to do to win, said Murray, 34.
With his four-year-old partner, he won seven gold medals at the World Championships.
They also triumphed in 2007, when they were both members of the golden four without a helmsman.
It was after the unexpected failure of the larger crew at the Beijing Olympics a year later that they decided to switch to a No-Steam without a helmsman.
At the London Olympics, they probably atoned for the biggest defeat of their careers and confirmed their dominance in Rio.
London was very intense.
We did everything the coach told us to do, and they didn't ask any questions.
This time it was a little more fun.
We knew it was going to be a hell of a lot of time, and we had to make sure we were mentally well off, Murray said.
We know they're all trying to overthrow us from the throne.
We still have that target on our backs.
But we are trying to be half a step ahead of everyone, he added.
NASA climate model: Venus was once habitable
According to projections of NASA's new climate model, Venus was once habitable.
Scientists at NASA's Goddard Institute for the Study of Space have developed a model to explore Venus using tools and algorithms similar to those used by climate-study scientists.
The model was designed to determine whether once on Venus, whose surface is hot, without water and sized by CO2, conditions could have prevailed similar to those on Earth.
Scientists have previously suggested that the low rate of rotation of Venus can be explained by its dense atmosphere.
But according to the latest simulations, it seems that Venus once boasted a sparse Earth-like atmosphere, turning slowly.
The model also dealt with the earlier topography of Venus.
The planet's areas were probably drier than on Earth, but once there was enough water and geographic diversity on it to have life in reign and provide protection against rapid evaporation.
Venus also used the sun, which was 30 percent more muted.
"In the simulation of the GISS Venus model, he exposes his day side to the sun for almost two months at a time during a slow rotation," GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio explained in a new report.
This is how the surface is heated and the formation of the rain, which creates a dense layer of clouds that act like an umbrella and shield the surface from too much solar heat.
The result is a climate with average temperatures that are actually slightly lower than currently on Earth.
The model compiled the story of Venus, a similar evolution to which was hypothetically compiled by planetary scientists.
Although Venus was probably habitable in the past -- over several billion years -- it was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet radiation.
Its oceans evaporated and the water vapor were burned by ultraviolet light.
The hydrogen leaked and only the dense atmosphere of carbon dioxide with the lethal effect of the greenhouse gas -- that's Venus as we know it today.
Researchers published their results from the new climate model Venus in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy resigns as coach of the Colorado Avalanche
Patrick Roy resigned his post as coach and vice president of hockey operations of the Colorado Avalanche team on Thursday, citing the impossibility of participating in the team's decision-making process as a reason.
Colorado's executive vice president/general manager, Joe Sakic, confirmed the move and said the club would begin looking for a new coach immediately.
"For the last three years, I've been head coach and vice president of hockey operations for the Colorado Avalanche, with energy, passion and determination," Roy, 50.
I have thought long and intensively over the summer about how I can improve the team, give it the depth it needs and get it to a higher level.
In order to achieve this, it is necessary that the vision of the coach and vice president of hockey operations is in line with the organization's vision.
They must also be able to participate in decisions that have an impact on the team's performance.
These conditions are currently not met.
Sakic, who accepted Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked him for his team's contributions.
"Patrick informed me of his decision today," Sakic said.
We appreciate everything he's done for our organization and we wish him good luck in the future.
Roy was nominated for a win for Jack Adams as the league's top coach during his first season with the Avalanche 2013/2014.
He led the team to a gain of 112 points and a first-place finish in the Central Division. But Colorado struggled with Minnesota in the first round of the playoffs, and during the last two years, the games each season failed to work out.
The Avalanche team scored 39:39-4 in the 2015/2016 season and was five points away from winning a second wildcard in the Western Conference.
Goalie Roy, who entered the Hall of Fame, won the Stanley Cup four times -- twice with the Montreal Canadiens and twice with the Avalanche.
Workers on North Sea oil rig resume talks and suspend strike
The heads of the party's negotiating parties said the strike over wages for oil rig workers were suspended while all parties to the dispute met for a new round of negotiations.
Strikes against the Wood Group oil pole services company sporadically took place on the North Sea platforms operated by Royal Dutch Shell.
"The Wood Group and the trade unions Unite and RMT can confirm that they have agreed to resume the process to address the current disagreements," the statement reads.
Starting next week, we will have a series of all-day meetings over the coming few weeks, where we will try to look at the problems from new angles.
According to trade unions, their recent action, which they said was the first in more than 25 years, is up to 30 percent in protest at wage cuts.
Wood Group cut rates this year and paid out about 9 percent less to its North Sea suppliers due to negative market pressure.
The reduction in company rates comes after a 10% reduction for coastal companies in 2014.
The company argues that further cuts would give companies the leeway to cope with the market downturn.
On the other hand, Shell removed thousands of people from its payroll and announced plans to abandon operations in the field of oil and gas as far as 10 countries in the modernisation of its processes - immediately after the mega merger with the British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure from low oil prices, the economic situation associated with Britain's decision to leave the European Union in June.
A member of parliament from Scotland, Dave Anderson, met with union leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest labour disputes of the entire generation that led to the North Sea strike.
The North Sea, he said, is vital to the region's economy.
"In the North Sea and across the country, we need an economy that operates for all, not just for some," he said in a statement.
By comparison, in 2016, it is expected to invest in new projects in the North Sea, while the average over the past five years was around $7 billion.
Kepler measures star rotation speed in Pleiades
The latest mission of the Kepler Space Telescope to help astronomers is to get an almost complete list of stars at the turn of the stars from the Roofs of the Sep.
The new data helps astronomers understand why stars in the cluster revolve at different speeds, as well as how the rotation time is related to the formation of the planet.
"We hope to learn more about the relationship between star material, it's about the relationship between star material, its age and even history in its solar system," Luisa Rebull, a research fellow at Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, said in a new report.
The Roof of the Fear is located 445 light-years from Earth.
Many stars in the cluster are now achieving a state of adulthood and have been around for over 125 million years.
Now it is turning fast.
At the moment of maximum rotation rates, these teenage stars release huge amounts of stellar wind.
Because these winds move along the magnetic fields of the stars, they have a slowing effect on them.
Along with the star getting older, its rotation rate slows down.
Kepler measures the turning rate of each star by measuring the time between discovering the discovery of recognizable points on the stars -- like the sun's spots.
According to the latest data on the rotation speeds, larger stars rotate more slowly than the less massive stars.
Rebull compares the stars to the dancers, the larger pirouettes make them slower than the smaller ones.
"In the "batch" of the 'Bartlet's Plejad, we see that slower-rolling stars are more massive, while the quickest ones are usually very light stars,' Rebull said.
Because the Folder Cluster is so close, it serves as the ideal space laboratory to compare star quality and rotate speed.
"The fiets provide an anchor for theoretical models of star rotation to both directions, in both younger and older stars," Rebull said.
There's still a lot we want to learn about how, when, and why the stars slow down their rate of rotation and, to say, "his mind of their nail dance shoes."
Rebull and her colleagues detailed the latest analysis of the speed of the Pleiade rotation in three studios, which will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal.
Is the qualification agreement necessary?
If I did not sign up, then the qualification agreement would not be concluded and after a few months I could go to another hospital?
Is it even possible to work after graduation without signing up for specialisation education?
My point is that in the field in which I would like to work, there is now a vacancy at a vacancy only in a slightly more distant hospital, but in about six months there could be a vacancy in another place where I would like to work afterwards.
So I don't know how to deal with the situation for about that six months, the question continues.
He's answering Mgr. Lenka Vlková.
No legislation provides for an obligation to conclude a qualification agreement with the employer - a hospital.
A qualification agreement is a legal institute governed by the Labour Code and can be concluded between the employee and the employer in order to ensure the recovery of the costs incurred by increasing or deepening the employee's qualifications.
In the area of health care, there is long-term pressure to fail to conclude these agreements with a view to ensuring the occupational mobility of health professionals, and not all hospitals currently require this agreement.
Under Law No. 95/2004 Coll., on the conditions for obtaining and recognising professional competence and specialised competence to practise the health profession of doctor, dentists and pharmacist, while it is expressly the case that participation in specialisation training is considered to be a deepening of the qualification (not as an increase).
This means that the Qualification Agreement can be concluded under the Labour Code only if the costs amount to at least CZK 75,000.
No legislation or provide for an obligation to apply for specialisation training.
The law only lays down the conditions of an application for enrolment in the field of specialisation training.
However, according to the law, the doctor is entitled to practise the profession of doctor by taking the necessary university studies, albeit under the conditions of law (under the professional supervision of a doctor with a specialised capacity in the relevant field).
The law foresees a situation where specialist experience completed in another field of specialisation may be included in the specialist training of a doctor, provided that its content and scope correspond to the relevant educational programme.
In theory, it would be possible to count the time worked elsewhere, which would correspond to the interviewer's situation.
However, in view of the fact that I do not know the circumstances of this case, it is possible to recommend consultation with the relevant Department of the Ministry of Health (Science and Medical Occupation) as the Ministry of Health provides by law a consultancy and consultation service related to the inclusion in and running into specialisation training.
The consultancy service is also provided free of charge by the Czech Medical Chamber, of which every doctor must be a member.
Doctors from the Syrian Halab are requesting the US intervention.
The United States has not made any effort to end the siege (the rebellious parts of the city by government troops) and did not use its influence to promote the protection of civilians, AFP quoted from a letter to the White House.
"We do not need tears, compassion, and even prayers; but we desperately need to create a no-fly zone over eastern Halab to stop the attacks, and we need an international action to ensure that Halab is not re-enclosed," the doctors said.
Russian forces, which support the army loyal to President Bashar al-Assad, have announced that they will stop strikes in the Halab area every day for three hours to allow safe passage through humanitarian convoys.
From 9 a.m. to 12:00 GMT, all military activities, aerial attacks and artillery fire are to be stopped.
The head of UN humanitarian operations, Stephen O'Brien, welcomed this, but stressed the need for at least a two-day truce.
According to AFP, the letter addressed to Obama in a letter by 15 of the 35 doctors who are active in the eastern part of Halab, which is controlled by the rebels.
They write that during the five-year war they witnessed the violent, cruel deaths of countless patients, friends and colleagues.
The world watches and notes how complex Syria is, but it is doing little to protect us.
Recent offers of evacuation of residents from the Syrian regime and Russia sound like only slightly veiled threats, said pediatricians, surgeons and other doctors.
Doctors said that in the past month, there have been 42 attacks on medical facilities in Syria, including 15 at the hospitals they work in.
We are most sad about the fact that we have to decide who lives and who dies.
We have young children coming to the emergency room with injuries so serious that we have to pick among them the ones most likely to survive.
And sometimes we don't even have the material we need to help them, the doctors described.
Two weeks ago, four newborns suffocated when the blast cut off oxygen supplies to their incubators.
They gasped for breath, and then their lives were over - before he could begin, they reminded them.
Belowed to President Bashar al-Assad, backed by Russian forces, has in recent weeks surrounded the insurers-controlled rebel-controlled eastern part of Halab, with over 200,000 people indoors without food supplies.
The rebels, who are under constant strikes from the Russian and Syrian air forces, managed to break the enciment and launch a counter-offensive on three weeks on Saturday.
Both sides were then added reinforcements in and around the city.
