Republican Party Strategy Against Obama&#39;s Re-election
Republican leaders justified their policies by the need to combat electoral fraud.
However, the Brennan Center describes such fraud as a myth, with electoral fraud less common in the United States than the number of people dying after lightning strikes.
After all, Republican lawyers have recorded only 300 cases of US election fraud in the last ten years.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on turnout.
In this sense, these measures will partially undermine the American democratic system.
Unlike Canada, in the United States, individual states have the responsibility to organize federal elections.
And in that spirit, most U.S. governments have been enacting new laws since 2009 that make it difficult to vote or register.
The phenomenon boomed after the November 2010 elections, during which 675 new Republican representatives in 26 states were added.
As a result, in 2011 alone, 180 bills restricting the right to vote in 41 states were submitted.
New election laws require voters to present a photo ID and proof of U.S. citizenship.
In addition, these laws limit the period for early elections, invalidate the right to register on the electoral roll on election day and deprive citizens of the criminal record of the right to vote.
Prior to the 2006 election, no U.S. state required voters to present a photo ID.
The first state to introduce this requirement was Indiana.
The constitutionality of the Indian law was upheld in 2008 by the US Supreme Court.
Republican authorities were in a hurry to extend this procedure to other states.
Over the past two years, they have supported bills in 34 states to force voters to present photo IDs.
It should be noted that, unlike Quebec, American citizens do not have a universal identity card, such as a health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of U.S. citizens, or 21 million people of voting age, do not have a photo ID issued by their government agency.
Furthermore, about five million new voters do not have such an identity card in 2012.
In addition, obtaining the required ID often costs more than a hundred dollars.
The new restrictions disproportionately affect mainly young people, members of minorities and people on low incomes.
25% African Americans, 15% people under $ 35,000; Therefore, 18% of citizens over the age of 65 and 20% of voters aged 18 to 29 do not have the required photo ID.
And that&#39;s not all.
Students who are known as voters for their inclination towards democratic candidates are not allowed to use their school-issued photo ID in several states.
On the other hand, the same states allow members of hunting or fishing clubs who vote more for Republican candidates to use the cards issued by those clubs in elections.
Until 2004, no state required proof of citizenship for elections.
Arizona introduced the first such requirement.
Since 2011, about a dozen states have passed laws requiring voters to prove they are American citizens.
These measures are clearly aimed at limiting the number of votes from the Hispanic minority.
It should be noted that two out of three Hispanics prefer the Democratic Party.
In 2011, Republican lawmakers backed laws in eight states that cancel voter registration on election day.
In addition, they restricted the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to voters who want to register.
These restrictions have their consequences.
For example, during the 2004 general elections, voter registration campaigns helped to register around 10 million people.
However, measures taken after 2009 caused a decrease in the registration of new voters in 2010 by 17% compared to 2006.
Republican lawmakers in five other states passed laws aimed at shortening the election period in advance.
For example, during the 2008 general election in Florida, African Americans made up 33% of voters who voted ahead, although only 13% were African American voters in that state.
It was the same with the Hispanics.
They made up only 11% of all voters, but 24% of citizens voting in advance.
On the other hand, whites, who accounted for 76% of all voters, made up only 46% of voters who voted in advance.
Of course, democratic lawmakers and their supporters have strongly opposed the passage of laws restricting voter registration.
Democratic governors vetoed several bills.
The United States Attorney General has even intervened to suspend the most controversial laws.
They managed to reduce the damage in part.
For example, only 16 of 34 states have passed laws requiring them to present a photo ID.
However, the newly introduced rules will undeniably make it more difficult in 2012 to exercise the right to vote.
Democratic critics speak mainly of the bias of the passed laws and consider them to be an obvious effort to influence the results of the 2012 elections in key states.
A 2011 Brennan Center report shows that states where these laws have been passed represent 171 of the 270 votes in the constituency necessary to win the presidential election.
It is too early to say with certainty that these legislative changes at the level of the electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the 2012 presidential election.
But one thing is certain today: these new provisions will have an adverse effect on turnout.
In this sense, these measures will partially undermine the American democratic system.
Prostate Cancer Detection: Pass a Screening or Not?
The PSA test sometimes yielded erroneous results that were incorrectly negative or even incorrectly positive, leading to unnecessary medical procedures.
All this added to the reluctance of men, who were already so reluctant to go for an examination at all.
Get tested or not?
We asked for the opinion of two experts.
Studies in the US have shown a high level of contamination between test groups, making it difficult to interpret these results and make valuable recommendations.
Another study, this time a European study, found a difference in mortality between patients who underwent examination and those who did not.
This study also showed after a 12-year interval that those who do not go for an examination have a 30 to 40% higher risk of metastases.
Therefore, I recommend testing from the age of 50 or from the age of 40 if your close relative had prostate cancer.
Men of African American descent are also a more vulnerable group.
The key is to make the right decision once the cancer is detected.
There are aggressive types of cancer and those that are inert.
It is therefore necessary to correctly explain to the patient the degree of danger of his type of cancer, to offer him possible alternatives, not necessarily to treat prostate cancer, which has no long-term impact on life, and to focus in these cases on active disease surveillance.
Today, many men who have been diagnosed with cancer are not being treated because their type of cancer is not aggressive and does not endanger their lives.
Rather, we suggest that they perform active supervision and, in the event of disease progression, offer them treatment.
More and more often and with more precision, we set criteria that help decide which type to treat and which not.
Nevertheless, I recommend undergoing the examination.
However, it is important to have an interview with a doctor and determine whether it is appropriate to undergo an examination or not.
In collaboration with the International Society of Urology, the Movember movement has created a tool that allows for the assessment of pros and cons in connection with PSA testing.

Disease prevention
Unfortunately, there is no miracle cure for cancer prevention.
Despite advances in research, adopting the principles of a healthy lifestyle seems to be the best way to reduce the risk of disease.
It is estimated that if everyone ate healthy and moved well, up to 30% of cancer cases could be prevented.
&quot;If everyone stopped smoking, that figure would rise to at least 50%,&quot; said André Beaulieu, a spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Research Society.
In contrast, it is estimated that approximately 10% of cancers cause heredity.
Some percentage also remains completely unexplained.
The fight against smoking remains a priority for the Canadian Cancer Research Society, even as the number of smokers declines.
Cigarettes account for 85% of lung cancer cases.
They are also a risk factor for several others.
This is extremely damaging to human health.
&quot;There are still 1.5 million smokers in Quebec today,&quot; spokesman André Beaulieu shakes his head.
Encouraging figure: 10 years after a smoker stops smoking, the risk of dying from cancer is halved.
Mass
According to the SCC, physicality and obesity are another risk factor for the occurrence of the disease.
They increase the risk of cancer of the breast, colon and rectum, esophagus, pancreas and uterus.
&quot;Research shows that regular physical activity throughout life protects against colon cancer,&quot; the report added.
Nutrition
The organization also recommends reducing red meat consumption.
Excessive consumption can lead to an increased risk of colorectal cancer.
It is advisable to avoid sausages, for which the same applies.
Preserving meat by smoking, drying or salting can lead to the formation of carcinogenic substances.
&quot;They can cause damage to the body&#39;s cells and lead to the development of cancer,&quot; the report added.
Vitamins
Recently, various scientists have focused on the link between vitamin supplements and cancer.
However, research has not yet yielded clear conclusions.
According to the SCC, studies focusing on vitamin E are contradictory.
Although one says they will reduce the risk of prostate cancer, another study suggests an increase.
Even the effect of vitamin D on cancer has not been clearly demonstrated.
Mr Beaulieu also insisted on the importance of discussing his family concerns and precedents with his doctor.
&quot;Being tested doesn&#39;t mean you have cancer.&quot;
Higgs boson examined
The announcement of the probable discovery of the Higgs boson caused a legitimate uproar last summer.
There is an opinion that this boson participates in the mechanism that is responsible for all matter in the universe.
And then there is the last particle, the existence of which is predicted by the standard model - our best or &quot;least bad&quot; explanation of the nature and behavior of matter - which, however, has not yet been observed empirically.
However, there is still no 100% certainty among physicists that this is the Higgs boson.
There is no doubt that we have a completely new particle that is very similar to the Higgs boson, as predicted by the standard model.
New data released this week during the big physics congress in Kyoto rather confirms it, but all the data is still missing so that we can be absolutely sure.
However, suppose it is a Higgs boson, as the risks of error appear small, and let&#39;s look at what it is.
In this world, there is a completely unquestionable law, according to which two things cannot occur at the same time in the same place.
This rule cannot be circumvented - and do not try too hard, otherwise you will get hurt.
Although particle physics is a very strange world, it turns out that a similar law applies to it: Pauli&#39;s exclusion principle, according to which two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time, if they are in the same &quot;quantum state&quot; - this &quot;state&quot; roughly speaking creates some of their properties.
It further divides physics particles into two categories.
On the one hand, we find orderly citizens, or fermions, who obediently follow Pauli&#39;s principle.
And at the other end are bosons, mean, anarchists who value nothing at all - certainly not of this principle, which means they can be in the same place at the same time.
These bosons are further divided into two groups according to the equipment (by the way, absolutely amazing) The Particle Adventure in Berkeley Laboratories: the mesons we leave unnoticed here and the &quot;force particles&quot; that propagate great natural forces and with which Higgs the boson was probably related in some way.
However, it must be said that these bosons are not as exotic animals as might be thought.
If you read this article, it is due to the boson with an unusual banality: a photon, or &quot;particle of light&quot;, which is the &quot;carrier&quot; of electromagnetic force.
This is because when an electrically charged particle accelerates or changes direction, it &quot;disrupts&quot; the electromagnetic field at that particular location, much like a pebble thrown into a pond.
This &quot;disturbance&quot; creates an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared or ultraviolet radiation, etc.) and this wave is nothing but a photon - and therefore one of the bosons, the &quot;carriers of force.&quot;
More stable field
It is also with the Higgs boson, with the only difference that another field, the Higgs field, must be &quot;disturbed&quot; for this boson to appear.
This Higgs field is much, much more stable than the electromagnetic field; to excite it, it is necessary to reach very high energy values, similarly to the frozen surface of the pond, which is already rippling only a very large boulder.
For this reason, it is necessary to use such a huge part accelerator as the accelerator in the CERN laboratory - a large hadron accelerator with responsive beams is a circle with a circumference of 27 km! - in order to develop such energy.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is again useful for clarifying the relationship between Higgs and matter.
Not all particles or all materials react with the electromagnetic field.
Some, such as magnets, do so, but others - a piece of paper, for example, will never stick to the refrigerator by itself.
And the same is true that not all particles react with the Higgs field: those that do have a certain mass, while others (such as a photon, let&#39;s look at it) do not.
And Mrs. Nováková asks, what are all these researches for, what will they &quot;bring&quot; us?
From a scientific point of view, it is a confirmation of the validity of the standard model (SM), which allows physicists to examine any discrepancy between observations and predictions of SM.
In addition, many physicists literally want to be able to find them, because the slightest difference could open space for &quot;new physics&quot; and close some gaps in the model.
It should be noted that the model still has huge shortcomings, it does not provide any clarification of gravity (ouha!) Or dark matter, which makes up approximately 80% of cosmic matter (ouha!).
However, CERN has not yet discovered such inconsistencies.
Responses
The responses of these researches in the daily lives of Mr. and Mrs. Novák are very difficult to predict, but it would be a mistake to think that there will be none.
Look: at the very beginning of the 1960s, the laser pioneers in Bell Laboratories had no idea of the revolution their work would provoke.
They envisioned scientific use, but nothing else.
Physicist Willard Boyle - who worked at Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who created the first permanent laser beam (previous beams were pulsed) in 1962, I have already said - the laser was initially considered such a &quot;lab toy&quot; &quot;.
Just imagine ...
In addition, all the tools that surround research can apply.
For example, the same Willard Boyle created a small light sensor in 1969 during his work on optics.
This sensor, although not initially planned by Boyle at all, now serves as the &quot;eye&quot; of all digital cameras in the world and won him the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physics.
Of course, this does not mean that the activities around the LHC necessarily have to change our lives, but it does mean that one never really knows ...
Palliative care - The best way to leave life ... | Le Devoir
Through its Commission on Dignified Dying, Quebec has recently become involved in the sensitive issue of the end of life.
The debate should continue soon and a bill is being prepared at the same time.
There is still a lot of work to be done in this crucial area.
Le Devoir magazine tried to take a closer look at this issue.
Less than a few weeks ago, Mr. L. still lived alone in his apartment in Montérégie.
The prostate cancer that fed him gave him a two-year reprieve.
&quot;They gave me five years of life and it&#39;s already seven,&quot; he says without emotion on his bed at the Victor-Gadbois palliative care home in Beloeil, where he had arrived the day before.
&quot;But it&#39;s still a shock, you can&#39;t prepare for this,&quot; he adds.
The illness has done its job: immense weakness makes it impossible for him to go to the toilet himself or just eat himself.
He looks resignedly at the tasty-looking breakfast and agrees to help him eat.
He is brave and even smiles, talks to strangers who stop by him, brings him medicine, offers him a bath.
Courage for ordinary death.
&quot;My biggest wish is to get rid of that diarrhea, it humiliates me,&quot; he confides.
A few hours later, a team of doctors found a cure for his problem.
&quot;Throughout life, you learn that guys urinate while standing,&quot; says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at the Victor-Gadbois facility.
Going back to the child phase is an unacceptable humiliation for some people.
&quot;It depends on the abilities of each person,&quot; whether he accepts the return, says the psychologist.
According to many palliative care professionals, crucial moments take place at the very core of such a return.
Patients who enter the home with Victor-Gadbois palliative care all suffer from cancer.
Their prognosis is a maximum of three months of life.
At this stage, the team of doctors and nurses who take care of them does not provide them with so-called &quot;medical&quot; care.
In the case of Mrs. A., 89, the worst fear is to die &quot;of suffocation in full consciousness.&quot;
But the disease allowed me to discover my children.
&quot;I have good children,&quot; he adds.
&quot;I have no wishes in my life,&quot; she says, and then agrees to put on her respirator.
Nevertheless, he is still looking forward to the last visit of his son from Italy in the following days.
The Victor-Gadbois home provides nutrition-assisted body care in collaboration with a group of volunteers.
This is what palliative care comes in, if nothing else can be done.
To make death more comfortable.
In Quebec, there is one palliative care bed per 11,700 inhabitants.
That is very little when we realize that we will all die someday.
Here, life continues in optimal conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors at home.
Whether it is a level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
When a person dies, he can be given, for example, a sip of brandy or pepsi, according to taste.
Diabetics no longer have to watch their sugar levels.
And death is part of everyday life here.
They carried beer to Mr. X last night, who died later that night.
This morning, his son drinks beer in honor of his late father.
&quot;We help patients as well as their loved ones,&quot; says Nathalie Savard, director of nursing care.
In the Victor-Gadbois home, the days go one after another, but they do not resemble each other.
In addition to the 93-year-old man, who rejoices in his last reunion with his family, carefully piled on his pillows while drinking in his honor, a 36-year-old man, surrounded by his parents, wife and two small children, dies tragically after trying his best to survive.
&quot;For half a year now, there have always been three to five beds for people with cancer under the age of 45,&quot; says Dr. Christiane Martel with concern.
53% of patients who come to the Victor-Gadbois home come from their homes, 47% from hospitals.
Problems with access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, ie care that is designed to alleviate suffering once a patient reaches the final stage of their life, whether at home, in a hospital or in a nursing home. .
And several organizations, such as the Victor-Gadbois Home and the Grand Montréal Home Palliative Care Society, specialize more or less exclusively in the care provided to cancer patients.
And it is this fundamental unavailability of health care in Quebec that has led many palliative care physicians to fear the adoption of a law on euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since October, a manifesto signed by tops in the field of palliative care, such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, in which they demonstrate their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, the Quebec health system is not efficient enough to ensure that all people have access to quality palliative care before it is possible to agree to euthanasia.
As she says, she recently experienced a patient who spent 14 days in the emergency room in great pain without anyone taking the necessary steps to relieve her.
He fears that patients will not ask to be killed because they are not receiving appropriate care.
At the same time, many oncologists care for their patients until the last moment, regardless of the unfavorable prognosis.
Hélène Richard&#39;s chances of survival were minimal when she left demanding chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I was finishing treatment, she replied that she regretted stopping fighting, she told us.
And yet she told me it was over!
There is no omnipotent care
Dr. Martel estimates that 90% of patients who wish to die thank their attending physicians for failing to fulfill their wishes when the palliative care team relieved the pain.
But it must be said that palliative care is definitely not omnipotent in the treatment of pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, director of palliative care at the Grand Montréal Home Palliative Care Society, patients are reluctant to treat pain in 8% of cases.
At the very end of life, doctors often use palliative sedatives, which put the patient to sleep until the moment of death, either suddenly or whether the sedatives are given to him permanently.
It cannot be pretended that we do not perceive this part of suffering.
A patient who is not relieved of pain will increasingly have access to palliative sedatives.
Patients who are not given a sedative always say the same thing: &quot;I want to die.&quot;
But that doesn&#39;t always mean &quot;I want you to give me euthanasia,&quot; but rather &quot;I want you to relieve my pain.&quot;
This report was made possible by a grant for journalists from the Canadian Institute for Health Research.
Extensive real estate scandals in Quebec
Road officials, construction and public works contractors, political party lobbyists and Italian mafia experts keep telling what they know about the amazing &quot;system&quot; that mixes construction, civil servants, politicians, trade unions and mobsters.
This &quot;field&quot; came to Quebec taxpayers very expensively, especially between 1990 and 2000.
&quot;It&#39;s interesting how the system has crumbled since we took major action,&quot; said Jacques Duchesneau, a Quebec MP and former police chief in Montreal.
Thanks to him, a scandal broke out in 2011 on the basis of a thorough investigation aimed at embezzling funds in connection with contracts for the construction of roads in Quebec, which the then liberal Quebec Prime Minister Jean Charest approved only after long delays.
The &quot;Duchesneau report&quot; confirmed the direct link between industry, opaque party funding and corruption by civil servants.
&quot;Since the beginning of the investigation in 2010,&quot; he says, &quot;the Department of Transportation alone has saved billions of dollars in contracts,&quot; while some people have kept their instincts in check to get a stake in them!
The Charbonneau commission &quot;has already led to the resignation of two mayors,&quot; he added, hoping it would &quot;reveal the cunning of some people.&quot;
Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit, established in 2011
The Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit, established in 2011, is also involved in the fight against its army of government inspectors, investigators and analysts.
In addition, the police officers of &quot;Marteau&#39;s party&quot;, who since 2009 have ensured that the Montreal &quot;money pipeline cartel&quot; has significantly reduced the inflation of orders ...
In recent weeks, they have conducted a number of searches and accused a number of municipal councilors of fraud and corruption, such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, the mayor of a suburban municipality.
Next on the list is Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just resigned as mayor of Laval, Quebec&#39;s third largest city.
He is suspected of repeatedly accepting bribes in exchange for public contracts.
Formal charges have also been received by Montreal-based traffic engineers and Italian entrepreneurs such as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito.
Lino Zambito caused a sensation by explaining to the commission the mechanism of the &quot;system&quot; of public procurement.
During these years, he himself donated 3% of the value of the contracts he won in Montreal to an intermediary associated with the mafia, who then transferred the money to the Union Montréal, for which Mayor Gérald Tremblay ran.
After 2000, Zambito was generous to all parties and donated more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (approximately 68,000 euros) to provincial parties, but especially to the liberals who were in power at the time.
He also admitted that he organized illegal fundraising for former Liberal Deputy Prime Minister Nathalie Normandeau.
Orders with cash pipelines, whose prices exaggerated
In Montreal, the &quot;system&quot; of corruption was very active.
Gilles Surprenant, a former traffic engineer, described it in great detail to the commission: over the course of ten years, he received gifts, invitations to trips, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey games and pocket money worth $ 736,000 in exchange for cash contracts, for which he exaggerated the price.
Other public officials in the transport sector admitted that they had been rewarded for overestimating invoices by 30% to 40% through false extra work.
The mayor&#39;s organizer, Martin Dumont, then accused Tremblay of narrowing his eyes without embarrassment at the parallel budget that was bringing dirty money into his coffers.
Following these revelations, Tremblay resigned in early November, plunging Montreal into a major crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was among the first Montreal MPs to issue a warning signal.
As mayor of the Rivière-des-Prairies district in the east of the island, she has been working since 2010 against the sale of municipal land purchased for $ 5 million and sold for ... 1.6 million to promoters right in the middle of a booming real estate business.
70% of dirty money in election campaigns
He says of the investigation, which will finally begin, that he is &quot;pulling the strings in an effort to understand the workings of an ant-infested system to stop gangrene and catch the culprits.&quot;
According to her, the process is &quot;painful but positive&quot;.
We are in the wound cleansing phase, but we need to set up our own investigation unit in Montreal and ensure that these dubious practices do not return.
Like cleaning up.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau himself says that &quot;public officials have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars&quot;, but he is especially worried about the role of &quot;MPs informed of this deception&quot; if they have not gotten wet in these squabbles!
He estimates that 70% of Quebec election campaign funding comes from dirty money, and adds ironically: &quot;I&#39;ve heard it&#39;s just a slight concoction of reality.&quot;
The Quebec government is proposing to limit donations to the parties to $ 100, but he says that will not solve the situation: &quot;Until election spending is strictly limited, dirty money will not disappear from politics.&quot;
He proposes a comprehensive review of the system of awarding public contracts and party funding: &quot;We can no longer fall; if we focus boldly on the substance of things, we can rebuild on stronger foundations and with more control and compliance.&quot;
If this story tarnishes the image of Quebec and Montreal abroad, Duchesneau recommends that all those who make fun of him look at their own backyard ...
&quot;PSG is not FC Barcelona!&quot;
This season, you and PSG have set a whole new pace.
How do you explain this development?
It can be explained by the fact that all individuals went into each other, or by a completely new dimension of PSG.
Big players came to us.
I get next to them every day.
The technical team also helped me a lot.
Every day, these facts allow me to increase the level of the game.
And it&#39;s easier with matches.
In football, everything goes very fast.
But I&#39;m not losing my head.
From my beginnings in training at INF Clairefontaine to my transfer to Saint-Etienne, I have always moved up a step.
So you are using the competitive environment introduced by Carlo Ancelotti ...
The reinforcements from this summer are used to playing matches at a very high level.
They also know that any training is essential.
And it follows that a player like me then has a greater appetite for the match and wants to give maximum performance.
In addition, Carlo Ancelotti gives me a lot in connection with my position.
He has assistants like Claude Makelele, who played the same position as me.
And does Ancelotti have the final say at the right time?
Of course.
Ancelotti has the respect of all technicians.
Today he has no equal in the 1st league and is one of the best European coaches.
He has a lot of experience and has won a lot of titles with top teams.
He also worked with excellent players.
In my opinion, he will win more titles in Paris.
In January, I had a reassuring conversation with him.
I had a number of injuries.
The trust it gives me is another reason for my performance.
How do you look at the first part of the PSG season?
In the 1st league, Lyon took our leading position.
But we remain in tow.
One of our main goals is the Champions League: we advanced very easily to the round of 16.
What is the goal of your club in this competition?
We will try to go as far as possible.
Anything can happen now.
But we definitely want to be a tough opponent for quality European teams.
We want to win our qualifying group ahead of Porto first so we can play in retaliation at home in the round of 16.
Can PSG become a big European club in the short term?
The budget already has ...
To become a great European club, Paris must win titles and make history.
This is not the case today.
On the financial side, PSG has the resources to make this happen a reality.
And would it be a great failure not to win in the 1st league like last season?
Of course, that would be a big disappointment.
We really want to win the league title this year.
We still missed a lot last season.
In May, we were disappointed because we had to win.
We had a great season.
We collected 79 points.
Usually, with 79 points you are a clear master ...
But another club, Montpellier, had an even more amazing season.
I think it will work this year.
Although big teams such as Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux are also vying for the title, I think we have the weapons to defeat them.
Do you think the media expect too much from PSG?
It is not uncommon to expect a lot from us given what has been invested here and what kind of players we have.
We completely accept that.
The fact is that if we beat Troyes 4: 0 at home and there is still something that they blame us in the newspaper, it&#39;s not very pleasant.
One asks what more people may want from you.
Of course, it is not possible to win 4: 0 every weekend.
We are not FC Barcelona!
We try to set the game style.
You need time to build a team.
In the Champions League, we proved that we can play.
Take a look at Manchester City, which has not made it to the round of 16 for the second season, and has also invested large sums!
Given the amounts invested, you could expect to be ahead of the other 15 points!
This offends other clubs and the French league.
The Lyon and Marseille clubs, which did not do well last season, moved on to the next phase with the new PSG.
This shows how amazing the 1st league is.
I hope that in May we will be able to smile and say to ourselves that, despite all the difficulties, we have managed to win.
It seems as if PSG relied on Zlatan Ibrahimovic&#39;s performances in everything.
It is good that it is said that there is a &quot;dependence on Zlatan&quot;.
This means that Ibrahimovic is very efficient and that he scores a lot of goals.
That&#39;s why he came here and proves that he is the star of the 1st league.
Everywhere he went, he proved to be a great player, a world star.
In our team, we respect people and players.
He also respects the people he has around him.
What he has achieved is truly exceptional.
This led others to raise their own level of play.
Thiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, also allows others to grow side by side.
How did you experience Euro 2012 with the French national team?
Like disappointment.
I really wanted to play in this tournament.
Unfortunately, due to injury, I could not play as I would have imagined.
But I experienced it and I came out stronger.
Today I also manage to play good matches in the national team.
And I&#39;ve been hoping for that since I joined the national team.
We have learned from what has happened in Ukraine, and today we owe it to ourselves to make our actions exemplary.
How do you view the first months of Didier Deschamps leading the national team?
The results speak for themselves.
We are in a good place to qualify for the World Cup.
The coach chooses strictly, is close to the players and can excite to win.
Such was Laurent Blanc.
But I don&#39;t want to compare them.
Blanc achieved his goal by qualifying for the Euro.
I hope Didier Deschamps leads our team to Brazil.
Is the October 16 draw (1: 1) a solid starting match in Spain?
This match gave us confidence.
We all fought for the team.
Before this shock in Spain, I had not experienced such a struggle during my career.

Moreover, as is often true of these technologies, there is a clear political outlook: the belief that the current financial system based on banking monopolies is leading to financial crises.
Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (pseudonym), is both virtual money (convertible to dollars, euros, etc.) and a secure BitTorrent-like transfer protocol that allows file exchange between partner pairs.
Thanks to 15,000 computers connected to the network, approximately 200,000 transactions have already been registered.
About a thousand websites already accept bitcoins as gifts or as a means of payment.
The bitcoin rate first peaked at $ 30 (23 euros) in June 2011, dropped to $ 2 five months later, and is now hovering around $ 10 (for a list of rates, see bitcoincharts.com).
Compared to the world&#39;s exchange for real money or financial products, this is nothing impressive.
And yet the European Central Bank (ECB) is interested in this in its report on virtual finance, which was published in October.
He describes Bitcoin as &quot;the most successful virtual money&quot;, &quot;competing with the dollar and the euro&quot; and &quot;the equivalent of ordinary money&quot;.
Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual money in that it is used as &quot;credits&quot; for advancing in a video game that one obtains through play or that one can buy (and sometimes exchange back).
The social network Facebook has also developed a similar system.
However, every month the central authority checks and processes individual communications.
In the case of Bitcoin, all nodes in the network are current account depositories, controllers, money issuers and buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Each transaction between two users actually takes place between two email addresses via e-mail.
However, the user can choose a different address for each payment, thus ensuring anonymity.
The set of information related to this transaction is electronically signed by a double-key encryption system.
The network can thus verify the legitimacy of the transaction.
Thanks to the contents of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the exchanged bitcoins exist in a public account of current accounts, which is distributed throughout the network.
The key phase is to write this new transaction in this book.
It is done by solving a mathematical task assigned to computers, the solver of which, a kind of temporary central banker, will have the right to complete this additional line.
This is the stage of cutting the file; ie the transformation of a huge file into a shorter and unique digital fingerprint.
Computers &quot;take over&quot; this new transaction and add a number to it, only then &quot;chop the whole&quot;.
The goal is to find a number that provides a specific fingerprint (a lot of zeros at the beginning).
Once this number is found, the other nodes can easily check for it.
The transaction then appears indestructibly linked to a string of all other transactions; any modification would change the fingerprint.
If the user wants to pay twice with the same money for the fraud very quickly in a row (within ten minutes), the network will confirm only one of the two transactions - the other will be abandoned, because each has a different fingerprint.
The computer that solves the challenge will win 50 bitcoins.
To prevent inflation, this remuneration is regularly divided by two, probably until the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is thus limited to 21 million, but they can be divided into hundreds of millions, so there is room for margin ...
The difficulty of the assigned task also increases with increasing level of calculation.
The network has already experienced its ups and downs.
Websites that provide services for Bitcoin have been compromised and stored bitcoins have been stolen.
&quot;The loophole used is not about the protocol itself,&quot; said Pierre Noizat, who founded Paymium, a real money payment company using Bitcoin.
The ECB also controls money laundering options through this anonymous service.
But this problem also applies to cash.
Prominent players like Wikipedia reject gifts of this nature.
Others, like the WordPress blogging platform, accept them.
Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron of the Weizmann Institute in Israel recently analyzed a book of current accounts and found that almost 80% of bitcoins do not circulate.
&quot;Huge discounts&quot; were launched in November.
&quot;Thirty thousand dollars have been exchanged,&quot; rejoices Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, which converts bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, who is also the author of a pedagogical book on this money, has great confidence in the potential of this technology as a transactional network.
Its system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (with real money) or contactless mobile payments, but it uses Bitcoin to verify transactions, which makes them cheaper.
In addition, the bearer manages his identity and can thus remain anonymous.
The system is easy to set up at retailers where there is no need to install new terminals or software.
All you have to do is provide an address that can be &quot;photographed and recognized&quot; by phone, says Pierre Noizat, who assures that he already has thousands of users.
There is a general movement to question hierarchical systems and a shift to more horizontal systems.
&quot;It will take some time for Bitcoin to gain ground, but 2013 could be a decisive year,&quot; he predicts.
In addition, the ECB envisages in its report a reassessment of the various risks that are considered to be increased today if this type of money is successful.
We left Afghanistan.
And what else?
French troops have left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and US troops should follow in late 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to take control of its territory and for the Afghans to choose their own future and not expect everything from us.
The greatest damage was suffered by the people in the Afghan countryside, whom we punished because we considered them terrorists.
And we, too, lost 88 soldiers killed, and what about all those wounded and maimed.
The Taliban are made up of foreign extremists, former leaders who fled to Pakistan, but are often peasants who reject the presence of foreign armies as in Soviet times.
They just want to defend their ancient and archaic traditions, even if they are joined by jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks, Tajiks.
They are now experiencing tolerance and frequent help from local insurgents, but if Western forces withdraw, their support will decline.
The departure of French troops from the base of Nijrab, which I watched from the tops of the mountains planted with almonds thanks to French loans, was orderly.
Convoys of trucks and armored vehicles arrived in Kabul without being attacked by air accompanied by helicopters.
From the end of 2014, the Taliban will no longer be so active in Kabul.
From their unstoppable progress between 1994 and 1996, conditions have changed considerably.
Kabul was empty at the time, and the earth was in blood and fire as a result of fighting between various resistance groups.
Their taking control of the country was then considered a kind of liberation, a return to security.
The Afghans paid the price for the darkness of these villagers, which was completely controlled by Al Qaeda, but their situation has not improved to our time.
The former Mujahideen, the Afghan government and the current Taliban agree in an effort to keep women in a subordinate position.
Major dignitaries from the war against Soviet troops returned to power in 2001.
They became shippers, seizing state land, which they sold as building land to refugees from Iran and Pakistan, and taking advantage of huge US contracts for subcontractors.
They discredited themselves; moreover, most of them have never been in a fight.
From what I&#39;ve heard in the campaigns, people want a government that won&#39;t be made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave as those who have been able to take advantage of American generosity are leaving: capital flight is significant.
Young people are already tired of war and related ideologies.
During exiles in Iran or Pakistan, they got to know the modern world and were fascinated by its benefits.
About 65% of the population is under the age of 25; Kabul currently has a population of 5 million, a fifth of the total population.
Public schools are full in the cities, girls and boys go there.
These young people will have to be given a job, they no longer want to return to the darkness of the former parties or to the corruption of some officials.
Everyone, including the armed opposition, likes cell phones; television and Turkish series that show the modern world are watched everywhere.
The army is already present.
Will the authorities who head it be considered legitimate?
Former commanders of the fight against the Soviet army are already renewing provincial militias that will be beyond the control of central power.
Afghanistan, a mountainous country with a strong influence of local identity, should enjoy a degree of decentralization along the lines of Western states, but the United States wanted to transform it into a centralized state with strong presidential influence, abolishing the post of prime minister since the constitution in in 1964.
President Karzai does not want foreign controls, especially not on the occasion of the elections scheduled for April 2014.
However, his country has been heavily dependent on foreign aid since the 1950s and earlier.
No industry has been restored, no dam is working, no major irrigation system has been repaired.
Everything is imported; nothing is produced but fruits and vegetables.
Private initiative takes precedence.
In a country devastated by three decades of war, government control of infrastructure would be necessary.
Rumors have spread that Afghanistan has enormous mineral resources.
And that only nurtured the feeling that Western states were only here to seize it.
But without energy to process iron ore or copper on site and without the means to transport raw materials across the mountains, no mining can take place.
The Chinese have almost left the Mes Aynak copper mine, leaving international archaeological teams (with the support of the World Bank) the opportunity to explore a large Buddhist site to retain their role as the most important employer in the province.
One day, Afghanistan and Pakistan, on which much of both imports and exports depend, will also need to resume normal relations.
The departure of French combat troops was completed on November 20.
The new cooperation agreement envisages the continuation of common types of assistance: girls &#39;and boys&#39; lyceums, French departments at universities, the French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural fields, support for the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, the &quot;win heart and soul&quot; initiative has been running, attempting the difficult task of reconciling aid and military activities, including the &quot;Civil-Military Steps&quot; service of the Ministry of Defense (Cimic), which was abolished in 2012 but reached thanks to countless French NGOs, a number of successes in the field of common interest and steps for agricultural regeneration in dozens of mountain villages.
These works, which involved a number of local workers, helped to quell the uprising: irrigation, wells, drinking water, afforestation, fruit trees, soil protection and the expansion of the arable land.
What memory will we leave behind after two billion euros of military spending?
A much more modest budget would help to improve local living conditions, which are very challenging in these valleys, which are often above 2,000 m above sea level.
The embassy received dozens of written applications for small agricultural aid from local communities in the province of Kapisa.
In order to free themselves from the uprisings led by foreign groups, these farmers want to see little civic aid in their favor, which is properly controlled and directly affects them.
Difficult work on the Egyptian constitution
President Muhammad Mursi has embarked on another game of poker.
While Egypt remains the most divided in its history due to the promulgation of a constitution that temporarily grants it unlimited powers, it has decided to play the bait.
On Wednesday, he announced, regardless of the opinion of everyone else, that the Constituent Assembly would approve the final text tomorrow.
Less than a week ago, the head of state gave the assembly another two months to complete the necessary work.
For almost two years now, Egypt has been using a provisional text that has been amended many times, weakening the country&#39;s constitutional stability and leading to legal speculation.
This new initiative has only further strengthened the country&#39;s rift.
From the perspective of the opposition, the president persists in his &quot;autocratic delirium,&quot; continues to &quot;break his word&quot; and &quot;trample on the law.&quot;
However, his supporters assure him that this is a means of turning the constitutional and political crisis as quickly as possible and speeding up the transition process.
A referendum should be held in two weeks.
This is a very short period of time that will force the Brotherhood to abandon the intention of the text to explain to the Egyptians article by article.
For the president, it is also a way to regain national and democratic legitimacy while protests run throughout the country.
As confirmed in an interview with the American weekly Time, Muhammad Mursi seems convinced that the Egyptians will vote in favor.
Especially because this hastily organized vote puts the Egyptian people before the ultimatum: &quot;You will either approve my text or I will retain unlimited powers&quot;, which would otherwise end after the approval of the new constitution.
And in this strange atmosphere yesterday, 85 members of the Constituent Assembly, with a large majority of Islamists, approved the text.
Most liberals were absent from the vote.
In mid-November, shortly before the promulgation of the constitution, they slammed the door stating that they could not enforce their views.
Human rights defenders, civil society or members of religious minorities have imitated their move.
In order to reach a quorum, 11 alternate members were hastily added yesterday morning.
Some of them are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
Not surprisingly, the articles of the constitution were often voted on unanimously.
Commentators further commented that one of the few disputes revolved around the ... prayer hour that day, with some committee members believing that the meeting room clock was not set correctly.
The text, which was voted on last night, consists of 234 articles.
The subject of general attention, Article 2, ultimately remains in line with the 1971 version of the Constitution, stating that &quot;the principles of Sharia law are the main source of law&quot;.
The Salafist parties, for whom the introduction of Islamic law is one of the fundamental requirements, hoped to replace the term &quot;principles&quot; with the term &quot;rules&quot;, which would allow for stricter application.
For Islamists, on the other hand, the fact that this article has not been corrected is a sign of their goodwill and respect for other parts of Egyptian society.
&quot;Hypocrisy,&quot; says the Liberals, who see only a rhetorical problem.
According to them, the Islamization of the constitution takes place through other articles.
They focus in particular on Article 220, which entrusts al-Azhar University with an advisory role, in particular on issues related to the control of compliance with Sharia law.
According to Egyptian expert Sophie Pommier, this is disturbing because &quot;those called to speak are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
This can be seen in the beginnings of theocracy &quot;.
Liberals&#39; fears are further fueled by the fact that the university&#39;s next rector should be less moderate than the current one.
&quot;So far, there has been no specific religious consequence.
With this constitution, Egypt remains a broad civil state.
Most of the lawyers who have worked on this text are not ulams, but university staff, many of whom have graduated from French schools, &quot;said Alexis Blouet, who is preparing to work on the constitutional transition in Egypt.
However, he agrees that &quot;there may be inconsistencies in the interpretation of Article 220, as the terms used in it belong to a religious dictionary.
There is in particular a reference to &quot;fiqh&quot; [Islamic jurisprudence, note. ed.].
And in the future, the question may arise as to the extent to which civil judges are competent to comment on this. &quot;
Apart from the religious aspects, the text approved yesterday is highly criticized due to the extended powers it grants to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood insists that they have been significantly reduced compared to the former regime.
Another point of contention: the powers vested in the military.
In line with the wishes of military officials, the verification of the defense budget will not be carried out by parliament, but by the National Defense Council.
Furthermore, proceedings against civilians will not be prohibited in military courts, as requested by the Association for the Protection of Human Rights.
These associations talk about their doubts in connection with the text, which they say is directed against freedom.
The crime of blasphemy is perpetuated and insult is still prohibited, which could have serious consequences for freedom of expression, especially for the press.
In addition, no article deals with the protection of women, emphasizes Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch.
In its view, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture laid down in Article 36.
This word was not mentioned in the previous constitution.
While the Egyptian president was scheduled to speak last night, demonstrations are scheduled for this afternoon.
Supporters of the head of state will then manifest on Saturday.
In Israel, holy places, the navel of the world and the sea from saturated salt solution await Ukrainian tourists
The Promised Land combines the greatness of biblical truths, modern comfort and the integrity of nature.
AaF has identified the five most important reasons why you should visit Israel.
Bow to holy places
Visit the Jordan River, where Jesus was baptized.
It is claimed that God&#39;s mercy will descend on all who enter this &quot;bath.&quot;
And Galilee - the place of Jesus&#39; miracles: the transformation of water into wine at a wedding, walking on water, calming the storm and filling the nets.
Here also Jesus appeared to his disciples and after the resurrection.
But the most holy places are in Jerusalem.
Believers will walk here the Way of Pain or the Way of the Cross (Latin Via Dolorosa).
It begins at the fortress of Antonia - Pretoria - where the trial took place, walks through the streets of the Old Town and leads to the Temple of the Holy Sepulcher on Mount Golgotha - the place of crucifixion, the anointing stone and the place where Jesus was buried.
Here is the symbolic Christian navel of the world, which symbolizes the salvation of humanity.
And the Holy Cross Monastery in Jerusalem was built on the site where, according to Christian legend, a tree grew, from which they made a cross for the crucifixion of Jesus.
Jerusalem also houses the holiest site for Jews - the Wailing Wall, the rest of the temple, which was destroyed by the Romans in 70 AD.
According to tradition, people of different faiths leave notes with wishes here, which are then filled in.
Take the path vertically
The ruins of the fortress of Masada remained from a secret hiding place from the enemy, which Herod the Great built in 25 BC for his family.
The ruins are located on cliffs in the mountains at an altitude of 450 m above sea level.
Only those who are involved in mountaineering can get to it on their own.
The cable car will take the others to this historic mountain.
And in the north of the country, at an altitude of 1600-2040 m, there is the famous ski resort Hermon, which experiences a huge influx of tourists in the winter months.
A shuttle bus takes tourists from the foot of the hill to this ski paradise.
The total length of the mountain slopes is 45 km.
According to an ancient legend, pagan gods allegedly lived on top of the mountain.
Visit unique museums
There are about 300 museums in this country.
You can&#39;t visit them all in one trip.
But at least five of them, the most interesting, are definitely worth a visit.
Among them is the Museum of Israel, which is located near the Knesset (Parliament).
It contains ancient Qumran manuscripts or scrolls from the Dead Sea, which were found in the caves of the Judean Desert, as well as approximately 500,000 archaeological and anthropological exhibits.
The Tel Aviv Museum of Art is also worth a visit.
Impressionists and expressionists Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall and Picasso are widely represented in his exhibition with their canvases.
In Akkon, you can visit the Al Basha Spa Museum, which introduces visitors to several rooms of the ancient Turkish baths with mannequins of the spa users and spa nurses from that time.
In Caesarei, the unique private Ralli Museum is worth a visit, where you can admire the statues of Dali and Roden.
There are no guides or souvenir shops.
Admission is free and donations are strictly refused.
The Fifth Museum - the Holocaust Museum or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv - tells the story of one of the most dramatic aspects of history.
The most tragic part of the museum - the Children&#39;s Memorial - was built in memory of 1.5 million children who were murdered in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You enter inside - and you find yourself in complete darkness.
The stars are glittering.
And the names of the Jewish children and the names of the countries in which they perished are heard.
Ukraine is also mentioned.
Improve your health
Israel&#39;s three main spas are located on the shores of the Mediterranean, Red and Dead Seas.
Each offers swimming pools, aqua parks, a dolphinarium and an oceanarium.
It is interesting that you can swim in the Red Sea even in the winter months, because the water temperature in it does not fall below 21 degrees Celsius and the air heats up to 23 degrees.
The Dead Sea is even warmer, and people bathe in it all year round.
By the way, the Dead Sea is the strangest sea in the world, located at the lowest land point on the planet - at 417 m below sea level.
The azure water in it is a saturated saline solution that easily keeps even those who cannot swim afloat.
The surrounding landscape is unrealistically beautiful.
Come here to undergo treatment using salt water - brine, and a healing mud that can cure health problems with dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes to heal tangled nerves.
Touch the mysterious ancient past
It is protected by the ancient part of Tel Aviv - the town of Jaffa on the Mediterranean coast.
The famous sea route connecting Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia passed through them.
Mentions of this city are found in the oldest Greek and Egyptian legends.
According to legend, this is where Noah built his ark and Perseus saved the beautiful Andromeda, with whom they lived a long and happy life together.
Tourists really love wandering the narrow streets, named after the signs of the zodiac.
It is said that if you press against the walls in the alley of &quot;your&quot; sign, happiness will be favorable to you.
In Jaffa, you may meet newlyweds who come here from all over Israel and even other countries to be photographed.
And in Caesarea - in the city of King Herod - you can walk through the Roman theater and &quot;conquer&quot; the fortress of the Crusaders.
In Roman times, Caesarea was the capital of Judea and the seat of Roman prosecutors, including Pontius Pilate.
Today, the carefully renovated theater is used for evening concerts and opera performances.
Tourists, just a word
If you are going to Israel, you do not have to worry about your imperfect English: in this country, about 30% of the population speaks Russian.
It is better to take money with you on the trip, not in euros, but in dollars, which you can easily exchange for shekels (now $ 1 is about 3.8 shekels).
Public transport is mainly buses, but there is a high-speed tram in Jerusalem and the city of Haifa has the only metro line in the country with six stations, which connects the lower city with the upper one.
It is basically an underground cable car.
Traveling by all types of public transport costs 6 shekels, for which you can drive with a change of 1.5 hours.
According to Jewish tradition, Shabbat is celebrated on Saturday in Israel.
From Friday evening until sunset on Saturday, work stops in markets, shops and public transport.
And the work week starts on Sunday morning.
In many cafes, restaurants and hotels, you only get kosher food: with the exception of pork, seafood, unscaled fish and dishes that contain a combination of milk and meat.
They offer a large selection of lamb and beef dishes, soups and desserts, prepared from coconut milk, traditional Jewish porridge hummus, various types of sauces, balls of ground chickpeas - falafel, fruits and vegetables.
There are no stray dogs on the streets of Israeli cities.
On the other hand, there are many fattened cats that gracefully &quot;wander according to their taste&quot;.
In the evening, you can see them sleeping on the roofs of parked cars.
Previous cats love populated places and with gusto indulge in every goodness.
Car rental will cost from $ 37 per day (Hyundai Getz) to $ 188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80) per day, depending on the car brand.
Plus insurance - $ 15 a day.
And renting a bike will cost around 15 shekels a day.
Museum tickets cost an average of 30 shekels.
Expressed by numbers
In 2012, more than three million tourists from all over the world visited Israel.
Most citizens of the USA, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England and Ukraine came to get to know the country and relax.
From January to October 2012, 118.8 thousand visited the Promised Land. Ukrainian tourists, which is 51% more than in the same period in 2010, before the abolition of visas on February 9, 2011.
The &quot;big and powerful&quot; will announce this in Moscow: emigrants will save money on their language
While MPs and human rights defenders are still debating the law on compulsory language tests, fraudsters have already appeared in the country selling &quot;forged&quot; certificates.
Every year, 13 million foreign workers come to Moscow, St. Petersburg and other Russian cities.
Most of them are citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to make enough money to support families at home.
On December 1, a law came into force, according to which every working migrant will be required to pass an examination in Russian language skills.
So far, this rule only applies to those who intend to work in the services sector, housing and communal economy, lifestyle and retail.
However, the FMS promises that over time, appropriate tests will be mandatory for all visitors.
However, the exams will consist not only of language skills, but also of Russian history and the basics of law.
Knowledge of the language will also need to be confirmed in order to obtain and renew a work permit.
The exception only applies to citizens of countries where Russian is an official language.
Even people who have successfully achieved attestation and obtained an academic diploma until the collapse of the USSR in 1991 are not subject to this law.
Benefit, condemnation and protection of rights
The network of examination sites will operate under the auspices of the Pushkin Institute of the Russian Language, the University of Friendship between Nations, Moscow State University, and the State University of St. Petersburg. St. Petersburg and other Russian universities.
Migrants can take exams in all cities; more than 160 such centers are already open in Russia today.
The initiative to support the introduction of testing was also supported by members of the State Duma and the FMS (Federal Migration Service).
But before the law came into force, human rights defenders were able to ask the press many times in the press: and what will it actually bring?
What will change the obligation to know the language for the Russians and for the visitors themselves?
So above all - answer the representatives of the migration service - it will reduce the number of people who suffer as a result of &quot;slave labor.&quot;
Many people today are talking about protecting the rights of migrant workers, explains Viktor Sebelev, chairman of the board of FMS Russia in Tajikistan.
The protection of their rights should start before they leave.
Only a system of organized recruitment will make it possible to solve 90% of the problems of foreign workers.
Problems arise for emigrants without a profession, without education, who do not know the language and do not have a medical examination.
Without knowledge of the language - says Sebelev with conviction - the future migrant is doomed to clash with dishonest people, who, under the pretext of helping, provide him with a &quot;voucher&quot; to horrible, cramped hostels where he and dozens of others like himself will suffer for months. without food and documents and work for 12 to 14 hours a day.
We receive many complaints from our migrant workers.
&quot;In their homeland, they promise them one thing, but upon arrival they cheat them, confiscate their passports, do not pay the promised wages,&quot; confirms the head of the Main Tajik Labor Migration Administration, Tolib Sharipov.
Don&#39;t swear!
All the less so because many Central Asian citizens who intend to go to work in Russia recognize that they not only do not know the language of the country they want to go to, but do not even have experience with the work.
Of course, it is not so much their fault as disaster: very few Turkmen, Uzbeks, Tajiks can afford to get at least an adequate basic education.
After all, their families also need to feed their children with something, not to mention the fact that they need to be properly dressed, dressed and equipped for school.
As children reach productive age, they must go to work at the first opportunity.
Without knowledge of the language, it&#39;s hard - they admit.
&quot;You feel humiliated and inferior.&quot;
It is true that, with regard to the law on language tests, human rights defenders point to one important thing.
Testing will only be performed on those migrants who have a legal status.
If they don&#39;t have it, they won&#39;t pass exams or get any other official work.
Meanwhile, as before, most migrant workers live illegally in Russia.
&quot;Welcome, or Unauthorized Entry Prohibited&quot;
Many of the incoming workers claim that obtaining official status in our country is not easy.
The reason - bureaucratic obstacles and all those language difficulties.
Legalization also costs money: from 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
But fake registration can be obtained quickly and only one and a half thousand.
Russian police officers know that we have basically fake documents, without registration, and this results in cases of extortion.
&quot;They require a hundred, two for cigarettes, tea,&quot; - shared with reporters his experience Tajik citizen Umed Kushadamov.
&quot;Come on, don&#39;t be greedy, buy a painting&quot;
On the first day of the law on language, it was found that not only migrants&#39; registration documents are false.
FMS staff have already confiscated several fake language test certificates.
Forged documents are printed on a plain color printer.
Of course, they did not get to the new owners for free: each of the migrants, hoping to ease the problem of passing the tests, paid seven thousand rubles for this document.
That is two and a half times the amount than passing the official test: it will cost migrant workers three thousand rubles.
The main task of the near future is to secure the system against corruption so that workers cannot simply buy documents, government officials and human rights defenders agree.
In the meantime, the government authorities can promise foreign workers who have failed the tests for the first time the time they need to take a basic Russian language course.
Visitors who do not speak Russian are expected to work in areas where active interaction with people is not required.
The MVD (Ministry of the Interior) does not circulate the illegal arms market
The proportion of crimes using legally held weapons is very low
The Russian Ministry of Interior is proposing a tightening of the law in relation to owners of civilian weapons.
It is the government&#39;s response to recent events: the impetus was the shooting of marriage without casualties, and the massacre planned by Moscow lawyer Dimitri Vinogradov, which killed seven people.
Police want to ban the carrying of dangerous weapons in public places and raise the age at which a license to carry a weapon can be obtained - from 18 to 21 years.
This idea is supported by the head of the Duma Committee on Security and Anti-Corruption Irina Jarovaja, who promised that changes to the law on weapons will be submitted to the State Duma in the near future.
Not everyone is satisfied that the Russian authorities are trying to deal with the problem by &quot;tightening the screws&quot;.
An open letter appeared in the network, the authors of which - representatives of various social shooting organizations - demand the rejection of the &quot;meaningless tightening&quot; of the law.
The percentage of hooliganism with registered weapons is minimal, said Vasily Lesnikov, a lawyer and forensic scientist in an interview with the Russian BBC.
According to statistics from the Ministry of the Interior, 142 crimes against the use of firearms registered by the Ministry of the Interior were committed in the first six months of 2012, while a total of 1168 thousand crimes were committed during the same period.
The authors of the open letter are convinced that the tightening of legislation on civilian weapons will not force the perpetrator to move to the &quot;black&quot; market.
According to them, any weapon can currently be found in Moscow at a low price.
Currently, the Ministry of the Interior claims that the situation with the proliferation of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: from races to officers
The &quot;black&quot; arms market is supplied by several channels.
There are five main channels, says retired Colonel Victor Baraněc, who worked for ten years at the Ministry of Education and the General Staff.
Screenshot of sites that accept orders for weapons
The first of these - the &quot;military or military route&quot;, that is, a weapon that was stolen during the fighting in the Caucasus.
&quot;The weapons were also stolen by Russian officers and the Caucasians themselves,&quot; says Baraněc.
Another type of &quot;black weapons&quot; are weapons stolen by criminals from security forces.
Baranec explains that this also includes thefts from police warehouses and weapons stolen directly from employees of law enforcement agencies.
Illegal &quot;barrels&quot; come on sale from military warehouses.
Explosions often occur in many military warehouses.
&quot;It has been proven that some fires were started intentionally - to cover the shortage,&quot; says the former soldier.
According to Barance, arms manufacturers also make their contribution.
&quot;Private armaments companies that are not competitive on the international market are currently being set up and are phasing out weapons that they are supplying to the black market, including Moscow,&quot; the expert said.
Another source of the &quot;black&quot; market is smuggling.
A particularly large number of pistols and machine guns come from poor countries such as Kyrgyzstan.
&quot;There is their production, sometimes weapons are produced in small-scale production, and a mafia was formed, which organized their continuous production,&quot; explains the former soldier.
Where is the weapon from?
Experts summed up the approximate share of individual sources of supply of illegal weapons to the &quot;black&quot; market.
The report on this issue was prepared in 2011 by the Center for Problem Analysis and Public Administration Design.
The specialists analyzed reports from the Ministry of the Interior and the Russian Statistical Office, criminological literature and data from public data portals focused on the topic of weapons.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, researchers say, come from military and executive bodies.
Half of all weapons have found themselves on the black market &quot;through the fault of officials whose work is linked to weapons,&quot; the report said.
According to the data available to researchers, 17% of weapons come from armed conflicts, in 14% of cases the weapons were stolen during their production, 5% are &quot;black archeology&quot;.
The salesman-consultant of one of the arms stores, who asked us not to mention his name, is convinced that the weapons found in the excavations by black &quot;archaeologists&quot; have long since been bought - they are simply too old.
Most often, as he says, sellers go directly to military warehouses for new shipments.
Through the ensign, the applicant buys a unit, such as a TT pistol.
You order a weapon from him and he will sell it to you over the fence.
&quot;He will take it to the city and sell it there for 900 euros per piece with two magazines,&quot; he says.
&quot;The truth is that the police are well in the picture, so whenever they start burning a plan to clarify crimes, they will make a check-up purchase from illegal arms dealers,&quot; the adviser added.
&quot;Like in a luxury store&quot;
The seller and the buyer most often find each other through their acquaintances.
I visited websites and blogs until a guy appeared who offered me the opportunity to go to the &quot;Trial&quot; platform, where there would be a man who would lead me to the &quot;corner&quot; where we would act together.
I learned the price mainly there
Military correspondent Viktor Baraněc
If I want to get a gun, I need an acquaintance who knows the way out, says the salesman - a consultant. - I have such an acquaintance, but I do not fully trust him.
There are sellers on the market, but there is also a need to go, hypothetically &quot;from Mr. Ivan Ivanovich, who asked me to tell my daughter that a tooth had fallen out.&quot;
And now I&#39;ll get there through a person I&#39;m sure of.
He will only deliver them to me, because he knows I will not give him.
Beginners look for weapons in different ways.
Former soldier Viktor Baraněc tried to buy illegal weapons in the mid-1990s, when he was working on a paper for publication on this topic.
According to him, the schemes did not change.
They gave him a photo album with &quot;everything you thought of&quot;.
&quot;I felt like I was in a luxury store,&quot; the soldier recalls.
According to Baranec, they do not offer rabbits in a sack to the buyer - you can try everything.
I, a potential client, just don&#39;t buy - we go to the forest with the seller and we set a target.
&quot;They give me a chance to shoot, and when I make sure the gun shoots well, we start acting,&quot; the expert describes the procedure.
Tray on the sofa
Search engines will take you on the Internet to websites and groups on &quot;Vkontaktu&quot;, where they offer to buy weapons &quot;for various purposes&quot;.
No documents or face-to-face meetings are required.
&quot;All you have to do is have a set amount of money,&quot; they write in an ad headline on the &quot;Buy a Combat Gun or Slot Machine&quot; website.
On these pages, users leave their notifications and ask questions.
And sales to minors?
&quot;Of course without a license,&quot; the user &quot;Ivan&quot; asks (spelling is preserved).
&quot;I will buy TT.Moscow&quot; - briefly formulates the request &quot;Fedorenkov.&quot;
The Federal Security Service recently launched a vast network of embedded websites, and people wishing to buy a military weapon can rake in a shovel.
People flock like hungry fish for bait and then mine coal in Siberia.
Military correspondent and senior military dignitary Viktor Baraněc
I have heard of such schemes: websites are usually registered outside the scope of Russian law.
People take orders.
The buyer makes the payment through an ATM.
&quot;In response, the seller will send him a photo and a description with instructions on where the weapon is hidden,&quot; said Dmitry Kislov, a spokesman for the NGO &quot;Right to a Gun&quot;.
Viktor Baraněc confirms that after placing an order on the website, you can be left unarmed and find yourself behind bars.
The Federal Security Service recently launched a vast network of embedded websites, and people wishing to buy a military weapon can rake in a shovel.
&quot;People flock like hungry fish for bait and then mine coal in Siberia,&quot; he confirms.
Makarov for $ 100
When you buy an illegal firearm, experts estimate that you usually pay between $ 100 and $ 900.
According to Dmitry Kislov from the NGO &quot;Right to a Gun&quot;, you can buy a Makarov pistol for $ 100 to $ 300.
You have to wait a month to one and a half months.
The weapon is shipped from warehouses for long-term storage through the warehouses of the middle article.
According to the official statistical office, the number of these crimes in Russia decreased by a total of 7% compared to January-October 2011, amounting to 22.9 thousand, and the number of clarified cases of theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices decreased by 7.8%.
In the US, fast food and supermarket workers are on strike
Up to a quarter of all American teenagers will work at the box office of the McDonald&#39;s
In recent days, there has been a wave of protests in America against low wages in Walmart hypermarkets and restaurants of popular fast food chains such as &quot;McDonald&#39;s&quot;, &quot;Burger King&quot;, &quot;Taco Bell&quot;, &quot;Wendy&#39;s&quot; and &quot;Kentucky Fried Chicken&quot;.
So far, no one can predict whether this wave will turn into a ninth wave, or whether it is destined to disappear soon.
The whole event is supported by trade unions and a number of left-wing social organizations.
In addition to the increase in the modest salaries that ordinary workers at Walmart and the fast food systems receive, the goal of the protest organizers is to achieve their creation in their trade unions.
At present, this economic sector is virtually untouched by the trade union movement.
46 cents a year?
The events began last week after Thanksgiving, the so-called &quot;Black Friday&quot;, when an orgy of cheap sales struck America, engulfed millions of people and in some cases was accompanied by fights.
On this day, some workers at Walmart, which employs 2.2 million people worldwide, left their jobs and demonstrated with unions and left-wing activists from multinational retailers whose goods are targeted at lower and middle class people.
Walmart sells everything from diapers to hunting rifles and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
Products in its stores are on average 8% to 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
That&#39;s why many low-wage employees in Walmart stores only shop at home.
The availability and range of goods have made Walmart one of the largest companies in America.
According to critics, Walmart can afford to sell goods so cheaply in part because they pay little to their employees.
They also complain about poor working conditions, such as the lack of automatic carts or hand-held scanners.
&quot;Black Friday&quot; protesters demanded a salary increase and complained that the cost of health insurance provided by the company had risen sharply from $ 30 to $ 100 a month.
A typical Walmart worker receives $ 9.5 an hour, but that doesn&#39;t match the amount of expenses, employees say.
Researchers at the University of California at Berkeley show that if Walmart raises the average wage to $ 12 an hour, it will cost the company $ 3.2 billion a year.
That&#39;s an average of 1.1% more than this company spends on salaries now.
If Walmart moves wage increases fully to consumers, each store visit will cost only 46 cents more.
In a year, customers will spend approximately $ 12.39 more than today.
Advocates of Walmart point out that the protest took place in only nine countries and that the company should do virtually no damage.
&quot;Black Friday&quot; in the company&#39;s stores lasted from 8 a.m. Thursday to midnight the following day, during which time Walmart sold about 5,000 items per second.
In total, its cash registers carried out almost 100 million transactions on &quot;Black Friday&quot;.
A spokesman for Dan Fogelman said in an interview with the left-wing Huffington Post website that a total of &quot;less than five&quot; Walmart employees had left their jobs, and that the protest was a &quot;further media sensation&quot; organized by unions.
&quot;Unoccupied cash register!&quot;
The protests continued this week in New York, where they were not aimed at Walmart department stores (they are not very popular in the progressive city, and therefore are almost non-existent), but &quot;McDonald&#39;s&quot; and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald says he sells billions of servings, and then he doesn&#39;t even pay you sick and don&#39;t pay you properly for your honest work!
Jumaane Williams, a member of New York City Council
Currently, the minimum wage for work under federal law and New York State regulations is $ 7.25 per hour.
Fast food restaurants are gradually raising this salary, but only slightly, and on average their ordinary employees in New York receive $ 8.90 per hour.
In this expensive city, no one has a lower wage.
I don&#39;t quite understand how you can exist in New York for such money.
Nearly a quarter of American teenagers who work part-time behind the counter after school and live with their parents are employed by McDonald&#39;s.
Few people see this as their main source of livelihood or plan to stay there for long.
Nowadays, I constantly meet in conversation with &quot;McDonald&#39;s&quot; workers who complain that they have to live on this money and sometimes even feed their children from it.
On the other hand, there is a comment on the Wall Street Journal forum, the author of which notes that it is irresponsible to have children if you do not know how to feed them.
Protesters, which began at 6:30 a.m. Thursday at &quot;McDonald&#39;s&quot; on 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that cashiers and fast food chefs start receiving at least $ 15 an hour, more than double their current minimum. wages.
They also demanded that trade unions be formed in the field of fast food.
U.S. laws prohibit the administration from preventing union formation and punishing union activists with bullying and dismissal.
On the other hand, administration seldom makes their lives easier.
However, it is difficult to establish trade unions in fast food companies for objective reasons as well.
One of the main reasons is the extremely high turnover of employees.
Disagreement
Noisy protests also took place on this day in a number of other cheap Manhattan restaurants.
The culmination of the event was a rally at McDonald&#39;s near Times Square at noon, where several local Democratic politicians spoke, most notably City Council member Jumaane Williams, who said &quot;McDonald&#39;s&quot; says he sells billions of portions and then doesn&#39;t pay you sick you properly for your honest work! &quot;
Demonstrators also received support from other prominent New York Democrats, such as mayoral candidate Bill de Blasio, who said that &quot;we must work together to support fast food workers to achieve the fair reward for their work and the economic prosperity that every New Yorker deserves! &quot;
As described by the New York Times, it was the largest event of its kind in the history of the American fast food industry.
But only a few hundred people took part, although far from all of them were fast food employees who employed tens of thousands of people in New York.
Whether this event will become a spark that ignites the flame of the mass movement is still unclear.
&quot;So far, the brain has been deceiving on average&quot;
Among fans of modern virtual reality technology, the topic of augmented reality is popular; Recently, this means perceiving the world especially through the prism of special glasses.
At its annual conference in early summer, Google unveiled a working model for the innovation, and in November, it was announced that Microsoft had also applied for a patent.
An interview with Sharam Izadi, head of the interactive 3D technology group at Microsoft&#39;s Cambridge Laboratory, shows that glasses are a thing of the past for the company&#39;s scientists.
They are attracted by the perspective of manipulating virtual objects in the air with bare hands, creating virtual public spaces.
- Please tell us in outline what your research group is doing?
- We deal with human-machine interactions, but at the same time we try to push the boundaries of this interaction.
So far, humanity is stuck in the stage of working with pixels on a flat screen, at most sometimes it touches the screen with a finger.
We want to look 5-10 years ahead and anticipate significant changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and Kinect sensors - this is a step forward, and almost no Xbox today is for sale without Kinect sensors, because the ability to use gestures is very interesting for everyone.
- What else awaits us in the future?
- Despite the fact that the Kinect system has transferred the interaction to the physical level, many interactions still take place on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input flow of information has improved (the system receives a larger amount of data), but so far the output flow is not separate.
We are trying to change that, we are working on truly three-dimensional imaging systems based on various technologies, including projective ones.
It is necessary to let the computer world into our physical world, to make it more real.
For this purpose, however, it is necessary to know not only the user, but also the space around him.
Then we will be able to add virtual objects to the real world in a much more convenient form.
And first of all - to hell with those stupid virtual reality helmets!
- What do you think about voice control?
This is a popular thing, but isn&#39;t it overrated?
- Certainly he cannot be considered a panacea - the question of privacy arises, because we do not always want to inform others around us about our activities and intentions.
In fact, all types of computer interactions are good, but in their own environment.
For example, to control the device in public places, we had a project in which we thought about gestures, but not sweeping, just such stingy, short ones.
The gestures would not be captured by the camera of the device, but by a bracelet that would monitor the movements of the bones and muscles.
So far, it is large, but theoretically it can be reduced to the size of a wristwatch.
In general, however, the future has a mixed type of control, such as gesture + voice.
- How&#39;s that?
- How do you ask me to give you this can of lemonade, for example?
You say it and you show it at the same time.
- I usually just talk.
- Oh, it will be very difficult to recognize.
- So you want to get users to adapt to what the machine can or can&#39;t do at the moment?
- It&#39;s not necessary at all, but it&#39;s a rapprochement.
I think that in the near future we will have to work mainly on the development of new types of sensors that can more accurately detect human reactions.
These can be, for example, laser sensors that provide relatively good depth resolution, which is very important.
- If you talk about your work with Xbox Kinect sensors, what are your requirements for modern cameras?
Isn&#39;t there enough resolution, depth or something else today?
- Basically the current generation - this is what we can reflect on in our work on three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, it would be good to get 8 megapixels at 1000 f / s.
But it&#39;s not just the megapixels themselves, but like the matrix and depth.
At the same time, all current technologies are insufficient for us - this adds work to algorithm designers.
So we have to keep in mind not only the resolution in the X and Y axes, but also Z.
So speed, number of frames per second are also very important.
Human movement is relatively dynamic and current data rates of 30 frames per second are frankly a little, especially for gestures.
Stephen Betishes of our laboratory in Redmond made a touch sensor with an adjustable processing delay of 1 to 100 ms, while the current, mass-produced sensors are closer to the second value (60-100 ms).
Not everyone understands the extent to which this affects a person&#39;s interaction with a machine.
For me, the equivalent of such a device would be very useful at work, I just don&#39;t need as many touches, but I need some extra frames per second.
- And is it not necessary to increase the number of cameras?
- The Kinect system now uses three &quot;cameras&quot;, one of which is actually an infrared transmitter and the other - a receiver of the reflected signal.
And the third camera - this is actually a common visible band sensor.
It is not used to determine the depth of an object.
More cameras could potentially solve the problem ...
Or make it worse, because it would increase the necessary amount of calculations.
It would be nice to create a flexible Kinect analog system, play around with the curvature of the camera locations, and see how it helps in determining the three-dimensional position.
- If I remember correctly, Microsoft (unlike Google) did not present its glasses publicly.
Don&#39;t you think it&#39;s one of the most promising platforms when it comes to everyday use of augmented reality technology with special glasses?
- Of course walking and constantly holding the smatphone in raised hands is not very comfortable, but I think: the strongest option would be a &quot;portable&quot; form of augmenting reality, where it would be possible to switch at any time from glasses to smartphone, projection screen and more round and round.
Glasses - this is a very personal device, there is their strength (private things only you see), and at the same time weakness - augmented reality based on glasses will not allow you to work on virtual objects at the same time with other people.
- Imagine for a second that manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is available not only to Tony Stark in &quot;Iron Man&quot;, but also to the average mortal.
There is one problem that critics often point out: there is no tactile response!
The hands do not feel anything!
What responses is your group preparing for this challenge?
- In my lectures I often say that augmented reality - this is the seventh consecutive breakthrough in the mutual interaction between man and machine.
I think that the addition of tactile sensations could easily become the eighth breakthrough.
So far, one of the interesting tricks is used - using the other hand as a kind of background for imaging.
It records compression in an excellent way!
But there are also technologies that are really aimed at adding tangibility to these &quot;images in the air&quot; - for example, the interference of several directional ultrasound beams at a defined point where the finger is located evokes a tactile feeling, but it&#39;s still very weak - as if you were blowing on tummy of fingers.
There is also a wrist bracelet that affects the nerve endings in the fingers - also a promising direction.
- Have you tried to fool your brain yet?
To think he feels what he seems he should feel at a given moment when he sees something?
- That&#39;s a good idea, we haven&#39;t tried it yet.
There is another challenge that will be fought for a long time to come - how to get a person who is physically in a very cramped space to believe that he is walking through open, practically endless space - we are also working on the concept of cross-country trails (not at all, as in clubs), moving platforms and also huge balls.
If deception of the brain becomes the goal, then there is still work for many years.
This is what makes working on virtual reality so appealing to researchers - many things are in their infancy.
Tastings instead of culture - Rosbalt.ru
&quot;Rosbalt&quot; is a continuation of the &quot;St. Petersburg Avant-Garde&quot; project, dedicated to the citizens who are at the forefront, they are the avant-garde of culture and art.
At the top of the list were already prominent figures in the art scene of St. Petersburg, whose achievements go beyond the city, often finding recognition in Europe without gaining all-Russian fame.
The new hero of &quot;Rosbalt&quot; is the stunning artist Cyril Miller.
The whole city knows Cyril Miller - a bearded man who is dressed all in red, whom you meet here at the Russian Museum, here at the Summer Garden, here in fashionable pubs and openings.
Cyril Miller&#39;s paintings, wherever they are exhibited, always attract crowds of spectators.
Cyril Miller is one of the purely social and philosophical narrators of St. Petersburg, creators of new mythologies.
Cyril Miller - a striking man of the St. Petersburg avant-garde of the late 80&#39;s and early 90&#39;s.
In addition to being an urban person, his appearance on the streets evokes a smile on the faces of the citizens, raising everyone&#39;s spirits.
He recently took the flute and became a St. Petersburg flute player, because he matured into this complex role with his entire bohemian life, philosophy and image.
- Cyril, why do you walk around the city all in red and not yellow or turquoise, for example?
- I chose red as a designer dealing with appearance and image.
In this world, red is a compromise between the artist, the imagemaker and the public.
Although, in general, anything that is just a little different from gray arouses aggression and awakens bad qualities.
But my provocations are aimed at establishing a conversation.
The whole history of my provocative actions is above all an invitation to a discussion.
- And when did you understand that you had to be an artist?
- At an exhibition in the House of Culture on Nevsky, where my works were exhibited.
I understood what my path was.
At that time, a wave of old free unofficial artists passed and I could not understand the new, free types of artists.
I befriended the artists of the new wave, the post-Gazonevsky who brought us to &quot;Pushkinska 10&quot;, and there were no other waves.
It attracts me to theater, dressing, music, all genres except words.
- And it all came together in your art clinic ...- It was important for me to find myself in the center of culture in St. Petersburg, where all the best forces of creativity should gather.
In 1995, I occupied a place at Puškinská 10, and even before the reconstruction there was a music and art club, a bohemian club, the home of St. Petersburg bohemians.
Many were born there: NOM, Tequila Jazz, don&#39;t forget how Šnura was brought with the &quot;Ear of Van Gogh&quot; project.
Šnur and his friends sang light songs under the plywood, dressed in tight leotards, in the middle between them the composer Igor Vdovin, who is now in fashion.
When the band started playing live, it became &quot;Leningrad&quot;.
Trachtenberg led many programs of the Galician days.
We gave them Trachtenberg, thus beginning his great career, basic education and training from us.
Gallery &quot;D 137&quot;, club &quot;Griboyedov - this is the reverberation of Art Clinic.
Our working and regular guests left here.
I am the hero of the last century, when culture still meant something.
In 2000, a survey was organized was in the press, a special award was &quot;People in our city&quot;.
I was named &quot;Artist of the Year&quot; in the nomination, ending my climax.
In new times, according to the old rules, work is unpleasant, I am a man of truth, honesty and culture of the last century.
Nowadays, it&#39;s easy to become popular, but culture and popularity today are different things you can be popular with, but not very cultural.
- Your works are characterized in a recognizable way.
- Many of my paintings - these are hits that vividly capture the topicality and penetration.
I will have a program exhibition &quot;Russian Museum in Clowns&quot;.
Clowns are a timeless category.
I used to be sociable, today being such is painful and terrible.
But in clowns, everything is blurred, tragedy is filmed.
I love grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, to save the world by totalitarian disguise in the order of regulations.
Today, people meet by dress, focusing on external mechanics, not internal man.
Or maybe he can&#39;t shake his hand and you have to spit in his face.
And the delusion will be removed by changing.
- We recently saw you in the role of a city flasinetist. - A cultural city should have such a hero.
And who should it be, if not me?
- And can commercial art be beautiful?
- At present, commercial, applied arts should be thorough, tactful, sweet.
Cultures disintegrate.
In the past, people met in groups, bohemians loved one, simple other people.
Today, everything has broken down into micro-societies, today it is very difficult to please everyone.
I&#39;m not a hundred-dollar bill, to please everyone.
Today you need to think about who you like.
Today, every cultural hero has 100 fans.
- And several thousand spectators will come to Stas Mikhailov!
- Fans will come to him, the sexual and social sphere is involved.
And 300 people come to the cultural ground and 10,000 of them don&#39;t come, and the result is less management, money, everything withers.
I have fans, the main thing is that no one deceives them and violates what is experienced.
When I was young, I painted pictures that hung on the wall of a collector along with Falk and Larion.
I started with images that people usually end with.
Today, people often confuse concepts.
They say: Spiritual culture, consumer culture.
There is no consumer culture, it is from elsewhere.
I am a man of culture yesterday, I grew up on the examples of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, refusing money because of drawing paintings.
And I&#39;m for such a culture.
- Cyril, what is the shortage in St. Petersburg?
- Good cultural experts.
There is such a concept: the official through culture.
But not all of them can deal with culture.
In the days of the proper tsars, this was not the case, the tsars may not have understood much of culture, but they understood the need to support real experts.
There are good consultants in Moscow today.
Here in St. Petersburg, we have people who could be experts, but they are tucked away in a corner, because we need great experts who will properly appreciate these experts and put them on the right path.
Today, Vkusov thrives.
The same Erart, but they differ in that they honestly say that we do not accept all modern art, there are artists who should look for other museums.
- What do you think is Petersburg?
- St. Petersburg - it is not the capital of culture, in Moscow there is much more culture, there is the right soil.
And on our eel, art is doing poorly.
We need a cultural ground, but we have more writers than readers today, which is wrong.
There are very many people in Europe who are curious, who like to go to exhibitions, concerts.
In our country, such a layer is only weak.
We need art to become fashionable, as it was at the beginning of the last century.
The project is implemented with a grant from St. Petersburg
Give birth in space
The country is in danger.
Global warming or collision with a killer asteroid.
Spaceships with spaceships on board set out in search of an alternate planet.
In order to save humanity, the main question arises: how to keep one&#39;s family in conditions of weightlessness or on a given surrogate planet?
I don&#39;t think the choice is big.
In fact, there are only two planets that can be mastered, even if only hypothetically.
&quot;It&#39;s Venus and Mars,&quot; says Vladimir Surdin, a senior scientist at the PK Sternberg State Astronomical Institute (SAIŠ).
But while there are better living conditions on Mars, they reach temperatures of 500 degrees Celsius on the surface of Venus.
It is only possible to live there at great altitude or in the orbit of Venus ... in space.
Scientists with flora began to address the issue of reproduction in space.
Experiments on plants were carried out half a century ago.
The four generations of peas grown in orbit are no different from their earthly relatives.
Then the insects were carried out into orbit - very small fruit flies Drosophila.
In 1979, a quail egg was sent into space to see how an embryo develops in a weightless state.
At the output we get an absolutely normal bird.
But then the problems begin.
&quot;There is a problem with this bird having to find support, stand on its own two feet and start moving,&quot; said Vladimir Sychev, head of the RAN Institute of Biomedical Problems (IBMP).
If they find no support, the birds fall chaotically and do somersaults.
After 10 hours, the freshly hatched birds completely lost their instincts.
The birds did not respond to light or sound.
And the problem was, they just died within four days.
&quot;We let the birds hatch twice, but then we refused because it&#39;s just impossible to work with them there,&quot; commented Vladimir Sychev on the failure of the experiment with chickens in space.
The last &quot;miniarcha&quot; with animals flew into orbit 16 years ago.
In the spring of 2013, the experiments will continue.
In the &quot;Bion&quot; biosatellite, however, there will be only beings of the same sex.
An experiment was performed with rats that were already sent into space pregnant.
Basically, they didn&#39;t find anything supernatural there.
&quot;It was only on biosatellites, but again - this is a unique experiment and such experiments need to be performed,&quot; says Vladimir Sychev.
After landing on the ground, the cosmic rats gave birth to offspring.
However, it has not yet been possible to approach the problem of reproduction directly in space.
It is a difficult task.
Animals simply cannot realize their sexual instinct when they lose their usual environment.
Man, unlike animals, can in principle.
Homo sapiens masters abstract thinking and is able to create an appropriate emotional background.
For ethical reasons, similar experiments are not performed.
But women have been flying into space for 50 years.
The greatest danger was threatened by Těreškovová.
The most precious thing humanity has is the female body.
Our Seagull flew away and no one on Earth could tell if it would last a flight into space.
Whether he can give birth to a child after such a flight.
&quot;After all, no one has answered this question yet,&quot; says Vachtang Vachnadze, a veteran of the rocket-space industry.
In June 1964, more than a year after space flight, the first female cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova gave birth to a daughter.
The child&#39;s father was also cosmonaut Andrijan Nikolajev.
In 1988, the son of the second woman cosmonaut, Světlana Savická, was born, who visited the orbit twice and who also worked in the open space.
However, the risk remains.
We have only a few astronauts who, after many years, have born and grown healthy offspring.
&quot;In addition, it can be dangerous during orbital flights,&quot; said cosmonaut pilot, Hero of the Soviet Union and Hero of Russia Valery Polyakov.
Nevertheless, humanity must inevitably look for new ways in biotechnology, radiation protection and the creation of artificial gravity.
The CPK hydroboratory is a mandatory stage of preparation for flight.
Here, in zero-gravity conditions, astronauts acquire the habits needed to work in open space.
Water mimics the state of weightlessness.
Although water is a comfortable but strange environment for adults, it is a natural element for young children.
The little ichtianders seem to confirm that life on earth comes from the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that the baby is in the mother&#39;s amniotic fluid for an average of 9 months and that it is then easier for them to get used to the water.
In principle, this is logical, because only 2 weeks pass from the moment of birth, from the moment of that first bathing.
&quot;That&#39;s very little for a child to forget something,&quot; says newborn swimming instructor Marina Aksenova.
In short, if a state of weightlessness is a more natural state for a newborn baby, then gravity, an attractive force, is more natural for women.
In the state of weightlessness, the abdominal muscles and pelvic muscles wither very quickly, the body&#39;s ability to expel the fetus decreases.
We can put this aside if the stimulators of muscle activity during childbirth work.
After all, it is possible for the birth to take place in a special chamber in which the mother&#39;s organism expels the fetus.
&quot;And what&#39;s next?&quot; Valery Polyakov asks difficult questions.
On the other hand, the baby also needs artificial gravity.
If the organism is not affected by the earth&#39;s gravity, it cannot properly shape the skeleton or muscle system.
It is not possible to dress a newborn in orbit as an adult in a special suit with a load in which he could train.
He will simply be deprived of what he absolutely needs to develop.
&quot;If we go with you to an experiment that allows the birth of a child in a foreign environment, we will bring to Earth a disabled person who will be completely unadapted to the local environment,&quot; predicts the head of the IBMP RAN Bioethics Commission Igor Pestov.
So the birth of children in space today is just a theoretical question.
But one day the time will come when the earthlings will set out in their ships to a distant planet, which will become the home of their descendants born in space.
SAO chief: The control of the Schwartz system failed due to politicians
In connection with public procurement, the Czechia has good controllers and quality legislation, but it lags behind in its application.
In an interview for Aktuálně.cz, Miloslav Kala, Vice President of the Supreme Audit Office, says this.
&quot;The law will never be perfect, but its application must be correct - that&#39;s what I think is missing in our country,&quot; Kala comments on the current situation.
Similar conclusions are also indicated by the joint inspection of Czech and German inspectors.
He cites Petr Nečas&#39;s approach to the so-called &quot;Schwartz system&quot; as an example of incorrect practice.
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the ODS will not bother entrepreneurs with its inspections - is it banned or permitted?
&quot;After all, the law must be set in some way, and if it forbids something, even the Prime Minister cannot prevent the activity of the office, which has the duty to go to control and enforce duties,&quot; states Kala.
At the meeting of the Control Committee in the Chamber of Deputies, you spoke about a joint project between the Czech and German sides, in which the legislation concerning public procurement in both countries was compared.
What exactly was it about?
This is a parallel inspection, which we started about two years ago.
To put it simply, European legislation regulates how to deal with public procurement, followed by individual national legislation and then also the practice itself.
We have put all this together, and even though the inspection has not yet been completed, we have shown very interesting differences - in general, the legislation may be &quot;stricter and more perfect&quot; in our country, but the practice itself is better in Germany in some parameters.
It is thus confirmed that it is not enough to create more and more precise rules, but it is necessary to pay attention to the application of law itself.
What can this project actually help you with, what does it mean for you?
It is precisely such joint control that could help us to stop making efforts to clarify laws, reduce and improve limits when it does not have such a positive impact.
Economy means getting the right thing for a reasonable (which does not always mean the lowest) price, in order to avoid enrichment and possibly criminal behavior.
But by lowering the order limit, we do not necessarily achieve this.
Maybe the system will be flooded with so much &quot;paper&quot; that those who want to look for holes in the system will be much easier to draw from it than if the limit remained higher.
You are talking about domestic problems with the transposition of public procurement legislation into practice.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is there an office similar to our SAO, or is it set up differently?
As far as the authorities are concerned, just as the SAO operates there, the Bundesrechnungshof, which is organized similarly to us, also has a college, it is only formed in a slightly different way, but in principle both offices proceed similarly.
The powers are also somewhat similar, but because Germany has a federal structure, it also has these courts at the level of the individual Länder - the system is a little different from ours.
The BRH can only control federal money, represented in our country by state funds.
Public funds, which are administered by regions and municipalities in our country, are controlled there from the level of federal accounting courts.
As for the local legislation, is it simpler than ours?
In general, I would not like to compare it without specific data, however, in some respects Germany is described as a model, but it cannot be said that it is better in everything.
So is it also necessary that they have better controllers?
Certainly not, but again, I don&#39;t like such comparisons.
But it must be said that even the countries that we consider to be a model face a number of problems.
Otherwise, it would be of no benefit to them to cooperate with our office, would it?
As far as domestic legislation is concerned, what did the amendment to the Public Procurement Act mean to your office, are its effects already manifesting themselves?
Due to the fact that the period of validity of this amendment is relatively short, it has not yet been reflected in our inspections.
Because we do ex post checks, there is a certain delay.
So far, we are only seeing this in the process of preparing future inspections - we have launched our new tool &quot;detection of risks of inefficiency&quot;, through which we drove almost 14 thousand public contracts, and analyzed them - there will of course be reflected in changes, because the limits, conditions some types of competition will be adjusted and so on.
Do you consider the approval of this law to be more of a benefit or an additional burden on the system of bureaucracy?
I think this law is definitely a step in the right direction, and I hope it will be confirmed.
The problem that can arise here is that the rules will be &quot;tightened&quot; and it will not be possible to follow them.
Even during the operation of the previous rules, the inspected persons are obliged by the provider (for example, in the case of regional operational programs by the regional council) that any non-compliance with the Public Procurement Act constitutes a breach of budgetary discipline.
So is it worthwhile to tighten the law in this way?
I don&#39;t think so.
The system must exclude those who want to attack and abuse it, and not punish those who make a formal mistake that does not affect decision-making.
Such a system will only put more pressure on bureaucracy.
So how to get out of it?
Let&#39;s see where the road doesn&#39;t lead.
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the ODS would not bother entrepreneurs by checking the so-called &quot;Schwartz system&quot; - and what does that mean?
Is the Schwartz system disabled or enabled?
After all, the law must be set in some way, and if it forbids something, even the Prime Minister cannot prevent the activity of the office, which has the duty to go to control and enforce duties.
He can say, &quot;We will change the law and allow it,&quot; but he cannot say that we will do it as nothing.
There are relatively strict rules in the Public Procurement Act as to what is to be formally done - which is right to protect public competition.
But on the other hand, it is tragic when the applicant with the best offer is excluded only for formal shortcomings.
The law will never be perfect, but its application must be correct - this is what we believe is missing in our country.
Roads are icy in some places, but mostly passable
In several places in the Czech Republic, the roads are frozen and also snowy.
Most of the time, however, the roads are passable, some with caution.
Karlovy Vary Region
In the Karlovy Vary region, the roads were passable this morning, but in some places they were frozen and also snowy.
The temperature has dropped between zero and ten degrees below zero, but is expected to warm slightly during the day.
The snowfall in the region has stopped and there is only a weak layer in the lowlands.
However, there is about 30 centimeters of snow on the ridges of the Ore Mountains.
In some places, there was also lower visibility due to fog, according to data from the dispatch center of regional road workers.
The R6 expressway and first-class roads are now passable in the region without restrictions.
However, caution is in place, for example, on some bridges, where the surface may be icy and slippery.
All second and third class roads, including mountain roads, are also passable.
On some sections, however, there are still remnants of frozen and in some places covered snow.
Especially in higher positions, increased attention must be paid to driving.
Pardubice and Hradec Králové region
There is a risk of icing on some roads in Eastern Bohemia, a layer of snow may have fallen on the roads in higher altitudes and on the mountains, informs the Directorate of Roads and Motorways on its website.
Road workers warn drivers of icing, it can form especially in the higher positions of the Pardubice region.
There may be icing in the vicinity of Lanškroun, Ústí nad Orlicí, Polička, Svitavy or Vysoké Mýto, especially on second and third class roads.
Roads I / 43 and I / 34 near Svitavy are chemically treated.
There is snow especially on the roads in the Giant Mountains and the Eagle Mountains.
The snow cover is in the highest positions on the roads in the districts of Rychnov nad Kněžnou and Trutnov.
In Eastern Bohemia today, it is most often clear to partly cloudy without precipitation.
Temperatures are usually between minus three and plus one degree Celsius, a light wind blows.
Pilsen Region
Roads in the Pilsen region are passable this morning, but in some places it is necessary to adapt the weather with increased caution and driving.
It is freezing in the morning, with temperatures ranging from three to nine degrees below freezing.
After previous snowfall and subsequent cooling, some roads may be frozen.
In some places, drivers have to reckon with fog, but visibility will gradually improve.
This follows from the information of the dispatch center of the regional road workers.
The D5 motorway is passable almost without restrictions, but increased caution is recommended by road administrators between 80 and 131 kilometers.
Most first class roads have a dry and frozen surface.
However, there may be frozen sections in the southern Plzeň and Tachov regions.
The second and third class roads are wet and in this case the warning for frozen sections also applies.
Drivers should be careful especially on less busy roads in the Šumava region.
Olomouc region
Today, drivers heading to the highest positions of the Olomouc Region have to reckon with snow slurry on the road.
After chemical dusting, it remained on the Červenohorské sedlo and on the way in the direction of the Videlský kříž.
The road workers were driven into the terrain by snow at night, in the Šumpersk region, according to the road administrators, they snowed about three centimeters.
In other parts of the region, roads are mostly passable without restrictions.
&quot;Remains of snow lie in the highest positions in the Šumperk region.
Drivers have to reckon with snow slurry on Červenohorské sedlo in the direction of Jeseník, &quot;a dispatcher of the Šumperk road administration told ČTK today.
Their colleagues in the Jesenice region also set off into the terrain at night, and according to them, the roads to the highest positions are now bare and wet after chemical treatment.
In the Olomouc region, roads are passable without restrictions, but in the Sternberg region, drivers should be careful in forest areas where the roads remain wet.
Ústí nad Labem Region, Liberec Region
This morning, road users in northern Bohemia report several difficult-to-navigate places.
In addition to several places with snow or ice, the mountain road from Telnice to Knínice in the Ústí nad Labem region is also closed, according to the police database.
Temperatures are kept below zero even in lower positions, so ice and snow will probably last on the roads. In the lowlands, especially southeast of the Bohemian Central Mountains, on the contrary, there are no problems and the roads are usually dry.
Operational complications have not yet been reported.
The occurrence of the glacier is reported by road workers, especially from the vicinity of Štětí.
According to meteorologists, the conditions were ideal for her at night - during the day rain and melting snow, at night clear and frost.
Adverse conditions have also been reported from the main routes on road I / 13 on the border of the Ústí nad Labem and Liberec regions.
The closure from Telnice to Knínice was forced by the bent branches of the trees, which bent to the road under the snow.
Simon Ornest: We want to gather positive energy at concerts
What do you think about the end of the world in less than a month?
It&#39;s just one of the other alarms we humans like to catch.
Together with The Tap Tap, we make fun of it and say that we are the only band in the world that can gather enough positive energy to delay or prevent the end of the world.
In addition, in December you will organize a completely unique project of three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you introduce it to readers?
This is a nationwide charity event, which we have been planning for two years.
We have decided to use the marketing potential of the end of the Mayan calendar announced on December 21 at 11:10 am.
The day before December 20 from 9 pm, 3 concerts will take place simultaneously in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will end around the time the Mayan calendar ends on the Pacific island of Kiribati, which is 12 hours ahead of us.
Who came up with this idea?
Originally it was probably my idea, then we came up with everything together with our artist Honza Augusta.
In addition to accumulating enough positive energy and preventing the end of the world, we also want to think with the public about the state in which we will one day pass this world on to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the Mayan calendar, we also created a unique collection of shoes, T-shirts, bags or original keys against the end of the world, which people can also support us by purchasing at www.e-tap.cz.
The Tap Tap, along with other performers, also sang the so-called anthem against the end of the world, called &quot;End of the World Canceled&quot;.
It is already very popular on YouTube, will it also be performed at these benefit concerts?
Of course, at the very end, that is, if we succeed and the end of the world does not come ...
It is sung by all the performers at all three concerts simultaneously.
The anthems are suddenly connected in a unique live broadcast on Czech Television.
He wrote the lyrics to this song and the main role of Jesus in the clip is played by Tomáš Hanák, Xindl X also sings in it ...
How did you get to work with them?
We also cooperate with other personalities of the Czech cultural scene, given that we organize a lot of charity events and concerts ...
We try to involve them intensively in these projects.
It turned out that most of them are interested in and enjoy working with us.
What will the proceeds from concerts against the end of the world go to?
To equip the barrier-free educational center Studeo, which we have been implementing for the sixth year with the civic association Tap at the Jedlička Institute.
Students of the Jedliček Institute regularly attend lecturers and engage in activities that entertain and interest them.
The students themselves do not have the means to go to the lecturers themselves, so we try to make it possible for them in this way.
As part of the completion of the Jedlička Institute, a separate building will be built in the future, to which we will move with this project.
Several bands and performers will perform at each concert.
How did you choose them?
We tried to put together a program that will appeal to all generations, including children.
For example, Chinaski, Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý will perform in Prague.
You can find all the details at www.kpks.cz.
Are you planning any similar &quot;bombastic events&quot; in the future?
In May, we will perform at the Prague Spring for the first time, so we will definitely prepare an interesting program with interesting guests here as well.
Next year we would also like to play at the Czech National House in New York, and I personally, when we are already in the USA, I would like to connect it with performances in Washington and Chicago.
Your foreign plans are not minimalist, so far you have performed in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
However, The Tap Tap is a group of handicapped people.
How do you manage these journeys logistically and organizationally?
It&#39;s not as bad as it seems at first glance.
We have five members in an electric wheelchair, their wheelchairs have to travel in the trunk, and of course we carry a large amount of cargo and tool boxes with us ...
However, so far it has always been possible without any problems, CSA and British Airways were very prepared for us, that I wondered how many times.
Even in Moscow, from which we returned recently, it was without problems.
Thanks to trips abroad, you can compare how individuals differ in accessibility, public access to the disabled and the like.
What have you encountered so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other places where everything works better than here, we have witnessed in Russia that everything in the East is still in its infancy.
Compared to Prague, Moscow is very barrier-free, here it is still unusual for a person in an electric wheelchair to move alone in the city center.
There are no such obvious things there, such as that you prefer wheelchair users in the elevator.
Fortunately, civic associations are already being set up there, which try to draw attention to the problems of people with disabilities.
And what, on the contrary, do we still have to catch up with more developed countries?
There are a lot of things we are still behind ...
But it is important to mention that improving and refining the situation always depends on the efforts of the people concerned.
It is quite common in London and Madrid that even people with severe disabilities move independently in public, they can go to the toilet, to the museum, anywhere ...
However, it is not very common for a large number of people with disabilities to take an active part in social life, on the contrary, we are a little ahead of that with The Tap Tap!
Respecting the public or accessibility is one thing, but only when we become important athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers will things really start to change.
So far, these are isolated cases of people who have a strong will.
The band The Tap Tap is very popular at the moment, but let&#39;s go back a few years, what made you start it in 1998?
I joined the Jedlička Institute as an educator, where I had many young people around me who were interested in doing something.
And since I&#39;m a musician myself, I play the saxophone, among other things, so I founded a hobby music group with a colleague.
And over time, as our moderator Láďa Angelovič says, it got a little out of hand (laughs).
But popularity came in recent years, or am I wrong?
It&#39;s true that it helped us when we started connecting with well-known singers and also actively working on the promotion of the band.
We realized that work that is not visible basically does not exist.
Thanks to contributions from the European Union, we can also afford quality lecturers, equipment and so on.
Was your goal to make it so high with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning, I felt the potential for something to be done differently.
Showbusiness is full of things where one mimics the other.
It is logical in a way, everything new is received carefully and it takes a long time.
There are very few things that are unique, but I dare say that Tap Tap are one of them.
The first impression of a person who sees us for the first time is, of course, regret, it is natural ...
But that regret is completely useless, because people with disabilities are no sufferers of all abandoned beings that we must regret.
These are people who can live a full life and develop, provided, of course, that they have the resources to do so.
I say that when people with disabilities succeed, it is not just a shift for them, but for society as a whole.
Did the fact that you are a strict boss, as many people called you, also helped this success?
If we want to do quality work, we must be uncompromising in many things and require a certain discipline.
But I think that&#39;s perfectly normal.
Some people come to us with a romantic idea and with their heads in the clouds, and when they find out that they have to go to rehearsal twice a week, go to a preparation and spend a lot of time traveling to concerts, their enthusiasm quickly leaves them.
But this is how it works everywhere, in every group that wants to work and that wants to achieve something.
The Tap Tap currently has twenty members.
How many of them were at its beginnings in 1998?
Only one Lada Angelovic.
We are an open group, people leave and come, this cannot be prevented.
Whoever has the will and taste always has the door open with us
It will take place the day before the expected end of the world, on Thursday, December 20, 2012 from 9 p.m.
It will take place in Prague&#39;s Incheba arena, Brno to Fléda and Ostrava Plynojem with the participation of 12 bands and other musicians from the Czech Republic
At the end of the evening, all three cities will be connected by telebridges while singing the song The Tap Tap &quot;The End of the World Canceled&quot; together.
The aim of the concert is to raise funds for the equipment of the multifunctional barrier-free educational center STUDEO at the Jedlička Institute in Prague in the amount of CZK 25 million
Admission to the concert is 400 CZK, children under 12 have free admission tickets in advance Bohemiaticket
Poland and the cosmos.
Last week, at the meeting of the Ministers of the European Space Agency, Poland was accepted as the twentieth member of this European Space Agency, as the second country from the countries of the former Eastern bloc (after the Czech Republic, which became a full member of ESA on 12 November 2008).
Poland began working closely with ESA in 1994 and has participated in a number of the Agency&#39;s projects over the years.
However, Poland&#39;s journey into space began much earlier.
Space enthusiasts had been flying into space before World War II; but they did not always meet with understanding.
I would like to mention, for example, a lecture by A. Šternfeld at the Warsaw Astronomical Observatory, which on 6 December 1933 presented ideas from his pioneering work, Entry into Cosmonautics.
The ideas of a young engineer (born 1905) left the listeners cold, and after years Šternfeld remembered that only Dr. Jan Gadomski was interested in his work.
In 1934, Šternfeld won the Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch Prize for his Entry into Cosmonautics in France.
The mentioned Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) later became a great promoter of astronomy and cosmonautics.
He has published hundreds of articles in Polish journals and written a number of books devoted to these scientific disciplines.
Gadomski became a world-famous promoter of cosmonautics, and his contribution was also appreciated by the fact that one of the craters on the far side of the Moon was named after him.
Already in 1925, a railcar was built in Poland, which was to be equipped with a rocket engine.
Unfortunately, the author of the proposal is not known and the details of the project are not known.
It is also not clear whether the rocket was to be used to launch the trolley or to brake it.
Information about this handcar is known only from the periodical press.
From 1933, Polish artillery began to deal with missiles.
The research was provided by Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia in cooperation with prof. Mieczyslaw Wolfek and prof. Gustawem Mokrzyckiegim.
From the preserved materials it is clear that the research has reached the stage of practical tests.
However, the arrival of German troops interrupted the research.
In 1937, a design of a photoelectric fighter rocket, designed by engineer Rohoziński, appeared in the trade press, and the following year the work Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza by Leliwy-Krzywoblocký was published.
Both projects were designed for the military use of rocket engines.
Just before the war, all projects for the military use of missile technology were dealt with by the Temporary Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy), which coordinated all work.
The committee was founded in 1937, but after two years of operation, its activities ended with the start of the war.
Other works devoted to cosmonautics appear in the Polish press after the war thanks to the work of the Polish Astronautical Society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
For the first time, the company is mentioned in the November 1954 issue of the magazine Problemy, which contains four more extensive articles devoted to astronautics.
In one of them, from prof. M. Subotowicz, it is proposed to create a company that will deal with astronautics.
At that time, artificial satellite projects were already underway, and it was clear that space research was a promising field.
Since the beginning of 1956, the Polish Astronautical Society (PTA) has been seeking to join the International Astronautical Federation (founded in 1951), and in the autumn the PTA became a full member.
And the following year, the first chairman of the PTA, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), became vice-chairman of the International Astronautical Federation.
He held this position until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, the PTA has been instrumental in the development of the highly successful RM (Rakieta Meteorologiczna) meteorological rocket, which became the first Polish rocket to conduct scientific research.
The first type of RM-1 was completed in 1957 and the first launch took place on October 10, 1958.
The rocket with a range of 1800 meters was about 80 cm long and weighed less than 5 kg.
Later, an improved version of the RM-1A was built, and in the summer of 1959, flight tests of the two-stage RM-2 missile began in the Bled Desert.
The rocket was 1.4 meters long and weighed about 11.5 kg.
Another type of development was to be capable of real scientific work - the RM-34 missile was to have access to up to 14.5 km and its task was to monitor the altitude wind.
However, in 1962, further development was suspended.
The successor to the first RM missiles was the Meteor-1 missile developed between 1962 and 1965.
The rocket was designed as a two-stage, its total length was 510 cm and the launch weight was 32.5 kg.
Three types were developed (designated Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C), which differed in the size of the space for scientific instruments.
The Meteor-1A rocket had a space of 0.4 liters, the Meteor-1B 0.34 liters and the Meteor-1C 0.62 liters.
The maximum access for all three types was 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1968, the Aviation Institute developed the Meteor-2 missile, whose first flight tests began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket had a starting weight of 380 kg and was able to withstand a payload of 10 kg to a height of about 60 km.
Subsequently, versions of Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 were built.
Mention should also be made of Poland&#39;s accession to COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 and the creation of the COSPAR National Committee two years later.
Poland also participated in space research on Soviet artificial satellites under the Interkosmos program, and in 1978, Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became the second intercosmonaut after Vladimir Remek.
The repeal of the Public Works Act is not the answer.
Last week, the Constitutional Court repealed the Public Works Act.
The resolution provoked a lively public discussion.
It will certainly be interesting to look at the issue from a broader perspective.
Liberally oriented economic systems in the EU, as in a globalized world, are based on the principle of more, unregulated competition.
In effect, this means that the individual economic units, the national economic systems, are in constant conflict with each other.
The reason is the principle of free trade and the free, unrestricted movement of private capital, together with unbridled financial speculation.
Due to significant differences in the price of labor (wages), there is a price tension.
This term is to be understood as a situation in which a manufacturer seeks to compete with low-cost goods by &quot;undermining&quot; a competitor&#39;s price in order to gain a larger share of the market and thereby increase its own profits.
On a mass scale, this means for most entrepreneurs either to relocate production abroad, or to buy there cheaply, or to disappear. The result is high unemployment in countries where labor prices are high compared to other economies.
Because private capital has no social responsibility and thus no responsibility for the unemployment it produces, the state&#39;s social spending necessarily increases.
The whole situation is exacerbated by the complete reluctance of business owners to pay taxes and thus compensate for the economic and social societal damage he has caused in the pursuit of profit.
The situation is so well known that there is no need to provide specific statistics.
Reckless practices of private capital create a situation in individual economies, where the governments of individual countries are forced to enter into mutual competition with the aim of artificially lowering the social level of their own population in order to attract foreign capital to the country.
In other words, governments give private capital a chance for its own population, regardless of the social decline.
This is reflected primarily in changes in applicable laws.
The aim is to economically force one&#39;s own population to accept the price dictate of private capital, especially in the area of wages.
This is done both by a system of economic coercion in the event of long-term unemployment and by restricting employees&#39; rights in the field of labor law.
The result is growing poverty, along with a widening gap between rich and poor.
For many years, there have been public food outlets in Germany for the poor who cannot make a living from their own work.
The number of these people is already in the millions.
As part of increasing the competitiveness of the German economy, it is quite common for duly employed people to receive such a wage that the state has to pay them to the subsistence minimum.
Such a scandal was also published in the case of auxiliary staff of the Federal Assembly.
Austerity measures in virtually all of the EU&#39;s southern states undoubtedly lead to the same situation where, under the pressure of a catastrophic decline in social standards, people are forced to either emigrate as they did in the 19th century or live on hungry wages on the margins of society in the hope of comes private investment capital.
But here it is necessary to ask where it will come from?
If it is from other EU countries, then poverty will move from one country to another, or it will not come at all, because a Chinese, Indian, Brazilian, or Turk, Moroccan, or Egyptian, or African is still working for a fraction of the European wage.
This applies to the whole of Latin America.
Liberal theories and the media faint that the state cannot participate in capital on its own economy, that a controlled economy leads to an economic catastrophe.
Private capital strongly insists that the state must not interfere with the economy through management interventions.
Then it is necessary to ask whether private capital does not affect, now it actually controls politics and thus the whole state in its own selfish sense.
Here is the clear answer that yes.
The proof is the existence of a virtually omnipotent and ubiquitous lobby in all states.
The result is a desperate situation manifested in the area of corruption, the provision of mutual benefits, legislation, where virtually everything is reprehensible, but nothing criminal.
In Germany, the situation is such that, due to a lack of funds, state ministries commission draft law to private law firms that are heavily connected with industry.
These bills are then agreed in the Bundestag.
All power thus does not come from the people, as proclaimed by Western-type constitutions, but from financially strong groups that prefer their own interests.
It is clear that liberal-oriented democracies are now rapidly entering the situation, as described by Appianus in his work The Crisis of the Roman Republic in Caesar and Pompey: &quot;The state has long been in complete disarray and the authorities have been occupied by force.
For bribes, gaining favor and using stones or swords.
Bribery and corruption flourished without any restraint and the people went to the polls with a pre-sold vote &quot;...&quot; character people did not run for office at all, so once it was due to this disruption was to stand for eight months without consuls &quot;.. ..&quot; indeed, to speak of the fact that the only cure in a bad situation is self-government and that an energetic man must be chosen. &quot;Appianes thought of Pompey, but it became Caesar who turned a permanent democracy into self-government.
Conclusion As in antiquity, today&#39;s society is based on a ruthless preference for self-interest, regardless of societal interest.
Private capital is no longer inherently able to understand and apply societal benefits.
The result is now, as then, the unprecedented decadence of elites without any effort for deeper reforms.
The causality of the rise of fascist and communist regimes must therefore be sought in the ruthless liberalization of the economic systems of the 19th and 20th centuries.
In the current situation, the demise of these systems in favor of a liberal-type democracy can be considered a break with the expectation of another round.
Particularly catastrophic is the fact that the current elites completely ignore the possible hundreds of thousands of loss of life, humanitarian and social catastrophes that we are already witnessing, along with crimes against humanity, as we know them from old and new history.
The repeal of the Public Works Act is not a solution, at least not a permanent one.
Under the pressure of competition at both the international and domestic European levels, the government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to look for ways to further reduce the social level of the population.
This trend is therefore systemic.
The solution is targeted political and social reforms that will strengthen the state&#39;s capital participation in the economy, strengthen the influence of citizens on the government and weaken the monopoly position of private capital in society for the benefit of the state.
Israel: Chaos Lab.
&quot;Nothing comes from violence and never can&quot; Sting in the song Fragile whose main verse in the chorus is &quot;let&#39;s not forget how fragile we are&quot;

After the last wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, as always, there have been many reactions.
Some stand for Israel, argue its right to self-defense and Palestinians play the role of terrorists, others support Palestinians, argue the racism of the state of Israel, the genocide perpetrated on Palestinian Arabs and the state of Israel the role of a terrorist state.
I do not want to think about who is to blame for the periodically recurring waves of killings and who are the victims, after all, today&#39;s people of Israel, including the self-governing territories, were born into the current political situation and did not experience the beginning of violence.
I want to offer readers a look behind the curtain, a look at who is primarily served by the 95-year-old tension (calculated since the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) on a small piece of Middle Eastern land.
Some of my reflections are supported by available historical facts, some are derived from them based on my own understanding of who resp. which group of people is the main driver of the events of modern history.
The history of mankind is first and foremost the history of the struggle for power.
In each epoch we can find some Alexander the Great or Napoleon.
What is not so obvious is whether it was always these personalities who controlled their actions completely autonomously, or whether there was someone behind their throne who directed their actions to a pre-set goal.
We must admit that we live in a time when the world&#39;s wealth is concentrated in the hands of several individuals, and that this concentration of money and the resulting power could not have taken place in a lifetime of one generation.
Among these astronomically rich families, one stands out that could be considered the head of an octopus (I don&#39;t know if anyone is still standing above them, but I don&#39;t rule it out) - the Rothschields.
Not much is written about them.
Of course.
They bought the first news agency (Reuters) as early as the 1990s to stop associating their name with the highly criminal acts behind them, which for them always meant the consolidation of power, the multiplication of wealth, or both.
They have major stakes in almost all central banks in the world and against countries where stakes in the central bank are not being waged or preparing for war (before the invasion of Afghanistan it was 7 countries, after the invasion of Iraq it was 5 countries, after the overthrow of Gaddafi remained only four, but in the meantime Russia has subordinated the central bank to the Russian government).
Whoever tried to resist this family died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to restore Rothschield&#39;s central bank status to Bank of America, began issuing his own (understand government) money during the Civil War, and was assassinated in 1865 in a theater.
JFK began spending its own money and wanted to abolish the Fed, was assassinated in 1963, MP Louis Mc Fadden was poisoned in 1936 after he wanted to sue the Fed for unleashing the Great Depression in 1929.
Their desire for global power led in the years 1859 - 1871 to the formulation of a plan for the three world wars by the Mason of the highest, 33rd degree of consecration by Albert Pike.
The first war was to remove large monarchist units in Europe, the second was to remove colonial rule, especially Great Britain, and the third was to reduce the world&#39;s population somewhere to 0.5 - 1 billion people (so many slaves for their comfort and luxury are enough and do not consume so many resources), the creation of one universal religion (ecumenism is nothing but a forerunner for such a solution) and the ultimate takeover of absolute power.
The method that the group of the richest families, led by the Rothschieldy, works is to provoke a crisis and then offer a solution (order ab chao - order out of chaos).
However, these solutions are false and always lead to a worsening of the situation (see the establishment of the Fed so that the crisis does not recur like the one they provoked in 1907).
So after they managed to start the First World War by assassinating the Habsburg heir to the Russian throne Ferdinand in Sarajevo, they destroyed Tsarist Russia by starting the Bolshevik revolution.
The First World War ended with the sudden, militarily and economically unjustified, surrender of Germany (there was no need for a war to destroy Tsarist Russia) and subsequently the fragmentation of the Central European power, Austria-Hungary.
To facilitate the outbreak of World War II, the bankers of politics had a latent conflict situation created by imposing huge war reparations on Germany, thus creating the precondition for the radicalization of the impoverished masses and then the creation of a multi-ethnic Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority, which was to play, and also played, the function of the fifth column, in the ignition of the war.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschields initiated the establishment of the Zionist movement, one branch of which sought to create a Jewish state, preferably in the area of historic Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
The aforementioned Balfour Declaration created a precondition for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine, and the first clashes with the local Arab population began.
There were terrorist attacks on both sides.
World War II broke out, whether Hitler broke free from the chain on which international bankers initially held him, or everything he did was planned to be difficult to predict, in any case, the suffering of European Jews in concentration created a precondition for the world community&#39;s acceptance of the Jewish state.
Israel was officially founded in 1948, and just as it was deployed to World War II by German war reparations, the declaration of the state of Israel created the focus of the Third War.
If international bankers succeed in unleashing it, the Jewish nation, as in the latter, will be a victim in the front lines of the struggle, now along with the Arab or general Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a huge laboratory, a source of strife and chaos not only within the country but also internationally (let&#39;s just take in how sharply people are divided into supporters and opponents of Israel).
Who is to blame and who is the victim in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, where wrongdoing breeds wrong in an endless chain of violence, when at the beginning was the greed of individuals and their desire for global power?
Here, it is necessary to distinguish the simple people of Israel from their leaders, because, as in our country, international bankers are pushing people to choose their own candidates exclusively.
The current Prime Minister of Israel, Hawk Netanyahu, is a typical example of a fascist politician loyal to international bankers who is doing his best to start a war with Iran that, given Iran&#39;s membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan). ..), threatened to escalate into a global conflict and, given Iran&#39;s control of the Strait of Hormuz, through which 20% of the world&#39;s oil travels (the corridor is only 2 miles wide), to destroy the world economy.
In what light do the words that David Rockefeller said in 1994 now seem: &quot;All we need is a general crisis and people will agree to a new world order.&quot;
The new world order in their imagination is the world of masters and slaves.
A world where the rest of the human population serves the comforts of a handful of financial aristocracies.
A world where a chip is implanted at birth with each newborn individual, making him a totally controlled being.
&quot;And he compels all small and great, rich and poor, free and slaves, to have a mark on their right hand or forehead, so that he may not buy or sell who is not marked with the name of the beast or the number of his name.
This must be understood: whoever makes sense, add up the numbers of the beast.
That number means man, and the number is six hundred and sixty-six. &quot;
Movie Argo: When It&#39;s Worst, Call Hollywood
In November 1979, a mob of demonstrating Islamist students occupied the US embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage.
They were to be released in exchange for the overthrown Shah Mohamed Reza Pahlavi, who fled to the United States after the revolution, which had been the patron of his regime for several decades.
The situation did not offer a positive way out for the American administration - it could not afford to throw the Shah overboard, because it would fundamentally jeopardize the confidence of the Allies in other countries.
However, in Iran, where the revolution resulted in the establishment of a theocratic regime, she was unable to release the hostages.
It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which was later exacerbated by the fiasco of trying to free the hostages by force.
The imprisoned diplomats were eventually released after 444 days, after negotiations were brokered by the Algerian government.
Their fate at home provoked a wave of solidarity and anti-Iranian sentiment.
The debacle in Iran contributed significantly to Jimmy Carter&#39;s loss to Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election.
Directing actor Ben Affleck&#39;s film Argo describes one episode in the history that brought America a small victory.
Just before the embassy was occupied, six employees fled it.
After difficult vicissitudes, they ended up in the residence of the Canadian ambassador.
The CIA, in cooperation with the Canadian authorities, managed to get them out of Iran, helped by an extravagant cover story - they went to Canadian passports as members of the film crew, who inspected sci-fi feature films in the country.
Genre combinations
The plan, devised by &quot;exfiltration&quot; expert Tony Mendez, also required Hollywood collaboration.
In order for the legend to be credible, it was written about the film project in specialized magazines, press conferences were held, and the fictitious production company had a real office.
The details of the operation have been kept secret for a long time, the film is based on the memories of Tony Mendez.
Affleck&#39;s film is a special combination of multiple genres.
On the one hand, a realistically conceived political thriller, at the same time the so-called &quot;caper movie&quot;, the story of a successful piece, a trip - an example can be a series of Danny&#39;s partners.
The film alternates moods - on the one hand, a documentary concept from Tehran (the title sequence shows iconic period photographs of events and the way in which the same situations were presented in the film - there are no big differences).
On the other hand, the light-hearted passages from Hollywood, treated with irony and a slight exaggeration.
And then there are scenes from the CIA headquarters and other institutions - men in suits discuss the situation at the negotiating tables, in the corridors of the office, on the phone ...
Ben Affleck managed to restart his career in a remarkable way.
From a ridiculous actor, he became a respected director and his acting ceased to be the target of ironic remarks.
Argo is his third feature film, after the dark crime Gone Baby Gone (2007) and the thriller City (2010).
It is also Affleck&#39;s first film not to take place in the director&#39;s home Boston.
The feeling for the atmosphere of the place was one of the characteristics that elevated the director&#39;s older films above the Hollywood standard.
And Affleck also shows it in Arg, where Tehran is &quot;playing&quot; Canada.
The best scenes in the film take place in the streets, reconstructing real events - the introductory sequence of the fall of the embassy is impressive in its clarity, which also conveys the emotions of confusion and unreliability that occur when history moves somewhere.
Affleck and his collaborators achieve a similar effect in fictional scenes (a fake crew at a Tehran bazaar).
Too many events in too many places
The director also had to deal with the fact that the story told does not actually offer much in the cinematic sense of exciting scenes.
He almost quite successfully works with it, sometimes he thinks of something to reality - everything doesn&#39;t go so elegantly there (a scene in which the impending crisis at Tehran airport is averted by a phone call in America and the runway on the runway looks pretty hair-raising).
The weakness of Arga, however, is the distraction resulting from the need to show too many events in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman are very charming in the roles of Hollywood collaborators, but their characters would deserve more space and are far from the only ones in the film.
Affleck&#39;s film loses a dramatic move a bit, it is a film that can be watched with a slight interest, appreciating the realization and retro style evoking the thrillers of the 70s.
But it&#39;s hard to pull down.
As a reminder of a still somewhat living history, a proof of how exaggerated the notions of omnipotent and omniscient secret services are, however, will suffice.
Rules for inflating balloons, bananas and circus
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which annually announces a survey on the most absurd bank fee, has now decided to announce a competition for &quot;the most absurd regulation or ideas from the EU workshop&quot;.
&quot;We were led to this by the last event, when the EU plans to adopt a 40% quota for women in the management of large European companies,&quot; survey organizer Patrik Nacher told Práva.
Among the absurdities nominated is, for example, the recent decision of the European Court of Justice to unify premium rates for men and women.
Until now, women have been favored in life insurance prices because they are objectively less risky for insurance companies.
&quot;Other incredible ideas from the EU workshop can be nominated by the end of this year.
The voting itself will then take place by the end of February 2013, &quot;Nacher informed.
Controversial EU regulations include the mandatory blending of bio-ingredients into fuels, which is harmful to nature, a ban on the use of reliable mercury thermometers just because they contain relatively small amounts of dangerous substances, or a directive on the size of chicken cages, which made eggs more expensive this year. .
Critics in the past also faced the de facto ban on the use of the term spread butter or the exclusion of conventional light bulbs from sale.
Quality bananas should be 14 centimeters
The EU apparatus often decides under pressure from one or another trade or industrial lobby, whose demands in Brussels are usually defended by a state or a group of states (so the Czechia now enforces the demands of its banks even with a threat of a veto).
The interests of the lobby were also due to the fact that, for example, bananas of the highest quality had to reach a length of at least 14 cm in the Union and were not allowed to show &quot;anomalous curvature&quot;.
At the same time, the European Commission defended itself by merely harmonizing the existing non-uniform national standards, which complicated trade.
Despite the opposition of some countries, the EU has already softened fruit and vegetable standards, pointing out that existing directives lead to food waste.
Last year&#39;s EU regulation, which requires that inflatable balloons sold must be warned that children under the age of 8 must not inflate them without adult supervision, may also be a candidate for winning the survey.
The EU referred here to American research, according to which balloons among toys are the leading cause of death of children from suffocation.
A similar restriction now applies to children under the age of 14 when blowing into fairground spray cans.
Curious ideas are born at home
The rule concerning European officials themselves is also relatively absurd - anyone with an official position in the EU cannot use the name Macedonia due to the sensitivity of the topic to Greece and must speak of FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia) instead.
The Bankpoplatky.com server, in cooperation with the Association of Liberal Economists Laissez Faire, nominated for the survey, in addition to some of the above-mentioned absurdities, the EU regulation on the volume of food stocks in the territory of a Member State.
The EU set maximum amounts of food stocks that could be located in the Czech Republic on the day of our accession to the Union.
The Czechia then exceeded, for example, the set volumes for canned mushrooms, for which it was threatened with a large fine.
The organizers of the survey were also interested in the idea of paying some countries for not having a sea, and the idea of granting subsidies to apply for a subsidy.
However, these ideas did not originate in Brussels, but in Prague.
&quot;We are handicapped because we do not have the sea.
We will ask the European Union for a refund, &quot;said in the autumn of 2004 the then Minister of Agriculture Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD).
As an argument, he stated that a lot of grain was born in our country and as a result of the so-called intervention purchases, he had to become full of warehouses, which he had to export.
According to Palas, the EU should have paid us hundreds of millions of euros for the Czechia to continue to the ports.
In the end, the European Commission met the Czech Republic by organizing a tender for the purchase of grain from countries that do not have access to the sea.
The subsidy for obtaining the subsidy was offered to the municipalities by the Ministry of Regional Development, managed by Minister Pavel Němec (US-DEU), specifically to go to the application for subsidies from Brussels.
EU: Bizarre regulations are an exception
While regulations are easily criticized in the Member States, the EU&#39;s efforts to regulate and at the same time make the Union as a whole operate and develop more deserve recognition, according to many experts.
According to experts, a more serious problem is, for example, the drawing of EU subsidies for projects that have nothing to do with deepening European integration, but which were forced by the Member States in budgetary negotiations.
Emotions among the Czechs are also aroused by the fact that, like other EU countries, the Czech Republic must fight in Brussels for the right to a specific designation of its traditional products, and it will not always succeed in this struggle.
Although the Czechs defended the designation of Olomouc cottage cheese after a six-year struggle with the Germans and Austrians, our producers, whose tradition dates back to the 19th century, had to be renamed our producers by the Czech Republic.
Only cane distillate products can bear the name rum, not sugar beet.
In the official list of registered EU products, in the company of world-famous feta and gorgonzola cheeses, marzipan from Lübeck, Germany or Parma ham, there are already Karlovy Vary biscuits, Pohořelice and Třeboň carp and Satu Mare hops.
Pardubice gingerbread and Hořice tubes can also be proud of the EU trademark.
People want me to save the republic, but I&#39;m an amateur, says Okamura
Senator, how do you think he wants to run for president?
It&#39;s not about being a senator or a president.
If it worked without problems in our country, then I am not running anywhere.
But I can no longer watch the country steal for the last twenty years, the thieves running around, people&#39;s taxes and retirement age rising.
I had no ambition to be a politician.
But when I see something I don&#39;t like, I try to come up with a solution to change it.
And since I was forty and an independent non-partisan, I have no choice but to run for senator or president.
You got to the Senate, but soon you went to the Castle.
Don&#39;t you turn your back on the people who elected you?
All the time I said that I would go to the fight for the Castle according to the result in the Senate elections.
I later clarified that if I was elected senator, I would run for president.
But my goal is not function, function is a tool for me to realize my visions.
That is why I need the greatest possible influence and the strongest possible mandate.
The problem, however, is not only that, as a nation, we swear in a pub and on television, but that we trample on anyone who wants to try to change.
To this are added the media, which dishonor a person and which confuse freedom of speech with the freedom to lie.
For example, it was claimed about me that I bribed journalists or that I was an adviser to Jiří Paroubek.
Let&#39;s get to your visions.
You set out to fight for the Castle with the thesis of material and criminal responsibility of politicians and return property returns of over twenty million.
To do this, you must change the law.
But as president, you do not have such authority, and only the Senate as a whole can draft laws.
How do you want to solve it?
When, as a citizen, I lobbied for guide-making to be a free trade, I succeeded.
The problem is politicking - when someone comes up with a good proposal from the left or right, they deliberately reject it, and that delays the citizens.
As an independent non-partisan, I have much more potential to gain support from all parliamentary parties.
My advantage is that without party boxes and dogmas, I can take something that is best for our country from every side and apply it.
Do you consider yourself a right-wing or left-wing person?
From the Czech point of view, it seems to me that people place me more to the left.
It doesn&#39;t matter to me at all, whether a little to the left or a little to the right.
It is important for me to move forward.
I don&#39;t care if anyone belongs to the left or the right, but I want to connect people.
I will always support any publicly good solution, even if it is proposed by the KSČM or the ODS, and I will be against a bad idea as well.
You joke when someone says you&#39;re a populist.
But don&#39;t you prove it by what you said?
When you create a business plan in a company, you also have an ideal goal and vision.
And you&#39;re trying to get closer to that.
Some may call it populism, but all the proposals I am talking about already work in the world, or have been talked about by prominent experts.
But without the support of parliament, you will be left with only passwords.
And you can&#39;t do that in politics for a long time.
Or do you think that if you go to people and talk to them, you will be able to enforce criminal and material liability, for example?
I have no choice.
Persuade politicians, journalists and the public and try to get them on our side to enforce it.
If I were elected President, it would not be a problem to organize a live television broadcast asking the Speakers of the parliamentary parties to legislate material and criminal liability for politicians, officials, judges and prosecutors.
And they might have to say why they don&#39;t want her.
When there is a strong personality who will name scandals, one can push the political scene.
Take the direct election of the president, it was the merit of public pressure.
To put it bluntly, I&#39;m an amateur, not a genius or an intellectual.
I try to look for allies for my opinions and visions.
I have just started in politics and I will try to get majority support for my program.
I try to move things on my own, if I can&#39;t, I&#39;ll quit in six years and go back to the private sector.
It sounds a bit like Okamura should save the Czechia.
I am not a savior.
I know that I will not do anything in one person, so I went around a number of famous people to see if they would also run for the Senate.
I went to see Radim Jančura, who refused due to the amount of work.
So at least I supported investigative journalist Jana Lorencová, who was exposing fraud with light fuel oils.
I ran to say that people are really dissatisfied, but now I&#39;m on dragonflies.
Sixty percent of the people did not go to the polls, and those who did usually elected establishment representatives.
In the Senate, we are only two independent.
The people elected the Senate so that changes will be difficult to enforce.
Nevertheless, I will fight for my visions, such as the direct election of mayors or governors.
Are you considering starting your own party?
I haven&#39;t thought about it yet, because I don&#39;t have time to check the net past of every potential party, and I don&#39;t even have the money.
I don&#39;t even have the money for the presidential campaign, there are only 20,000 in my transparent account.
Don&#39;t have money?
Are you talking about property declarations, what is yours?
I estimate private property at about 60 million.
In Prague, I have a plot of land for about 25 million, an apartment for ten million, another apartment for eight million, a collection of works of art for about ten million, Aston Martin for 3.5 million and Škoda Superb for a million, and then I have a few million in my account.
By the way, I have Aston Martin because it was my boy&#39;s dream - I always liked James Bond, who drove in a car, was gallant towards women and at the same time fought against bad things.
Do you drive Aston Martin, have $ 60 million in assets and no campaign money?
You say you want to change the republic, but you don&#39;t want to put your own money into it.
That is not very convincing.
I don&#39;t have 15 million for the campaign.
Should I get into debt?
I have already invested 2.5 million in the campaign.
The fact that I don&#39;t have any sponsors indicates that there is probably no such interest in my program.
And I have no obligation to pay the campaign on my own.
The cost of the campaign will basically be covered by my senatorial salary.
But I would not make a living from it, for example, I could not pay my son for an English school, which costs 30,000 a month.
If I just wanted to make money, I&#39;m not running anywhere.
So will you continue to do business so you can live?
Didn&#39;t you say you would slow down these activities?
But this is not related to the amount of salary.
As I promised, I partially curtailed my activities.
For example, my deputy will become the travel agent in the spring.
People would like me to be a Samaritan who will save the republic.
But I also need to live on something.
How much did you, as an entrepreneur, used to take per month?
Two hundred to 400 thousand, which I take further.
And if I were president, I would quit my business.
You can find the whole interview in the Saturday issue of Práva.
MVRDV architects are proof that real adventures don&#39;t just happen in the head - for example Spijkenisse and the recently built Mountain of Books - 2 images
&quot;I find the building cheerful, it looks futuristic. Finally, something interesting can be seen again,&quot; says Lisette Verhaig, who walks along the side of the road.
Stefan Spermon, an IT technician at a nearby large company, says, &quot;Of course, the house is nice.&quot;
However, I wonder what we still need the library for today.
All have internet, iPads and e-books.
No one goes to any of these old-style libraries voluntarily today, do they?
Spijkenisse, a housing estate in the immediate vicinity of Rotterdam without its own job opportunities, which is not even worth a visit, holds a special record.
This municipality with 80,000 inhabitants has the lowest level of education in the whole of the Netherlands.
To address this stupid situation, a few years ago, the decision was made to contribute to general education and to build seven nicely painted reinforced concrete miniatures of fictitious bridges, which are depicted on euro banknotes.
However, the success of the educational offensive was not dizzying.
And so the city councilors realized that there was only one way to become the master of statistics: we must have a library!
Winy Maas from Rotterdam&#39;s MVRDV architectural studio, a master of insanely bold bar graphs and a contractor of funny, often even cynical buildings, accepted the matter with the usual calm and appeared at a competition in 2003 with five books under his arm and a smirk on his face.
And while the commission still looked around in astonishment and shrugged, the cheeky Maas piled up his presents on his size and ended his activistically reasoned speech with the words &quot;Dear urban community!&quot;
So this is my proposal for the Mountain of Books in Spijkenisse, the so-called Boekenberg!
Nine years later, the mountain was built for 30 million euros.
It is part of a revitalization project, which also includes an underground car park, a supermarket, a post office and several adjacent residential and terraced houses with a total of 50 apartments.
At the beginning of November, the Mountain of Books was awarded the second place &quot;Best Library of NL 2012&quot;.
In addition, the project is nominated for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
The small-town gray, which could not yet offer more than a postmodern pedestrian zone and the extraordinarily ugly town hall, behind whose white facade you would rather expect a dairy, is therefore richer in a little contemporary architecture.
Above all, however, Spijkenisse now has the first public cultural building in the history of its existence.
A long way to the book
First impression: reader&#39;s eldorado under the cheese lid.
An elevator runs through the middle of the mountain massif, but you will only discover real spatial and reader passions when overcoming the topography on foot.
The glazed interior is bright and well-arranged on all sides, the burnt floor and the elegant street lanterns clearly express the atmosphere of the public square.
The urban environment is perfect.
You see park benches, a dog and boys and girls playing soccer.
And books, books, books everywhere.
&quot;Normally there are bookshelves along the facade and in the middle is a large dark space, which is mostly uncomfortable and impersonal,&quot; says Winy Maas.
We built the classic spatial configuration upside down and pushed the space for the reader from the inside out.
The interior of the Mountain of Books is cleverly used: in the middle there are offices, an internet library, a chess club, an ecological center and a home technology exchange.
A special pleasure are the black bookshelves, which are once lined with walls, once with a parapet and sometimes with a stair railing.
The appearance, structure and smell are foreign.
Even sworn architects and civil engineers shake their heads at the unknown building material.
&quot;We wanted to work with recycled materials here,&quot; says Joop Trouborst, project manager at Spijkenisse, when asked by Standard magazine.
And so one day we came across a suitable agricultural waste product in a Friesian farm.
For many years, millimeter fleece of synthetic material has been used as a base for roots in greenhouses and fields in the Netherlands.
It is cheap and time efficient.
The thin textile lasts one or two seasons and is then ready to be disposed of in bulky waste.
For the library, the fleece - for the first time in such quantities - was pressed into plates four centimeters thick.
Under the influence of heat and pressure, the so-called Landbouwplastic (KLP) turns into a dark, homogeneous and load-bearing material that smells a bit like a new car and a bit like sports shoes.
After 105 steps you will reach the top.
At the end of the almost 500-meter journey, you will be rewarded in the literary café not only with a fantastic view of the city, but also with Dutch croquettes and ficus in pots.
They care about the atmosphere, but mainly about the right humidity in the mountains of literature.
Gifts for a new soul
&quot;You probably wouldn&#39;t believe it, but despite the many glass areas, this house is an ecological demonstration project,&quot; says Trouborst.
It is heated and cooled by the earth&#39;s heat.
Although the Mountain of Books stands under a glass cover, the sun shines inside only briefly, even on sunny days.
The wide glued wooden trusses, which stand perpendicular to the glazed façade, serve as shading and capture a large part of the sunlight.
The climate in the room is very pleasant.
Fully automatic blinds can handle the rest.
Stefan Spermon, an initial skeptic in the IT industry, has already visited the new library.
Lisette Verhaig was already there.
And also Cynthia Bogarde, a teacher of traditional Chinese medicine, who even calls Boekenberg the &quot;long-awaited soul&quot; of Spijkenisse.
The reason: every resident of the city was invited to the opening a few weeks ago to donate one book from his personal collection.
Optical gaps in the not yet fully equipped library, which currently numbers 70,000, were to be filled first.
The concept worked.
The shelves are completely full.
&quot;There&#39;s nothing worse than a half-empty library,&quot; says architect Winy Maas.
&quot;I think that thanks to our invitation, every inhabitant now has a certain relationship with the new house.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
Even if it was just for decoration.
Thus, the MVRDV succeeded in the royal discipline, which in professional jargon is called the formation of identity.
Spijkenisse wrote the history of literature.
However young and uneducated it may be.
This is ultimately the starting point for identity.
Szabo: &quot;Germans must play a bigger role&quot;
Germany abstained from voting on Palestine.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on US-European relations, Berlin is balancing on the narrow edge of diplomacy.
Deutsche Welle: Earlier this week, Germany first signaled that it would vote against the proposal for Palestinian observer status at the United Nations.
But then Berlin abstained.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelis did in Gaza.
Now, however, Germany must be cautious because of its special relationship with Israel.
But at the same time, I don&#39;t think it will support the American position either.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence - without being too critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained when it came to establishing a no-fly zone.
This was eventually enforced by NATO.
Is it difficult for Germany to take a clear position on important international issues?
Yes, that&#39;s right.
The reason is that it is changing its foreign policy, from a policy that was, so to speak, controlled by the United States, to a German foreign policy.
The situation is all the more difficult because Europeans do not have a coherent and uniform policy.
The Germans are therefore between the two fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I think they are just settling in in their role, but they are on their way to a &quot;more normal&quot; foreign policy.
On the foreign policy they have in France or Great Britain.
What exactly does &quot;normal&quot; foreign policy mean from a German point of view?
It shows a readiness to take positions in the case of national interests, which are independent of the positions of the USA or European partners.
I think that German foreign policy is motivated by economic policy, that is, by exports and its relations with certain areas, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany&#39;s economic interests are to some extent different from those of other great powers, and Germany must therefore protect its interests.
Did economic interests influence attitudes in the Middle East conflict and voting at the UN?
First, Germany has large markets in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf states.
Therefore, they must be careful not to deter the public, but also the elites in Arab countries.
It plays a role anyway.
But I would not even attach too much importance to it, it is not a completely one-sided relationship.
In any case, it plays an important role in German considerations.
Did it damage Germany&#39;s relations with the United States by abstaining from voting on both important decisions, such as the vote on Palestine?
I think that there is a great deal of understanding of the German position in Europe and even in the United States.
That is why I do not think it was as dramatic as in Libya.
Perhaps Germany will even gain some respect from this.
This signals that he must be considered an international player and his interests must be taken into account.
There are differing views on the Palestinian initiative in Europe.
The US, on the other hand, has clearly spoken out in favor.
Are there differences of opinion between the United States and many European nations?
These differences have always existed as a result of American domestic policy.
I think the Obama administration probably secretly has a strong understanding of the European position.
But due to the political situation there, he cannot, of course, take this position publicly.
I don&#39;t think the differences of opinion really are as great as they always seem.
When you look at the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, Obama is not at all very enthusiastic about Netanyahu&#39;s policies.
Is it not difficult for Germany to reconcile its close relations with Israel and the United States, on the one hand, and with the position of the EU&#39;s most important partners, on the other?
I think that is exactly what makes it difficult for the Germans.
It would, of course, be a little easier for the Germans if there was a coherent and unified European policy, which is not happening at the moment.
So they cannot be part of a wider line and must instead push things forward from their own position.
That&#39;s what they&#39;re doing with the euro.
I believe that Germany will take the lead in the future and push Europe towards a European position.
Of course, this is not easy for Germany, because of the relationship with Israel.
It has always been a sensitive topic.
But I think it is clear to the Germans that they have to play a more independent role.
Does Germany see itself as a major international player? Does he want to take over the lead role at all?
Or is the leading role still difficult for Germany?
Germany is still not used to it, it is still unpleasant, and for obvious reasons it is still difficult for this country to play a bigger role.
For example, if we look at the European crisis, anti-German sentiment will emerge whenever Germany takes on a greater role.
This does not make it easier for the Germans.
It&#39;s actually an old problem: we don&#39;t want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
In this respect, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the United States.
It must be acceptable to a variety of neighbors and opinions, and it is not easy.
The US &#39;s influence in European politics is now steadily declining, but the EU is not currently filling this vacuum. Who else is left here?
The Germans will simply have to play a bigger role.
Even if they don&#39;t like it, it&#39;s uncomfortable and will make it much more unpopular - c&#39;est la vie!

&quot;Brand protection&quot; in China: when Puma and Armani are suddenly Chinese
Armani is a world famous brand, Polo Ralph Lauren as well.
But what is Armani Polo?
Behind this lies a designation that is completely officially registered in China, but has nothing to do with the original company.
However, it enjoys protection until it is prosecuted by the real owners of the brand.
And even then, it is not clear whether they will get the rights.
&quot;It&#39;s becoming increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their brands in China,&quot; said Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer at Taylor Wessing&#39;s law firm that specializes in infringing rights in the Far East.
A new case lands on my desk every week.
Counterfeiters only need a few extra letters to register their marks.
For example, the Gucci brand will become Lu-Gucci and they will register Prada-Kny instead of Prada.
In this way, German companies, such as the manufacturer of sporting goods Puma, are also legally copied.
Pattloch opens a file folder with the Beijing Trademark Office.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company had the Zegna DF Puma brand protected there. An artificial name that parasitizes even on the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
The Chinese are known to be world champions in copying and infringing intellectual property.
In large cities, there are multi-storey department stores, which sell almost exclusively counterfeits.
But Pattloch&#39;s cases are different. On behalf of its clients, it opposes the fact that Chinese companies officially receive from the trade mark office the right to use a sign that is already protected elsewhere.
The Chinese call it &quot;Bang Mingpai&quot;, an associated brand.
This word focuses on &quot;Bang Dakuan&quot;.
This means women who hunt rich men.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt.
&quot;It&#39;s damaging business, we have to fight it,&quot; Pattloch said.
&quot;The brand will dilute, the exclusive position will disappear, the damage to the image is enormous.&quot;
The financial losses and legal costs of the affected industries go into the millions, especially for expensive demonstration products.
According to the market research company CLSA, China is the third largest market for luxury goods and the fastest growing market with a volume of 15 billion euros per year.
However, deleting dubious entries in the register of marks is difficult to achieve and it costs something.
Driving can take up to nine years, with uncertain results.
Pattloch tells of cases where the court dismissed the lawsuits because the name complained of became a &quot;market reality&quot; after a long period of time.
If the plaintiff is unlucky, he still has to pay the plagiarist because he damaged his brand in China, says Pattloch.
Sometimes there is a law of the jungle.
Known cases also concern graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler lost a lawsuit against construction machinery manufacturer Sany, a company that recently took over the German concrete pump manufacturer Putzmeister.
Therefore, the Chinese are still allowed to use an emblem that resembles a Mercedes star.
Geely, which bought Volvo, originally used a blue and white logo that resembled BMW. The dispute was settled, Geely had to change her logo.
Fashion goods manufacturer Lacoste lost in China to counterfeiters from Hong Kong and Singapore, who turned the famous crocodile in the opposite direction.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt.
Although the CTMO trademark admits that there were shortcomings in 2010 due to too few employees and premises.
But last year, he reportedly &quot;returned to normal from the emergency.&quot;
For example, the number of pending opposition proceedings fell by 22 percent.
57,000 of these cases were closed, 75 percent more than in the previous year.
Nevertheless, 81,500 complaints are still pending at the office.
Doing something against it is expensive
As is often the case in China, these are impressive numbers.
Last year, CTMO received more than 1.4 million applications for brand protection, which is almost a third more than in 2010.
This is a record and means that China is keeping a list of new applications around the world for the tenth time in a row.
This also applies to the number of all valid trademarks - there are a total of 5.5 million.
In 2011, 1.8 billion yuan was collected on fees.
Simply put, each registration costs an average of 1,280 yuan, or 160 euros.
It takes several times to start a dispute against this, as the case of the German family business Freudenberg shows.
This concern has been fighting a Chinese plagiarist for more than seven years.
Although the Germans managed to cancel its illegal production of imitation car parts.
However, the counterfeiter continued to secure Chinese rights to the Freudenberg brand.
We would forget this ourselves, because surnames cannot be protected in Germany, says Hanno Wentzler, Chairman of the Board of Freudenberg Chemical Specialties in Munich.
The CTMO trade mark office then also rejected the objection of the Munich company.
In the other two instances, Freudenberg claimed rights, but the defendant continues to fight to this day.
You have to be very careful
The matter is now before the Supreme Court.
Wentzler is confident that he will bring the matter to a good conclusion and praises the professionalism of the courts.
But he also says, &quot;Driving is extremely expensive and costs us a lot of time, money and nerves.&quot;
Internal costs cannot be quantified. They even had to look at hundred-year-old files in the company&#39;s archives to present evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg offered the other party a &quot;high six-digit euro amount&quot; in vain to settle the dispute.
&quot;You see what it means to us,&quot; says Wentzler.
The danger from the Far East threatens to hit Europe as well.
This is the case if the imitators secure unprotected marks there.
One Chinese manufacturer, for example, wanted to register the Freudenberg label for footwear and leather in Germany.
The group has long since given up this area of business activity, yet it has been able to avert registration.
&quot;You have to be very careful,&quot; says Wentzler.
He and Attorney Pattloch advise German companies to be very careful when doing business with China.
It is not enough to rely on international trademark rights. Rather, foreigners should &quot;register everything worth protecting in any way in China,&quot; says Wentzler.
Otherwise, it can be much more expensive than registration.
Indeed, if Freudenberg succumbs in the last act of its brand drama, then it will probably have to pay royalties to the other party in its own name, Wentzler explains.
Or we will be pushed out of the market in the controversial segment.
World AIDS Day: stomping, singing, helping
In Heidelberg, the Imbongi choir rehearses - and in Swaziland, orphans rejoice at their parents who died of AIDS.
The story of a connection that spans much more than 8733 kilometers.
First there is trampling: cowboy boots, basketball boots, women&#39;s pumps and men&#39;s moccasins look for tact on the dance floor and quickly find it.
One two three four.
Then the voices of the singers - alto, bass, tenor and soprano - slowly rise - urging, mom and chasing each other.
The 29-year-old conductor Fiete Hopf almost lifts it off his textile shoes as he connects the voices with his supplely wild gestures.
It&#39;s Monday night. The Imbongi choir is rehearsing a new song in the music hall of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg.
Fifty female singers came between the ages of 23 and 69, from a human genetics researcher to a janitor.
&quot;Om&#39;Obani&quot; is not an easy song, each choral voice has a different text and in a very foreign language - Zulu, spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and parts of Swaziland.
Self-help help
Unaids, the United Nations&#39; AIDS program, estimates that there are approximately 34 million people living with HIV worldwide.
Of this, 23.5 million live in southern Africa.
There are 245,000 orphans in Swaziland after their parents have died of AIDS.
More than 40 percent of the population is already HIV positive.
For 180 orphans from their parents who died of AIDS, Voices for Africa found patrons in Germany in the village of Esitjeni.
70 of them attend secondary school.
Patronage can be accepted for 15 or 20 euros per month.
It guarantees the child tuition, school uniform and one hot meal a day in the Gogo-center.
In the Zulu language, Imbongi means &quot;storyteller&quot; or also &quot;one who glorifies.&quot;
No one in this space can speak fluent Bantu, just sing.
For almost ten years, the choir has been rehearsing songs in this foreign soft language, and sometimes it also brings them back to where they originally came from: South Africa.
At an air distance of 8,733 kilometers from Heidelberg, there is the village of Esitjeni in the northeast of the Kingdom of Swaziland, which depends on the power of the German choir&#39;s voices.
Forty percent are infected
About 2,000 people live there, some still in plain clay or straw huts. Most of them are children.
More than 300 of them no longer have parents because they have succumbed to HIV.
In Esitjeni, you can see in a small way the whole of Swaziland: the highest rate of HIV infection, the lowest life expectancy in the world according to UNICEF.
The population does not accept male foreskin circumcision, which has been shown to reduce the risk of infection by half.
More than forty percent of people in Swaziland carry a weakened immunity virus. It is not uncommon for them to die in less than thirty years.
The village was discovered by a church on a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005. Above all, however, members of the Imbongi saw many children on the streets, who lacked not only parental care, but everything: food, clothing, education.
Without a school education, they have no chance at all in a poor country.
Initially, it was a private commitment of individuals, which for a few euros a year allowed to send the child to school and give him one hot meal a day.
However, a year later, the church &quot;Voices for Africa&quot; was founded, which has since cared for orphans by parents who died of AIDS, almost professionally.
Facts About Sexually Transmitted Infections
What are the most serious sexually transmitted diseases?
Bacterial SPIs include syphilis, chlamydia, and gonorrhea.
Common viral SPIs are HIV, human papillomaviruses, genital herpes, or hepatitis.
Cells and scabies belong to the parasitic SPI.
Who belongs to the group of the most affected?
Syphilis and gonorrhea occur mainly in men who have sex with men.
The Robert Koch Institute estimates that at least four out of five cases of syphilis reported in Germany are transmitted through sexual contact between men.
In heterosexual adults, the most common sexually transmitted diseases are chlamydial infections, trichomonads, candidiasis, gonorrhea, and human papillomaviruses.
HIV is relatively uncommon among heterosexual adults in our country, but about 20 percent of people newly infected with HIV fall into this group.
Chlamydial infections are significantly more common in adolescents than in other populations.
According to European surveys, three quarters of all infections affect young people aged 15 to 25.
In addition, human papillomaviruses are often found in our country.
How did the number of infections develop?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases need to be reported.
According to the Robert Koch Institute, the number of people infected with syphilis more than doubled from 1,697 in 2001 to 3,698 in 2011.
The number of people newly infected with HIV has been declining since 2007.
In 2011, there were about 2,700 cases.
That&#39;s about one-tenth less than the year before.
What symptoms indicate a venereal disease?
Infectious diseases can cause ulcers in the genital area, difficulty urinating, discharge, abdominal pain and blisters or warts.
However, they often do not cause any pain or other symptoms and therefore remain unnoticed.
How is it possible to protect yourself?
Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but they do not offer 100% protection.
Because sexually transmitted diseases can be partially transmitted by infection from impurities and close physical contact.
Therefore, experts recommend, especially in the case of frequent changes of sexual partners, regular examinations.
In the case of early diagnosis, it is possible to cure most SPIs and prevent later consequences.
Thanks to patronage, charitable donations and, last but not least, royalties earned by singing all over Germany, some money is raised.
&quot;In total, we have already sent about 200,000 euros to Esitjeni,&quot; says Annette Lennartz, president of the association.
Money from Germany is managed in the village of Zodwa Dlamini itself, a confident woman who can assert herself.
She also makes sure that orphaned children find shelter, for example with one of the grandmothers.
Gogo, as old women are called in the Zulu language, is the backbone of the village.
Some of them even took 14 orphans, gave them a roof over their heads and made sure that the children arrived at school on time every day in uniform.
Children who no longer have anyone go to a shelter for Khanyisila, a lonely woman paid by the guild, as well as two cooks who cook for more than 200 hungry children a day.
In addition, &quot;Voices for Africa&quot; set up a sewing school, built two chicken coops, and, together with the American health organization PSI, arranged for many people in the village to have an HIV test.
This is not a matter of course. Although the disease is so obvious throughout the country, everyone is silent about it.
King with 14 wives
&quot;AIDS is absolutely taboo,&quot; says Annette Lennartz, &quot;because it has to do with sexuality.&quot;
Actually quite strange in a country where the king officially maintains 14 wives.
The last absolutist monarch of Black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his immense lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
Among other things, this state-approved lifestyle is to blame for the fact that the HIV virus has spread so rapidly in recent decades.
But also many migrant workers who spread the virus across the country.
Annette Lennartz says condoms are free on every corner, &quot;but no one uses them.
Culture is different - unprotected intercourse. &quot;
To promote cultural exchange at least a little, Imbongi travels every two or three years together in southern Africa, singing songs full of grief, militancy, confidence in the future, and black self-confidence that many in the southern tip of the black continent have known since apartheid.
A bus full of white people singing songs in the language of blacks - such an award not only brings mood and joy, but has also shed tears in many savage border soldiers.
The journey always leads to Esitjeni, where the singers visit the children they have patronage over.
Although you can hardly find this village on maps, in the valley of the river Ezulweni it is more than known.
&quot;Go to Esitjeni, there is light,&quot; people say there.
And when you return to Heidelberg, which is 8733 kilometers as the crow flies, to the stomping singers in the rehearsal room on Bergheimer Straße, you can see that the light is shining here as well.
Messenger: NASA has discovered ice on Mercury
The Messenger spacecraft has found evidence that there is ice on the planet Mercury.
The ice cover could be up to 20 meters thick.
The US National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has proven the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although it is closest to the Sun, there is also frozen water, according to three studies published by the scientific magazine &quot;Science&quot; on Thursday.
The Messenger spacecraft has found evidence that there is an ice sheet in the area of this planet, which lies in permanent shadow.
It is said to be at least 30 centimeters and maybe even up to 20 meters thick.
This water apparently came from comets or perhaps from asteroids that hit Mercury.
But let&#39;s not relate the finding of ice to the existence of life on this planet, said Sean Solomon, the chief scientist working on the Messenger spacecraft.
The temperature on Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius.
However, the findings could help clarify how water and other essential elements of life entered other areas of the solar system.
Probes, telescopes, and small robots like Phoenix, unnoticed by Earthlings, take part in exploring the depths of space.
From time to time, images are sent to Earth, small windows in endless distances.
The image comes from a photographic device developed by German scientists at the Max Planck Institute.
Eight planets in our solar system, in addition to the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, which orbits the Sun behind Neptune, Ceres is not a &quot;planet&quot; by the 2006 International Astronomical Union&#39;s new conceptual definition.
This excerpt from an infrared image of the Spitzer Telescope shows a &quot;family portrait&quot; of countless generations of stars. The oldest stars look like blue dots, and the pink-colored &quot;newborns&quot; in the birth hall of the stars are less identifiable.
This star-forming region - scientists non-romanticly call it W5 - was discovered by the Spitzer Telescope in the constellation Cassiopeia at a distance of 6,500 light-years.
This changing heat of a dying star was captured by NASA&#39;s Spitzer Telescope.
The muffled ring consists of a material that the star ejected during the dying process.
In the giant Trifid Nebula, 5,400 light-years from Earth, new stars form from gas and dust.
The photo of the galactic &quot;cradle&quot; was taken by NASA&#39;s Spitzer Telescope.
The Pleiades star cluster, also called the &quot;Seven Sisters&quot;, is visible to the naked eye at night.
Thanks to the telescope, however, the colors stand out better.
The Helix Nebula may look like a red eye to an observer in this infrared image.
It is located 700 light-years from the constellation Aquarius.
Its resemblance to the Earth&#39;s continent earned this nebula the name of North America.
The combination of normal and infrared photography is the cause of the extraordinary color.
Only the infrared detectors of the Spitzer Telescope were able to detect this &quot;baby&quot; among the stars in full beauty.
Saturn and its rings: how they formed is one of the greatest astronomical mysteries.
Perhaps these are the remnants of Saturn&#39;s moon, which disappeared without a trace 4.5 billion years ago.
One of the largest and sharpest images of the Hubble Telescope: a vortex galaxy
Images of spiral galaxies become real works of art, depending on their color.
The image, published by the European Southern Observatory, shows the Trifid Nebula in the constellation Sagittarius, several thousand light-years away.
The name Trifid comes from the Latin word &quot;trifidus&quot; (divided into three parts, triangular), because the dark streaks of dust divide the glowing heart of this stellar maternity hospital into three parts.
In the constellation Hadonos, astronomers have photographed the cosmic collision: 400 million light-years from Earth, the nuclei of two merging galaxies are sweeping each other and must inevitably collide.
This birth of a star was recorded by the Hubble Telescope in the spiral galaxy M83.
If you don&#39;t like technical abbreviations, you can call it the nickname Jižní Větrník.
A photograph from the Hubble Space Telescope shows a section of the Iris Nebula in the constellation Cepheus.
This nebula, 1,400 light-years away, consists of dust grains that are ten to a hundred times smaller than ordinary house dust.
This image was composed of optical and X-ray images of various telescopes.
It depicts a ring of black holes that is 430 million light-years from Earth.
This group of galaxies, called Arp 273, was recorded by NASA&#39;s Hubble Space Telescope.
Scientists call this larger spiral galaxy UGC 1810.
In this stellar nebula is the brightest group of young stars in our Milky Way.
The cradle of the stars gives rise to ever new additions.
These star clouds, associated with the Rosette Nebula, are also giving birth to new young stars. They are 5,000 light-years from Earth.
There is still no dust in this brightly glowing galaxy with a small black hole, only gas.
Scientists believe that it formed only shortly after the Big Bang, when there was mostly hydrogen throughout the universe.
Our views into space: the most important telescopes
The telescope was allegedly invented in 1608 by Hans Lipperhey. Before Galileo, Galilei used it a year later to observe the stars.
Since then, the mirrors of optical binoculars have grown ever larger - and the views they convey are getting deeper.
For 19 years, from 1947 to 1975, the largest telescope in the world was the Hale Telescope at the Palomar Observatory near San Diego.
The mirror in this picture was five meters in diameter.
There is a Large Binocular Telescope in Arizona, USA.
It allows you to look into space using two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The interior of the Gran Telescopio Canarias on one of the Canary Islands - La Palma is huge. Only the mirror measures 10.4 meters in diameter.
The Southern African Large Telescope mirror in South Africa is segmented to save costs.
Nevertheless, its diameter reaches about eleven meters.
Disadvantage of the cheap construction method: the telescope is secured with a hook at a height angle, which limits its mobility.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas is also fixed at a height angle.
Its peculiarity is the high amplification of the luminous flux.
This is comparable to the world&#39;s largest mirror telescopes, despite its relatively small mirror diameter.
Using a radio telescope in Arecibo, Puerto Rico, space scientists are searching for extraterrestrial signals.
This radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
&quot;Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence&quot; (SETI) - the search for extraterrestrial intelligence - can help any computer owner who makes their computing power available.
A view of the European Southern Observatory (ESO) observatory in the Chilean Andes.
There stands a Very Large Telescope - and it lives up to its name.
This telescope with a total of four mirrors can illuminate even the middle infrared spectrum.
The European extremely large telescope is also planned at the ESO observatory in Chile.
Its main mirror should be 42 meters full and composed of almost 1000 mirror elements.
However, the images can be expected in 2018 at the earliest.
Until 2007, Keck&#39;s two telescopes on the Hawaiian Mauna Kea volcano were considered the largest in the world.
They offer two mirrors, each with a diameter of ten meters.
Keck&#39;s telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea observatory, which, in addition to them, also looks into space using the Subaru telescope and the IRTTF.
A new giant telescope is also to be built on Mauna Kea - with a mirror diameter of 30 meters.
Here you can admire it in the picture.
However, the Hubble Space Telescope provides the most significant impressions from space.
He has been providing us with shots of distant worlds since April 24, 1990.
Since March 2009, the Kepler Space Telescope has been searching for extrasolar planets - especially those that are habitable.
On February 2, 2011, NASA announced that 1,235 candidate planets had been identified since the beginning of the mission.
The picture documents the last preparations before the launch of the Kepler space telescope.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will not be launched into space aboard the Ariane5 rocket in 2018 at the earliest.
The primary mirror of the space infrared telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the telescope&#39;s tasks is to search for the light of the first stars and galaxies after the Big Bang.
Scientists believe that there is ice on the south pole of Mercury.
However, there is no reliable data for this, as Messenger orbits this planet much closer to the North Pole.
Radar measurements have shown for decades that there is ice on Mercury.
Thanks to the Messenger spacecraft, which was launched in 2004 and is the first to orbit Mercury, scientists are now confident.
Drink butter daily and live 168 years
In southern Azerbaijan, many people live to the Bible age.
There is even a museum of longevity.
Searching for clues in a country where 97-year-olds are still relatively young.
In southern Azerbaijan, many people live to the Bible age.
There is even a museum of longevity.
Searching for clues in a country where 97-year-olds are still relatively young.
We can call the ride through the Talyš Mountains wildly romantic.
The minibus rumbles down a road with many bends along densely wooded hills, predatory rivers and simple farmhouses.
Everything is green and juicy, we almost seem to be in the Black Forest.
However, this is the far south of Azerbaijan. The border with Iran is only a few kilometers away.
Here lives the Caucasian ethnic group of Talis, about which not much is known, apart from the fact that they speak perfect Persian and Azerbaijani and live to a very old age.
The final station is Lerik.
This town boasts too monumental architecture from Soviet times, which somehow does not fit into the picturesque mountain landscape.
Tourists from Europe do not come here. Arriving from the Azerbaijani capital Baku is too difficult.
It takes eight hours for 323 kilometers, because the road is only single-lane.
The fabulous wealth that the country owes to oil in the Caspian Sea has not yet arrived in the countryside.
However, Pilata Fatulajeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has to become a tourist attraction.
&quot;Baku became famous for the Eurovision Song Contest in May - and we will have a festival of the world&#39;s oldest people here next year,&quot; says Fatulaeva.
She is the director of the Museum of Longevity, probably the only one in the world.
Here, the lives of almost eight dozen Talys from the area, who are over a hundred years old, are documented. Fatulajeva shows a black and white photo.
This is my grandfather, he was 120 years old.
At the age of 136, he still fathered a child.
However, the controversial star of this museum is the sheep herder Şirali Müslümov, who was reportedly 168 years old.
However, there is no birth certificate.
And given that the oldest person with documents was 122 years old, Müslüm&#39;s age seems extremely questionable.
&quot;He was born in this area in 1805 and died in 1973,&quot; Fatulaeva explains.
The man was reportedly married three times and had 23 children. At the age of 136, he allegedly fathered a daughter.
So wasn&#39;t Şirali Müslümov at the age of a few decades wrong?
However, Rembrandt Scholz, a gerontologist at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, also heard about the elderly in Central Asia.
&quot;Remarkably many people of old age also live in some areas of China, Japan or the Hunza Valley in Pakistan,&quot; says Scholz, &quot;and extremely many very old men also live in Sardinia.&quot;
However, due to the lack of evidence, no scientific evidence of age can be provided, especially when registries are missing.
A glass of melted butter every day
The fact is, however, that people in the area around Lerik live the Bible age remarkably often.
There are currently 20 people over the age of 100.
So why do so many elderly people live here in the south?
The Azerbaijani guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains this with the special genes of the Talis.
On the contrary, the director of the Fatuljev Museum believes that this is about nutrition.
However, the fact that the caloric diet of the Italians, who love meat, bread and especially dairy products, and many of whom drink a glass of melted butter daily, is so healthy, does not seem very credible from a bromatological point of view.
Or is it the original way of life that keeps people young? Rubab Mirzaev lives in Cengemiran, a small settlement near the town of Lerik.
At the age of 97, she is still relatively young at this latitude.
Mirzaeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house, which is typical of the entire Caucasus region.
He sits on the ground with a butter churn, which he rockes tirelessly.
Eight people live here under one roof, including one of Mirzaeva&#39;s sons and a daughter. Both have long been grandparents.
Two small children are also jumping around.
In the kitchen, tea is prepared for guests, which is served in typical belly &quot;armada&quot; glasses.
Mirzajev&#39;s white teeth form a perfect row and under the scarf she hides long dark blond braids, which her son proudly reveals in front of us.
I always washed my hair with milk, so it didn&#39;t look and kept the color.
&quot;I&#39;ve also never used shampoo,&quot; says Mirzaeva.
A monthly pension is enough for life
She always ate only what came from her own yard, tomatoes, potatoes, peas.
I have never bought food in a supermarket in my entire life.
Then he tells me about his husband, who was in the army.
It was the worst during World War II.
But everything improved when Gelaydar Aliyev &quot;beloved father&quot; took over the oar.
Propaganda sounds strange from an old woman&#39;s mouth.
However, the cult that takes place around the figure of the Father of Nations, who ruled his country as dictator, knows no bounds in Azerbaijan.
He was in power until 2003, when his son Ilham took over the oar.
At least the old people in Azerbaijan are not in need.
Mirzaeva receives a pension of 230 manatas each month (approximately the same amount in euros). This is the amount from which it is possible to enjoy well.
And perhaps Mirzaeva&#39;s long-gray son is right: &quot;Old people enjoy great respect in our culture.&quot;
They live in the middle of a large family, are loved, cared for and are happy.
Unless there&#39;s a reason to stay alive as long as possible
The term &quot;human rights&quot; is missing in the constitution
The revolution returned to Cairo.
The quarreling demonstrations in Cairo revealed the country&#39;s deep rift.
The future constitution based on Sharia law is widely discussed.
The Egyptian president did not spare pathos.
We need to create a transition.
&quot;And I am responsible for our success, before the people and before God,&quot; he said on state television.
His speech was addressed to the whole nation, but especially to the Christian Copts, liberals, enlightened Muslims and secular persons.
All of them, still hopelessly disputed in confused opposition, are afraid.
Fear of the &quot;state of God&quot; on the Nile at the mercy of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood.
Mohammed Mursi almost apologetically said that he had temporarily limited the powers of the Constitutional Court and expanded his own to &quot;save the revolution.&quot;
But what the 61-year-old engineer, who has a doctorate from an American university in Southern California, really wants to save, the Egyptians and the world are not clear about.
Should the judiciary be deprived of power?
The 234 sections, which the stubborn Constituent Assembly, with a predominance of Islamists, hastily approved in a fifteen-hour night marathon, are of some concern.
As in previous constitutions, this proposal states that jurisdiction is based on &quot;principles of Islamic law.&quot;
But what does &quot;principles&quot; mean?
This has been and is a matter of interpretation, and it is to be feared that Islamists will use this vague wording and the associated legal leeway for a stricter interpretation of sharia.
At the very least, this is clarified by a newly added paragraph: In all matters concerning sharia, it is necessary to consult the University of al-Azhar, which is the most important Islamic institution in the country with a great influence on the whole Sunni Islam.
This does not have to be, but it may mean that the clergy will oversee the legislation, which would bring the judiciary a de facto deprivation of jurisdiction.
There are many things to interpret in the draft constitution
The problem is also that the civil jurisdiction of the military courts should be maintained.
Under Mubarak&#39;s rule, these courts served to suppress the opposition.
After the fall of the dictatorship, up to 11,000 civilians were in military custody.
As the proposal states, the state should also protect &quot;the true nature of the Egyptian family and promote its morals and values.&quot;
This is legally so inaccurately formulated that, with the help of this paragraph, state institutions could even control the content of film art and literature.
In plain language, this means nothing but censorship.
After all, no paragraph defines explicit equality between men and women in writing.
However, another section forbids defaming or slandering the Prophet Muhammad and his envoys.
However, it remains unclear what defamation is and how it will be prosecuted.
Equally dubious is the wording that &quot;insulting people&quot; is forbidden.
In this case, is a cartoon of the president or a joke on behalf of legal experts enough?
A matter of interpretation, like many others in this proposal, which Mursi will submit for signature and, in his words, will present &quot;very soon&quot; to the Egyptians for the purpose of a referendum.
&quot;The revolution is back&quot;
Opposition to the superiority of Islamists has been forming for several weeks.
Tens of thousands of people gathered in unusual unity on Friday night in Cairo&#39;s Tahrir Square and promised to destroy the constitutional charter before it came into force.
&quot;The revolution has returned and we will win,&quot; said Hamdin Sabbahi, who placed third in the presidential election.
Nobel laureate and former director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed Baradei, said the draft constitution was &quot;a dustbin of history.&quot;
Through Twitter, he accused Mursi&#39;s supporters of wanting to carry out a &quot;coup against democracy.&quot;
&quot;If a referendum is called, we will go to his palace and overthrow it,&quot; said opposition member Yasser Said.
&quot;We are not tired yet, the blood of our brothers is not yet punished,&quot; the Egyptian media quoted opposition politician Khalid Ali as saying.
Several judges have said they do not want to oversee the referendum, which would invalidate it.
&quot;The Quran is our constitution&quot;
The well-organized Muslim Brotherhood declared anti-demonstration, but out of caution not in Tahrir Square, but after a mass prayer on the other side of the Nile in front of Cairo University.
It was attended by many veiled women and Salafist supporters, who shouted, &quot;The people demand the application of God&#39;s law.&quot;
They called on Mursi: &quot;Clean the earth!&quot; and assured, &quot;The Qur&#39;an is our constitution.&quot;
The struggle for sovereignty over the symbolic Tahrir Square, where it all began, would probably provoke a state similar to the Civil War.
Mursi&#39;s followers clearly didn&#39;t want to risk that.
The Muslim Brotherhood said opponents and supporters of the draft constitution spoke out loud and clear.
Now is the time to let the people at the polls decide which direction the country should go.
A majority in favor of the Islamists&#39; proposal is considered certain.
&quot;The word &#39;human rights&#39; does not appear once&quot;
The forced constitutional dispute, which should actually continue until February and integrate all social forces, is being debated by Hafiz Abu Sa&#39;du.
The 48-year-old human rights defender and chairman of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EOHR) defended members of the Muslim Brotherhood when they were in prison or standing trial under Mubarak.
Not because he shares their ideology, but because human rights are indivisible to him.
For this he was beaten, convicted and imprisoned.
&quot;And in the new constitution, the words &#39;human rights&#39; are not once,&quot; he complains in an interview with &quot;Welt am Sonntag&quot;.
Mursi&#39;s extension of power to all three branches of power in the state forced this lawyer to resign.
These measures are a scandalous offense against the democratic rules of the game and will lead Egypt to a new dictatorship.
&quot;Instead of strengthening civil society, the president has effectively abolished it,&quot; Sa&#39;da complains.
But without civil society organizations, democracy cannot work.
Sa&#39;da also feels abandoned by the international community, which is watching the struggle of ideological factions on the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
That could work out for him.
A protester in Tahrir Square warns: &quot;You have created a monster that you can no longer control.&quot;
Norwegian rakfisk: The most smelly fish in the world?
Five million people living in Norway enjoy one of the highest living standards not only in Europe but also in the world.
Could the secret of the country&#39;s success be linked to a local appetite for extremely stinking fish?
Take some overripe cheeses.
Put them in the middle of a pile of dirty and wet football gear.
Let it lie for a week.
This will give you the smell of paralyzing the smell of rakfisk, one of Norway&#39;s greatest delicacies.
I&#39;m in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
There is snow, a beautiful view - and there is a ubiquitous smell in the air.
Rakfisk is a salted trout that has been fermented in water for up to a year - depending on how much you want the fish to smell.
As it gets dark and cold, the Norwegians begin to gather here in Fagernes for a festival dedicated to this, best to say, the most captivating meal.
&quot;You eat it raw and then drink it with a glass of aquavit,&quot; says Havard Halvarsen, a local professional firefighter, but also the so-called &quot;Rakfisk General&quot;, who is responsible for the festival.
All around us, people eat small fish cubes and drink a lot of alcohol.
&quot;Some people prefer aquavit to rakfisk,&quot; says Havard.
The drink can overwhelm the odor.
I&#39;ll try a few pieces.
If a fish can avoid your nose, it&#39;s not that bad - it&#39;s similar to a piece of sushi that was on a long bus ride.
Rakfisk is a product of a very different time when there was poverty in Norway, and because refrigerators did not yet exist, fish were soaked in airtight barrels of water and salt in the autumn.
Then, in the middle of winter, when they were well fermented, they pulled out and ate - their senses no doubt dulled by alcohol.
Just a generation ago, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country and look for work, mostly emigrating to the United States.
Currently, the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants attracted by a lot of work, high earnings and an extensive care system.
The people of Sweden, an old rival who was until recently much richer than Norway, are flowing into the country for work.
Rakfisk is seen as something important, an indispensable, albeit relatively fragrant, part of Norway&#39;s past.
It is one of the more expensive dishes on the market.
Although everything is expensive - a small glass of beer or a sandwich will cost you £ 9 ($ 14) apiece.
Norway often does not make it into the global news - and this seems to suit most people.
The name of Anders Breivik, a right-wing racist extremist who shot 77 men, women and children last year, is still mentioned with disgust.
Instead, the shooting is called the &quot;July 22 event&quot;.
Norwegians can hardly believe that in their peaceful country, one of them was capable of such brutality and murder.
Behind Norway&#39;s current wealth lies the growth of one of the world&#39;s largest oil and gas industries from the early 1970s.
&quot;But oil is not the only reason we are doing so well,&quot; says our waitress Anna, who with her long blond hair and surprisingly blue eyes, is a prototype of Nordic well-being when serving plates of lying rakfisk.
We are, as they say, thoughtful people.
Her English, like the English of most people here, is absolutely flawless.
We don&#39;t show off, we don&#39;t like pomp.
Norway handles its oil wealth very carefully - except for a small percentage, most of the money in this sector is invested in a special fund for future generations.
When everyone else was wasting money they didn&#39;t have in the years leading up to the global financial crash, the Norwegians had their strings tightened on their bags.
&quot;As long as we can ski in the winter and go on trips in the summer, we are happy,&quot; says Anna.
&quot;And eat rakfisk,&quot; he adds with a carefree laugh.
I&#39;m standing in the snow in line for something to eat - I&#39;ve had enough rakfisk.
Such an elk burger is definitely something else and is beautifully juicy.
But in the evening the smelly fish is here again.
The hotel where I live is one of the many places where rakfisk is served for dinner and where guests choose the best, or rather the most demanding fish for smell.
They have a connection with a live television broadcast, in which the moderator with a bow tie is surrounded by plates with rakfisk.
It&#39;s like a Eurovision Song Contest.
&quot;What score do you have for the best fish up there in the mountains, Thore-Juergen?&quot;
&quot;Here&#39;s our score, Havard.&quot;
There is applause and laughter.
A man falls from his chair, perhaps overwhelmed by aquavit.
Or maybe fumes from all those fish.
Enrique Pena Nieto from Mexico has a difficult start
As incoming Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto prepares for office, Will Grant of the BBC looks at the challenges he faces and the mixed expectations of his fellow citizens.
Traffic in Mexico City is currently particularly poor.
In a city that is clogged even in the best of times, steel barriers have been erected to close several key routes to the capital and cause chaos on the roads.
However, the aim was not to prevent commuters from getting to work, but to prevent protesters from accessing parliament.
On Saturday, the new President of Mexico, Enrique Pena Nieto, will receive a presidential sash and take over the leadership of the nation.
He faces a challenging task.
Mexico was doing well economically at the time of the resigning Felipe Calderon, but the country is in the grip of a drug war that has already claimed an estimated 60,000 lives in six years.
&quot;My government has a strong commitment to the Mexican people to reduce violence,&quot; President Pena Nieto told US President Barack Obama at the Oval Office earlier this week.
I will propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve this goal.
Before shaking hands with the US president, President Pena Nieta gained political experience as governor of his home state of Mexico.
Opinions on the new leader also differ in his old homeland, the populous and vast state surrounding the capital.
Straight man.
For example, in the rural town of Valle del Bravo, he is well remembered.
Citizens attribute it to the development of tourism in the resort and the construction of infrastructure.
You can now drive to the city on one of the new motorways built by Pena Nieto. These highways are a huge improvement over the leaky and bumpy roads that used to be here.
Boards with his name also hang on the wall of a modern sports center and an impressive interactive museum on climate change.
&quot;We expect it to bring about real and lasting change,&quot; said Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, a friend and political ally of President Pen Niet&#39;s party in favor of the Institutionalized Revolution (PRI) party.
We especially hope for the interesting and real changes in security and the economy that our country so desperately needs.
After an uninterrupted 81 years in power, the PRI party was pushed out by Vicent Fox.
Mr Olvera admits that after 12 years outside the Los Pinos presidential palace, much is expected of Enrique Pen Niet inside the party.
And he rejects the statement of the opposition characterizing the new president as a man without substantial content.
He is a very straightforward man, very interested in an excellent vision of the country.
He is a great statesman and above all he is a man who can listen.
But on the other side of the state, this is not the impression that many people have of their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast with the cobbled streets of Valle del Bravo could not be more apparent.
Tucked under highway overpasses in many ways resembles a suburb of the capital of Mexico itself.
And the problems in the municipality are also persistent and urban.
Earlier this year, the military was called in to help deal with drug gangs operating in neighborhoods, especially violence against women.
In the last two years alone, the bodies of dozens of murdered women have been dumped in desolate places next to a huge landfill.
At the time of Pena Nieto&#39;s governor, more than 1,000 women were murdered in Mexico, much more than in the notoriously violent city of Ciudad Juarez, a place synonymous with the murder of innocent women.
At best, critics of Pen Niet say he failed in office to adequately address the issue of female homicides.
And in the worst case, they accuse his leadership of closing his eyes.
In a concrete house, typical of a dilapidated neighborhood, Irinea Buendia shows me photos of her late daughter Mariana Luna and suppresses crying.
According to the official version, Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
However, her family believes that she was murdered by her partner.
&quot;When I arrived at her house, it looked like someone had washed her body,&quot; recalls Mrs. Buendia.
There were signs of blows on it, and the posthumous stiffness had already begun.
As her mother tells the story, Mariana stares down from the picture on the wall, next to the cross, which contains a single word: &quot;Justice.&quot;
However, this is, as the family says, exactly what they were denied.
The authorities treated me as if I were an old gossip, a troublemaker, and a whimper.
They want you to just accept what they say and keep quiet.
&quot;But it can&#39;t be right with so many mistakes and omissions,&quot; he says.
The sherpa that President Pena Nieto will receive on Saturday is accompanied by a great deal of responsibility.
In the last six years, tens of thousands of families in Mexico have been affected by violent crime, and the new president has promised to be his priority during his tenure.
&quot;I hope he will be the same president as the governor,&quot; said PRI Olvera in Valle del Bravo.
However, this is exactly what the families of the victims in Ciudad Neza fear most.
Bradley Manning did not complain of ill-treatment, says the military prosecutor
The military prosecutor is trying to refute Bradley Manning&#39;s allegations of ill-treatment in custody.
The hearing focuses on Manning&#39;s military detention in Quantico, Virginia.
The defense wants the case to be dismissed on the basis of the harsh treatment of Manning in prison.
The soldier is accused of stealing thousands of secret documents.
The military prosecutor is trying to prove that Private Bradley Manning, who is accused of the largest leak of secret material in US history, missed many opportunities to complain about the ill-treatment he allegedly suffered in military custody.
Military Prosecutor Maj. Ashden Fein at the cross-examination of Private Manning at a preliminary hearing in Ft. Maede in Maryland claimed that records of Manning&#39;s weekly visits to unit officers during his nine months in custody at Quantico, Virginia, showed no allegations of ill-treatment.
The cross-examination, which took place during the defense hearing to dismiss the case against Manning on the grounds of ill-treatment during detention, which is in itself a sufficient punishment, took place the day after Manning testified that he had considered suicide in custody. .
A military intelligence analyst arrested in June 2010 is accused of stealing thousands of secret documents while serving in Iraq.
The material was then published online on WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks never confirmed that Manning was the source of her information.
At Friday&#39;s hearing, Military Prosecutor Fein and Manning went through forms filled out by officers after a meeting with Manning at Quantico Remand Prison, where he was held under high security from July 2010 to April 2011.
Officers asked Manning questions and recorded his answers.
When Fein asked him about these forms on Friday, Manning admitted that he rated the treatment of his guards as &quot;excellent&quot; and that the overall treatment at the facility was &quot;very professional.&quot;
The forms show no complaints of ill-treatment, although Manning&#39;s officers directly asked how he was being treated, Fein said.
Manning replied that he had expressed concerns about the various issues orally and that the officers who had visited him had spoken to him about the concerns and indicated that they would address them, but did not notice the problems.
&quot;They wrote &#39;no problems&#39; (after discussing the concerns), and that didn&#39;t necessarily mean I didn&#39;t mention them,&quot; Manning said.
Judge Col. Denise Lind also asked Manning why he had not complained about the treatment of his person in January 2011 during a meeting with a committee assessing suicidal thoughts, which he had expressed on the form a few months earlier.
Manning replied that during the meeting, his intention was to achieve a reduction in the &quot;injury prevention&quot; regime.
The military said it had used this restrictive regime (one level under suicide surveillance) to protect it and the safety of others.
&quot;I wanted the detainees to know that I was fine and that I wanted to abolish this injury prevention regime ... so that I could enjoy an improved quality of life, as I saw it,&quot; Manning said.
Manning on Thursday testified about his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Kuwait, where he was held for nearly two months before being transported to a detention center at the Quantico Marine Corps in July 2010.
He said he was considering suicide in Kuwait and passed out once because of the heat.
He said that the fact that he was not allowed to know what would happen to him and what was happening in the world around him was very depressing.
&quot;My world has shrunk only to the base of Arifjan, to that cage,&quot; Manning said on Thursday.
I thought I was going to die in that cage.
Manning said that after arriving in Quantico, he spent most of the days (at least 21 hours, but often more than 23 hours) in a small cell without any company.
Manning said he was only allowed one mattress, a blanket, slippers, some clothes and glasses.
He said he tried to walk because sleeping or just lying around was against the rules during the day.
Manning said he always slept with the light from outside the cell in his eyes.
He said that if the guards could not see his face when he turned to the other side at night, they woke him up and had to turn back.
Manning&#39;s lawyer lodged a formal complaint about the treatment of Private Manning in January 2011.
Manning was transferred to Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, a military prison in April 2011.
On Friday, Judge Manning also questioned the allegations he made in Thursday&#39;s statement that, after being forced to sleep naked in his cell in Quantico for a night, he was also forced to stand naked in front of guards and other fellow prisoners during the morning count.
Manning said he was not allowed to cover himself with his blanket during the count.
During Judge Manning&#39;s interrogation on Friday, he said he had decided from his guards&#39; orders that he had a blanket to cover for, but admitted that no one had given him an order to postpone it.
On Thursday, Manning said he had been forced to sleep naked the night before because he had tried to show the officer that he was not dangerous.
Manning said he told the officer he could use a belt from his underwear or his booties to hurt himself, but he didn&#39;t.
Manning testified that his underwear, his booties, and his glasses had been removed from his cell that night.
His lawyer hopes that the judge will take into account his experience during his imprisonment and that in the event of his conviction in a military court, which is expected to begin early next year, he will significantly reduce his sentence.
The defense said it planned that Manning would plead guilty to lesser crimes and that he would fight other allegations because they were too extreme.
The hearing is scheduled to begin this week, with the military prosecutor expected to defend the terms of custody as justified.
The Pentagon said a statement that Manning had been held in accordance with regulations regarding all detainees held with maximum security.
Allegations against Manning include aiding the enemy, illegally disclosing intelligence documents on the Internet, transmitting national security information, and stealing public property or records.
If he is charged at all points, he can be sentenced to life imprisonment.
My crisis of Mexican-American identity
He says many people have been forced to leave Mexico due to insufficient opportunities there.
Mexicans tend to blame those who left; they remind them of hard times, he says.
Navarrette says Mexican Americans are trapped between two worlds.
On my last trip to the Mexican capital, I barely made it through the crowd and arrived at the immigrant agenda area, where I encountered a problem.
The arrows pointed to one of two fronts: one for &quot;Mexicanos&quot; and the other for &quot;Extranjeros&quot;.
I stood there for a few seconds and didn&#39;t know where to go.
I grew up in Central California and was called a &quot;Mexican&quot; my whole life.
It&#39;s an ethnic acronym, the same as when my friends in Boston call themselves &quot;Irish&quot; and my friends in New York call themselves &quot;Italy.&quot;
So later I ended up calling myself a &quot;Mexican American.&quot;
But this was Mexico.
And there was no need to use abbreviations in my grandfather&#39;s homeland.
I was just American.
I speak Spanish well enough to handle both sides of the conversation in this language.
However, I do not have the vocabulary of a native speaker and I cannot get rid of the American accent.
So I pulled out my American passport and lined up for &quot;Extranjeros.&quot;
I was thinking about the moment when the newly elected Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto visited President Obama&#39;s White House this week.
They had the usual issues on the agenda, which are discussed when the leaders of the two countries meet: immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto also wanted to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, which is one of the reasons why Mexicans are just as likely to stay in Mexico as they are traveling to the United States.
It wants to unite with the United States and Canada and create a trade bloc in North America similar to the European Union.
And Pena Nieto promised to continue the Mexican war on drug cartels, although he did not provide any details.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and full of hostility.
Most Americans probably never thought about the fact that in 1848 the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leader, under threat of weapons, to rewrite half of Mexican territory to the United States.
But for Mexicans who have been thinking for centuries, not minutes, comments are ubiquitous.
So a minute after the US official says something a little critical about Mexico, you hear in the Mexican press and among the elite complaints about how Americans are interfering with their neighbor&#39;s sovereignty.
And the children of Montezuma set out on a war path.
And yet, the real challenge for Mexico is the relationship with the more than 35 million Mexican Americans living in the United States.
Do you want to talk about hostile feelings?
There are a lot of them.
In Mexico, there are winners and losers, people to whom the country offers opportunities, and others to whom.
The only reason so many people with Mexican roots live in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that at some point in our family tree was a person, perhaps a parent or grandparent, who was in Mexico. denied the opportunity and had to go north.
And more often than it seems, this person matched the profile - dark skin, poor education, descent from a poor village, etc.
We are their descendants and we are loyal to them.
Not against Mexico.
And even though we now live the American dream, go to good schools and have a good job, we can never forget the fact that we live the American dream, not the Mexican dream.
Our identity can sometimes be unclear, but our loyalty is not.
It is against the United States.
And besides, we are aware that many elite Mexicans belonging to the ruling class do not like us.
This feeling is mutual.
They see us as a reminder of a humiliating defeat and see us as an inferior race that is not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our ties to Mexico will never be strong enough.
In their opinion, our existence is only about failure.
If our families in Mexico had not failed, they would never have left it.
And we would not now be trapped behind a silk curtain, with a good life in the United States, but still with lost souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and legally came to the United States as a child, reminds me that there is tension between Mexicans and Mexican Americans because Mexicans have a better understanding of who they are, and Mexican Americans are reluctant.
Although a citizen of the United States, she sees herself as part of two countries.
And at the same time, many Mexican Americans I know don&#39;t feel part of either.
We love listening to Mexican bands, Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.
You get the best of both countries, but you don&#39;t have roots in either.
In Mexico, they look at us as Americans.
And in the United States, we are considered Mexicans.
And to make relations even more complicated, some Mexican leaders and some of the intelligentsia, as I learned on my trip, want to reconnect with the diaspora.
They want Mexican Americans to work for Mexico as &quot;makeshift ambassadors&quot; and represent Mexican interests in the United States.
We should tell our fellow Americans how great it is to visit this country and press political leaders to strengthen relations with Mexico.
No.
So that won&#39;t happen.
Too many hostile feelings.
And with income inequality and widespread corruption and drug violence, many of us are not sure it&#39;s a great country.
I feel like it&#39;s up to you, amigos.
That&#39;s fair.
If at least some Mexicans are not prepared to forgive the United States for dealing with Mexico one and a half centuries ago, then they must accept the fact that some Mexican Americans still feel reluctant to treat their family members in the near future.
Hmmm.
Maybe we&#39;re more &quot;Mexican&quot; than I thought.
Old battles, the new Middle East
A ceasefire between Israel and Hamas could still be an uncertain basis for peace.
Can there ever be lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
The next round of bloodshed suggests that not every such thing is in vain.
Among the usual unnecessary speculation about who started it, many buildings were demolished, killing more than 140 Palestinians, mostly civilians, and six Israelis. And for the first time, rockets hit Gaza near Tel Aviv, the Israeli capital, and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But while Israelis and Palestinians appear to be stuck in their long-standing conflict, the Middle East is changing all around them.
The Arab Spring has changed the old order, and Palestinians and Israelis, whether they like it or not, are caught in the chaos in the region.
Maybe it will make their fight even bloodier than ever.
However, there are reasons to think that this can break their deadly stalemate.
A war that is neither won nor lost.
At first glance, there do not seem to be much reason for optimism at the moment.
Even if the ceasefire on November 21 lasted, the fighting from this week intensified the hawks on both sides.
Leaders of Hamas, the Islamic movement that has ruled Gaza since 2007, will claim to have forced Israelis to retreat, even though Gaza has been defeated.
Despite the killing of several Hamas leaders and the closure of Gaza&#39;s 1.7 million people in one of the most deplorable and populous corners of the planet, Israel has failed to destroy Hamas.
Indeed, Hamas is gaining influence in the West Bank, another piece of Palestine that is currently ruled by its staunch rivals from Fatah, a more moderate Palestinian faction.
In addition, Hamas leaders may well conclude that time is on their side.
Islamists have gained more influence throughout the Arab world, so Hamas has made powerful and wealthy friends.
Turkey, a resurrected regional power that was once Israel&#39;s closest Muslim ally, has joined Hamas. So is Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic countries in the Gulf.
Cheers from Hamas say the Islamic crescent is encircling Israel, in the north of Lebanon, where the Hezbollah party / militia rules, through Syria, where rebels who are increasingly leaning towards Islamism can oust Bashar Assad to Jordan, where Hamas allies threaten the king.
And above all, on the southern wing of Israel, the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood under President Muhammad Mursi in Egypt, by far the most populous and pivotal Arab country, changed the balance in the region.
Husni Mubarak, a secular despot who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, had no time for Hamas.
On the contrary, the Brotherhood is a cousin of Hamas and its leaders are more influenced by public opinion.
In future diplomacy, Hamas may emerge as a player who cannot be ruled out by Israel or America.
By contrast, Israeli hardliners come to the opposite conclusion.
In military terminology, Hamas was put back in a box.
Israel&#39;s Iron Dome anti-missile system has proved its worth, and many Hamas missiles have been destroyed.
Israelis can sleep better - for a while.
In diplomatic terminology, America is as steadfast as ever. Many European countries have also blamed Hamas for launching the latest round of violence.
And most importantly - Israel prospered, especially under the leadership of Benjamin Netanyahu, the prime minister, who mostly ignored the peace process.
Although Gaza rockets have killed about 30 Israelis since 2004, there has been relatively calm in Israel from suicide bombers, thanks in part to a wall that extends into the West Bank, a major part of what may one day be a Palestinian state, and protects Jewish settlements. which are still growing despite their illegality under international law.
Prime Minister Netanyahu, whose Likud party had teamed up with an even more radical group led by Avigdor Lieberman at the start of the January 22 election campaign, is in a good position.
Why pamper those treacherous Palestinians by giving them their own state?
If they really ruled the West Bank, wouldn&#39;t they launch rockets like their compatriots in Gaza did?
It will be better if we hold them behind that wall and hit them when they stick their heads out.
Proponents of the hard line may win, but the Arab Spring may change their calculations.
Although Islamists gaining power in Egypt and other countries do not love Israel very much, their main priority will be to deal with domestic problems.
Israel&#39;s defense spending is higher than that of all four of its Arab neighbors combined.
The launch of a new war with the local superpower will hardly help the new Arab governments to heal their economy.
The fact that President Mursi has worked with President Barack Obama to bring a ceasefire is a good sign and could mark the beginning of something new.
Israelis should also look at the situation from a long-term perspective.
At a time when the rest of the Arab world is becoming more democratic, denying Palestinians the right to self-determination is creating a barrel of gunpowder that must one day explode in Israeli-occupied areas - just like a bus that exploded in Tel Aviv last week.
Already, repression is undermining democracy in the Jewish state, and demographics are exacerbating the situation as the Arab population grows.
The bloody attacks on Gaza every few years to push Hamas will increasingly take a diplomatic toll.
Both sides need external incentives.
The answer is what prudent people on both sides, most of the outside world and these newspapers are preaching: two states where Israel cedes territory for security reasons.
In the short term, there is little hope that a ceasefire will give outside pressures at least a little more influence in enforcing the matter.
Egypt, which, together with Turkey and Qatar, must work to halt arms supplies to Gaza, is in a better position than ever to persuade Hamas to accept the idea of a 1967 border-based Jewish state with the exchange of parts of the country and shared Jerusalem.
Arabs from outside must also push for an agreement between Hamas and Fatah.
This would do more than an immediate offer of virtual state sovereignty at the UN to create a Palestinian state.
President Obama also has a role to play in getting Israel to the table.
During his first term, he neglected to present his own peace plan.
Now, back in the White House, he seems just as reluctant to enter the process.
That&#39;s woefully short-sighted.
America has a vital interest in a stable Middle East.
That means a peace settlement between Israel and the Palestinians.
Ugly cigarette packaging laws have entered into force in Australia
Warnings for smokers and sick parts of the body are displayed on unsightly green boxes, which are the same for all brands of tobacco.
Australian laws on ugly tobacco and cigarette packaging, the world&#39;s first of its kind, came into force and replaced logos and brand colors with generic olive green boxes with disgusting images of diseased body parts and depictions of children and newborns ill with their parents&#39; smoking.
In addition to various health warnings and pictures, the only difference between the boxes from Saturday is the brand names, which are printed in the same lower case.
This is the strictest regime in the world regarding tobacco packaging.
The Australian federal government claims that the aim is to discourage young people from smoking by depriving this bad habit of its appeal.
It relies on studies that show that if people don&#39;t start smoking by the age of 26, there is a 99% chance they will never start smoking.
&quot;Even for very young children, you can see that he understands the message that tobacco companies are trying to sell them with their product,&quot; said Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek, citing studies showing, for example, that children associate a crown in a logo with the idea of to be a princess.
While Australia has one of the lowest smoking numbers in the world and the changes will have little impact on the profits of multinational companies, other countries are considering similar steps.
The tobacco industry has lobbied hard against the introduction of these laws.
Tobacco companies have argued that the law will increase black market trade, leading to cheaper and more affordable cigarettes.
&quot;This legislation will have serious unintended consequences,&quot; said Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia.
Counterfeiters from China and Indonesia will bring many more of these products, which will be sold on the streets of Australia.
Another claims that the laws have increased their business.
Sandra Ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family business, said demand for silicone cigarette packs to cover disgusting boxes two months ago when British American Tobacco, Britain&#39;s Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost their appeals concerning the laws to the Australian Supreme Court, increased from almost zero sales.
Ha said Zico has sold almost 6,000 units to wholesalers and expects new stocks.
It&#39;s a good deal for us.
Experts cite the popularity of social media among the demographic group targeted by the plan as a possible snag.
Tobacco marketing has moved online following a number of Australian laws banning television advertising, sponsoring sporting events and requiring most retailers to hide cigarettes from view.
Australia has banned online advertising by local companies and websites, but cannot restrict foreign sites.
&quot;If you are a marketer in the tobacco industry and you only have this little space to promote your products, online space is the unbeatable place you want to be,&quot; said Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at the University of Sydney. .
Ms. Freeman noted an increase in brand ratings on social networks such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook by the &quot;average Honza&quot;.
We have to ask, is it just a private citizen who really loves Marlboro cigarettes and got the job and created this video, or is there a marketing company involved?
British American Tobacco Australia claims that the industry has focused on how it handles new regulations rather than marketing.
The industry has gone so far as to pay Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge the new regulations - countries within the World Trade Organization claim that trade is unfairly restricted, despite the fact that none of the countries trades significantly with Australia.
The decision of the SOO is expected in the middle of 2013.
Minister Plibersek says the government has held talks with other governments considering similar packaging laws.
Canada was the first country to introduce mandatory warning photographs in 2001.
They have now expanded to more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
Stricter laws are being considered by the United Kingdom, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many smokers in Australia resist.
The pictures have no effect on me.
I just ignore them.
&quot;You just take out a cigarette and put the box back,&quot; says Victor El Hage as he buys the box with a photo of the tumor in his mouth.
Honestly, there&#39;s only one reason for me to quit smoking, and that&#39;s my little daughter.
James Yu, who owns the King of the Pack newsagent in the center of Sydney, claims that the uniform boxes make it harder for him to put them on the shelves.
&quot;It took me an hour to unload the cargo, now it takes me four hours,&quot; Yu said.
&quot;The government should just ban them completely, then we&#39;d say, &#39;OK, it&#39;s over, let&#39;s close the shop,&#39;&quot; he said, throwing up his hands.
In a world of constant connection, it&#39;s not so bad to be bored
The last Thanksgiving I unexpectedly spent five hours at the airport when our plane was having mechanical problems and we had to wait for the arrival of another plane.
So we had a lot of time to think about boredom.
I will not lie to you.
Waiting half a day at the airport for the next flight is pretty annoying, despite being distracted by books, magazines and an iPhone (not to mention duty-free shops).
But some scientists and child development experts are increasingly coming to praise for boredom.
They say that it is good for us (and our children) to get bored at times.
It forces the brain to go in interesting directions, which can encourage creativity.
And since most of us are constantly connected to a screen these days, we don&#39;t have a chance to enjoy boredom.
So should we encourage boredom?
Yes.
And no.
But I&#39;ll come back to that.
First, like many people, I assumed that boredom was a relatively new phenomenon that occurred with the advent of more free time.
But as Peter Toohey, a professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary in Canada, author of Boredom: A Lively History (Yale University Press, 2011).
&quot;In fact, boredom has a long history,&quot; he said.
On the walls of Pompeii was found a Latin inscription about boredom, dating from the first century AD.
And then there is the question of how we define boredom.
The problem is that it has been defined and discussed in many different ways, said John D. Eastwood, a professor of psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada.
After reviewing the research literature and demonstrating the idea to a target group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined boredom as an experience &quot;I wanted to do something that would satisfy me, but I was not able to.&quot;
Boredom differs from apathy in that the person is not involved in anything, but would like to be.
He says that there is no urge to do something about apathy.
He says the core of boredom is &quot;disrupting the process of attention associated with a bad mood and a feeling of slow passing time.&quot;
Boredom can be very reminiscent of depression.
But Professor Eastwood said that while they may have a relationship, bored people tend to see the problem as the environment or the world, while people who are depressed see the problem in themselves.
Sometimes we think we are bored when we only have difficulty concentrating.
In their study &quot;The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention&quot;, published in the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science in September, Professor Eastwood and colleagues pointed to an earlier experiment in which participants listened to a tape on which a person read an article from magazine.
Some groups heard a loud and unrelated television program in the next room, others heard it so quietly that they barely noticed it, while the third group did not hear it at all.
Those who heard the television program quietly reported more boredom than the other two groups - they had difficulty concentrating, but they were not sure why and attributed these difficulties to boredom.
When you try to focus on a difficult or engaging task, distractions can lead to boredom, said Mark J. Fenske, a professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, when you&#39;re doing something boring, &quot;like looking for the wrong parts on a factory line, distracting music can help keep you from getting bored.&quot;
In fact, he said, we now know that twisting and scribbling, often seen as a sign of boredom, can actually help fight boredom and keep people more physically alert.
&quot;Research shows that children who are allowed to fidget learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to sit still,&quot; said Professor Fenske.
We&#39;ve all been bored at times - the delay of my flight, the humming speaker, a particularly lengthy movie.
But some individuals have a better chance of getting bored than others.
To help measure boredom, researchers developed the &quot;Boredom Proneness Scale&quot; in the 1980s.
The scale includes questions like, &quot;Many things I have to do are repeated and are monotonous,&quot; and &quot;I have so many interests that I don&#39;t have time to do them all.&quot;
Using these scales, the researchers found that boys tend to get bored more often than girls, said Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, especially when it comes to the need for more and different external stimuli.
However, teenagers are generally indifferent.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of human and social development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted nearly 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day.
He found that 32 percent of teens said they were bored at school and doing homework, while 23 percent said they were bored when they were not at school.
On the other hand, 3 percent of parents said they were bored.
Professor Larson said he did not know if the percentage of boredom would be higher or lower now, 21 years later.
But he said he knew that &quot;adolescence is the peak time for boredom&quot;, which is largely due to the fact that children and young people are not given much control over what they want to do.
So back to my original question: &quot;Is boredom good for you?&quot;.
As research shows, sometimes not, because in its extreme form it can lead people to take absurd physical risks, gamble or abuse addictive substances as a way to alleviate it.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers have discussed the connection between boredom and creativity, said Professor Vodanovich, who has studied the problem for more than two decades.
&quot;Boredom is the way the brain tells you that you should do something else,&quot; said Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at NYU.
But the brain doesn&#39;t always know the best thing to do.
If you get bored and use this energy to play the guitar and cook, it will make you happy.
However, if you watch TV, it will only make you happy for a while, not for a long time.
So if your child gets bored and you give him an iPad, he won&#39;t be bored anymore, but he won&#39;t learn how to have fun or drive on his own, said Professor Fenske.
And &quot;this separate procedure is being transferred from one situation to another,&quot; the professor said.
Your child will not only learn how to entertain himself, but will gain more self-control in other areas.
I don&#39;t think we really want to celebrate boredom.
But we shouldn&#39;t be too critical of her either.
Rather, our goal should be to feel comfortable when we are out of reach of the constant rumble of activity and technology.
Professor Eastwood agreed.
&quot;We accuse her of being bored even more, but boredom is a painful, restless desire to be associated with something meaningful,&quot; he said.
What people are actually looking for, he said, is a way to relax and enjoy their free time.
&quot;In an environment where we are constantly overstimulated,&quot; he said, &quot;it&#39;s hard to find ways to have fun when the noise goes off.&quot;
There is no handbook in Colorado on the new marijuana law
Nineteen-year-old Anthony Orozco, a college student and footballer in southeast Colorado, is facing criminal charges for something that will soon be legal throughout the state - possession of several grams of marijuana and a pipe he used to smoke it.
Mr Orozco said he was driving with several friends in Lamar, on the plains near the Kansas border, one September day when he was stopped.
After a police officer found marijuana in his car, Mr. Orozco was summoned for possession of drugs and drug paraphernalia - minor offenses for which there is a $ 100 fine - and a trial date was set.
&quot;They treated us like criminals,&quot; Mr Orozco said.
But is he a criminal?
In the uncertain weeks following Colorado&#39;s vote to legalize small amounts of marijuana for recreational use, the response to hundreds of smaller drug cases depends on the spot rather than the law.
Hundreds of marijuana offenses have already been dropped here and in Washington state, which has approved similar measures.
Police departments have stopped blaming adults aged 21 and over for possession of a small amount that will be legally allowed once the law enters into force in the coming weeks.
But prosecutors in more conservative Colorado neighborhoods have said they will continue with existing marijuana cases and continue to accuse people of possession.
At the same time, several cities from the suburbs of Denver to the western mountains are voting to prevent the opening of new, state-licensed marijuana shops in their communities.
&quot;This matter is evolving so fast that I don&#39;t know what will happen next,&quot; said Daniel J. Oates, a police chief in Aurora, east of Denver.
Regulators in Washington state are also shaking their heads.
And they&#39;re looking for instructions on how to set up a licensing system for cultivation, production, distribution and sales - all by December 1, 2013.
They say that Colorado, for better or worse, is ahead of most states in regulating marijuana, first for medical use and now for recreation.
&quot;Colorado has a more regulated market, so it will be a good guide,&quot; said Brian E. Smith, a spokesman for Washington&#39;s alcohol licensing board.
But as Mr. Smith admitted, no place or system can do more than suggest what might work.
&quot;There is no real precedent we can follow,&quot; he said.
The Washington law, the so-called I-502, enters into force on December 6, which also leaves an annual vacuum during which there will no longer be a state licensing system, but legal possession will.
And there are tricky mechanical issues that need to be resolved during this time, such as how to balance a state directive on &quot;appropriate access&quot; to licensed marijuana with its ban on cannabis trafficking within 330 meters of schools, parks, playgrounds or children&#39;s centers.
&quot;Nowhere will it be more difficult to locate a licensed cannabis trade than in urban areas, especially in the Seattle metropolitan area,&quot; said Ben Livingston, a spokesman for the Center for Legal Cannabis, a recently established research group.
On November 21, Police Chief Oates of Aurora sent an e-mail to his officers informing them that the city prosecutor would no longer prosecute small marijuana offenses against any citizen over the age of 21 and that police would &quot;immediately&quot; blame people. for these crimes.
Chief Oates said police would enforce city laws governing medical marijuana growers and would continue to prosecute drug traffickers and dealers.
In Weld County, northern Colorado, District Attorney Ken Buck presents a stricter view.
After the vote, he said his office would continue to prosecute cases of marijuana possession, mostly as a way to pressure users to seek treatment.
Currently, 119 people face charges of possession of 56 grams or less of marijuana, although many face additional charges.
&quot;Our office has a duty to prosecute criminal offenses that were criminal at the time they occurred,&quot; Mr Buck said in a statement.
The reaction was also complicated in places such as the rural district of Mesa, where voters rejected the marijuana initiative.
Police in Grand Junction, the district&#39;s largest city, no longer accuse adults of possessing small quantities.
The district attorney, Pete Hautzinger, supports this decision, but has also decided not to dismiss all ongoing possession cases.
&quot;I don&#39;t think I&#39;m wasting my time continuing to enforce the law until it changes,&quot; he said.
Although 55 percent of Colorado voters supported the measure, bringing recreational marijuana into the arms of the government and the legal system will never be easy.
And opposing reactions across the state have revealed a deep rift between local officials in light of this large state green experiment.
For district prosecutors, this is a &quot;cultural barrier,&quot; said Sean McAllister, a Denver lawyer who represents defendants in possession of marijuana, and a local spokesman for the National Marijuana Law Reform Organization.
&quot;They&#39;ve spent so much of their lives prosecuting people that they still can&#39;t really accept it&#39;s legal,&quot; he said.
Colorado and Washington are the best states to treat small amounts of marijuana as alcohol, and are well on their way to becoming national test cases for drug legalization.
Advocates and government agencies are planning new frontiers for legalized sales, while also anxiously awaiting instructions from the federal government, which still plans to treat the sale and cultivation of marijuana as a federal crime.
Proponents of legalizing marijuana hope the Ministry of Justice will comply.
Despite several arrests of medical marijuana vendors and patients who attracted attention, most of the federal government has left medical marijuana stores in Colorado, Washington, and 16 other states in operation.
While drug agents are unlikely to slam the door to catch a small bag of drugs, they are likely to resist allowing state-regulated recreational marijuana shops allowed by the new law, said Kevin A. Sabet, a former drug policy adviser to the Obama administration.
Several Colorado cities are not awaiting federal action.
Even before election day, some local governments approved moratoriums on any new marijuana business, although it will take about a year before any business can open.
Last week, the city of Montrose in the west of the state proposed a six-month ban and is likely to take effect next week.
&quot;We don&#39;t want to find ourselves in a situation where we issue a license to someone and then we get a big federal affair out of it,&quot; said Bob Nicholson, a city council member.
Our municipality voted against this amendment.
We look at what the municipality voted for, as opposed to what the state voted for.
There are really many questions.
Petronella Wyatt: &quot;I was forced to leave Oxford because I&#39;m a conservative.&quot;
Today&#39;s university students are not the only ones attacked for their opinions.
I don&#39;t remember ever dreaming of studying at Oxford University.
Both my father and my older brother studied at a university that I thought was the world&#39;s largest seat of knowledge, a modern wrapped Greek symposium motivating the two pillars of civilization, free thinking and tolerance.
Meanwhile, in the late 1980s, within two weeks of attending Worcester College, where I wanted to study history, I packed my bags and rushed into the first scandal of my life.
My father collapsed and cried.
My friends were confused.
The Evening Standard claimed that I gave up because I objected to the students&#39; love in the next room.
Writer AN Wilson said frantically that I had left because I was forced to drink from battered mugs.
The truth was less comical.
I ran away.
Yes, I ran away because I was subjected to systematic bullying and intimidation.
Not because of my somewhat bizarre name or the fact that I came from a private school.
I was persecuted for one reason only, and in this cradle of supposed enlightenment, it was both bigoted and barbaric: my father, the late Woodrow Wyatt, was a high-ranking adviser to Margaret Thatcher and I was a supporter of the Conservative Party.
You may be wondering why I&#39;m pulling this out right now.
Simply because recent reports suggest that the new generation of students to the right of Wednesday are suffering similar persecution.
Institutionalized and growing hatred for conservative students at Oxford is so great that last week, a group of these students sought the same protection of equal rights as gays, people with disabilities and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the Junior Association (JCR) at Corpus Christi College claim that because of their political views, they are &quot;often actively isolated, subjected to personal attacks and shown that they are not welcome.&quot;
They call for the creation of a position on the University Committee for Equal Opportunities to ensure that they can express their views freely.
Their situation was not helped by the recent BBC Two documentary, Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right, about student politics, which portrayed conservatives as freaks and neo-Nazis.
The show featured a graduate of Joe Cooke, former president of the Oxford University Conservative Association (OUCA), who rode a Rolls-Royce, was dressed in a silver suit and had a silver-headed cane.
At other universities, conservative students say they are being treated as &quot;scapegoats&quot; because of the introduction of higher tuition fees.
Luke Black, 20, vice president of the Nottingham University Conservative Association, told a Sunday newspaper that &quot;left-wing influence in universities is growing.
People think we&#39;re like the Bullingdon Club without meeting us at all. &quot;
Twenty-one-year-old Corpus Christi history student Samuel Roberts, who is behind the greater protection movement, says the climate is &quot;unpleasant.&quot;
&quot;This poses a threat to the atmosphere of intellectual debate as well as to the well-being of members,&quot; he says.
During my first few weeks in Oxford, I was a minority of one member.
I joined in September 1986, 18 years old and cripplingly shy.
The hatred of the Conservative Party was the most feverish.
A year earlier, the university had voted to refuse honorary degree to former student Margaret Thatcher because of cuts in higher education funding.
Even the Stalinists would tremble with fear from the atmosphere.
During the first few days of the introductory week, when the new students met with each other and with the professors, I got to taste the wormwood that was to come.
I have found that not only do professors tacitly approve of stabbing conservative students, but they also enjoy participating in it.
The policy of mining strikes, privatization and the government&#39;s resistance to sanctions against apartheid in South Africa was brought into the wood-paneled auditoriums.
My first lecture was about translating an 18th century French text into English, and I was not prepared for what followed.
&quot;Miss Wyatt,&quot; said Professor Harry Pitt (now deceased), &quot;please translate the first paragraph.&quot;
I was pretty stiff.
Professor Pitt, a small man with a face like cake dough, was very bile.
&quot;Are the Thatchers refusing to learn French, or are they just stupid?&quot; he asked.
The other students giggled.
Tears welled in my eyes.
&quot;I suggest you take some basic French lessons in your spare time, unless you&#39;re too busy with social issues,&quot; Professor Pitt growled.
Overwhelmed, I returned to my room.
At dinner at school, I sat alone when I felt a light tap on my shoulder.
He was a sophomore named James who introduced himself as a member of OUCA.
&quot;I know who you are,&quot; he said kindly.
Unfortunately, this is so.
Anyone suspected of conservatism is the target.
It&#39;s bad enough for me, but they know your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so it&#39;ll be even worse for you.
Most conservative freshmen pretend to be Labor.
Later in the local pub, I cowardly tried to pretend.
I insisted that I disagreed with everything Thatcher said.
This trick proved unsuccessful.
A first-year student of philosophy, politics, and economics, who (what an irony) went to Eton, said, &quot;You are the daughter of a fascist pig.&quot;
You&#39;re infected.
The other students took notes with him.
I was perverted, dirty.
&quot;How do conservatives love each other?&quot; one asked.
They beat each other, right?
I felt how homosexuals must have felt before the liberal legislation of the 1960s.
Could I ever lead a normal life in Oxford?
Would I be forced to meet like-minded people only after dark?
Would I have to turn into a Labor and suppress my natural inclinations?
Three years before me unfolded as a purgatory of ignorance and isolation.
The only openly conservative professor was Norman Stone, a professor of modern history based at my faculty.
He was hated not only for being conservative, but also for being Margaret Thatcher&#39;s foreign policy adviser and one of those who spoke to her.
He was almost there.
He hated the place for its provinciality and pettiness and for its inclination toward the Marxist-deterministic view of history.
In 1997, he became a professor at Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey.
&quot;You won&#39;t be happy here,&quot; he told me.
I began commuting from Oxford to my parents&#39; house in London, seeking refuge with my unbiased metropolitan friends and family.
I told my father I hated Oxford and why.
He couldn&#39;t believe it.
During his studies at Oxford in the 1940s, all political views were accepted.
&quot;But it&#39;s the best place in the world,&quot; he said pathetically.
They wouldn&#39;t do that, not in a dreamlike city.
Even my communist friends have always had perfect manners.
His wet eyes darkened.
Try again.
I&#39;m sure it&#39;s just a joke.
It would break my heart if you left.
Exhausted by frequent trips to London, my emotional resilience worsened.
My friend, also a supporter of the Conservative Party, succumbed to the pressure and gave up his convictions.
The following week, during class, when another professor of history declared in all seriousness that I was an &quot;enemy of the people,&quot; I decided to do the same.
Although I blushed with shame inside, I admitted that my &quot;parents had brainwashed me&quot; and called them &quot;old fools.&quot;
The relief was only short-lived.
My father hammered a nail into the coffin of my Oxford career.
At that time, he wrote two columns for Murdoch&#39;s newspaper every week.
My door was locked.
I crouched inside, and after five minutes, my pursuers gave up.
When they left, I packed my suitcase and caught the first train to London.
I never came back.
You can call me a sipped weakling.
But no 18-year-old girl or boy should be subject to such intimidation and toxicity in an educational institution.
Even more tragic, however, is that it was Oxford, from which not only 14 conservative prime ministers emerged, but which also hides to this day behind the undeserved reputation of a place with equality and freedom of thought.
&quot;Valentino prefers elegance to fame&quot;
ABC spoke to Nata Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisz and other famous Italian designer customers on the occasion of the &quot;Valentino: Master of Fashion Design&quot; exhibition, which opened this week in London.
Somerset House, the ancient residence of Isabella I of England, is the only place in the British capital worth hosting Valentino Garavani&#39;s exhibition.
The designer confirmed this at the launch of the celebratory retrospective &quot;Valentino: Master of Fashion Design&quot;, which presents more than 130 top fashion models created by his studio over the past 50 years.
&quot;I love this castle,&quot; he says with his unmistakable Italian accent.
This exhibition concludes with a story in which &quot;il signore&quot; Garavani is the only protagonist who could not have been written without his esteemed clients.
Valentino always felt enchanted by the rare and distant world of the aristocracy.
The first hall of the exhibition, which will last until March 3, is full of private correspondence and photographs signed by the most important nobles, from Princess Salima Aga Khan through Greek Princess Maria-Chantal and Margaret from England to Lord Snowdon.
Valentino exhibits these personal memories as trophies of his social rise: from a simple tailor from the city of Voghera in northern Italy to the idol of the international &quot;bohemian cream&quot;.
There is nothing wrong with loving the royal family.
&quot;At least they won&#39;t stick a cigarette butt in a great rug, like some wonderful pop music celebrities do,&quot; says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisz.
In the 60&#39;s and 70&#39;s we both lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is an impressive host and guests enjoy it a lot and with elegance.
&quot;We were all very pleased to be invited to his cottage in Gstaad,&quot; explains &quot;Heini&#39;s&quot; wife Thyssen and a close friend of forgotten beauties like Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
&quot;Valentino has always preferred elegance to fame.
And yet he is a star. &quot;
Valeria Mazzová shows Valentina
Argentine model Valeria Mazzová does not forget about the designer&#39;s charisma either.
&quot;It &#39;s been a long time since we went to dinner with him after a parade in Piazza di Spagna in Rome.
There were twenty of us, and among us were Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
In every detail of his apartment, the decoration, the food, the music, he reflected in everything and his spirit could be felt.
Thanks to him, all the guests were able to feel important and loved, &quot;recalls the top model who started working with him during the Paris Week of Top Fashion in 1995.
&quot;He never goes out of fashion because his designs are works of art,&quot; he concludes.
A show of nobility
Gravani&#39;s life is not a story of obsessions, but of really reciprocating loves.
He loves people with good manners and better titles and they love him.
One of Somerset House&#39;s galleries has been converted into a distinctive 70-foot passage that offers a change of roles: the visitor turns into a model and marches through the passage to observe the &quot;audience&quot; of dreams wearing Valentine&#39;s masterpieces as the dress Jackie Kennedy chose for her wedding to Aristotle Onassis, the costume Monica Vitti wore on &quot;Night,&quot; or the wool and fur coat that belonged to Empress Farah Diba.
Names like Sibilla of Luxembourg, Gloria of Thurn and Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria and Sophie of Habsburg shine in the audience of mannequins.
Naty Abascal and designer in 2006
Many of these clients say that the first Valentino is like a first love, &quot;you can&#39;t forget him&quot;.
&quot;I remember it perfectly.
These were trousers, shirts, a &quot;gillette&quot; vest and a jacket from the autumn-winter collection from 1971-1972.
It was a gift he made for me, &quot;says Naty Abascal, one of the designer muses.
&quot;I prefer him to others for his femininity and great love for women, because it underlines our beauty,&quot; adds the former Duchess of Feria.
&quot;I really like the colors he uses, they brighten up a lot and give a&quot; sparkle &quot;to the face.
The proportions are perfect. &quot;
Even the princess and fashion icon Patricia della Giovampaola d&#39;Arenberg cannot forget how she first dressed Valentina.
When she was growing up and living in Italy, she longed to be of legal age and to have the opportunity to wear one of his evening dresses ...
It finally arrived in the late 1990s.
&quot;I bought my first dress from Valentin to celebrate the castle of my cousin, Prince Edouard de Ligne.
It was a red dress with a ruffled skirt, a pleated bodice and a strapless top.
It was a dream come true, &quot;says Rodriguez d&#39;Arenberg&#39;s widow.
&quot;Valentino is lax in fashion, his passion is timeless,&quot; explains the Italian aristocrat, whose life unfolds between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess d&#39;Arenberg has stored the designer&#39;s formal dress &quot;very carefully ... because the dress is not just a dress, it is also a set of memories they have in them.&quot;
The &quot;king&quot; of fashion
The highlight of the exhibition at Somerset House is the wedding dress of Marie-Chantal Miller from her wedding to Paul of Greece in 1995.
It took four months of work and 25 &quot;girls&quot; (as the designer calls his seamstresses) to create this ivory silk dress with sewn pearls, twelve types of different lace and a four-and-a-half-meter-long siding.
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the largest authority in the specialized press, these dresses represent a landmark of late-20th century fashion, &quot;the return of clients from high society.&quot;
Valentino, dazzled by the elitist &quot;savoir-être&quot; over the years, is now his best example.
Garavani such as the Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest honor in Italy), the Cavaliere del Lavoro, the Commander of L&#39;Ordre des Arts et des Lettres and awarded the Order of the Legion of Honor accumulate as many honors as any of his clients&#39; spouses.
&quot;My attention has always been drawn to his selectivity, calmness, tidy and perfect appearance,&quot; admits Princess d&#39;Arenberg.
&quot;I last saw him a month ago at a gala dinner at the Orsay Museum.
He was at the table with Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, my great friend.
He was perfect, time left no trace of him. &quot;
When the princess says that ...
The hardest craft in the world: sulfur carriers in the area of Kawah Ijen volcano
For four euros, carriers in the Indonesian volcano area gamble with their lives and health as they carry 70 kilos of sulfur down steep stone paths.
There are people for whom their work is hell, and there are those who literally work in hell.
This is the case of Anta Wijayi, one of the 400 miners who make a living by extracting sulfur from the Kawah Ijen volcano in the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
Because of this, they have to fare every day to the bottom of the crater, where sulfur gases escape from the interior of the Earth and, when in contact with air, become solid.
After cutting large blocks of sulfur, which together weigh up to 70 kilos, he takes them on his shoulders in two bamboo baskets along steep stone paths.
It is only 250 meters to the top of the volcano, which rises 2,386 meters, but it takes over 40 minutes for exhausted porters to ascend at a turtle&#39;s pace, as they maintain their balance and carefully consider their steps so as not to slip and fall into the abyss.
They know that any trip could cost them their lives, as happened to a French tourist who fell from the rocks of Kawah Ijen years ago.
Miners in Kawah Ijen earn five cents for every kilo of sulfur they extract
When they are upstairs, they make their way past tourists who photograph them as if they were monkeys in a circus, and wearily carry heavy baskets to the weight that the mining company placed a little lower, at an altitude of 1850 meters.
It is PT Candi Ngrimbi, which has been mining in the volcano since 1960 and has never paid its workers more than 662 Indonesian rupees (five cents) per kilogram of sulfur.
He then sells it for 10,000 rupees (83 cents) to the petrochemical industry, as this mineral has a place in everyday life and is used to make matches, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even sugar bleach.
&quot;Because they normally carry 70 kilos, we earn about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) for each trip,&quot; explains Anto, who usually completes three trips a day.
One trip takes him three hours and in the end he is destroyed, but he can earn 138,000 rupees (11.5 euros) a day.
While this may seem like a negligible amount for such inhuman efforts, it is three times what he would earn in the field.
&quot;The daily wage of miners is very high here. For example, coffee is paid 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) a day and a fortnight&#39;s pay is two million rupees (167 euros),&quot; explains a carrier who previously worked on a tourist island Bali as a bricklayer.
There was a salary of 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) a day and the work was not so hard, but Anto returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a village near the volcano, for a serious reason that is as convincing in Indonesia as sulfur: &quot;He married I was with a young girl from Bali who is Hindu and I took her to Java to convert to Islam. &quot;
Anto has asthma, he has difficulty breathing, he still coughs and his eyes are irritated by toxic gases
At the age of 27, Anto risks life three times a day in the Kawah Ijen volcano, whose sulfur has already begun to take its toll on him, even though his face is protected by a special mask and goggles.
He has asthma, he has difficulty breathing, he still coughs and his eyes are irritated by toxic gases escaping from the volcano.
This is the price he has to pay to achieve his dream.
&quot;I will work for another two years because I want to open a shop or study Spanish or French,&quot; he promises more than good English.
This sympathetic and intelligent young man with a destiny could be a tourist guide, a waiter or a receptionist at a hotel, and instead works as a porter.
She shares a dirty wooden hut with other carriers and gets up at two o&#39;clock in the morning every day, because the sulfur does not stop flowing at night and its characteristic yellow color changes to blue and glows in the dark.
Despite the surrounding darkness, Anto digs into the crater and illuminates the path with a small flashlight, which he has attached to his helmet, and he bought it for his own money.
About 400 carriers carry baskets of sulfur from the bottom of the crater on their shoulders
Although the company has high incomes, it has not mechanized the production of sulfur due to cost savings, nor does it provide any equipment to carriers working on their own and with such effort.
In fact, they do not even receive a share of 30,000 rupees (2.5 euros) from the photography surcharge, which, together with a ticket for 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros), is collected by nature park guards from tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its human resources. muly.
&quot;This job is for cattle, not humans,&quot; said Madrusin, a stout 42-year-old porter who has worked at Kawah Ijen for three decades since leaving school.
He manages to lift up to 110 kilos and assures us that he will last to work &quot;as long as he can&quot; because he needs money to educate his three sons between the ages of 18 and 10.
I&#39;m not retiring, I&#39;m going to die here because the volcano has been my whole life
Although sulfur burns the throat and stings the eyes when the wind unexpectedly turns and catches the miners in the thick fumes that emanate from the volcano, the miners are so hard that none of them complain that they are suffering from serious diseases ... but it is clear from their frequent respiratory problems, osteoarthritis, knee pain and shoulder wounds caused by the weight of the baskets.
Unainik, who balances his basket on his back, can load only 50 kilos at the age of 53.
Every day, he and his colleagues mine 15 tons of sulfur in the volcano, which three trucks take on a steep path between the thickets to a warehouse in Tamansari, 18 kilometers away.
&quot;I&#39;m not retiring, I&#39;m going to die here because the volcano has been my whole life,&quot; Unainik declares, opening his mouth wide and missing a few teeth.
Of his five sons, the eldest, thirty, also earns his living by mining sulfur.
Time passes, but the constant misery of one of the most difficult crafts in the world persists from generation to generation - the crafts performed by human mules in Kawah Iljen.
Singapore is looking for babies to save the economy
Singaporeans are tempted not to have children for career, stress and the cost of living and education.
&quot;Singapore&#39;s population needs growth.&quot;
I&#39;m married and I&#39;m a patriot, you&#39;re my wife and you&#39;re a patriot. Let us fulfill our civic duty and give birth to a new life!
It may seem unbelievable that this slogan is part of a menthol candy ad, but still - or maybe that&#39;s why - the video spread en masse on YouTube in Singapore earlier this year.
These sentences are part of rap, which uses local allusions like &quot;let&#39;s put the bun in the oven&quot; as a mockery of the birth rate in Singapore.
The advertising agency BBH, which created the video, hopes that this advertisement will be able to draw attention to the problem in a funny way.
Douglas Hamilton, the agency&#39;s artistic director, says he wanted to use the influence of music to make people fulfill &quot;their civic duty.&quot;
&quot;It &#39;s all a matter of the internet, so it had to be fun and funny.
This is the biggest problem in this country.
We are the worst in the world in reproducing our population, so we felt it was a topic we had to touch on.
We knew that the government was trying a lot of things like spreading pheromone perfumes or organizing dating parties.
Many of these ideas may have been creative, but not fully functional.
So we thought, why not do the most creative thing possible, like composing rap, to solve this problem. &quot;
1.2 children
The one who doesn&#39;t take it much lightly is the Singapore government.
It spends $ 1,300 a year on encouraging citizens to have more children.
The government&#39;s marriage and family package provides up to $ 15,000 per child, extends maternity leave, and allocates financial benefits.
However, all these measures had little effect.
Singapore is a rich, high-tech city-state in Southeast Asia, also known for its conservatism and strict social controls.
The birth rate in Singapore with regard to population stratification is currently 1.2 children per woman.
The last birth rate exceeded 2, which is considered the recovery rate, in 1976.
Why don&#39;t Singaporeans have more children?
Tan Wei Ming, director of the National Population Office&#39;s Marriage and Family Department, says it is because of &quot;better education&quot; and &quot;a wider range of career opportunities.&quot;
&quot;People have a wider range of options in terms of life goals and priorities, it&#39;s not just the wedding and the family,&quot; he explains.
These changes in societal norms have contributed to an increase in the number of single people and to the postponement of marriages and childbirth. The result is a reduction in the birth rate in Singapore.
While immigration policy has sought to drastically increase the influx of immigrants as a measure against population decline, this has caused resentment among locals.
Some Singapore websites show undisguised xenophobia against many new immigrants, especially the Chinese, who are criticized for keeping wages low and trying to integrate.
The increase in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why the ruling party of Singapore recorded its worst election result since the beginning of independence last year.
After the elections, there was an effort to solve the problem with quotas and higher fees for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While the decline in the birth rate has known effects on national economic growth, tax revenues, health care spending and immigration policy, there have also been some unexpected consequences for Singapore.
The government is trying not to build so many small houses.
For example, it began to affect the real estate business.
The Office of Urban Development has begun regulating the number of small flats known as &quot;shoe boxes&quot; that can be built in certain urban areas.
These apartments have an area of 46 square meters and have been a great success in sales.
However, there are concerns that these apartments may promote a youthful lifestyle and discourage developers from building large single-family homes.
But Lim Yew Soon, CEO of development developer EL Developers, claims that their &quot;shoe boxes&quot; are selling much faster than larger houses.
&quot;They are more popular, as they sell days to weeks faster than larger houses.
That&#39;s why they are much better for our cash flow. &quot;
However, he admits that the new standards set clearer rules for developers who were previously limited when they wanted to offer too many small houses in one project.
Too stressed
Singapore is a city-state.
Although these new rules could lead to an increase in the nation&#39;s birth rate, an interview with Singaporeans working in the financial district in the city center suggests that they will not have much effect.
&quot;People are still stressed, houses are expensive, as is education, which is why many people put it off,&quot; says the young official.
&quot;Let the others have children.
But it&#39;s important for me to rely on my own money and time, &quot;says another young man in his early twenties.
Both men and women cite careers, stress and the cost of living and education as reasons that prevent them from having children.
So no matter how hard the government tries to force citizens to have children, it is ultimately the Singaporeans who have the last word on starting a family.
What is private offline is private and online
Privacy.
According to a dictionary published by the Royal Spanish Academy, this is something of a personal nature or &quot;an area of private life which everyone has the right to protect against any disturbance&quot;.
What is privacy for a person under 16?
How does he apply this definition in his daily life and on social networks?
Does he understand the dangers to which he is exposed when he publishes matters on the Internet that he would certainly not tell anyone in ordinary communication?
Journalists from elPeriódico interviewed five boys and girls between the ages of 10 and 15, who are frequent Internet users.
In four cases, they considered the notion of privacy to be &quot;something entirely personal&quot; on a personal level and to be a &quot;username and password&quot; when it came to social networks.
&quot;My biggest secret I wouldn&#39;t reveal,&quot; says 10-year-old Jorge, trying to explain the importance of privacy in places like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has had accounts for two years.
&quot;They are very secret secrets, my mom may know about them, but not the whole world,&quot; he claims.
&quot;I put nice photos or photos of how we play on FB.
I also talk to friends there.
I wouldn&#39;t share a photo that wasn&#39;t mine, or a photo that would make fun of someone, &quot;he says.
This boy realizes that it is wrong to post obscene photos, photos of naked people or photos of crimes, or to write degrading or rude comments.
Jorge says he knows all 35 friends he has on FB and his nine followers on Twitter.
Most are relatives.
Among them is a mother who has the name and password of one of the accounts.
&quot;I set up a Twitter account so I can express my opinions and write interesting posts.
I don&#39;t know if anyone will answer me, I just put them there, &quot;he adds.
&quot;Social networking is fun, I can talk to relatives who are far or fast to communicate with friends,&quot; he says.
He does not hesitate to say that he would never accept a request from an unknown person.
He wouldn&#39;t even care if someone recommended someone unknown to him.
The case of fourteen-year-old José is different.
This teenager owns accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, and admits to the last mentioned network that he does not know 20 people from his friends list.
&quot;I&#39;m not afraid of that because we have something in common, like music,&quot; he says.
According to the boy, none of them guided him to anything, nor did he want an address or a telephone number from him.
&quot;If they urge me or ask me to do so, I will simply remove them from my account,&quot; he admits.
José signed up for Ask after reading the recommendation on Twitter.
This boy is no stranger to what is now called cyberbullying.
&quot;They blackmailed a friend on a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
He never knew who it was, &quot;he confirms.
According to José, the victim did not log out of the account.
&quot;She just activated private mode.&quot;
It then explains a series of steps on how to set up your account securely.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would post photos of acquaintances in unpleasant or embarrassing situations.
&quot;Of course I would do it if someone bothered me or I just wanted to.
Even though I know it&#39;s cyberbullying, &quot;he says.
Key issues
Marielos Porrasová, an English teacher and a graduate of Education and Teaching, believes that in order for children and adolescents to find their way around social networks, they must understand that the main goal of these networks is to inform.
He states: &quot;The Internet was created as a means of finding information, but when social networks appeared, the rules of the game changed.&quot;
Marrielos Porras notes that academic Marc Prensky, a graduate of Yale University&#39;s pedagogy and author of Digital Natives and Digital Immigrants, introduced these concepts to explain the phenomenon.
&quot;Digital natives are children and young people who were born at the time of this technology.
We are digital immigrants who have to teach them, and we are still learning for ourselves, &quot;he says.
He explains that it is a complex topic, &quot;because we ask them to recognize what is appropriate to disseminate, publish and say, and what is not, at an age when they are not yet mature&quot;.
Also, to be - in terms of the environment - prudent, at a time when what they desire most is to be popular, to have thousands of friends and not to think about the consequences, &quot;he adds.
According to this specialist, the most effective way to show children and teenagers what privacy is is to ask questions that make them think.
&quot;Telling them not to do something doesn&#39;t work,&quot; he adds.
Next, Marrielos Porras lists some of the possibilities: There are things you wouldn&#39;t tell a stranger, so why are you doing this on the Internet?
Or: Would you like someone to post your photo the way you posted your friend?
Do you know what others publish about you?
When you tag the people in the party photos, did you ask their permission?
And one more thing: Does everyone constantly need to know what you&#39;re doing?
Another point is to realize that they must behave in the Internet environment as well as outside it.
These are the same rules.
&quot;One follows the Internet from respect, morality and other principles, and the same should be true on social networks,&quot; he claims.
Surveillance
Estuardo Guardia, a university professor, primary school teacher and educational counselor, explains that it is essential that children&#39;s parents read the rules of social networks carefully.
&quot;If they understand all the tricks, they have a good basis for talking to children about the consequences of setting up an account on the Internet.
For example, in terms of age or what is allowed to be shared or published, &quot;he says.
The Guardia believes that it is crucial to remind children of the traditional rule of &quot;do not talk to strangers&quot;.
The South American Summit ends and the Lima Declaration has not been published
The Sixth Presidential Summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) in Peru ended today without the issuance of the Lima Declaration, which was announced and allegedly signed by the seven presidents present.
Efe has repeatedly tried to gain access to a document signed at the sixth meeting of Heads of State and Government of Unasur, but representatives of the Foreign Ministry and the President&#39;s Office, who initially decided to publish the document after the summit, said it would later be published on Peruvian websites. government.
They added that the content had been published by Peruvian President Ollanta Humala in several short press releases.
Journalists had limited access to information throughout the summit.
During the meeting, a video of the presidential assembly was transmitted in the press room without sound with the message &quot;confidential meeting, audio transmission prevented&quot;.
A small amount of information available to journalists was provided by spokespersons for some governments present at the meeting, but not to Peruvian spokesmen.
The only document released during the meeting was a list of participating presidents, which caused the resentment of hundreds of journalists from various national and international media who asked for more information.
The Peruvian presidential office later sent an e-mail to the media with a &quot;final statement&quot; from the summit, but this is only a statement by President Humala, and not an official document that closed the summit.
Last October, Peru hosted the third summit of South American and Arab countries (América del Sur-Países Árabes, ASPA), and even on this occasion the originally promised Lima Declaration was not published, although it was eagerly demanded by the press.
It can be found on the official ASPA website that the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities sought to ensure broadcasting for all journalists, but completely prevented the flow of information.
The summit ended, among other things, with a joint commitment by Chile and Peru to adopt a judgment of the Hague Court of Justice, which resolves a border dispute between the two countries.
Peru&#39;s President Ollanta Humala and Chile&#39;s President Sebastián Piñera met during a regional meeting, confirming that they would respect the ruling of the International Court of Justice in The Hague, which will begin hearing a dispute between Lima and Santiago on Monday by hearing both parties.
&quot;We will submit and enforce the ruling that will resolve the dispute we are hearing in this international court today,&quot; President Humala and his Chilean counterpart said.
&quot;Chile has been, is and will be a country respecting international law, peaceful settlement of disputes, conventions and international courts,&quot; Piñera added, greeting President Humal at the flags of both countries.
The two presidents&#39; confirmation that they would abide by the ruling of the International Court of Justice was released after Colombia adopted the Bogota Pact this week, expressing its compliance with the rulings of the international court ruling on the maritime border with Nicaragua, and Colombia considered the ruling to be completely wrong.
The summit was held without the participation of the Presidents of Brazil (Dilma Rouseff), Venezuela (Hugo Chávez), Bolivia (Evo Morales) and Argentina (Cristina Kirchner).
Paraguay was expelled from Unasur in 2011 following the dismissal of then-President Fernando Lugo and did not attend the meeting.
Host President Ollanta Humala was instructed to open the morning speeches and close the summit in Lima shortly after noon.
The president read the final document, informing that 16 agreements had been adopted and 31 projects were planned between South American countries, with investments of $ 17 billion.
In addition to the agreements reached, he said that UNASUR member countries would take &quot;important steps towards the goal of South American citizenship, for which residence agreements are being extended&quot;.
He said actions were being encouraged to improve &quot;cooperation in the fight against civil insecurity and transnational organized crime, better access to medicines and cheap internet in all corners of South America, and joint and effective action against the risks of natural disasters.&quot;
When Europe is in crisis, &quot;economic consolidation (of Latin America) should not be victorious, but it should serve to expand our productivity and show our nations a better future,&quot; Humala added.
&quot;We have decided to prioritize a group of 31 symbolic projects that will improve transport links between different parts of South America, especially rural and border areas ... so that our countries are better connected and create new economic ties,&quot; the Peruvian president said in a reading.
He mentioned that five of these projects concerned Peru and the transverse axes of its territory from the coast to Brazil, and the other two concerned better connections with Ecuador, but did not give more details.
The final document also touched on the political situation in Paraguay.
&quot;We hope that the electoral process in this country will serve to return it to the Union of South American Nations,&quot; from which it is currently excluded.
Another issue highlighted by the summit was the need for Latin America to remain a prosperous and peaceful area that is holistic and has good neighborly relations.
In this sense, Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos said before attending a regional meeting that he hoped to meet with his Nicaraguan counterpart Daniel Ortega in Mexico on Saturday to discuss with respect the ruling of the International Court of Justice on the maritime border dispute, which is questioned by Bogota.
&quot;It is possible that I will meet with President Daniel Ortega tomorrow (Saturday),&quot; Santos said.
&quot;We will discuss all solutions, none are ruled out, not even an agreement with Nicaragua that would require negotiations with this country,&quot; he stressed.
&quot;I hope to be able to tell President Ortega to conduct the negotiations in the most civilized and considerate form possible,&quot; Santos added.
Santos and Ortega will meet on Saturday in Mexico to attend the inauguration of President Enrique Peña Nieta.
At the summit, EU defense ministers met in advance to approve the 2013 Action Plan, which seeks to strengthen dialogue and consensus on defense in the region.
UNASUR members are Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay, although the latter is currently excluded.
Peru is the interim president of this regional bloc.
Rafael Correa: South America must learn integration from Europe
Ecuadorian President Rafael Correa announced today that the creation of common citizenship is a goal in which &quot;South America, in this case indeed, must learn from Europe.&quot;
Correa, who attended the sixth presidential summit of the Union of South America (Unasur) in Lima, said on state television TV Peru that Europeans &quot;were killed during World War II&quot; and in other conflicts, &quot;but now they are practically one country.&quot;
In this sense, he defended the project of creating South American citizenship, which the member countries of the Unasur organization support.
&quot;We need to achieve the free movement of citizens and workers within any South American country that is already taking place among the members of the Andean Community, but there are still regressive areas that want to take us back to the past,&quot; he said.
The Ecuadorian president said, among other things, that he agreed to the reorganization of the Organization of American States (OAS) on the condition that the influence of the Anglo-Saxon states be reduced and that those who signed the San Jose Pact on Human Rights were taken into account.
&quot;Those at the helm never commit to anything, and we South Americans will sign everything.
It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights in Washington is funded by the United States, &quot;he said, referring to the political asylum granted by Ecuador to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.
President Correa confirmed that he did not regret the decision because it did not betray his principles and respected his &quot;deep democratic values and human rights.&quot;
He added that at the time &quot;there were reasonable suspicions that Assange could be extradited to a third country regardless of the ongoing process&quot;.
He also criticized the Swedish judiciary, which asked him to be questioned on Swedish territory for alleged sexual offenses, &quot;and Swedish law itself allows the hearing to take place by videoconference, which could take place from the Ecuadorian embassy in London.
Correa said there was a risk that Assange&#39;s physical and mental health would deteriorate.
&quot;I haven&#39;t spoken to him since he was at our embassy, but the ambassador informed me that he had minor lung problems, but nothing serious,&quot; said the Ecuadorian head of state.
&quot;But there is a risk that his physical and mental condition will deteriorate because he is locked in a small space without the possibility of moving in the fresh air.
That would affect everyone&#39;s health, &quot;he added.
President Correa noted that the resolution of the asylum granted to Assange since June at the Ecuadorian embassy in London with permission to travel to Ecuador was in the hands of the United Kingdom, Sweden and European courts, and stressed that talks had taken place with London to resolve imprisonment. founder of WikiLeaks.
&quot;We are not negotiating about human rights, we are not using such a word in this case, but there have been constant talks.
The solution to this problem is in the hands of the United Kingdom, Sweden and the European courts, because Assange&#39;s lawyer Baltazar Garzón is conducting a series of proceedings at various European courts, &quot;he said.
He said that &quot;if the United Kingdom issues a pass tomorrow, everything will end&quot;.
And if Sweden hears Mr Assange at the Ecuadorian embassy in London or via Skype, as local legislation allows without any problems and as has already been done in other cases, the problem will be over tomorrow. &quot;
Correa took advantage of this situation to present himself as a defender of freedom of the press, and made it clear that he certainly did not tolerate &quot;below-average, bad intentions and lies that undermine freedom of expression.&quot;
The biggest enemies of the free press are not us, vile and perverted politicians, but bad journalists in the service of profit, coercion and blackmail, &quot;he said.
In this regard, he rejoiced that neither such journalists, &quot;neither bankers, nor hegemonic countries nor the bourgeoisie, dominate Ecuador,&quot; and reiterated that, if re-elected, &quot;he will continue to change in the right direction and in the right direction.&quot;
President Correa also supported the decision to further maintain Paraguay&#39;s veto over Unasur membership, at least until its next election, arguing that the whole &quot;must be firm and not tolerate opportunism and coup-shrouded in legality&quot; because it &quot;destroyed the legitimacy of Paraguayan democracy.&quot;
The Ecuadorian president also said he considered it &quot;quite appropriate&quot; for his Colombian counterpart Juan Manuel Santos to wish to negotiate with Nicaragua on maritime borders between the two countries now, after the ruling by the International Court of Justice in The Hague, which ruled in favor of Nicaragua.
The judgment is currently not accepted.
&quot;This is a problem between South America and Central America.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the will to walk together.
They need to be seen broadly to be overcome and to be able to move forward. &quot;
He also expressed hope for a settlement of the maritime border dispute before the same courts in Peru and Chile, and expressed the view that &quot;it is right for Latin America to seek international instances if both countries commit to a verdict, no matter how harsh.&quot;
With the possibility of running in the next presidential election in Ecuador to run for a third term, he noted that he saw the possibility &quot;with great optimism and joy, although it is sometimes very difficult&quot;.
Correa said that if he lost the election in February 2013, he would leave public life.
&quot;Personally, I have never been interested in much, but such unfair situations as socio - economic poverty in Ecuador can only be remedied by political power.
My political movement believed that it was I who guaranteed this probable victory, so we must accept this responsibility, &quot;he said.
&quot;If I won, it would be my last presidency and then I would leave politics.
When we lose, the same thing awaits me.
I&#39;ve already made up my mind, &quot;he said.
Correa also mentioned the new medical treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez in Cuba.
&quot;I have just spoken to Venezuelan Vice President Nicolas Madure, who says that President Chavez has gone on a planned routine treatment and that his return to Cuba was expected after the end of the campaign.
This is not a recurrence in the president&#39;s state of health, &quot;he explained.
The Head of the Ecuadorian State today attended the Sixth Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), culminating in calls for greater regional integration in order to maintain development, equality and security.
AIDS victims today are the result of late diagnosis
Fabrizio was 21 years old when his test was confirmed: HIV positive.
&quot;It was as if lightning had struck me,&quot; he says, recalling a moment of truth that the doctor had tried to &quot;alleviate&quot; a little, but apparently without success.
The boy hid it from his family.
He decided to take his illness on his own shoulders and began to inquire about it. And with such dedication that he has already celebrated his 43rd birthday.
He is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients of the HIV Unit at the Civil Hospital in Guadalajara (HCG), which he came to in 1994 after several battles with the disease.
Fabrizio has been living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) since the age of 22, something unimaginable in the early 1990s, when there were many doubts, few treatment options and a greater stigma.
At that time, even the director of the clinic of the Mexican Institute of Social Security (IMSS) did not say goodbye, &quot;because he had a cut.&quot;
Back then, having AIDS was synonymous with death.
It is now possible to survive with this syndrome and live fully.
However, there are many people who do not know about their disease and come only when the virus has destroyed the body and strengthened the immune system, and then become victims of accidental infections.
&quot;31 years since the onset of AIDS, or at least since the first documented cases,&quot; means great success that the life expectancy of a patient who starts treatment in a timely and appropriate way is exactly the same as that of healthy people, &quot;Jaime said. Andrade Villanueva, head of the HIV Unit at the Civil Hospital in Guadalajara, saying this information was confirmed in a prestigious scientific publication in April this year.
Andrade Villanueva, an infectologist and HIV / AIDS specialist, explained that the researchers concluded that AIDS has not been a death sentence since 2008, but that survival and full life depend on the degree of impairment of the immune system of patients diagnosed with the disease. those who do not use drugs: people with 200 CD4 cells can live up to 30 years and people with 500 CD4 cells up to 50 years.
Simply put, this means that someone who is diagnosed with HIV at the age of 25 can, according to these findings, &quot;live without problems for up to 75 years if the treatment is followed,&quot; the doctor explained in an interview.
To emphasize this progress, it is worth recalling that the average life expectancy of Mexicans today is 76 years.
Although mortality has fallen significantly in recent years and, in the case of Mexico, the number of people who died of AIDS fell from 6,678 in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (yearbook of the United Nations Joint Program on HIV / AIDS - UNAIDS), it is also true that that 60 percent of patients have died since the discovery of AIDS, according to national statistics.
In Jalisco alone, 255 people died in 2011 and 187 by May this year. However, universal access to antiretrovirals has been ensured since 2005.
- Why do people continue to die as a result of the disease?
- &quot;It seems to me that the problem is not in the possibilities of access to treatment.
This is how I see it, this is how it happens at our hospital.
At least for the last 12 years, we have not depleted our drug reserves. The problem is that patients come at a very advanced stage because they do not know the disease state, that is, in the late stage of the disease. &quot;
He adds a compelling figure: &quot;Nine out of ten patients come when an associated infection has already developed. The only thing we need to do to influence overall mortality is to diagnose the disease earlier, so we need to offer large-scale tests to detect the disease. to all persons who request them &quot;.
In his proposal, he agrees with specialists and officials from the State Council for AIDS Prevention in the state of Jalisco, as well as directly with patients like Fabrizio, who came to have tests performed in a private laboratory only because his friend did it, despite his young age. AIDS has already erupted and he also suffered from Kaposi&#39;s sarcoma, a cancer that is one of the common complications.
&quot;Everything changes when you know you have AIDS.
Some think they are going to die and don&#39;t want to know anything else.
&quot;If I&#39;m going to die, I&#39;d rather get fired three times a week,&quot; they say, but that&#39;s not my case.
The change was for the better, I eat healthily, I exercise, I take medication. &quot;
To this day, his parents only know that he suffered from cancer.
&quot;I live a normal life like everyone else.
I work, I have a lot of activities, I travel, I lead an active sex life, but responsibly, I take care of myself and the other person, &quot;says Fabrizio, who accepted the invitation to share his experience with the daily MILENIO JALISCO, today as part of World Day AIDS has motivated those who are afraid with his testimony.
&quot;Have them tested. If they risked, let them know as soon as possible if they are HIV positive. And if they have already been diagnosed, let them realize that they can live like anyone else when they are responsible.&quot;
This message summarizes the motto of the battle against AIDS in this year 2012.
Condoms behind the counter
There is a big gap between health programs and ordinary people, said Ricardo Salazar, a Guadalajara journalist who reports on HIV.
And the biggest gaps are in prevention.
In places dedicated to this task, &quot;the distribution of condoms has really increased, they used to give us one or two, today they give us packages and a hundred condoms, which is very good, but there are still people who do not have access to condoms,&quot; he said.
Adolescents are among the most susceptible to new infections.
&quot;What do you want it for?&quot; is a common question full of irony and judgment from social workers, school counselors, pharmacy staff and medical staff that teenagers want to avoid, says the reporter.
He suggested changing this inefficient distribution. Let the condoms not just be behind the counters, but let the hundred of them be found in dispensers in public toilets, in places where young people often go.
&quot;It is not about promoting promiscuity.
It is not even a question of &quot;paying for beer and motel&quot;, as Governor Emilio González responded to the question of whether he would agree to the distribution of condoms in his district.
There is no such sexuality. It is best to make condoms available to those who already lead a sex life, &quot;he said.
Key figures in the state of Jalisco
There were 13,435 cases (12,158 cases of AIDS and 1,317 cases of HIV).
This situation ranks fourth in Mexico in new and identified cases of AIDS and 13th in HIV.
92% of infections occur sexually, 6% by blood and 2% perinatally.
It is estimated that about 50,000 people can live with HIV, as there are four to five people who do not know about the disease in one registered case.
The ruling, approved by the United States Court of Appeals, which does not recognize Grupo Vitro&#39;s debt restructuring imposed by bankruptcy in Mexico, sets an unfortunate precedent for any national company with branches in a neighboring country and a solvency problem.
Thus, the procedures for restructuring companies allowed by Mexican law do not seem to apply in the land of stripes and stars, despite international agreements.
The approval of Judgment Harlin Hall at the North Texas Bankruptcy Court on June 15 last year leaves Mexican companies in practice unprotected against the possibility of confiscating their assets on the other side of the El Bravo River.
However, the ruling opens the door to a major Mexican glass manufacturer to the United States Supreme Court, appealing against three irregularities.
It should be noted at the outset that while the judge in this case claims that creditors should be governed by United States insolvency law, the New Orleans-based Fifth District Court of Appeal says the main procedure is bankruptcy proceedings in Mexico.
First, it would indicate ignorance of international procedural cooperation in cases of insolvency of multinational companies.
In essence, a United Nations model law for the unification of international trade law was created for this purpose, which is appointed by the American Law Institute as an arbitrator.
Second, the judgment states that without the voting of the branches of the internal corporate structure, in which the indebtedness of the parent company Vitro to the branches is recognized, the required majority to approve the restructuring would not have been reached.
However, Mexican law allows this possibility.
The fact is that the Vitro case was not the first in which this scheme was adopted.
There are half a dozen examples, such as Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose internal debts were guaranteed by the Federal Bankruptcy Institute.
In addition, it is true that even after deducting the branch votes, the creditors - who were suing Vitro in the United States, ie vulture funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited - would not reach a majority.
In the vote, they would reach about 45 percent to 37.
This information is not taken into account by the court of appeal.
From another point of view, the court blames Vitro for the difficult situation it has faced since 2008 - against the background of the serious economic crisis that has hit the United States.
Meanwhile, González Sady&#39;s family business appeals to the reassessment directly before the Court of Appeal, so that the assessment takes place in full, with the participation of five judges, as originally only three voted.
If he fails here, he will seek a review of the process by a higher instance, in this case the United States Supreme Court.
What is serious in the case is that the court omitted a document sent by the Mexican government as an amicus curiae department detailing Vitro&#39;s conduct under the Bankruptcy Act and pointing out that the company had made it easier by adhering to the agreements signed both countries to confront the law with Chapter 15 of the United States Insolvency Act.
In addition, it points out that the country has complied with the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, namely the rules governing international insolvency cases, which guarantee equality for both debtors and creditors.
Impact on both sides: punishment for Vitro and the state.
Overall rating
For several months, a Mexican police union&#39;s criminal complaint against the former owner of Gastón Azcárrag, Andrade, who was accused of fraud, lay unnoticed on the table, and according to the pilots&#39; union, the vessel has already overflowed.
The instance, headed by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau, has just filed a lawsuit against the National Banking Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission, which it accuses of obstructing the administration of justice.
According to it, the Authority systematically refused to report to the General Prosecutor&#39;s Office of the Republic on the transaction carried out by this entrepreneur, in which it withdrew 198 million pesos on behalf of Mexican Aviation from bank IXE from fideikomis F / 589.
The funds were most likely directed to the purchase of shares in the Administradora Profesional de Hoteles.
As is well known, Azcárraga Andrade is the majority shareholder in the Posadas hotel chain.
Siege of Dragon Martu
A group of domestic and foreign environmentalists, academics, businessmen and ordinary citizens met at the Universidad de Caribe over the weekend to approve the formation of the association in order to prevent the opening of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancun.
We are talking, as we know, about a huge sales and distribution center with products from a &quot;country with a big wall&quot; focused on Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean, which would include a residential area for employees from 150 companies at the bottom.
The Canacintra (Cámara Nacional de la Industria de Transformación) has previously been able to unite the governors of the south-eastern zone to oppose a monumental area that would partially devastate protected areas and which is the source of any resistance to industry.
End of the ACTA issue
The Senate&#39;s request, which was not taken into account by the government and asked for an explanation of the conditions and circumstances in which the Mexican Ambassador signed the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement in Japan, known as ACTA, has become obsolete, according to the Mexican Institute of Industrial Property (Instituto Mexicano de la Propiedad Industrial).
As is well known, this has happened despite the fact that the Senate itself has ruled out the possibility of considering it a threat to freedom of expression on social networks.
Homex in the long run
In an effort to repay long-term debts and not affect short-term ones, the development company Homex is giving the market investment certificates worth 500 million pesos.
This series is the first of four identical ones that offer interest payments every 28 days.
The Competival is born
The merger of leading information technology companies such as NYCE, e-Quálity and Kernet has created an association with the trade name Competival, which will target the software services market in Central and South America.
Business investment will exceed $ 1.5 billion.
Hector &quot;Hetin&quot; Reyes: &quot;Basketball was my life&quot;
Basketball globetrotter Héctor &quot;Hetin&quot; Reyes has been associated with this indoor sport for more than 60 years and has traveled the world through it.
Few people in Puerto Rico have as many memories of the history of local basketball as Héctor &quot;Hetin&quot; Reyes.
Reyes was on the wheelchair for more than 60 years before being stuck in a wheelchair in 2008, both as a junior player, a BSN national basketball league player, and the owner and coach of the Vaqueros de Bayamón national basketball league. , or the president of the Puerto Rican Basketball Federation.
&quot;I have played many roles in basketball during my life, including several at the same time, such as when I was BSN National League President, National Team General Manager and Federation President in the 1990s,&quot; Reyes recalled visiting Primera Hora reporters at home in Bayamón, where he has lived for more than 50 years with Isabel, his faithful wife.
&quot;Basketball was my life.&quot;
Reyes does not exaggerate in his claim.
The walls of his house, which are almost all decorated with photos and souvenirs from his long career, prove this.
Bayamón in the heart
With the greatest turmoil of all, he guards those who are reminiscent of his work in los Vaqueros since the mid-1950s, where he was a player until 1982, when he also celebrated 15 years as a co-owner or owner of a team.
&quot;These were my best years, which I enjoyed the most, because I had the opportunity to participate in eight championships with the los Vaqueros team since 1967, either as an owner, co-owner or coach.
It was a number of successful years, including five championships held from 1971 to 1975.
And then I said goodbye to one championship - in 1981, when Jerome Mincy made his debut at BSN.
At that time, the team was taken over by &quot;Cuco&quot; Ortiz, who was an excellent leader, &quot;said Reyes.
&quot;I remember Gene Bartow, who used to be a coach here and was at the University of Alabama at Birmingham at the time, telling me, &#39;I have a two - meter - tall player for you.
Do you want him?&quot;
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players Puerto Rico has ever had.
Bartow then recommended me quarterback Raymond Gauss, who became a member of the team and one of our top shooters.
I remember him saying that if Mincy brought Bayamona to victory in the championship, Gauss would then contribute to the next. &quot;
He enjoyed the championship, when Gausse played for los Vaqueros, but only from a distance, because in 1988 he was already the president of the basketball federation.
At that time, he wanted to devote himself fully to his functions and enjoy Mincy&#39;s placement on the national team.
&quot;I remember the first time we defeated the United States in a qualifying Olympic match in Mexico in 1989.
Then came the 1990 World Cup, where we finished fourth, but we should have been bronze had it not been for the Canadian referee who had us repeat the final throw-in, &quot;said Reyes.
Is the 1990 World Cup team the best national team you&#39;ve ever seen?
He is among the best, just like the one who defeated the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympics.
But my favorite was the national team at the Pan American Games in Cuba in 1991, when we won gold and beat the United States team, which was quite similar to the one that blew bronze out of us at the World Cup.
The team not only had Mincy, Gauss, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and &quot;Piculín&quot; (Ortiz), but there were also young men (Javier) &quot;Toñito&quot; Colón and James Carter, the León brothers (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario &quot;Quijote&quot; Morales. who could not be on the team in 1990 due to a knee injury.
The team that may not have had a perfect composition, but managed to win us a gold medal and bring us great joy, was the team from the 1995 Olympic qualification in Neuquén, Argentina.
With rosters such as &quot;Canito&quot; Nieves, Pablo Alicea and junior player Rolando Hourruitiner, who replaced players eliminated for the Pan-American Games in Mar de Plata, we won gold despite all predictions.
What was Puerto Rico&#39;s best player?
This was without a doubt Piculín Ortiz.
His numbers from international tournaments are impressive.
No one from Puerto Rico has achieved such results at this level as Piculín.
Not to mention his work in the various leagues where he played.
Who was the best Puerto Rican coach?
This is very difficult.
We had a very good generation, which includes Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau and Armandito Torres.
Of the young people, I really like the work of Leo Arilla.
Which success do you consider the greatest in the federation?
That I was part of the most famous era of the national team from 1988 to 1995 and that in the early 1990s the BSN National League had up to 17 teams in one season.
What did you not manage to prove?
There were things I wanted to introduce, such as the division of youth categories by region.
For example, the boys from Ponce would only play in their area and compete with teams from other parts of the island only in national playoffs.
Now children travel a lot and play too many matches, which is not necessary.
I also see a benefit in mandatory certifications and courses for coaches, assistant judges and referees.
It pleases me.
What are you doing now?
I listen to music the most, watch YouTube videos with music from my time, enjoy my grandchildren and sometimes go to basketball games.
And of course I enjoy the company of my wife Isabel, who has always been by my side.
Actor Larry Hagman has died
Born on September 21, 1931 in Forth Worth, Texas, Larry Hagman became world-famous for starring John Ross Ewing, better known as &quot;JR&quot; in the Dallas television series, in which he played a man who acted ruthlessly and was insidious and manipulative.
Larry Hagman, whose role as predatory oil magnate JR Ewing in the television series Dallas became a symbol of greed in the 1980s, has died.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned as JR in the new Dallas series this year, died on Friday afternoon from a family announcement given to the Associated Press by Dallas-based production company Warner Bros. on cancer-related complications.
&quot;Larry has returned to his beloved hometown of Dallas, where he has once again played the iconic role he preferred,&quot; his family said.
Larry&#39;s family and his closest friends were with him in Dallas for Thanksgiving.
&quot;Linda Gray, who represented his wife in the original and new series, was with Hagman when he died at Dallas Hospital,&quot; said her agent Jeffrey Lane.
He brought joy to all he knew.
&quot;He was creative, generous, funny, kind, kind and talented, and I will miss him terribly.
He was unique and lived his life to the fullest, &quot;said Linda Gray in the announcement.
Hagman was diagnosed with liver cirrhosis in 1992, and he himself admitted that he drank a lot for years.
In 1995, a cancer was found in his liver and Hagman underwent a transplant.
Years before the Dallas series, Hagman became famous on television as a decent guy in the lightweight comedy I Dream of Jeannie, which aired on NBC from 1965 to 1970.
Here he played the character of Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life changes when he meets an attractive girl (genie) played by Barbara Eden and takes her home to live together.
He was also the protagonist in two short-lived comedies, The Good Life (NBC, 1971-72) and Here We Go Again (ABC, 1973).
His acting in films included roles that were well received by critics: The Group, Harry and Tonto and Primary Colors.
But it was only Hangman&#39;s masterpiece in the form of the incredibly repulsive JR that brought him to the top of the star.
The CBS drama series about the Ewing clan and other celebrities around them aired from April 1978 to May 1991.
The promotional slogan &quot;Who shot Jejar?&quot;, Which was supposed to raise expectations about a work full of emotions, when Hangman&#39;s character is almost murdered, has caused not only a huge amount of speculation around viewers around the world, but also risking millions of dollars in billing offices.
This also helped this work achieve a record in viewership.
The November 1980 episode, in which the answer was revealed, was watched by an average of 41 million television viewers. Dallas thus became the second most watched entertainment program in history after the broadcast of the MASH series in 1983, which was watched by 50 million viewers.
His sister-in-law Kristin (played by Mary Crosby) fired at JR.
Kristin and JR became pregnant and he threatened to label her a prostitute if she did not leave town. But there were others who had reason to attack him.
Hagman played Ewing, a voracious greedy man with a charismatic smile: a cunning businessman and an unfaithful husband who tried to get his alcoholic wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray) locked up in a hospital.
&quot;I know what I want JR to have on the tombstone,&quot; Hagman said in 1988.
It should be there, &quot;Here lies the honorary citizen of JR Ewing.&quot;
This is the only thing that didn&#39;t work out for him.
Victoria Principal, who starred in the original series, remembered Hagman on Friday as someone who was &quot;great on and off the screen.&quot;
He is unforgettable and irreplaceable for millions of admirers in the world and in the hearts of all of us who have been fortunate enough to know and love him.
Ten episodes of the new Dallas series were broadcast by TNT a few months ago with great success.
&quot;The shooting of five episodes of the second series has already been completed and the sixth has just been filmed,&quot; the television station reported.
Immediately after Hangman&#39;s death, there was no statement from Warner or TNT about how the series would continue.
A native of Fort Worth, Texas, he was the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who shone in classical works such as the musicals South Pacific and Peter Pan.
Mary Martin was a very young girl when she gave birth in 1931 to Larry, whose father was her husband, lawyer Ben Hagman.
In the early 1950s, Larry tried his luck on theater stages in New York and then served in the Air Force in England from 1952 to 1956.
There he met a young Swedish designer, Maj Axelsson, whom he married.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and lived in Malibu, California for a long time, where many celebrities live.
In 2001, he published the autobiographical book Hello Darlin &#39;: Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life.
&quot;I didn&#39;t put anything in there that I knew could harm or harm anyone,&quot; he told Prensa Asociada at the time.
After a liver transplant, he began promoting organ donation and volunteered at the hospital, helping timid patients.
&quot;I advise them, I give them courage, I meet them when they go to surgery and then,&quot; he said in 1996.
I try to give them comfort in the sense of &quot;don&#39;t worry, it will be a little uncomfortable for a while, but you will be healthy&quot;.
He was also an anti-smoking activist and took part in various campaigns.
A course that explores the &quot;end of the world&quot; begins
Each week, students explore apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria, and global warming.
When religion professor Stuart Charmé decided to take an end-of-the-world course this semester, he knew it was an irresistible lure: The end of the &quot;long number&quot; of the Mayan calendar due on December 21 was grabbed by many as evidence that the end of the world is coming.
However, Charmé had no idea what awaited him in the next few months: Catastrophic Hurricane Sandy, the budget gap, which some call &quot;debt Armageddon,&quot; and the growing conflict in which Israel is involved, the place where Christians theorizing about the end of the world begin .
&quot;I didn&#39;t realize this was going to be the most apocalyptic semester ever,&quot; Charmé told Rutgers University students in Camden, New Jersey, this week.
It&#39;s a really good time to discuss what&#39;s going on in the world today, as if we had 30 days left.
And remember, bad means good to the apocalyptic-minded.
And it&#39;s not the only professor who offers courses on the &quot;end of the world&quot; this semester, which is theoretically the last in history.
At Temple University, Assistant Professor Barry Vacker runs the &quot;Resources, Culture, and the End of the World&quot; course.
Each week, students explore apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria, and global warming.
&quot;We&#39;re discussing why these ideas spread over time,&quot; he says, and how they offer hypothetical scenarios that control certain human behaviors.
For example, if nuclear material falls into the hands of terrorists, war can break out.
This month, students are analyzing films with apocalyptic themes and exploring how they differ from real-life examples.
&quot;I tried to inform students about what is possible, probable, believable and impossible,&quot; says Vacker.
On the main campus of the State University of Pennsylvania, Matthew Restall, a professor of Latin American history, and his colleague Amara Solari, an assistant professor of art history and anthropology, came together to organize a course called the End of the World.
&quot;We are not joining &#39;2012&#39; because we always count on the possibility of re-organizing the course if the world does not end,&quot; Restall said.
Despite the &quot;imminent destruction&quot;, students must study, create projects and take final exams.
At Penn State, the final exam will take place on the eve of the Apocalypse, which gives students no choice but to work &quot;until the evening of the expected end of the world,&quot; Restall said.
Courses have become quite popular.
&quot;It stretched to two hours,&quot; Restall said of his course for high-average students, who signed up for 35.
Weeks and weeks before the start of the semester, we received e-mails asking if there was still room.
The students themselves assure that the course is one of the most interesting.
&quot;I find it fascinating to see what people are doing to comfort themselves,&quot; said Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old student of religion and sociology in Haddonfield, New Jersey, at Rutgers University in Camden.
And so apocalyptic, secular, or religious thinking is just a matter of comfort or absence.
Will Wekesa, a 25-year-old psychology and nursing student, said he saw all the apocalyptic films.
&quot;I&#39;ve never heard of a lesson in which it could be taught before,&quot; he said.
&quot;I&#39;m enjoying it.&quot;
But no interviewed student, let alone a professor, said he believed in the end date of December 21st.
&quot;Our first project was about the Mayan prediction, and in a way we&#39;re going to disprove it,&quot; said Julie Zeglen, a 21-year-old final-year student at Temple University in West Chester.
&quot;The Mayans never predicted the end of the world; it&#39;s just a key point on the calendar,&quot; Restall said.
But he added that there is an apocalyptic anxiety in Western culture that dates back several centuries, in which people respond to changes in their surroundings with predictions of the end of the world.
These speculations flourished due to the Internet.
&quot;People don&#39;t think about it elsewhere,&quot; he said.
This is mostly done in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at La Salle University who lectures in the Philippines this year, quickly answered the question of whether he knew about a &quot;end of the world&quot; course.
&quot;The Philippines is not participating in the end of the world,&quot; he wrote, signaling an exception to the highest office.
We have grace from the Pope.
Restall noted that many days of the Last Judgment had been spoken of over the years, saying that if nothing happened on December 21, &quot;people would start thinking immediately about the next date&quot; or philosophize that December 21 was the beginning of a seven-year period that ended the world will perish.
The date is taken lightly by students and professors.
Several said they intended to go to the &quot;end of the world&quot; festival.
&quot;I&#39;ll probably call some friends to laugh together,&quot; explained Samira Ford, a 20-year-old communications student.
