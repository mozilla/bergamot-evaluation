The Prague Stock Exchange fell into the red at the end of trading
After a sharp fall in the morning, the Prague Stock Exchange corrected losses.
Transactions with CEZ shares reached almost half of the current daily trade.
The Prague Stock Exchange continued its Monday slump from the beginning of Tuesday&#39;s trading, when it fell by almost six percent.
This time, the decline is due to a fall in shares on Wall Street.
In our country, too, the market&#39;s reaction to the result of the vote in the US House of Representatives, which refused to support the plan to stabilize the local financial sector, is reflected.
The fall of stocks in Asia
Shares on Asian stock markets fell dramatically on Tuesday, although indices eventually erased some of the losses during the day.
The Hong Kong Hang Seng Index lost almost four percent during trading, but later erased some of the losses and reduced the decline to about 2.5 percent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index, which tracks the movement of Chinese stocks on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, fell 3.8 percent, and markets closed in Shanghai.
Shares on the Sydney stock market lost more than five percent, but eventually reduced the losses to 4.3 percent.
The stock market in Taiwan, according to the local index, fell by 3.6 percent.
&quot;The timing of the US bailout is uncertain and will affect financial markets around the world,&quot; said Joseph Yam, head of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority.
Hong Kong, although part of China, determines its monetary policy independently, ie without dependence on China&#39;s central bank.
Hong Kong has the same interest rates as the United States.
According to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, US lawmakers should return to negotiations as a matter of urgency and approve the proposal to support the financial system.
Otherwise, there is a risk that other countries will feel the effects.
Bloody bath of American stocks
The US House of Representatives on Monday rejected a plan to support the financial system, which was to be spent up to $ 700 billion (almost CZK 12 trillion).
Lawmakers thus ignored President George W. Bush&#39;s call to support the plan.
According to Bush, the plan would address the root causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the entire economy.
US stocks experienced a bloodbath on Monday, with major stock indices falling the most in more than 20 years.
The Dow Jones index fell nearly seven percent and last dropped to a similar extent in 1987.
The index had been falling before the vote, but as soon as it became clear that the proposal had not passed the House, the index was in free fall.
Congress backs down: US government can pump $ 700 billion into banks
The top leaders of the US Congress and the government of President George W. Bush have agreed on a broader form of agreement on financial assistance to the US financial system.
It will be voted on early next week.
US lawmakers have made a breakthrough in talks on approving a rescue plan in the form of financial assistance to the US financial system in the amount of $ 700 billion (approximately 12 trillion crowns).
However, it has not been won yet.
Congressmen have to complete some details of the agreement before they can publish the final version of the law and vote on it.
The plan to support the financial system will be discussed in the House of Representatives on Monday.
Barney Frank, chairman of the House&#39;s Banking and Financial Services Committee, told Reuters on Sunday.
According to sources, the plan could probably be voted on in the Senate on Wednesday at the earliest.
According to economists, the announcement that the rescue plan will be approved should be the first significant psychological factor for the recovery of financial markets.
Then, however, there will be a &quot;sobering up&quot; due to the complexity of the mechanisms by which to help the markets to achieve in practice.
Paulson: The plan must be effective
&quot;We have made great progress.
We have resolved our differing views on what a market stabilization package should look like, &quot;Democrat Nancy Pelosi told Bloomberg.
According to her, the final vote could take place on Sunday.
Lawmakers met with US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson on Sunday night to give the government a definitive shape.
He should buy unsaleable mortgage assets from financial companies, which drag financial companies into heavy losses and threaten the stability of the entire system.
&quot;We are on the verge of a final agreement on a plan that will work and must also be effective in the marketplace.
The recovery plan has yet to continue, but I think we are there, &quot;Paulson said.
Signal for Asian trading
The global financial crisis is having a significant impact on stock markets, which are falling sharply.
According to Nevada Democratic Senator Harry Reid, lawmakers are trying to reach a final agreement in Congress on Sunday.
They want to reassure investors from trading in Asian financial markets, which are the first in the time zone where a congressional decision could affect Monday&#39;s trading.
However, it is not yet clear with certainty when both chambers of the US Congress will vote on the law, or whether negotiations cannot get stuck on a problem at the last minute.
Lawmakers hope it will be approved in the next few days.
However, the law will still undergo a number of changes.
The total amount earmarked for system assistance is to be divided into two parts.
The initial $ 350 billion is to be made available as soon as possible, as requested by President George W. Bush.
But Congress can block the release of the remaining amount if it feels that the program is not fulfilling its function, in the order of another $ 100 billion and later the final $ 350 billion.
Bush praised the progress of the negotiations
The president may veto the decision, but Congress may override his veto.
Despite these changes, however, the basic idea of the program, which was to raise funds to buy bad mortgage securities that have failed in value because hundreds of thousands of Americans are unable to repay their mortgages, has survived.
&quot;It simply came to our notice then.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on the bill on Sunday and the Senate on Monday, &quot;said Republican Sen. Judd Gregg.
US President Bush is also pleased with the progress in the negotiations.
His spokesman Tony Fratto said Bush was pleased with Saturday&#39;s progress and praised &quot;the two-way effort to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy.&quot;
Limitation of golden parachutes
Senate Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd, chief negotiator, said lawmakers agreed on responsibility for the monetary program, protecting taxpayers from losses, closing relief, timing funding plan.
The new law is also intended to reduce the so-called golden parachutes for directors of companies participating in the program and establishes a committee to oversee the fund.
It should be managed by the Ministry of Finance.
&quot;We have worked very hard on this and we have made great progress towards an agreement that will work and benefit the market and all Americans,&quot; Paulson said.
The plan also includes help for homeowners who have problems repaying.
The government should negotiate new installments for the mortgages it buys, in order to reduce the monthly cost of installments for borrowers and allow them to keep their homes.
Marek: Psychological help
According to the chief economist of Patria Finance, David Marek, the proposed plan is a good idea, but its implementation will be very difficult.
&quot;This is because it is not known by what mechanism and at what price problem assets will be bought.
This will be decisive for how the financial sector and the government share the losses, &quot;Marek told the iHNed.cz server this week.
Whether the plan will be approved now or early next week is not so significant, according to Mark.
&quot;It is much more important for congressmen to agree this week to support this plan and to sanctify it as soon as possible.
The psychological significance of the agreement that approval will take place is the most important at the moment, &quot;Marek emphasized.
The triumph of right-wing populists in Austria, together they have 29 percent
According to the first preliminary results, Sunday&#39;s early parliamentary elections in Austria brought a significant weakening of both parties to the current grand coalition and a significant strengthening of right-wing populist parties.
The Austrian People&#39;s Party (ÖVP) has suffered particularly heavy losses, shaking the position of current chairman Wilhelm Molterer.
On the contrary, the election leader of the Association for the Future of Austria (BZÖ), the Carinthian governor Jörg Haider is preparing a triumphant return to national politics.
According to preliminary results, it remains the strongest party in the Social Democratic Republic (SPÖ) with 29.8 percent of the vote, but is losing 5.5 percent of the vote against the last elections in 2006.
The ÖVP fared even worse, losing almost nine percent of the vote with 25.6 percent.
These are the worst results of both of these great parties in Austrian post-war history, and especially among the people who caused the early elections, they were literally a catastrophic result.
Even at the beginning of July, when the ÖVP left the coalition, the People&#39;s Party had a considerable advantage over the SPÖ in preferences.
However, voters have apparently punished them for letting the government go bankrupt.
Already in the first reactions to the results, there were speculations about the possible resignation of the party chairman and current vice-chancellor Wilhelm Molterer.
Observers believe that this could happen on Monday at an extraordinary meeting of the party&#39;s presidency.
Such a development would probably facilitate the way to the still most probable way out of the election result, ie to renew the grand coalition of SPÖ and ÖVP.
However, due to the strengthening of both right-wing populist parties - the Free (FPÖ) won 18 percent and the BZÖ eleven percent of the vote - the Social Democrats also expressed concern about the repeat of 1999, when the People&#39;s Party agreed with the populists (the FPÖ was still united; from the BZÖ) to a joint government, which even provoked sanctions from the European Union.
Haider, who has already stated that he is ready to cooperate with any party and expects to return to Vienna for national politics, is clearly betting on this development.
The Green Party also got into parliament, but it lost slightly and fell from third to fifth place among Austrian political parties.
None of the other parties apparently crossed the 4% mark and did not get into parliament.
Knife-edge duel: MP3 players against mobile phones.
We will advise you how to choose
While almost every mobile phone can play MP3 files, no MP3 player can make phone calls.
From this it seems clear that it is better to buy only a phone.
Still, there are plenty of reasons to buy a standalone player.
The choice depends entirely on the method of use and the requirements of the future owner.
It&#39;s probably hard to get a top-of-the-line expensive turntable at home to listen to Maxim Turbulenc&#39;s latest album.
On the one hand, such music products are not published on LPs, and from a qualitative point of view, there is no objective reason for this.
However, if vinyls with art rock, jazz or blues are crammed into your shelves, you will probably dream of such a turntable at least.
It is the same with music on the go, ie compressed music, simply put - MP3 music.
Here, too, there are price and quality categories.
It may be unacceptable for some people to spend eight thousand crowns on a player, just as a Pink Floyd fan will probably have a hard time trying headphones for twenty crowns from the market.
Two extremes, between which there is enough space for everyone.
The choice is wide.
Battery life also matters
Some high-end music players can handle much more than just playing music, but what most cell phones don&#39;t even happen to.
No current device is as versatile as a telephone.
In addition to its primary functions, telephoning and texting, it can play music and video, record both, it has a better, worse camera and maybe even navigate.
And when you consider smartphones and communicators, you will have a small computer in your pocket.
It&#39;s a small miracle, because no refrigerator can grill and no television photographs anything.
The versatility of the mobile phone also brings disadvantages.
The more functions you use on your mobile phone, the sooner the indicator on the display will send you to the charger.
And playing music is one of the biggest eaters of energy.
Few mobile phones can play music for more than ten to twelve hours, usually much less.
In this respect, music players (especially the simplest ones) are significantly more powerful.
Therefore, with cheap mobile phones, expect that they will not play for you for more than a few hours.
If you still call here and there, get another charger to work for safety - this also applies to more expensive devices.
You won&#39;t have this problem with MP3 players, even the worse ones will last at least 9 hours of continuous operation on a single charge.
Another problem occurs when uploading music to a mobile phone.
Unfortunately, only a limited number of devices have a universal USB connector, and in addition, not all of them can be connected directly to a computer without special software.
Of course, music can be recorded directly to the memory card, but only a few card readers can handle the miniature memory cards used in mobile phones without reduction.
With some exceptions (iPods), you don&#39;t need any special software.
Just fill the device with music via USB from your computer.
Most mobile phones and players will already create a music library sorted by artist name, album name, genre or user rating.
Some devices only display a directory tree structure similar to Windows Explorer and some can do both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smartphones with an operating system).
Players are easier to use, mobile phones know more
When choosing a specific device, pay particular attention to battery life, memory capacity, quality and type of audio output, and of course the comfort of operation.
If the music is primarily a backdrop for you and if you listen to it only briefly every day, for example on the tram, any mobile phone that plays MP3s will suffice.
Which almost any mobile phone can really do.
You don&#39;t even have to watch what music formats your mobile phone or player can do.
MP3s can handle everyone, and the vast majority of music that comes to you will be in this format.
It is one of the most widespread and in addition to it, the vast majority of devices can also handle music in WMA format.
AAC (the format used by Apple and its iPods) is less common.
Better mobile phones also allow you to buy music online, for example.
All you have to do is visit the relevant pages of the operator (or another provider) via the mobile internet and buy a song or album.
This service in itself could be a strong argument for purchasing a music mobile.
Unfortunately, the offer of operators is lousy and is mostly limited to fast-fermented radio hits.
Prices are also not the lowest.
However, it is generally assumed that this way of selling music (whether via GSM, internet or wireless internet) will dominate the music industry in the future.
Most people always carry a mobile phone with them.
Whenever you feel like listening to something, you can feel the mobile phone in your pocket, while the MP3 player is forgotten at home.
However, it still depends on whether you also always carry headphones or at least a wired handsfree.
If not, you can use the integrated speaker, which has almost every mobile phone, but only a minimum of MP3 players.
Probably the biggest advantage of music mobile phones will be the price for many.
The cheapest ones usually cost under three thousand.
For three and four thousand crowns you can buy a very decent walkman.
In most cases, however, you will be limited by the absence of output to regular headphones.
The best and technically most equipped phones with a 3.5 mm jack for ordinary headphones cost up to fifteen thousand.
The advantage of the players is, among other things, easy operation.
The simplest ones - not necessarily the cheapest ones (see our selection) - can be controlled by anyone.
The minimum of functions, the similarity of control with a previously common cassette player or, for example, a turntable, is obvious.
There is no risk of a collision in the form of an accidentally switched on mobile internet and subsequently a giant bill for data transfer.
What device to reach for
Even the cheapest mobile phones (eg Vodafone 527) usually have a slot for removable memory cards (type M2, microSD, etc.).
Even with the purchase of the relevant card, you can fit into two thousand crowns.
But be careful.
For basic models, only cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB are supported.
Only the most expensive ones can handle 8 GB memory cards.
If you already have a mobile phone and still want to buy a cheap MP3 player, reach for Cowon, Creativ, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or Iriver.
Depending on the capacity (max. 2 GB), you do not have to spend more than 1,100 crowns.
If you are one of the more demanding listeners, you should rather reach for specialized mobile phones - walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have separate control buttons for MP3 and the comfort of operation is close to a separate MP3 player.
The furthest is Sony Ericsson, whose Walkman phones have the same user interface as the separately sold MP3 players.
The same service and in the same price category up to four thousand crowns, but with a larger memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and battery life (normally 15 hours, maximum up to 35 hours), MP3 players will take you from the above-mentioned brands.
The first virtual operator will arrive in the Czech Republic this year.
Maybe
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is relatively developed and our operators offer virtually all services as their partners in Western Europe.
Nevertheless, we are missing something here - a virtual operator that would force the classic ones to become cheaper.
Maybe it won&#39;t be long.
We have written many times on Mobil.cz that Czech operators are among the most expensive in Europe.
After all, this was also confirmed by the CTU, which pointed out that the price of SMS is higher in our country than in the rest of the Union.
After the last steps of the European Commission in the field of regulation of roaming fees, a paradoxical situation may arise - for some customers of Czech mobile operators, SMS from abroad will be cheaper than at home.
How is it possible that prices in the Czech Republic remain so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, there is no competition that would really want to fight.
Maybe it sounds paradoxical, we have three mobile networks and a penetration well over 100%.
Mobile operators, on the other hand, like to complain that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
The chairman of the Council of the Czech Telecommunication Office (ČTÚ), Pavel Dvořák, often reminds them of this, saying in the past several times that there is no place for another operator in the Czech Republic.
It is probably true that a classic operator with its own network probably doesn&#39;t have much of a chance (after all, it would probably be hard to find frequencies).
But there is another option - a virtual operator.
It was the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market that brought a significant reduction in prices, to which even traditional operators had to respond.
Even before the entry of pike as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile on the market, similar voices were heard in Great Britain as in our country.
But it turned out that there is a place for such operators and they can be really successful.
After all, we don&#39;t have to go too far for examples.
In February of this year, we informed you about the launch of the virtual operator Mobilking in Poland.
In just half a year, this operator has managed to gain more than 100,000 customers and become the fifth largest operator there.
Mobilking is backed by the Penta financial group, which in the Czech Republic owns, among other things, U: fona.
The advantage of virtual operators is the ability to focus on a much more specific target group.
In order to be able to function effectively, they need far fewer customers than a traditional operator.
They do not involve relatively high costs for the construction, operation and maintenance of the mobile network.
In the world, virtual operators usually profile themselves as low-cost - they offer cheap calls and SMS, which is often offset by a narrower range of services.
For example, Tesco Mobile in the UK offers SMS at least half as cheaply as its competitors.
But as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, a bet on a new target group can also be a pretty good move.
This operator focuses specifically on men.
&quot;The right guys choose Mobilking - an operator they like and can trust,&quot; says David Seibertz, CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, which runs the virtual operator.
It is difficult to say whether a similar concept as in Poland could catch on in our country.
Vodafone spokesman Miroslav Čepický doubts this: &quot;The Czech market is relatively small for the segment approach on which most virtual operators are based.
In addition, it is relatively saturated in terms of service offerings. &quot;
In the Czech Republic without a chance, say mobile operators
However, it seems almost certain that if there is a virtual mobile operator in the Czech Republic, it will not be Mobilking.
&quot;We are talking about the expansion of this successful project, but in the Czech Republic the negotiations do not look very promising.
Rather, Mobilking will be launched in other countries in our region, &quot;Jana Studničková, a spokeswoman for the Penta financial group, told Mobil.cz in a telephone interview.
Indirectly, it confirmed that the existing mobile operators in the Czech Republic are definitely not in favor of this idea.
On the contrary, it tries to do everything so that no potential competitor arises.
The GTS Novera group has not been interested in launching a virtual mobile operator for a long time, and would like to take another step towards becoming a real competitor of Telefónica O2 in the field of corporate customers.
&quot;We are very interested in being able to offer our customers not only fixed but also mobile telecommunications services.
And the sooner the better.
We have repeatedly discussed this possibility with all Czech mobile operators.
We have already managed to make progress with some of them in the negotiations, &quot;says Pavel Kaidl, the group&#39;s spokesman.
So maybe it&#39;s flashing for better times.
From unofficial information, it seems that we should see the first virtual operator by the end of the year.
For now, however, its creation is accompanied by an impenetrable wall of silence.
&quot;At the moment, we do not believe that there is room on the Czech market for the emergence of a full - fledged virtual operator.
The Czech market is very specific compared to other markets.
So far, no entity with a complex and serious project in this area has approached us, &quot;said Vlastimil Sršeň from the press department of Telefónica O2 in his statement to Mobil.cz.
Other operators also refer to the specificity of the Czech market.
T-Mobile spokeswoman Martina Kemrová adds in rare agreement with O2&#39;s statement: &quot;So far, we have not seen any viable and mutually beneficial business project on which it would be possible to build further.&quot;
He adds: &quot;It is difficult for a virtual operator to appear in T-Mobile&#39;s network by the end of the year.
At this point, we would have to have a concrete agreement on the table so that we can think in this short term. &quot;
Vodafone focuses more on meeting the requirements of its own 3G license.
Miroslav Čepický says: &quot;We are open to negotiations with potential virtual operators, especially in the area of cost sharing and infrastructure.
We consider this to be the most beneficial from the customer&#39;s point of view.
Vodafone&#39;s main strategy in this area is to find a partner to build a shared network for fast mobile internet. &quot;
Responsible authorities - with operators one hand
The procedure of mobile operators is easy to understand, the entry of another operator would mean an increase in competition, would lead to a decrease in prices and thus to a decrease in their profits.
So why make it easier for such a competitor to start?
The fact that when operators are concerned about something, they can pull together, is also evidenced by the scramble around the creation of U: fon.
Probably the greatest pressure towards the CTU came at the time of the establishment of U: fon from the company T-Mobile.
This is evidenced by publicly accessible information from the CTU website.
But now U: fon is suitable as an argument why not allow a virtual operator.
Martina Kemrová commented: &quot;The competitive environment of the mobile market has recently been further intensified by the entry of a fourth mobile operator into the market.
Given the nature of the mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is clear that the entry of another player would place high demands on him and especially on his services. &quot;
However, given this approach of mobile operators, the utter lack of interest of Czech regulators is directly striking.
At the same time, it is not just the position of the CTU, which unfortunately in the Czech Republic - unlike the United Kingdom and other developed countries - does not have the authority to interfere in competition.
These belong exclusively to the Office for the Protection of Competition (ÚOHS).
But he took his typical position on the whole issue.
&quot;The entry of a virtual operator into the mobile market would be possible after the conclusion of a contract between the mobile operator and the virtual operator for the lease of the necessary infrastructure.
No such contract has been concluded so far, as the offer of potential bidders was probably not interesting enough for traditional operators, &quot;said Kristián Chalupa from the Office of External Relations of the Office in response to our question.
The statement formulated in this way will probably not surprise the representatives of the operators.
From the authority, which is supposed to represent the interests of consumers and, among other things, to make sure that no one abuses their position on the market, it is more than considered serious.
Especially when Kristián Chalupa adds: &quot;Abroad, where virtual operators normally operate, we can observe that their entry into the market has contributed to lower prices for mobile phone services.&quot;
Apparently, however, the pressure on the proper functioning of the market environment and the fall in prices are not in the interests of the Office.
In truth, shocking in the whole case is the touching harmony of the three mobile operators, which results from their reactions.
The question of whether it is really just a coincidence comes up all by itself.
Like the exact same price of petrol at petrol stations, it is certainly just a matter of chance and fierce competition.
&quot;The Office did not find any signs of anticompetitive conduct in this case and therefore has no reason to intervene in any way.
None of the operators has a dominant position, so it does not have a correspondingly increased responsibility for its actions on the market.
The necessary tools for opening up the mobile market for virtual operators are probably also lacking in the telecommunications regulator, &quot;Chalupa said in his statement.
The interpretation of market dominance is one of many points of contention.
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets prepared by the CTO, according to which telecommunications are the only market from the point of view of competition.
Of course, none of the Czech operators has a dominant position in such a market.
However, some legal experts offer a different view - the consent of the network operator is always required to create a virtual operator.
And the mobile operator - quite logically - has a monopoly on its network.
So in a certain segment it must necessarily be dominant.
However, even if we do not accept this argument, it should at least be a warning to the Office that the three mobile operators are strikingly similar.
At the same time, the complaints of a number of interested parties (including the aforementioned company GTS Novera) show that they encounter very similar obstacles in dealing with all operators.
The imposition of responsibility on the CTU is then a relatively common trick in telecommunications, by which the Office gives its hands away from the whole matter.
We have met him in several similar cases.
Unfortunately, until the recently adopted amendment to the Telecommunications Act, the extension of the CTU&#39;s powers to the area of competition in telecommunications failed to be enforced, although a number of experts promised to improve the situation.
Representatives of the Office must know this more than well, but apparently their interests are elsewhere.
It works when no one is watching
At the same time, the functioning of some pseudo-virtual operators, of which there are several in Czech mobile networks, goes unnoticed.
These are companies that publish their own price lists for mobile telephone services, but they are only partially public.
These are usually multilevel marketing companies.
Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others offer their own mobile phone services.
The price lists of these companies usually reach only the chosen ones.
The magic lies in the fact that the company acts towards the operator as a classic corporate customer who orders a large number of SIM cards.
As a major customer, he will then receive special price (and other) offers.
The problem is that the business conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit such resale.
&quot;If the cases you are talking about occur, it could be a breach of the terms and conditions we are dealing with and could result in termination of cooperation with the company,&quot; Martina Kemrová answered our question on this issue.
However, it is quite unlikely that similar activity would not reach the responsible people from mobile operators.
Especially in the case of the three mentioned companies, there may be thousands of customers.
None of the operators opposes such a procedure.
They make significant profits from the activities of these companies and at the same time - unlike real virtual operators - they do not threaten them with their own official marketing.
Miroslav Čepický points out possible problems: &quot;The law allows similar speculation, however, only a negligible percentage of customers use the services of these companies.
In addition, they must accept that the SIM card in their phone is not in their name, so they cannot use it fully like regular customers of mobile operators. &quot;
But that is exactly what the CTU should be at least strange about.
In addition, another question arises for the Office.
If mobile operators turn a blind eye to a similar process, why are they blocking the creation of a virtual operator?
It should be added that the Office has relatively strong powers to detect similar activity, and if it does not want to, it does not have to be satisfied with the explanation of the operators that they have no idea about such a thing and their business conditions prohibit it.
When we will not be the most expensive
As has been mentioned several times in the text, the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market has brought about a noticeable drop in prices for services.
At the same time, in practically all countries where virtual operators were established, classical operators tried to more or less prevent their creation.
The arguments they used were practically identical - too small or too saturated market, problems with the quality of services, etc.
In developed countries, however, it is at these moments that regulators have intervened, defending not the interests of mobile operators but their customers.
Whether through formal measures or informal pressure, they achieved the creation of the first virtual operator and the addition of others.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulators are throwing the whole case around like a hot potato.
In our experience, we cannot shake the impression that ambiguity in competencies is more than appropriate in these cases.
But let&#39;s not throw a shotgun into rye.
If the behind-the-scenes information is correct and the virtual operator appears in our country really soon, the Czech mobile market may start moving again.
If one of the operators has accepted the creation of a virtual mobile operator, it will be difficult for the Office to remain indifferent to the rejection (discrimination) of other applicants.
And we may stop calling more expensive than in the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Choose the best one
Listen to four performances of the new version of the Czech national anthem.
On Sunday, on the occasion of the Czech Statehood Day, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek ceremoniously presented new recordings of the national anthem Kde domov můj.
The anthem was newly recorded by the orchestra of the National Theater under the direction of Jiří Bělohlávek.
There are four versions available - with male or female solo singing, in choral performance and instrumental version.
Kateřina Kněžínková and Adam Plachetka took over the singing.
The authors of the anthem adaptations are Otakar Jeremiáš and Jaroslav Krček.
You can listen to all four versions on the iHNed.cz server.
Bělohlávek considers the Czech national song to be one of the most beautiful hymns.
He had previously told Czech Radio that he had deliberately chosen singers with young representative voices who are strong and popular to sing solo variants.
&quot;From the beginning, I tried to make sure that they both had a clear diction, that the text was well understood, that they agreed,&quot; he said.
The Czech national anthem will celebrate its 175th anniversary next year.
The song Where is my home first heard in 1834 on the boards of the Estates Theater in the original Czech play Fidlovačka by Josef Kajetán Tyl, accompanied by music by František Škroup.
It gained popularity and people spontaneously took it for granted.
The first stanza of the song then became a natural part of the national anthem after the establishment of Czechoslovakia in 1918.
It remained one of the seven state symbols even after the establishment of the independent Czech Republic.
What does the &quot;new&quot; anthem sound like?
On Wednesday, Prague&#39;s public transport will take the chip for the first time
Wednesday, October 1, 2008 will be recorded in the history of the Prague Transport Company as the date when the first passengers will board the metro, trams and buses, who will have an electronic coupon in their pocket instead of a paper ticket.
At the moment, it can be purchased by about one hundred thousand people who own an Opencard chip card.
Passengers can buy a 30-day, a 90-day and an annual coupon (which will be valid from 1 January 2009) and at the same time upload it to their chip card at the Transport Company&#39;s information centers and workplaces at Muzeum, Můstek, Nádraží Holešovice, Anděl, Roztyly, Letňany metro stations. Kobylisy, Rajská zahrada, Kačerov and Luka.
As of yesterday, coupons can also be purchased via the Internet on the Transport Company&#39;s website www.dpp.cz.
More than four hundred customers used the service until the afternoon.
Those who start using the online store can definitely forget about the dispensing windows in metro stations, where they have so far had to stand in long queues for paper tickets.
They buy the coupon over the Internet and upload it to their Opencard card in one of the thirteen branches of the Municipal Library.
&quot;In these places, passengers have a counter with trained staff who will help those interested with online shopping and also upload the purchased coupon to their card,&quot; said project spokesman Martin Opatrný.
In addition to libraries, it will be possible to upload electronic coupons to Opencard also in self-service vending machines, which are mounted in several subways of the metro.
What do such machines look like?
They are red, reminiscent of ticket markers, and passengers may have already noticed them in the Roztyly, Budějovická, IP Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská metro stations.
&quot;There are now five of them in the city, but there should be eighty by the end of the year,&quot; Opatrný added.
The coupon checks the driver&#39;s seat of the machine
Operating machines that will start working tomorrow is simple.
All you have to do is insert the Opencard chip card into them and the previously paid coupon will be uploaded to it yourself.
From tomorrow, electronic coupons are valid not only in the capital, but also in its surroundings.
That is, in suburban trains and bus lines with numbers 300 to 499, which travel to the capital, mainly residents of Central Bohemian municipalities.
&quot;On trains included in the Prague Integrated Transport, the guides are equipped with card readers, which are used to determine the time and zone validity of coupons,&quot; explained Filip Drápal from the Ropid organization, which compiles Prague public transport timetables.
Suburban buses have card readers built into the driver&#39;s cash register.
When boarding, it is therefore necessary not only to show the chip card to the driver, but also to attach the Opencard to a designated place on the side of the cash register.
This will allow the driver to check the validity of the uploaded coupons.
&quot;If the passenger needs to verify the validity of the recorded coupons, there is nothing easier than asking the driver for this information,&quot; Drápal added.
Passengers who do not ride suburban buses and do not remember when the coupon expires, can go back to the vending machines, where the coupons are loaded on the card.
Here, information about the validity of their documents is displayed on the device&#39;s display.
The Sudetenland wanted a referendum on the United States
In 1945, the Sudeten Germans demanded the incorporation of Šumava into the United States.
This follows from a letter stored in the collections of the South Bohemian Scientific Library.
When we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we want to live at least under the auspices of the United States.
Some groups of Sudeten Germans allegedly turned to the US President in 1945 with such a wish.
This follows, among other things, from a letter that has been preserved in a private archive and is now stored in the collections of the South Bohemian Scientific Library.
In a letter from the American president, the Germans from Český Krumlov ask that he not allow the return of the &quot;Šumava county&quot; - occupied by Hitler on the basis of the Munich Agreement - back to Czechoslovakia.
&quot;We understood the situation correctly and we really want to be sure of the words that American troops come to German territory not as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators,&quot; reads the letter, signed &quot;People for whom the fate of Šumava is at heart&quot;.
Since the annexation to Czechoslovakia allegedly gives the Sudeten Germans - knowing the Czech national nature - hope only for brutality, ruthlessness, misunderstanding, oppression and slavery, the authors of the letter ask the American president to take over the Protectorate over Šumava for the present and eternal times.
&quot;We cannot believe that, regardless of the opinion of a quarter of a million people, you would give this territory to a foreign state that oppresses and refutes minorities and has done nothing to contribute to the Allied victory,&quot; the letter said.
The reason why the authors cannot sign is allegedly fear of the revenge of the &quot;Czech oppressors&quot;.
If the President of the USA allegedly doubts the thinking of the Šumava Germans, it was enough for him to hold a referendum in the Šumava County as to whether its inhabitants want to become part of the USA or live under the auspices of the United States.
Although the text of the letter may sound a little naive in today&#39;s knowledge of post-war history, according to some witnesses, it aptly illustrates the expectations of the Sudeten Germans at the time.
Although the Czech Germans had to at least suspect that it would be their expulsion from the republic, few of them ever admitted such a possibility.
Some expected the United States and Great Britain to negotiate some kind of autonomy for the Sudetenland.
Others believed that they would simply stay in Czechoslovakia.
This is also confirmed by the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in České Budějovice.
During the war, he was a German from Budweis deployed to the Baltic Navy.
When he was captured by the British at the end of the war and placed in a prison camp in Holstein, dozens of other Czech Germans went to him to teach them Czech.
&quot;They believed that when they returned home, the Czech language would be useful to them,&quot; Chalupa said.
According to him, none of the German prisoners living in Czechoslovakia before the war expected to be expelled from the republic on the basis of Beneš&#39;s decrees.
You do not think, you pay!
An emotional campaign attacks the driver
The most expensive event focused on road safety in Czech history.
Even so, one could characterize the emotional media campaign that the Ministry of Transport intends to launch on Wednesday.
The office of Minister Aleš Řebíček promises that it will discourage drivers from dangerous behavior behind the wheel.
The 150 million campaign will appear on television, radio, cinema, on the Internet, but also on leaflets.
It should discourage drivers from driving fast and drink behind the wheel.
And also to remind them to buckle up before they leave.
It wants to reach the conscience especially of young drivers, bikers, pedestrians and, last but not least, professional drivers.
And what will appear in the spots?
Especially human stories that attack emotions.
And this is evidenced by the &quot;bloody&quot; slogan of the entire campaign:
You do not think, you pay!
The word &quot;don&#39;t think&quot; is written in capital letters on the espezzo.
And in the pool of blood is the word &quot;pay&quot;.
This is to symbolize that one can pay for a moment of inattention with one&#39;s own life.
Viewers will be &quot;haunted&quot; by spots until 2010.
The ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in Anglo-Saxon countries, where pictures with drastic images of accident victims can be seen.
He promises that this will reduce the accident rate and the number of deaths on Czech roads.
The spots were prepared by the Euro RSCG agency.
Sugar and whip on the driver
&quot;The sugar and whip system applies to drivers.
The sugar for them is that when they go red, for example, they save time.
A whip is a threat of a fine or an accident.
The driver must be reminded of the risk, &quot;says Martin Kořán, a traffic psychologist at Na Homolce Hospital.
That is why information campaigns in the press and especially negative advertising are needed, says the psychologist.
According to him, boards that warn drivers of danger are less effective.
&quot;If a static warning board is installed, it will probably merge with the surroundings soon and the drivers will not pay attention to it,&quot; Kořán warned.
Olmert would return almost all occupied territories in exchange for peace
The Prime Minister of Israel, Ehud Olmert, spoke in favor of returning virtually all the territories occupied in 1967, including the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, in exchange for peace with the Palestinians and Syria.
He did so in an interview published by the daily Jediot Achronot on Monday.
&quot;We have to reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it will be necessary to return almost all (if not all) of the (occupied) territories,&quot; Olmert told the daily.
&quot;We will keep a certain percentage of these territories, but we will have to cede a similar percentage (Israeli territory) to the Palestinians, because without it there will be no peace,&quot; he added.
He admitted that any return would include East Jerusalem.
&quot;Anyone who wants security in Jerusalem and, in particular, does not want tractors or bulldozers to cross his legs, as happened to one of my best friends, will have to give up parts of Jerusalem,&quot; Olmert said, referring to two July attacks in the city. several people were killed and dozens were injured.
According to the prime minister, it will be necessary to find &quot;special solutions for the Temple Mount, sacred and historical sites&quot;, which lie inside the Old City.
&quot;Anyone who wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty over the entire city will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
It will not work, &quot;he stressed.
Departure from the Golan Heights
Olmert also spoke in favor of Israel&#39;s departure from the Golan Heights, which he said was an essential condition for a peace agreement with Syria.
But that would also require some effort on the part of Damascus.
&quot;I do not propose to make peace with Syria solely on the basis of leaving the Golan,&quot; he warned.
&quot;The Syrians know well what they will have to give up in order to get the Golans.
They will have to give up their current relationship with Iran; they will have to give up their relationship with the (Shiite movement) Hezbollah; &quot;they will have to give up the continued support they provide to the terrorism (Shiite movement) of Hamas, the (terrorist networks) Al Qaeda and the jihad (holy war) in Iraq,&quot; the prime minister said.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India may cool
According to the Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg, if the problem with Czech scientists accused of illegally collecting beetles in India could not be solved, there would be a certain cooling of Czech-Indian relations.
The minister stated this in New York after today&#39;s meeting with his Indian counterpart Pranab Mukherji.
&quot;If this had not been resolved, then yes, then there would have been some cooling,&quot; he stated after the meeting, which took place on a Czech initiative.
After the hearing, Mukherji said that the executive branch could hardly interfere in court matters.
However, he said that in the case of Petr Shvácha, who was acquitted and fined, the central government could negotiate with the local government in Darjeeling, under whose jurisdiction the matter falls.
&quot;His problem could be solved,&quot; the minister said.
According to Mukherji, it would be best for Emil Kučera, who was sentenced to three years in prison, to appeal to a higher instance.
He can then apply for bail and wait for the sentence, he explained.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner had expressed the same opinion during the negotiations.
&quot;He recommends an appeal to a higher court, then it would be possible to pardon him,&quot; said the head of Czech diplomacy.
The only way the Czech side can get involved is to provide &quot;competent legal support&quot; to the convicts, said the Indian minister.
He also said that the Indian side is already providing such assistance.
&quot;We have the utmost interest in maintaining the best relations with India, which have a long tradition.
Indians also recognize this, &quot;said Schwarzenberg.
At the same time, as he told ČTK, he emphasized to his partner that the Czech Republic attaches great importance to the problem of Czech entomologists.
&quot;We really consider it a profound mistake to imprison and accuse these Czech scientists,&quot; he said.
The minister avoided answering the question of whether he received a promise from the Indian side to deal with things.
&quot;I&#39;ve received quite a few promises,&quot; he said only.
Questions after the accident: Are the stewards on the bus illegal?
The law does not know them, it is not allowed to walk on a long-distance bus
In connection with the tragic accident of a Student Agency bus near Padua, Italy, the question arose as to whether stewards and passengers could move around the bus while driving.
&quot;If we want to strictly and formally comply with the law, the steward&#39;s activity is in conflict with the law on road traffic,&quot; says Ministry of Transport spokesman Karel Hanzelka.
The accident, in which the 22-year-old stewardess died last week, was apparently caused by a truck driver who crossed the bus path.
Unfortunately, the girl was sitting next to the driver at the time, in the least safe place in the car, although she has two more seats.
However, the bus may crash or brake sharply, even when the steward is delivering coffee or newspapers.
It plays a role whether the bus is equipped with parking spaces according to the technical certificate.
If it is not homologated on the bus, the passenger must sit.
Student Agency long-distance buses do not have parking spaces; which was confirmed by Aktuálně.cz by the company&#39;s director Radim Jančura.
&quot;We dealt with this with the ministry and at first did not allow the movement of passengers.
Later, they called it off and we came to the conclusion that passengers are allowed to go to the toilet while driving, if they have their own seat, &quot;he said.
He doesn&#39;t know the steward&#39;s law
&quot;There is no clear legal interpretation of the role of the steward - no legislation addresses this role.
However, no legislation even prohibits the carrier from providing services.
The Road Transport Act only knows the term accompanying vehicle; does not define his rights and obligations, &quot;adds spokeswoman Hanzelka.
Josef Pokorný, director of the road vehicle operation department of the Ministry of Transport, on the other hand, thinks that the issue is sufficiently addressed by law.
&quot;It depends on whether the bus is allowed to stand in the homologation.
That&#39;s the end of it, &quot;he says.
Buses are divided into urban, where there are parking spaces and limited maximum speed, intercity with parking spaces with a higher permitted speed and long-distance without parking spaces with a maximum permitted speed and seats equipped with seat belts.
Like on a plane, says the expert
BESIP traffic safety expert Jaroslav Hořín does not see a fundamental problem in the movement of stewards on board the bus.
&quot;There are not many dangers when driving smoothly, the situation can be compared to servicing aircraft.
Here, too, it is uncertain when the turbulence will come and the flight attendant may hit her head. &quot;
&quot;Of course, if the bus brakes hard, the laws of physics apply.
Just like on a city bus or tram.
The safety of stewards must be solved by the carrier by internal regulations, &quot;he says and also thinks, from the point of view of the law, the problem is unresolved.
Jančura is willing to cancel the services
Student Agency offers the services of stewards as the only bus operator.
He employs two hundred of them.
Even after an accident, the director does not consider their profession to be risky.
&quot;But as soon as I get the impression that the profession of stewards is risky, I will cancel them.
Coffee and newspapers can be provided to passengers upon boarding.
It would also save costs, &quot;he says.
Alexei Litvin, the director of Asiana, which operates a fraction of the lines compared to SA, justified the absence of stewards in his cars as an interest in safety.
&quot;We don&#39;t have stewards, we have been against it from the beginning.
Sooner or later, it will end in a fatal accident, &quot;he told Týden.cz less than a year ago.
An immense tragedy has happened
A young flight attendant from the Pilsen region, who worked for the company for two years, died in an accident on a regular line to Naples.
The Slovenian truck probably deviated from the parking lane without using a signpost and blocked the bus route.
His driver tried to avoid a sharp maneuver, but he tripped over the right front.
Jančura refuses to sell out two places reserved for the stewards&#39; rest.
&quot;These places cannot be reserved for long-distance connections, they are blocked.&quot;
The company intends to sue the truck driver.
With the compensation of the girl&#39;s family, the agency will not wait for the court ortel, but it also expects financial compensation from the culprit.
Amending the law?
In sight
The amendment of the law, on which a thirty-member expert group of the Ministry of Transport has been working for over a year, could specify the movement of stewards on board the bus.
&quot;It simply came to our notice then.
Buses don&#39;t solve much, rather a point system, maximum speed on the highway and the use of a mobile phone while driving, &quot;says expert Hořín.
&quot;The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activities of stewards to be something that would fundamentally endanger the safety of passengers,&quot; concludes spokeswoman Hanzelka, adding that the control of bus safety is within the competence of the police and occupational safety authorities.
The Czech Republic is judging the battle for the seabed
Access a wall-mounted electronic map of Australia and adjacent maritime areas.
However, he is not interested in the continent, but in a small point lost in the blue ocean.
&quot;The island belongs to Australia and with it the adjacent seabed.
At the same time, the area is as big as the continent itself, &quot;says Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who belongs to a 30-member team of employees of the UN Division for Ocean and Marine Law.
Its boss, the director of the division, the Czech lawyer Václav Mikulka, monitors the interpretation and occasionally completes it.
There is work enthusiasm and enthusiasm.
The seabed hides a hitherto little-known world, rich in natural resources.
Oil, ores and other minerals can be found here, as well as hitherto unknown living organisms, which carry the key to developing a cure for cancer.
Bottom larger than the mainland
Today, coastal states have begun to vehemently apply for new submarine territories.
Under the UN Convention, they are exercising their rights, which were agreed in 1982 in Montego Bay, Jamaica.
This is mainly the area of the so-called continental shelf, which often extends up to several hundred kilometers from the coast of the country.
According to the convention, it has the exclusive right to all resources of the continental shelf.
&quot;Simply put, the continental shelf is the part of the seabed and its subsoil that is a natural continuation of the continent under the sea.
It extends beyond the coastal sea, often beyond the limit of two hundred nautical miles of the so-called exclusive economic zone, &quot;explains Mikulka.
The country&#39;s request to the Commission for the delimitation of the external borders of the continental shelf must be supported by extensive scientific and technical documentation based on many costly surveys and measurements.
It is the result of many years of preparatory work.
&quot;One of our tasks is to provide the Commission with legal and technical assistance.
The Commission has so far examined five applications, namely Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
So far, only the last three countries have succeeded, &quot;adds Mikulka.
The success of Australia, which was the first to substantially expand its submarine states, has recently seen worldwide acclaim.
But he also acquired New Zealand - the area of the seabed that the commission granted him last week is about 1.6 million square kilometers, about six times the size of the state itself.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in the survey.
The profits they will receive from the use of the seabed in the future will, they promise, be invaluable.
Other states will gradually submit their applications.
They can do so for up to ten years from the time they ratify the &quot;Montego Bay Convention&quot;.
Where the continental shelf ends, the ocean floor begins, a convention declared the &quot;common heritage of mankind.&quot;
No state has an exclusive position here.
The right to mine in this area is granted by an international institution established by the Convention.
&quot;But the seabed is no Klondike,&quot; says director Mikulka in exaggeration, noting that his &quot;individual areas are legally clearly defined and their regime is contractually enshrined.&quot;
Czechs in the Pacific
Today, part of the seabed also belongs to the Czech Republic.
They are shared with other states of the former Eastern bloc within the joint organization &quot;Interoceanmetal&quot;.
Under the convention, it gained the status of a so-called &quot;pioneer investor&quot; in 1991 under the convention, as did investors in a few other states.
It is authorized to mine in the ClarionClipperton Zone of the Pacific Ocean, located between Mexico, the Hawaiian Islands and Kiribati.
The area explored by the investor is slightly larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The bottom is rugged there, it is a kind of underwater replica of the Tatras.
&quot;It is possible to mine there on an area of 75,000 square kilometers.
The area is a rich site of polymetallic concretions containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese, &quot;says another lawyer, Ind Pakshi Rajan.
Macedonian division worker Rober Sandev brings one such concretion to the show.
It resembles a small potato or, with a little imagination, a mythical shem, which according to legend revived the Golem.
Düsseldorf&#39;s hope is Frankfurt
The big words in the letter from the WestLB board of directors to the employees of this bank are not missing.
The merger of the units of this Düsseldorf-based monetary institution with the Frankfurt-based Deka-Bank will create the &quot;central institution of a financial group of savings banks for trading on the capital markets,&quot; we read in a letter released to the public on Monday.
According to the letter, WestLB will bring a &quot;set of competencies&quot; to this transaction, securing long-term returns.
And it is said that such a merger can be a decisive impetus for further associations in the provincial banking sector.
Such texts are created when the board of directors wants to prove its ability to act in a problematic period.
The unstable WestLB is still under considerable pressure.
Not only from the European Commission, but also from the Federal Office for the Supervision of Financial Services, whose message to the Land Government of North Rhine-Westphalia that it is time to find a solution for the future is still fresh.
However, the connection between Deka-Bank, which the savings bank&#39;s customers know for its investment funds, and WestLB, of whatever kind, has been talked about for a long time - even on the Frankfurt side.
Deka-Bank chief Franz Waas said at a presentation of his six-month financial results at the end of August that he did not see the point in merging his Mainzer Landstraße bank with one of the state-owned banks, such as Helaba or WestLB.
However, the Board of Directors of Deka-Bank, which is backed by one half of the Landesbank and the other by the savings bank associations, has instructed the Board of Directors to conduct talks with WestLB on joint business activities.
These could be capital market trades or part of them.
However, the talks have only just begun, they say financially.
Deka-Bank, which with its 3,000 employees is one of the most important employers on the financial market in Frankfurt, is not being discussed for the first time in connection with consolidation in the savings sector.
In 2003, it looked like for a while that Deka-Bank could merge with Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz and Helaba.
In the end, there was nothing of this trio.
Shortly after the merger plans became public, the Hessen state government spoke out against Helaba&#39;s involvement.
The two remaining banks did not merge either.
Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz was instead acquired by Landesbank Baden-Württemberg of Stuttgart.
Nevertheless, there has been repeated speculation about the merger of Deka-Bank with the Landesbanks.
Recently, however, Günther Merl, Chairman of the Board of Directors of Helaba Bank, commented negatively on speculation about the merger of his financial house with others.
However, the belief that bringing the various public sector banking houses closer together is necessary, however, is maturing.
Now, after the elections to the Landtag in Bavaria, the merger of BayernLB with Landesbank Baden-Württemberg could be the first to emerge.
That&#39;s not good news for Helaba.
Should the pressure for further mergers increase, they gradually lose potential partners for such a merger.
In the south, it would only play the second violin, even though it still faces the financial crisis significantly better than the banks in Munich and Stuttgart.
At the beginning of the year, the Hessen-Thüringen Association of Savings Banks and Giro Banks, which has an 85% stake in Helaba, banned the connection with WestLB.
At most, Nord LB would be considered.
However, geostrategic considerations of this kind are only one side of the problem.
On the other hand, it is a question of how much the business models of individual institutions harmonize.
In June, Merl said that the decisive question of what business model should ensure the future competitiveness of the Landesbanks, the German Association of Savings Banks and Giro Banks has not yet answered.
Everything could also end up with the dismantling of WestLB, which, of course, no one in this institution wants.
That is why the letter from the local board of directors also says that they are trying to find a &quot;comprehensive solution&quot; for the entire bank.
Whether and how it will be possible to connect with the connection of individual components with Deka-Bank will be shown by time.
The second weekend of Oktoberfest is known as the &quot;weekend with Italy&quot;
It&#39;s the first time for Elena, the third or fourth time for Luca.
But this time Elena will be like his girlfriend, and so everything will be different, he says.
Behind them, by a five-liter Kaiser barrel, stands a stronger bearded man and proves to two hundred tourists at Oktoberfest how deep tones his throat can make.
Elena slaps Luc first and then kisses him.
They came to Verona from Bologna.
From here, from the bus car park next to Puorta Nuova station, four buses marked &quot;destinazione Monaco, festa della birra&quot; depart this evening at 11.45, expected to arrive at 6.30.
Three buses are occupied mainly by Italians, one bus is used exclusively by Brazilians.
In one corner of the parking lot, these South Americans are already singing with their flag, they have already celebrated at night.
And so loud, says Marco Guarda, this is nothing for Italy.
Marco, who is wearing a long coat lined with imitation fur and glasses with wide silver rims, belongs to the three buses.
He has been going to Oktoberfest with them for five years, and this year alone he is organizing three expeditions.
At night there, during the day between the beer stalls, at 22.30 departure back.
Overnight would be an unnecessary expense, says Marco.
The trip costs 75 euros, including a welcome toast with Kaiser beer, brewed exactly according to the Bavarian Purity Act, health insurance and a German-speaking guide - Marco took a language course in Frankfurt.
Buses leave at night, following the highway towards &quot;Brennero&quot;.
Beer is not served, not yet.
The bus shuts up quickly, the passengers are asleep.
They are doing well, they will still need their strength.
It is being built in Brixen and Holzkirchen, where many other buses with Italian license plates are taking another break on the number 8 motorway just outside Munich.
When Marco&#39;s group finally arrives at the parking lot near Theresienwiese at half past six in the morning, there are already about 50 other buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others gather, Marco has his last speech, explaining the plan of attack.
First: Put on the yellow cap.
It reads &quot;Oktoberfest&quot; on the left in a swabian, next to the internet address of Marco&#39;s travel agency: &quot;conoscersiviaggiando.it&quot;.
Second, &quot;When the door to the beer tent opens, run!&quot; calls Marco into the morning air.
&quot;Go!&quot; Go and occupy the seats in the back of the tent.
&quot;Not forward so you don&#39;t get in the way, and not all the yellow caps on the same bench, spread out around the space!&quot;
The ointment costs 8 euros, 25 cents.
And don&#39;t forget the tips.
&quot;Show the securitians that we are behaving properly.
Once you leave your seats, they are gone! &quot;
Thirdly, &quot;Be here again at exactly half past ten tonight!&quot; Do you understand?
And up to Wiesn, a space with beer tents.
Along the way, one member of the group hangs yellow caps as markers on trees, signs and even on the election poster of a large Bavarian party.
It is necessary to prepare for retreat.
The second weekend of Oktoberfest is known as the &quot;weekend with Italy&quot;.
Exact data on visitor numbers are not available; there are talks about fifty thousand of those who set out on a journey across the Alps and break into beer tents, ten percent of all visitors reportedly arrived from Italy this weekend.
The ranks of the Munich police will be strengthened by seven police officers from South Tyrol, Italian volunteers will support the Bavarian Red Cross, which keeps national statistics, in which Italians in front of the British (about 60 hits) and Austrians (about 80) occupy first place with about 200 medical treatments.
The Hofbräu tent is especially popular with Italians.
Sleepless nights for Hypo Real Estate lenders
Last week, Federal Minister of Finance Peer Steinbrück emphasized that the German banking system was relatively stable.
It is good that this politician used the word &quot;relatively&quot; and incorporated into his statement the fact that the German banking sector will not be spared the crisis.
Because it happened last weekend.
The Dax-monitored financial house specializing in real estate financing Hypo Real Estate (HRE) will receive a loan of several billion from a consortium of German banks to protect against market turbulence.
A person familiar with the situation told Reuters on Monday that the loan assistance would go up to 35 billion euros.
Hypo Real Estate (HRE) will only have to pay interest on the amount actually used.
The money is said to come from both private and public banks.
In the background are the losses of the subsidiary Depfa.
According to a newspaper report, this state financier refinanced for short-term projects for which he lent money in the extremely short term, which is now no longer possible due to mistrust in the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank&#39;s reserve shrank by 95% to 2.37 million euros and the share of equity decreased slightly from 1.6 to 1.45 percent.
Current income and net income from financial transactions fell to zero compared to the previous year, while income from the increased value of receivables and certain securities, as well as from the cancellation of provisions for credit trading, fell by more than 70 percent to 5 million euros.
Only due to higher revenues from compensation for subsequent settlement costs in the restructuring of the former Depfa group and from interest compensation under the Tax Code and for business intermediation for group companies, the 16% decline in revenue was even more modest.
After its privatization in 1990, the former state financier burned himself out on mortgages for self-employed people, who were then separated from the portfolio of services and further managed by Aareal Bank.
Because there was too little profit in traditional state funding, Depfa became more involved in infrastructure projects and in the financing of joint projects between private investors and the state (Private-Public-Partnership, PPP) and diversified internationally.
Hypo Real Estate now has to write off some of the value of its subsidiary, and these write-downs will have a &quot;significant material effect&quot; on the calculation of the group&#39;s profit and loss, as some have been vaguely heard.
The fact is that there will be no dividend.
Already for 2007, it was reduced by two thirds.
Hypo Real Estate has been a major financier of state and infrastructure projects since the acquisition of Depfa.
It depends more strongly than other institutes on refinancing in the interbank market, because it has no customer deposits.
After the collapse of the American investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, the source of interbank loans practically dried up, as banks guard liquidity.
Hypo Real Estate needs short-term refinancing funds for part of Depfa&#39;s loan portfolio - approx. 50 billion euros - annually.
According to Hypo Real Estate, the group&#39;s financial needs are covered by this loan for the foreseeable future and the company is protected &quot;from the influence of international money markets, which are currently largely incapable of functioning&quot;.
Other sources have said that the money will provide refinancing by the end of 2009.
HRE Chairman Georg Funke, on the other hand, stated that the Hypo Real Estate Group will not have to use the money markets for the foreseeable future.
The Federal Bank and the Federal Institute for the Supervision of Financial Services (BaFin) assume that the competitiveness of the Hypo Real Estate group on the market is now ensured.
The bank&#39;s shareholders and creditors hope so.
But given the dynamism and intangibility of the crisis, there is probably no certainty.
It is not even completely out of the question that the loan should not be used up completely.
However, the opposite cannot be ruled out.
After the bank appears to be facing insolvency late Sunday afternoon, the rescue, albeit a preliminary one, cannot calm the passions.
The share price fell by 75 percent to 3.30 euros.
On the contrary, bond prices held up well.
While senior debt has remained virtually unchanged, secondary bond prices are falling more sharply.
This applies in particular to bonds of the former Württemberg Hypo subsidiary and logically bonds with a maturity after 2009.
Hypo-Real-Estate bonds originally looked like an alternative investment opportunity for speculators, but their stability must be understood in the light of the stability of the international financial system after the banking crisis and the crisis of the institute itself, which brought it into the company with the acquisition of Depf.
As long as issuing banks, governments and less affected commercial banks are willing to support the system, it is possible to count on the repayment of securities within their maturity.
But it can also happen what almost no one dares to hope for at the moment - the financial crisis will be overcome in the next 15 months.
However, given the reports coming at the same time as this partial nationalization, the probability bordering on certainty has now become a mere legitimate hope.
This is likely to prepare long-term creditors, especially for a number of sleepless nights, when deciding whether to waive their obligations.
Short-term investors may use the threshold at least to transfer the loss from previous accounting periods to foreign exchange gains of later years for the purpose of future payment of capital gains tax.
German special forces were held hostage during the liberation
The Egyptian government has asked Germany for help in resolving the hostage crisis - experts have arrived.
When the situation escalated, special units were ready, but no deployment.
Further details of the circumstances of the release of eleven European tourists abducted in Egypt are gradually coming to the public.
According to the Ministry of Defense and the Interior, German special forces also took an indirect part in the rescue operation.
According to the ministries, both experts from the Federal Army and members of the anti-terrorist group of the German police GSG9, the squadron of the Federal Police, the Federal Criminal Office and also logistics experts from the Technical Assistance Service (Technisches Hilfswerk) were exempted.
However, according to another statement from spokesmen for both ministries on Monday afternoon, German forces were not needed because the kidnappers let their prisoners go and fled when they recognized signs of violent liberation.
The Egyptian government reportedly accepted the aid offered by Germany as support forces for the action on the spot.
&quot;Fortunately, that didn&#39;t happen,&quot; said a spokesman for the Federal Ministry of the Interior.
The attackers kidnapped a group of travelers consisting of five Germans, five Italians, one Romanian and eight of their Egyptian guides on September 19 in southern Egypt.
After the abduction in the desert region in the south of Egypt, they took hostages in the border areas between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the kidnappers remained unclear until the last moment, as did the details of the exemption or possible payment of the ransom.
The rescues are now in order in Cairo.
Minister Steinmeier said that the release of the hostages was in the care of the German embassy.
He did not comment on the details of the release.
Information on when the rescue will return to Germany is not yet available in Berlin.
According to the newspaper &quot;Bild&quot;, all five tourists should fly with special forces on one of the German Air Force&#39;s Airbuses and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
Sylvana and the secret of the bento box
When 16-year-old Sylvana Hiltrop is to introduce herself on the first day of high school in Tachibana, the girls start giggling: the German woman is completely &quot;kawaii&quot;!
What does it mean?
Sylvana already knows this word from manga. In his new exchange blog, he talks about Japan.
&quot;The first day in Japan.
Sir, I was nervous.
I was already on my way to school.
I live on the outskirts of Tokyo towards Kawasaki and take a 40-minute train ride to Central Tachibana.
I had to find the way myself, fortunately I didn&#39;t get lost.
It seems that the beginning of teaching in Tachibana is not set as strictly as in our home in Lower Saxony.
Students begin to meet after eight o&#39;clock, and twenty minutes before nine o&#39;clock, a short session with the teacher, the so-called &#39;home room&#39;, begins.
But before class started, I was supposed to introduce myself.
At the same time, I am not the type of person who likes to speak in front of people, let alone in front of a class of 40 students.
Since I didn&#39;t have a school uniform yet, I put on my host&#39;s old skirt, a blouse, blue stockings, and black leather boots.
So, dressed like this, I stood in front of the bench and tried to say everything correctly: &#39;Sajónara Wo še Sylvana ...&#39; - my name is Sylvana, I come from Germany and it is my birthday in a week.
At that moment, I was very happy that I started learning the language two years ago.
All 31 girls in the class were whispering, giggling and waving, and I kept hearing the word &#39;kawaii&#39;.
I already knew that from my manga.
It belongs to the basic vocabulary of Japanese girls necessary for survival and means &#39;cute, sweet&#39;.
Then I sailed quickly to my place.
The girl next to me smiled quite broadly, considering it an honor to have a foreign student sit next to her.
The rest of the hour was relatively calm, but when the gong sounded, they literally covered me.
They talked over each other and giggled and asked me about the possible and the impossible - and yet it&#39;s really hard to understand Japanese English.
During the break, everyone unpacked their bents.
My host mother also made me such a lunch box - and that&#39;s something other than boring German snacks.
I had rice with herbs, small sausages, a cucumber and seaweed salad, fruit and some fish in tofu batter.
Mostly I have no idea what exactly I eat here in Japan.
Those things look weird and taste quite new.
What is certain is that everything is really good.
Well, maybe except for the salted plums, br!
Bentos in Japanese schools are not just for lunch.
Sometimes it happens that the girl gives the boy a hand-made bento, which in this case is especially artistically arranged, and hopes that he will get to know the boy better during the snack during the break.
I read about that in my manga comics.
I wonder if I&#39;ll see it here too.
&#39;Why Japan?&#39; my friends asked me when I told them I wanted to go to school in Tokyo for a year.
Then I always said:
&#39;Because I&#39;m just fascinated.&#39;
After all, I&#39;ve preferred to read manga for years.
And to better understand these comics and their culture, I once started learning Japanese a little bit.
So it was very clear to me that I would have to come here one day.
Because I also have a weakness for tradition, customs and usages.
And you are highly valued here.
On the one hand, Japan is a country of the latest technologies and trends, on the other hand, it is strict, disciplined and traditional.
And because everything is so well organized, I&#39;ve never felt lost here before, even though Tokyo is the biggest city I&#39;ve ever seen. &quot;
The US House of Representatives has rejected the rescue package
The First House of Congress has narrowly dropped a $ 700 billion bailout package for financial markets.
The Dow Jones index fell sharply.
In a ratio of 206 to 227 votes, the US House of Representatives rejected the government&#39;s rescue package for financial markets.
Despite all the calls made by US President George W. Bush and the leading politicians on both sides, there was no majority in favor of a program that should alleviate the chaos in the financial markets.
Through dramatic action, proponents have been desperate to persuade critics of the $ 700 billion package.
Barney Frank, one of the Democratic negotiators, called on the deputy to agree before the vote, although, he said, the plan was not popular.
&quot;It&#39;s hard to get political recognition for avoiding something that hasn&#39;t happened yet,&quot; he admitted.
Even during the vote, the Dow Jones index fell by more than six percent, or 600 points.
The reason was investors&#39; fears that the state rescue package could fail.
Shortly before the end of the vote, the value of the index rose, only to fall sharply again after the announcement of the failure of the package.
Experts now expect further serious turbulence in international financial markets.
The approval of both the House of Representatives and the Senate is required for the program to enter into force.
Even rats have feelings
When a rat or cockroach runs away from danger, does that mean they also feel fear?
Neurologist Joseph LeDoux is convinced that many animals have feelings as well.
But how could it be verified that they feel the same way when they behave like us?
Contributions by well-known scientists have been published in the online magazine &quot;Edge&quot; for several years.
In his series, SPIEGEL ONLINE presents selected answers to the question &quot;What do you consider to be true without being able to prove it?&quot;
I believe that animals have feelings and other states of consciousness, without me or anyone else able to prove it when we cannot even prove that other people have consciousness.
But in this case, we can at least hope, because all human brains have the same basic configuration.
However, once we begin to engage in another kind and open up questions of perception or consciousness in general, we enter impassable terrain because the hardware does not match.
When a rat is in danger, it will do the same as many other animals: it will pretend to be dead, flee or attack.
Humans behave similarly, with some scholars suggesting a comparable subjective experience.
However, I do not believe in that.
Two aspects of brain structure make it difficult to transfer our subjective experience to animal experience.
This is partly because the circuits associated with human consciousness almost always include the lateral prefrontal cortex (due to its role in short-term memory and executive or control functions).
This large area is significantly more developed in humans than in other primates, and it seems to be completely absent in other creatures.
At least for those aspects of our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal cortex, including knowing who we are and the ability to plan and make decisions, there is reason to believe that humans are even different from other primates.
Another dramatic peculiarity could be hidden in the linguistic nature of man: because so much of his perception is linked to language, it is often said that consciousness depends on it.
In this case, we could exclude animals.
But even if consciousness did not depend on language, it would certainly be affected by language, so that animal consciousness, however constructed, would probably differ from most states of our consciousness.
Therefore, it is difficult to determine what consciousness may look like in other animals.
When, as something internal and subjective, neither can it be measured nor, due to special hardware, analyzed on the basis of our own experience, its examination presents us with great problems.
Most of my conclusions relate to the content of conscious experience, but in addition, there is another aspect of consciousness that should be more scientifically accessible.
It would be possible to study processes in animal consciousness regardless of their content, and this is exactly what is the case in short-term memory studies in primates, especially on the example of visualization.
But this approach, taken by Christof Koch and Francis Crick, focuses on neural correlates of consciousness rather than causal mechanisms: both may or may not be identical.
Interestingly, this approach also emphasizes the importance of the nefrontal cortex for the realization of visualization.
What does this mean for feelings?
I deduce them from the fact that an emotional system, such as the fear system, is activated in a brain aware of its own activities.
What we call &quot;fear&quot; is therefore the mental state in which we find ourselves when the activity of the defense system located in the brain (or its consequences, such as bodily reactions) uses operational memory.
Seen from this angle, feelings are closely linked to those areas of the cortex that characterize primates, and humans in particular.
In connection with linguistic nature, there is a subtle gradation of perception, because with the help of words and grammar we can distinguish and categorize states so that we can ascribe them side by side to others.
Antonio Damasio, on the other hand, believes that feelings arise from more primitive activities in the cortex and brainstem areas devoted to bodily sensations, similar to Jaak Pankseep, who is more focused on the brainstem.
Because this network has not changed much during human evolution, it could easily contribute to the feelings perceived by several animal genera.
Purely theoretically, I cannot oppose it, but I consider it unprovable.
Pankseep argues that what appears to us to be fear in rats and humans is likely to be felt in the same way by both organisms: But how can it be verified, says Pankseep, whether rats and humans feel the same when they behave similarly?
The cockroach is fleeing from danger - does he also feel fear?
From my point of view, the mere similarity of behavior cannot prove the identity of experience.
It is true that neural comparisons take us further: rats and humans have similar brain strains, while cockroaches and the brain do not.
But is the brain stem responsible for feelings?
And even if it could be proven in humans: how would we like to prove it in rats?
I think rats and other mammals, maybe even cockroaches (who knows?), Have feelings.
But I really don&#39;t know how to do it.
And because their feelings are probably fundamentally different from ours (because human consciousness rests on special circuits and language), I examine emotional behavior rather than the emotional perception of rats.
In any case, in this case we can expect progress at the neural level if we measure the same in rats and humans.
As with rats, I do not examine language and consciousness, nor do I examine feelings, for I do not know if they exist.
It can be considered short-sighted, but I would rather move forward than repeatedly throw myself against the wall.
I&#39;m a practical emotionalist.
UEFA President Platini: Grace period for Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Ivan Vasjunyk said that preparations will soon be managed directly by the president and prime minister.
&quot;The government sees UEFA&#39;s decision in Bordeaux as proof of confidence in Ukraine and its ability to co-host the European Championships with Poland,&quot; Vasjunyk said.
&quot;It simply came to our notice then.
The work has only just begun and there is still much to be done in both countries. &quot;
Both hosts are lagging behind in timely implementation of the construction or redevelopment schedule for stadiums, streets, hotels and airports.
It is even possible that the number of stadiums for the European Championships will be reduced from eight to six.
&quot;We can no longer waste time.
We must now work as quickly as possible, &quot;said Grigory Surkis, chairman of the Ukrainian Association.
&quot;UEFA will keep an eye on us.&quot;
An even more radical step was agreed in Poland.
After numerous scandals, the leadership of the Polish PZPN was dismissed by the National Olympic Committee and replaced by independent administrator Robert Zawlocki.
The committee met at the request of the Minister of Sports Miroslav Drzewiecki.
It is said that there is a &quot;serious danger that PZPN will not be able to act according to the rules,&quot; Drzewiecki told the Polish news agency PAP.
&quot;We have assured UEFA President Michel Platini in a letter that preparations for the 2012 European Championships will not suffer as a result.&quot;
Several teams from the first league were sentenced to a forced relegation only last season due to manipulations, and in the end the beginning of the league even had to be hastily moved.
Travel agents are recording an increasing number of bookings
It looks like winter will be good for German tourism entrepreneurs:
According to one study, travel bookings for the coming months increased significantly compared to the previous year - even by more than 30 percent for the winter season.
Despite weak economic growth, the Germans&#39; desire to travel remains untouched.
For reservations for the winter season, travel agencies saw a 31 percent increase in turnover compared to the same period last year, as reported by the German Travel Association (Deutscher Reiseverband, DRV) in Berlin on Monday.
According to a survey by the GfK market research institute, increased numbers of reservations are already available for the autumn months.
According to DRV, the turnover for October was about eleven percent higher compared to 2007.
The basis for these results is the figures of GfK, which evaluates booking data from 1,200 German travel agencies every month and interpolates them into the overall market.
This result included tour bookings that took place until the end of August 2008.
Due to the weak exchange rate of the dollar, trips to the USA are especially in demand, the DRV said.
For these trips, the increase in reservations is about one third.
In addition, Spain, Turkey and Greece, as well as domestic waters, are particularly popular destinations for the Germans.
Above all, organized tours are on the course, said DRV chairman Klaus Laepple.
Given the rising costs for energy and food, the costs are &quot;easier for the client to calculate than for an individually organized holiday&quot;.
Laepple explained that consumers can save money, among other things, by using discounts for early booking or all-inclusive offers.
Even in the summer months, the number of reservations was said to be very good, so compared to the previous year, there will be a higher turnover again - although according to another study, the number of Germans who took a trip decreased compared to the previous year.
Outraged, Dennis Quaid strikes back
She wanted to advertise a new film, talked about private matters - and now she has problems with her ex: Hollywood star Meg Ryan talked about her former Dennis Quaid as a marriage breaker.
He rages and strikes back.
The belated war of the roses by former couple Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: seven years after the divorce, the two Hollywood actors are in a nasty dispute - in front of the public.
In an interview with InStyle magazine last week, Meg Ryan commented for the first time on the reasons for the collapse of her marriage: &quot;Dennis was unfaithful to me for a long time, and it was very painful.&quot;
She allegedly found out about the extent of the fraud only after the divorce.
The impetus for this mental striptease was Ryan&#39;s PR work for her new film &quot;The Women&quot; - which tells the story of a broken marriage.
Dennis Quaid&#39;s reaction to his presentation as an unfaithful husband was strong: &quot;Crazy,&quot; the 54-year-old New York Daily News actor told &quot;Meg is repeatedly chewing on and adjusting the history of our relationship.&quot;
Moreover, it is &quot;regrettable&quot; that he reiterates to the common 16-year-old son Jack &quot;publicly the pain and radical changes that divorce is for every child.&quot;
While Ryan has been living alone since her divorce, Quaid is remarried and recently became the father of twins.
He concludes his thoughts on bending: &quot;My life goes on anyway.
I consider myself happy to have an amazing family that is doing great. &quot;
Ticket and hotel prices are falling
In the first half of 2008, flights and accommodation in Europe were cheaper than in the previous year.
In Germany, according to one current study, flights were even up to 50 percent cheaper.
Flights and hotel accommodation have become cheaper again - the result of a study by travel and financial services provider American Express.
The company analyzed its data on reservations made from the first half of 2008 and, after rising prices in the first quarter, found a significant decline in the second quarter.
After several years of prices on the hotel market, accommodation in many places has become cheaper.
From January to March, prices in 41 of the 48 European cities surveyed rose by an average of 6.9% compared to 2007.
From April to June, however, prices were already 3.6 percent lower than in the previous year.
This trend was most noticeable in Paris and Rome, where passengers had to pay 30 to 37 percent less than in the previous year.
The cause of this trend is considered by American Express to be the weak exchange rate of the dollar, which caused a &quot;declining appetite of American tourists to travel.&quot;
The fall in hotel prices also hit financial centers harder than industrial centers such as Hanover, Cologne and Stavanger.
In this Norwegian city, hotel prices even set a European record with an increase of 26.3 percent.
Ticket prices also showed an upward trend in the first quarter:
Due to the increase in the price of kerosene, Economy class passengers had to pay an average of 7.1 percent more than in 2007, and fuel-intensive long-haul flights even increased by as much as 29.2 percent.
From April to June, Economy ticket prices fell by an average of 12.5 percent compared to the previous quarter, but in the Business and First-Class classes, the changes in knowledge were less pronounced.
In Germany, prices fell even more sharply than in other European countries:
From January to March, they rose by 11.9 percent, in the second quarter they fell by 23.6 percent.
According to the cited study, prices have even halved on German domestic flights.
One of the reasons for this price drop is slowing economic growth, the company explains.
Demand in many segments of the air transport market is uncertain.
On the other hand, there is increased competitive pressure due to the Open Skies agreement, which has liberalized air traffic between the USA and Europe.
A sign of the tense situation is the cancellation of unprofitable routes by air carriers and also the high number of airlines that went bankrupt in the first half of 2008 - 24 airlines in Europe alone.
HSV defeated Gladbach 1: 0
Thanks to one goal and simple methods, Hamburger SV gets to the top of the table.
In Borussia, Luhukay continues to fail to put together a functioning eleven.
Written by Kristoffer Klein - Enlarge Failed landing for representative Marko Marino.
This player from Gladbach joined the game late and failed with a balloon stuck on the stick.
His message was precisely worded and convincing.
He simply knew he was right.
&quot;We need a second goal,&quot; hissed Hermann Rieger in the hallway to the booths of the Hamburg arena.
There wasn&#39;t much going on in the catacombs, the half-time break was over, and most of the people were back in their seats.
Rieger has been an HSV physiotherapist for nearly three decades and enjoys more respect than many momentary actors.
And so his request was also heard in a responsible place.
Assistant coach Cornelius Jol nodded and raised his thumb to indicate a match.
Cornelius is the brother of Hamburg head coach Martin Joel.
His order probably sounded similar: here with the second goal!
No execution.
&quot;Everything didn&#39;t look nice here today,&quot; Marcell Jansen later admitted.
Even Bastian Reinhardt would have &quot;wished more relaxed&quot;.
For 1: 0 (1: 0) the Hamburgers owe the head of Mladen Petrić (11th) and the fact that the very weak Gladbashans could not harm the weak Hamburgers.
&quot;It was a dirty victory,&quot; Martin Jol concluded.
Hamburger SV will celebrate 121 years of its existence this Monday.
The spectators celebrated themselves on Saturday afternoon, the blue sky above the arena and a live updated table on the video wall, in which their team was shown as the premiant.
It will be a birthday without a proper party.
&quot;We know how to evaluate it,&quot; said Marcell Jansen.
He suspects that the current tabular result symbolizes the unpredictability of the league rather than the dominance of its HSV.
The team with the late arrival of new players - Brazilians Nevese and Silva, goalkeeper Petrić and FC Bayern acquired by Jansen - is slowly in place, but it still can&#39;t shine.
&quot;We need more emotion and more dribbling,&quot; Jol said emphatically.
My first Oktoberfest
Endlessly repeated pop, tuplá beer and celebrities in traditional costumes from well-known designers.
For the first time in a beer meadow.
Susanne Kronzucker and I don&#39;t really have much in common.
She is a blonde, TV presenter and wears a tailor-made costume.
I have dark hair, I am a student and my dress is from secondhand.
But one thing unites us: we haven&#39;t been in a beer field for three minutes, and photographers are already throwing themselves at us and filling memory cards deftly - that&#39;s flattering me, because I&#39;m at Oktoberfest for the first time.
This is how you can make friends.
My cheap costume seems to have served its purpose.
I&#39;m here as a tourist and I live north of the sausage equator, so my sense of comfort in the costume was rather limited.
But right after arriving at Theresienwiese, everything is better than it seemed.
Almost everyone is wearing a women&#39;s costume or leather pants; no one looks disgusted or embarrassedly concerned - everything is completely normal.
Only my apron reaps the strange looks at the chocolate banana stand.
One Munich woman warns me that I tied her up badly: &quot;On the left you are free, in the middle a virgin, on the right entered, widowed on the back.&quot;
I secretly toss the bow from back to left.
&quot;Okay,&quot; he says, laughing.
Others do not deal much with subtle flirting techniques and wear simple felt hats with the words &quot;To drunk to get dressed!&quot; and they poke naked asses at passersby.
A young man with such exhibitionist tendencies is called Bob, he is from England and he came to Oktoberfest for the first time.
He finds it &quot;gorgeous&quot;, with an extended &quot;óóó&quot;.
He tells me this after he was relieved by the drink he had just drunk.
Right next to one of those hydrants everyone thinks are trash cans.
Bob is therefore one of the dreaded &quot;Wildbieslers&quot;, as people who urinate freely in public are called in Bavaria.
Others are unlucky enough to get rid of alcohol this way.
Around eight in the evening, swarms of medics run around the area where the Oktoberfest takes place, who have to take care of poor drinkers.
Paramedics always appear in flocks - in four they carry covered stretchers from tent to tent.
They work like most beer meadow visitors: empty there, full back again.
Who is lying under the tarpaulin of this coffin of perile is not visible.
&quot;It&#39;s the one you can&#39;t go on,&quot; one of the paramedics calls me in response to my question and disappears into the crowd.
After the defeat in the vote
Fear is spreading on Wall Street.
The first reports of the sinking of the rescue package caused the Dow Jones index to drop by as much as 700 points.
It was the biggest point loss in a single day in its history.
Later, the Dow gained something again.
Around 8.30 pm, this world&#39;s most important stock market barometer showed a five percent drop to 10,579 units.
The Nasdaq Technology Exchange was down 1548 points with more than seven percent.
The worst off in Dow at the moment was American Express, which lost nearly 14 percent, and Bank of America, which was losing about twelve percent.
None of the titles could strengthen.
Shares of Goldman Sachs lost almost ten percent.
Until a few days ago, large investor Warren Buffett had a stake in this company.
As part of the rescue plan, funds are to be made available for the purchase of so-called corrupt mortgage securities.
However, the entire amount should not be paid out at once, but in several stages.
In return, the state should receive stock options from financial companies, which could be repaid if the exchange rate develops favorably, which would reduce the burden on the state budget.
Stock prices in Europe are falling sharply
Billions in aid to banks in Europe and the United States do not relieve investors of their doubts.
The share price of the large German bank Hypo Real Estate is falling sharply, pulling the Dax index with it.
The US Dow Jones index is losing despite the planned rescue of the financial market by the state.
The spectacular exchange rate losses of Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank pushed the German stock index (Dax) deep into the red.
The shares of the aforementioned Munich real estate financier lost up to three quarters of their value despite the rescue action of the federal government and private banks, Commerzbank lost more than 20 percent.
Dax clearly slipped below the psychologically important 6,000-point mark and minus 3.7 percent, scoring 5,839 points.
Stock markets around the world went to their knees.
In New York, the trading day on Wall Street began with significant losses.
Investors fear that the US government&#39;s $ 700 billion rescue package may not be enough to revive financial markets.
The Dow lost 334 points, or 3.3 percent, during the first hour of trading, up 10,809.25 points.
The US House of Representatives is due to vote on the rescue plan, and the Senate could comment on October 1.
Other European exchanges were moving in only one direction: in London, the FTSE index first weakened by 3.2 percent, the CAC-40 in Paris lost 2.9 percent.
In Asia, Japan&#39;s leading Nikkei index fell 1.26 percent to 11,743.61 units after initial gains.
In Hong Kong, the Hang-Seng index fell 2.1 percent to 18,286.90 points.
In India, the leading Sensex index lost 506.43 points, or 3.9 percent, and traded at 12,595.75.
In MDAx, Arcandor shares lost after the announcement of the share capital increase.
Private bank Sal. Oppenheim subscribed for 23 million new shares.
The business and tourism group also announced that it would not sell its shares in Thomas Cook.
Dark matter affects the flight of space probes
For years, scientists have not been able to cope with one mysterious phenomenon: dark matter affects the speed of space probes during a so-called swing-by maneuver.
Experts fear that Albert Einstein&#39;s general theory of relativity might not be entirely correct.
The &quot;Ulysses&quot; spacecraft flew through space for almost 18 years.
She is now in danger of dying from the cold due to fuel lines that will soon freeze.
One mysterious phenomenon has been causing confusion among scientists for years - the gravitational sling anomaly.
A gravitational slingshot is an aerial maneuver of space probes in which they gain additional momentum in the gravitational field of a cosmic body, such as the Earth.
As a result, the probes can save a lot of fuel.
The European-American Cassini-Huygens research probe used this physical trick in the same way as the Ulysses solar probe.
But what the scientist has been wondering for years in this case: flying bodies do not behave one hundred percent as one would expect under the good old law of gravity.
On the contrary, there are irregularities in speed.
The probes accelerate or decelerate unexpectedly.
So far, physicists have not been able to explain this effect.
He was christened the Gravity Slingshot Anomaly.
Several experts fear that perhaps even Albert Einstein&#39;s general theory of relativity, which describes the attraction of matter by the curvature of space, might not be entirely correct.
American physicist Stephen Adler of the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton remains convinced that Einstein was right, and tries to explain the gravitational slingshot anomaly using so-called dark matter, which astronomers have discovered in space.
&quot;Dark matter, which could also be very close to Earth, could be responsible for this anomaly,&quot; he writes.
The existence of dark matter has only been known to space researchers for about ten years.
It is the source of the gravitational force, the effect of which on other cosmic bodies can be observed.
On the contrary, it itself is completely invisible, which means that it does not emit or reflect any electromagnetic radiation, not even visible light.
According to scientists&#39; calculations, a good fifth of the total mass of the universe is from this dark matter.
In Egypt, abducted tourists are at large
After ten days in the hands of their captors, according to the Italian foreign minister, tourists are kidnapped in Egypt again.
The kidnappers from Sudan demanded a ransom of several million euros.
It is said that six kidnappers were killed in a shootout before release.
Five Germans were abducted in southern Egypt.
Negotiations on the ransom are said to be underway.
The Germans have repeatedly become the target of kidnappers.
WELT ONLINE brings you the most important cases.
European tourists brought to the Sahara appear to be free.
Egyptian state television, the Arab television station Al-Arabiya and the Italian media reported similarly.
According to reports by the Italian television station Sky TG 24, Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release: &quot;Our fellow citizens and other hostages have been released.
We&#39;re checking their health, &quot;Frattini said.
According to a report by Egyptian state television, five Germans, five Italians and one Romanian, as well as their eight Egyptian guides, are safe and secure.
All 19 participants in the desert expedition appear to be on their way to Cairo.
The background to the shootings before the hostages were released remains unclear: according to an Egyptian security guard, the kidnappers were ready to end the kidnapping before the Sudanese army surprisingly killed six kidnappers.
&quot;The problem was solved.
They agreed to the ransom, &quot;said the quoted worker.
It is said that &quot;it was just a matter of taking hostages,&quot; when suddenly &quot;this surprise&quot; came.
Sudanese troops shot dead six kidnappers and captured two on Sunday in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt.
The kidnappers demanded a ransom of six million euros from Germany; the money was to be handed over by the German wife of one of the hostages.
The daily &quot;El Masri El Jom&quot;, referring to one of the German intermediaries, stated that the release of the hostages was delayed because the kidnappers were afraid for their safety.
According to the report, the kidnappers wanted to release a female hostage after paying a ransom.
The men were to be held until the kidnappers had a safe escape route.
The German embassy in Cairo declined to comment on the report.
Police released the name of the accident victim
The name of a 66-year-old woman who died in hospital after being hit by a car in Essex was published.
An accident on Shenfield Road in Brentwood on Friday afternoon affected Carole Paulson from Chelmsford Road there.
She was taken to Queen&#39;s Hospital in Romford, but later died.
A 51-year-old man was arrested after the accident on suspicion of reckless driving.
He has already been released on police bail.
Abuse by stepfather &quot;led to suicide&quot;
Several years of abuse by her stepfather led the woman to kill herself, it was heard in court.
Fifty-seven-year-old Michael Trerise of Stithians, Cornwall, was sentenced to six years after confessing to eight cases of sexual harassment.
The Crown Court in Truro heard that he regularly tied up his stepdaughter Stephanie Randle when she was between five and seven years old.
&quot;I feel responsible for her death,&quot; Trerise wrote in a confession.
The court was also told that Miss Randle had killed herself at her home in Mutley, Plymouth on April 1, 2007, at the age of 34.
When she lived in Coventry as a child, Trerise tied her up and blindfolded her and subsequently sexually abused her while her mother worked in a pub.
Trerise and his wife divorced in the 1980s and returned to Cornwall.
His stepdaughter went to Plymouth.
However, the court said that Miss Randle, who had spent a significant part of her time volunteering for the National Trust, was haunted by the specter of abuse that had been perpetrated on her twice a week.
Prosecutor Ramsey Quaife said in court that in 2006, friends of Miss Randle, who was also very involved in surfing and cycling, said she was &quot;emotionally dead&quot; and &quot;gave up her life.&quot;
In April 2007, her real father, Terrance Randle, found her dead in her Plymouth apartment.
She is believed to have suffocated with a plastic bag.
Randle stood face to face with his daughter&#39;s stepfather, who wrote a confession that ended with the words, &quot;I tied her up and blindfolded her.
&quot;I did not abuse her.
I feel responsible for her death. &quot;
Judge Christopher Elwen told Treris: &quot;You are an extremely strange fetishist and it must have been awful for your victim when she was only seven years old.
&quot;This unpleasant story ends with the victim taking her own life.
Even more terrible is the fact that if she did not do so, the case would probably not get to court at all. &quot;
&quot;I would especially like to emphasize the consequences that, according to Stephanie&#39;s parents, your crime has had on their daughter over the years,&quot; he added.
&quot;Apparently otherwise, she would probably be a promising, successful and happy young woman.&quot;
The official who lost the data will be charged
The BBC has learned that a government official who left top-secret documents on a train in June will be charged under state secrets law.
The man in question left two top-secret documents on a train at Waterloo when he was temporarily assigned to the Department of Defense.
The documents fell into the hands of the BBC before being handed over to the police.
It is the least serious offense against the said law and there is no indication of a criminal intent.
BBC Defense correspondent Frank Gardner said such a move would be surprising to many in Whitehall.
&quot;They probably thought the matter was being handled internally between the ministry and the Office of the Government,&quot; he said.
An employee who may not be appointed is charged under section 8.1 of the law in question, which is a clause dealing with the protection of information.
The Crown Prosecutor recommended that the Metropolitan Police prosecute the official on the grounds of the very sensitive nature of his work in the Joint Intelligence Committee.
The documents he forgot contained secret analyzes of al-Qaeda and the capabilities of Iraqi security forces.
He was informed of the decision on Monday morning and was moved from his home to an unknown location.
Credit unions face B&amp;B debt
British credit unions may have to deal with a debt of more than £ 80 million after rescuing Bradford &amp; Bingley.
The government has provided £ 14 billion in deposit protection to 2.6 million clients at Bradford &amp; Bingley.
The interest on this loan will be repaid by all companies that take client deposits, including 59 credit unions.
Adrian Coles, CEO of the Association of Credit Unions (BSA), said it was &quot;humbling&quot; that credit unions and their members had to pay.
The $ 14 billion debt will eventually be repaid by saving the Bradford &amp; Bingley mortgages.
However, the interest that accrues in the meantime will be repaid each year by all 700 financial companies that take client deposits.
The BBC Compensation Plan for Financial Services has confirmed that all 59 credit unions are included in this number.
It is humbling that these institutions, which have been prudent ... now have to pay some of the bills of those institutions that were far from
Adrian Coles, BSA
He said that each company should pay in proportion to the deposits it held, and that credit unions should pay about 18% of the price.
The Treasury estimates that interest on debt will rise to £ 450 million in 2009.
This means that credit unions will have to find £ 81 million to pay the first year&#39;s interest.
Adrian Coles, CEO of the Credit Union Business Association, told the BBC he believed it was not fair.
&quot;It is humiliating that those institutions that were prudent during the housing boom now have to pay some bills from those institutions that were far from prudent.&quot;
According to the BSA, no bank has fallen since they appeared in 1945.
&quot;We will have to examine all aspects of this matter over the next few weeks to see what the options are for protecting credit unions and their members from an account that could be material,&quot; Cole added.
The interest due in 2009 covers seven months from the end of September this year to the end of March.
In 2010, interest will be payable for the whole year and it could be almost twice as much.
Because credit unions are mutual organizations without shareholders, this account will eventually be paid by their members through higher fees or lower interest rates on their accounts.
Turkey&#39;s diplomatic horizons are expanding
Long before Turkey began trying to join the European Union, European powers longed to penetrate deep into Turkey&#39;s confines.
On the east bank of the Bosphorus, perhaps just twenty paces in Asia, stands one of the best monuments to this failed imperial ambition.
The Hydarpaša railway station was designed by two German architects, Otto Ritter and Helmut Con, in the Neo-Renaissance style.
So the tourist guides will tell you.
The building sits astride at the end of the platforms with a tower on each corner of the façade, at a sight indistinguishable from some German provincial town hall.
The stone is dirty.
The whole building is slowly falling apart.
But once one gets inside the arched box office, one can no longer doubt the size of the enterprise whose westernmost gateway was the station.
The station was opened in August 1908 by the German consortium Anatolia-Baghdad Corporation.
Germany, which was late in the game of empires, intended to realize its ambition to control the Middle East with this railway, which was to lead to Damascus, Baghdad and beyond in what is now Saudi Arabia.
But German imperial ambitions collapsed during World War I.
Their dormitories were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his irregular units.
The relative isolation from the surrounding territories, created by the frozen borders of the Cold War, is gone
British and colonial troops advanced from Egypt and expelled the Turks and their German allies from Palestine and Syria.
And bad news came for Hydarpaša station as well.
In 1917, an explosion of an ammunition train destroyed its elaborate roof.
Turkish sources say it was sabotage.
Since then, it has gradually crumbled and history is bypassing it.
Today, however, this gateway to Anatolia and further east serves - at least symbolically - to highlight the expanding horizons of Turkish diplomacy.
The ruling Justice and Development Party - the AKP - has created a completely new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation from the surrounding territories, created by the frozen borders of the Cold War, is gone.
A new policy is now in place - Turkey is engaging.
It is noteworthy that the Turkish Government has good relations with Israel and Syria, with the Palestinian factions Hamas and Fatah, with Iraq and Iran, and of course with the European Union and the United States.
In order to review the parameters of this new policy, I boarded a night train to the Turkish capital Ankara, where I was to meet one of the AKP&#39;s leading foreign policy experts, Turkish MP Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning - about ten and a half hours later - after a jerky ride on the tracks, reminiscent of the old-world rhythms of the famous Night Mail, I arrived in the Turkish capital, designed as a new city for a secular state that wants to turn its back on its Ottoman past.
However, the AKP, with its well-known Islamist roots, represents a paradigm shift in the Turkish consensus.
She aroused suspicion in the west, especially in Washington.
A taxi drove me to AKP&#39;s main tent, an state-of-the-art stone and metal building deliberately built in a thriving suburb, surrounded by semi-detached department stores and power shops, where middle managers in business suits - men and women - meet to do early morning business. .
Suat Kiniklioglu could easily be a center-right politician from almost every other European political party.
Jacket, tie, I&#39;m sure he had a Blackberry, too.
&quot;The goal of the party &#39;s foreign policy is to reintegrate Turkey into its immediate vicinity.
The Cold War was an anomaly, &quot;he told me.
Turkey has been cut off from its confines.
Today he has to look east and west at the same time.
It was no choice.
He had to do both.
&quot;But there will definitely be a time,&quot; I asked, &quot;when will Turkey have to decide?&quot;
&quot;Turkey,&quot; he said, &quot;did not want such a decision to be made.&quot;
He then emphasized what almost everyone I spoke to here said almost by heart: Turkey&#39;s relations not only with the Middle East but also with the Caucasus and the Black Sea region are as beneficial to Europe and the United States as to Turkey.
With Turkey on board, it seems that Europe as a whole can, metaphorically speak, follow these tracks east to Asia and the Middle East.
Back at Hydarpaša Station, after another mostly sleepless night, I thought of the two German gentlemen, Herr Ritter and Herr Con,, who watched the building be built a hundred years ago.
How surprised they would be to find that European ambitions in the Middle East could now be, for the most part, in Turkish hands.
And while I was waiting in the port for the ferry back across the Bosphorus, I remembered that in those days Turkey was called the &quot;sick man of Europe&quot;.
So, at least then, there seems to be little doubt as to which continent should be entitled to this fascinating country.
Milk will increase in price by five pence per liter
People in Jersey may have to pay more for milk.
Jersey Dairy has announced that it will increase the wholesale price of its milk by five pence per liter from Monday.
This is the second rise in prices this year, after a two-penny rise in February, and comes after research conducted by a consulting company.
Retailers have to decide for themselves whether they want to reflect the increase in customer prices.
Prior to the February increase, the wholesale price of Jersey milk last changed in 2002.
Deposit for Bangladeshi ex-prime minister denied
A Bangladeshi court has rejected former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina Vajid&#39;s bail, meaning she could be arrested if she returns home.
Her lawyers said the court refused to release her on bail on allegations that she had extorted over fifty million ($ 729,700) from a businessman when she was prime minister.
The case is one of several allegations of corruption against it.
Khalida Ziya, a longtime political rival of Sheikh Hasina, was released on bail earlier this month.
Sheikh Hasina is due to return to Bangladesh within the next few weeks, but her party, the People&#39;s League (Awami League), has demanded that the local army-held government first give her complete freedom.
The correspondents say that while she was released on parole to undergo medical treatment abroad, it is not clear under the terms of her release whether she will remain at large when she returns to Bangladesh.
Her lawyers say she will now appeal the Supreme Court&#39;s order to the Supreme Court.
&quot;The High Court has rejected Sheikh Hasina&#39;s bail application, saying she does not need bail when she is already undergoing examinations released on affidavit abroad,&quot; said her lawyer, Rafique-ul Huq.
&quot;We will appeal against the High Court&#39;s order.&quot;
Her lawyers said she needed bail to return to the country from abroad to prepare for the December elections.
A senior People&#39;s League official said Sheikh Hasina was to return home after October 17.
She was detained last year after an army-held caretaker government took power, but was released from prison in June for medical treatment abroad.
Sheikh Hasina and Khalida Ziya both reject all charges against each other.
Fear of polio vaccination in Afghanistan
According to the UN, almost 200,000 children did not take part in the recent universal vaccination against polio due to Taliban-related violence.
The UN carried out vaccinations in six provinces last week.
However, she says she could not reach the children in the south in parts of Helmand and Kandahar for security reasons.
A UN spokesman said that this was despite Taliban promises not to attack or prevent thousands of vaccine workers from working.
BSkyB lost a lawsuit over ITV
BSkyB has lost a lawsuit reviewing a decision of the Competition Commission ordering the company to reduce its stake in a competing broadcaster, ITV.
The Competition Court of Appeal ordered BSkyB to reduce its stake in ITV from 17.9% to below 7.5%.
The Commission previously stated that BSkyB&#39;s share thwarted competition and gave the company a disproportionate influence over ITV.
BSkyB bought a stake in 2006 in a deal that prevented NTL, now renamed Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Fair Trading Office announced that the acquisition of a stake in ITV by BSkyB raised doubts about ITV&#39;s independence and called on the Competition Commission to open an investigation.
Virgin consortium chief Sir Richard Branson, consumer organization and Ofcom regulator were all against the purchase.
BSkyB argued that the forced reduction of its stake in ITV was unreasonable and disproportionate as a solution - mainly because BSkyB had previously said it was willing to give up its voting rights.
A new investigation into the affair of American lawyers
The U.S. Attorney General has appointed a special prosecutor to investigate the dismissal of nine U.S. attorneys in 2006.
The move came when a report on an affair prepared by the chief inspector of the Ministry of Justice criticized the activities of government officials.
The report criticized White House officials, lawmaker and former Justice Minister Albert Gonzalez.
The investigation was fueled by fears that lawyers had been removed for political reasons.
Special Prosecutor Nora Dannehy will now investigate whether officials questioned during the investigation lied to investigators in order to thwart justice.
Inspector General Glenn Fine said in a report: &quot;Serious allegations, including potential criminal activity, have not been fully investigated or explained.&quot;
The appointment of a special prosecutor with the power to compel witnesses to testify was one of his key recommendations.
The dispute began when the US Department of Justice removed nine US lawyers in December 2006.
At the time, the ministry said the lawyers had been fired for poor performance.
However, it later emerged that the dismissed lawyers were not rated any worse than many of their colleagues, leading many observers to conclude that the dismissal was politically motivated.
Some lawyers have been involved in prosecuting high-ranking Republican MPs and senators, while others have refused to investigate allegations of deception of voters against Democrats.
U.S. attorneys investigate and prosecute lawsuits on behalf of the government.
They may be released at any time, but may not be removed for political reasons.
The then head of the Ministry of Justice, Minister Alberto Gonzales, came under fire due to his dismissal and eventually resigned.
A number of other Justice Department officials also resigned.
The Inspector General&#39;s report was very critical of Gonzales&#39; role in the affair, saying he had &quot;primary responsibility&quot; for the dismissal, that he had &quot;abdicated&quot; from his leadership position, and that he had not &quot;been remarkably involved&quot;.
Other officials, including former senior Bush adviser Karel Rove, have been criticized for not cooperating in the investigation.
Meat Loaf&#39;s masterpiece will be awarded
Rock star Meat Loaf will receive one of the Q Awards for his epic anthem Bat Out Of Hell.
The singer, who will come to the ceremony next weekend for his special gold award in London, said that he was &quot;honored&quot; by the recognition.
The song, which lasts nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title track on Meat Loaf&#39;s 1977 hit album.
This year&#39;s nomination is led by the Coldplay group, which was shortlisted in four categories.
Paul Rees, editor-in-chief of Q Magazine, said, &quot;There are some songs that stand out like things like time and genre, and Bat Out Of Hell is definitely one of them.&quot;
The song, written by Jim Steinman, needed great vocals provided by Meat Loaf.
It started with the instrumental part, which lasted almost two minutes.
The song was released in Britain in 1979 as a single and peaked at number 15.
But Meat Loaf&#39;s Bat Out Of Hell album has been on the charts for about nine years, selling more than 40 million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf - real name Marvin Lee Aday - has suffered from health problems in recent years, and in 2003 he was operated on for an irregular heartbeat after collapsing on stage.
In 2007, acute laryngitis forced him to cancel concerts.
He later turned out to have a cyst on his vocal cords.
Obscure street, often forgotten and maybe soon for sale
The city of New York has thousands of roads, streets, highways and other roads, some famous, others only commercial.
But many veteran taxi drivers and longtime locals have difficulty finding Extra Place, mostly because they&#39;ve never heard of it.
This tiny alley is in the East Village and leads north from First Street - without reaching Second Street - between Bowery and Second Avenue.
With a width of about ten and a length of forty meters, it resembles a dusty passage rather than a traffic lane.
There are no street signs.
It is practically invisible in a normal atlas.
Nevertheless, the alley has admirers.
For example, Avalon Bay, a developer of recently built luxury buildings on First Street.
It wants to pave the New Place and create a cleaner passage to the shops and boutiques to be opened in the new buildings.
Other admirers are long-time neighbors who say they were enchanted by the shortened alley simply because it was one of the last remnants of the time before the block was refined.
However, the city&#39;s Office for the Protection and Development of Buildings, which has the street in its power, has not the slightest interest in adhering to it.
At a meeting of the municipal community&#39;s land committee, representatives of the city council and Avalon Bay outlined a plan for the developer to buy the street.
However, according to Suzan Stetzer, district manager of the Municipal Community 3, the committee favors a option where the street remains in the hands of the city and has asked for a new plan, which should be submitted next month.
&quot;The city already owns very little land, and we would like Extra Place to remain its property,&quot; she said.
&quot;Proposals could be made for repair and administration, which Avalon could do, but we also want to guarantee public accessibility.&quot;
Avalon Bay announced a few months ago that it wants to pave a new street and install seating, several of which would be used by a café, which the developer expects to be interested in renting space.
The idea that Avalon Bay could buy the street was first announced at a meeting this month.
Michele de Milly, a spokeswoman for Avalon Bay, said that although the company wanted to use the street, it did not necessarily own it.
&quot;The main intention of Avalon Bay is to repair this desolate alley and make it a beautiful place for the public,&quot; she said, adding that the sale was proposed by the city.
Seth Donlin, a spokesman for the Conservation Authority, said the city really wanted to sell the street, noting that his office&#39;s job was to develop rather than manage the property.
Compared to its more colorful neighbor, Bowery, Extra Place has left a shallow mark on history.
Some people think that the street got its name in 1802, when Philip Minthorn&#39;s large farm was divided among several of his children and no one claimed that narrow strip of land.
The back door of the CBGB, a punk rock monument that closed in 2006, led to Extra Place, and the alley is perhaps best known as the background of the photo on the cover of Ramones&#39; album &quot;Rocket to Russia&quot;.
&quot;The place was amazing,&quot; said Danny Fields, Ramones&#39; manager, who took the picture in November 1976.
&quot;It was full of garbage, torn clothes, and pieces of barrels, posters, leaves, and ropes.&quot;
Some locals, including bloggers who write about the refinement of the East Village, oppose the idea of selling Extra Place, arguing that the piece of public property, albeit meager, should remain public.
Others see Extra Place as a rarity - an almost unchanged piece of the city that should be left as it is.
Jeremiah Moss, who writes a blog called Jeremiah&#39;s Disappearing New York (subtitled &quot;The Wailing Book: A Bitterly Nostalgic View of the City in the Extinction Process&quot;), posted part of the Extra Place story from the Talk About the City section of The New Yorker in in 1952.
The author of the article, Brendan Gill, wrote: &quot;Extra Place is a narrow dead end, dark even during the day and bordered by rusty iron warehouse gates and hammered windows where a week-old newspaper runs in the ditches.&quot;
With a few exceptions, the alley looked exactly the same one recent evening.
The rat ran across the dead end of the street near the door that once led to the CBGB, which is now home to an expensive clothing store.
There was graffiti on the walls, and an empty beer bottle lay next to a fresh batch of discarded newspapers.
A couple of passers-by said they seldom thought of Extra Place, but suggested that a boost might be useful.
Fields, on the other hand, said he thought some people underestimated the impact of the alley in its current state.
&quot;The best years of my life,&quot; he said, &quot;were in dark, damp, and disgusting places.&quot;
The bilingual debate: immersion in English
In this issue of Focus on Education, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi will discuss candidates&#39; attitudes toward bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, a California academic and director of education at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, co-authored &quot;Worse Than You Think: Why the Middle Class Needs to Choose Schools.&quot;
Reaching Hispanic voters effectively is a tricky business.
Barack Obama&#39;s educational agenda just proves it.
The Obama campaign notes that &quot;African-American and Hispanic students are significantly less likely to graduate than white students,&quot; which is true.
To combat such performance disparities, Obama&#39;s education agenda particularly promotes, among other things, &quot;transitional bilingual education&quot; for those who are still learning English.
However, the question for Barack Obama remains whether his commitment to bilingual education, which emphasizes the use of languages other than English in the classroom, is no stronger than his interest in reducing performance gaps.
Take Sixth Street Prep, a charter elementary school in East Los Angeles County, for example.
The students of this school are in the vast majority of cases Hispanics from low-income families.
More than a third of students, many of whom have only recently arrived, are still learning English.
Nevertheless, in the state mathematics tests in 2008, an incredible one hundred percent of fourth-grade students reached the highest level.
Nearly as many as ninety-three percent of fourth-grade students made it to the highest levels in state tests in English and literature.
This incredible success has been achieved by a different method than that preferred by Obama.
Sixth Street emphasizes control and practice, constant assessment of abilities, and an excuse-free approach.
Furthermore, and Obama should note this, according to Linda Mikels, director of Sixth Street, the school&#39;s pedagogical approach for those who are just learning English is &quot;complete immersion.&quot;
Immersion in English emphasizes the almost privileged use of English in teaching.
Miss Mikels, who opposes bilingual education, told me: &quot;We have had tremendous success with one brand new student from Mexico - after twelve months you would enter the classroom and not know who it is.&quot;
&quot;It works,&quot; she said, &quot;it works for us.&quot;
Would Obama take a school like Sixth Street Prep as a model for what other schools with large proportions of Hispanic and English learners should look like?
The school&#39;s results should make the answer to this question a matter of course, but its own party&#39;s educational agenda (the National Education Association has been a longtime supporter of bilingual education) and its own consistent support for bilingual education obscure Obama&#39;s prediction.
While Obama agrees that immigrants should learn English, he recently trivialized the matter by saying that people should stop worrying about &quot;English only&quot; laws.
Instead, &quot;you should make sure your kids speak Spanish,&quot; he said.
If Obama really wants to close the performance gap, he should think carefully about the educational patterns that work, rather than make fun of them and trivialize them.
Oil is falling sharply due to renewed economic concerns
Oil prices fell sharply on Monday on fears that even a US plan to rescue financial markets might not revive the economy.
Oil futures prices fell as much as 7 percent to $ 99.80 a barrel in morning trading on the New York Commodity Exchange.
Prices have fallen by more than $ 20 a barrel since last Monday.
Over the past two weeks, commodity markets have been shaken by financial unrest on Wall Street and also by a pair of strong hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After reaching a peak of $ 145.29 per barrel in July, prices fell to almost $ 90 per barrel earlier this month, after which they jumped on the wave of tremendous financial market uncertainty.
Anxiety gripped investors again on Monday, even after the congressional presidency announced that it had reached an agreement over the weekend on the largest rescue plan in history.
The report was overshadowed by recent concerns that the financial crisis is far from over.
In the latest episode of the ongoing disintegration, the government announced that Citigroup would buy a banking division of Wachovia Corporation.
Meanwhile, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partially nationalized the European financial conglomerate Fortis.
Barclays Capital analysts said the frantic weekend talks that led to the plan to save the economy &quot;are proving incapable of reviving market sentiment.&quot;
As the economic situation deteriorates, demand for commodities, including oil, is expected to decline.
&quot;The outlook for global equity, interest rate and exchange rate markets is highly uncertain,&quot; Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a report to investors.
&quot;We believe that commodities will not be able to escape the disease.
From a commodity perspective, our biggest concern is the extent to which the American virus will spread throughout the world, and especially to China. &quot;
The bank&#39;s analysts lowered their expectations for next year as oil consumption fell due to slower economic growth and reduced their gasoline price forecasts for 2009 by about 20%.
The wild ride in the second quarter broke the team&#39;s record
After spending more in the Jets jersey in the last eight seasons than anyone else, defensive player Shaun Ellis thought he had seen it all.
Then on Sunday he watched the development of the second quarter, in which the Jets turned a scoreless game into a sleepy ride.
&quot;I&#39;ve never seen anything like it,&quot; Ellis said.
The second quarter began after the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals matched the gloomy clouds above them with their troubled play.
Then quarterback Brett Favre sent Laveranese Coles on a 12-yard touchdown sprint, heralding an afternoon in which their ever-evolving collaboration moved a mile ahead.
Favre sent Coles behind the other two touchdowns this quarter, including the one in which the cornerback fell, and another 10 seconds before halfway through the game.
&quot;It was nothing special,&quot; Favre told Coles of all his passes.
&quot;He&#39;s a damn good player.
We communicated well, no matter what people thought. &quot;
While Favre and Coles threw, the defense attacked Cardinals quarterback Kurt Warner.
Cornerback Darelle Revis caught a stray throw and returned it 32 yards for a touchdown.
Safety Eric Smith picked up another pass and caught it.
Linebacker David Bowens forced Warner to win.
The last loss of the ball, the fumble that Bowens forced, was perhaps the best ever.
The Cardinals got to the ball 10 seconds before the end, and after the Jets got the ball back, Jay Feely kicked a 20-yard goal from the field, giving him a 34-0 lead.
That&#39;s the most the Jets have ever won in a quarter.
Jets coach Eric Mangini, when asked to describe the madness, said, &quot;Second quarter or third quarter?&quot;
When he was told that both - the Jets allowed 21 unanswered points in the third quarter - Mangini said: &quot;I can tell you that I enjoyed the second quarter much more than the third.
Many points were scored in a short period of time. &quot;
The rested Gebreselassie improved his world record
Ethiopia&#39;s Haile Gebreselassie has once again shown why many consider him the best long-distance runner ever, breaking his own world record on Sunday in the Berlin Marathon to become the first person to run a 26.2-mile race in under two hours and four minutes.
With a victory on a pleasantly flat track in 2:03:59, he rolled over his previous time of 2:04:26 by 27 seconds, which he ran last year in Berlin.
Gebreselassie, 35, has set the 26th world record of his career, which is truly incredibly broad - breaking a world record or at least being world champion at all distances from metric miles to marathons.
Last month, Gebreselassie missed the Beijing Olympic marathon because he feared - perhaps in the back, too frightened - that polluted air would irritate his asthma problems.
Instead, he promised to run in Berlin.
In almost perfect conditions - sunny and 48 degrees at the start, 55 degrees at the finish - Gebreselassie won on Sunday with a lightning-fast average of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile.
As track runners such as Gebreselassie and Paul Tergat from Kenya focused on longer tracks, the marathon record fell by more than two minutes in the last decade, since Ronaldo da Costa from Brazil won in Berlin at 2:06:05 a year. 1998
After Sunday&#39;s victory, Gebreselassie told reporters that he had cramps in his calf two weeks ago and missed a week of training.
The break obviously woke him up rather than delayed him.
&quot;I&#39;m so happy,&quot; Gebreselassie told reporters.
&quot;Everything was perfect.
I started again a week ago and I was a little in doubt today, but everything was fine. &quot;
He was also criticized - especially in Kenya, Ethiopia&#39;s East African rival - for allegedly over-planning his races, generally avoiding world marathons, relying on drivers as if it were a track race, and setting world records above the sense of competition.
But this criticism can hardly diminish Gebreselassie&#39;s enormous running qualities.
Kept at the pace by four Kenyans, Gebreselassie reached half in 1:02:04.
After the drivers dropped out, Gebreselassie was constantly chased by two elite Kenyan runners, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi.
Just before three miles before the finish, Gebreselassie took the last time and ran away from Kwambai, who then finished in second place in 2:05:36, improving his personal maximum by almost five minutes.
Kamathi finished third in 2:07:48.
In the women&#39;s race, Irina Mikitěnková, a native of Kazakhstan who is now a German citizen, ended an excellent year with the seventh fastest time in history.
Record time 2:15:25 is held by Paula Radcliff of Great Britain.
The 36-year-old Mikitěnková surprisingly won last spring in the London Marathon in a time of 2:24:14.
She missed the Beijing Games because of what was described as a back injury, but recovered and won in Berlin and improved her personal maximum by almost five minutes in the third marathon she ever ran.
She ran the race cleverly and thoughtfully: she let the four Ethiopian and Kenyan runners run to a big lead and then caught up with them after about 18 miles.
Askale Tafa Magarsa of Ethiopia finished second in 2:21:31 and Helene Kiprop of Kenya finished third in 2:25:01.
Pride and obstacles in the life of blacks in a separate city
Tucked away among the sprawling theme parks of Greater Orlando, a few miles from everything shiny, noisy and huge, lies a quiet city where the pride and sophistication of African American life comes to life.
Eatonville, the first completely black town to be incorporated into the state and where Zora Neale Hurston spent her childhood, is no longer as simple as she described it in 1935: &quot;a town of five lakes, three croquet courts, three hundred brown skins, three hundred good swimmers, plenty of guava, two schools and no prisons. &quot;
Now it is a place of pilgrimage.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee came to the annual Eatonville Zora! Festival to pay tribute to Hurston, Harlem&#39;s most famous female writer.
The city she described remains aside, even though it has made it a tourist stop by including it in a Florida tourist guide created by the Federal Writers project during the economic crisis.
It is still as independent, dignified, and private as it was in the 1930s, when Hurston wrote that rural blacks in Florida often resisted and did not share their true feelings with a white man who &quot;knows so little about us that he doesn&#39;t even know what he&#39;s missing.&quot; . &quot;
Even today, in a year when the black presidential candidate, Senator Barack Obama, is calling for an open debate on race, many locals remain wary of foreign views.
&quot;We pay close attention to how our story is told,&quot; said Hortense Jones, 59, who has lived here since birth and is a member of the city&#39;s oldest parish.
&quot;It must be right.&quot;
Eatonville has long been characterized as a paradox of triumph and effort.
It is both a historical model of black rise and a community of nearly 2,400 people, where the poverty rate is double the national average.
It is a center of literature, but also an oak-shaded example of southern rural black culture - sometimes despised, sometimes praised - that arose from American slavery.
Not surprisingly, the locals are both proud and conservationist.
And worries about the idea of Eatonville really only started with Zora, which is the only way the Hurstons are called here.
She introduced her hometown to the world through heartfelt dialect books such as &quot;Mules and Men&quot; (1935) and &quot;Their Eyes Were Watching God&quot; (1937).
Five paragraphs of a Florida tourist guide have turned the city a short distance into Highway 17, which runs through the often overlooked center of Florida, into a stage for black history and human drama.
With the force of a big drum in life and in literature, Hurston introduced readers to the store of Eatonville&#39;s first mayor, Joe Clark, and then turned to more personal places.
&quot;To the left of the road,&quot; she wrote, &quot;is a white brown ornate modern national school with well-maintained courtyards and playgrounds, always cared for by Howard Miller, even if he can&#39;t read or write much.&quot;
She also mentioned Dash&#39;s widow&#39;s new husband and wrote that Lee Glenn &quot;sells drinks of all kinds and anything that fits into a one-hour hotel.&quot;
So in just a few hundred words, Hurston linked Eatonville to self-government, but also to illiteracy, remarriage, and sex.
This was obviously not a typical Fodor&#39;s publishing house.
In fact, it was not a portrait that everyone would appreciate.
&quot;Zora said it the way it was,&quot; says 90-year-old Ella Dinkins, one of Johnson&#39;s choir girls, who made Hurston immortal by quoting men who sang obscene songs about their beauty.
&quot;Some people didn&#39;t like it,&quot; she added.
Hurston is still remembered here as a nimble eccentric who often returned after her family moved to Jacksonville, Florida.
Seventy-seven-year-old Augustus Franklin recalls that most of the time, when she arrived in the city, she arrived unannounced in a huge Chevrolet, smoking and wearing pants in a city that is still proud of her dignified clothing.
Most residents were fascinated, Franklin said, but many sneered.
&quot;People have always liked to see Zora,&quot; Franklin said.
But, he added, swinging in a chair on the back patio overlooking Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was most likely baptized, &quot;she never stayed too long.&quot;
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were taken out of print.
Eatonville, along with the rest of the world, seemed to have forgotten about her.
Although she was once a literary star, a contemporary of Langston Hughes and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in an unmarked grave in Fort Pierce, Florida, where she had previously lived.
There were no major mourning ceremonies or large public readings in Eatonville.
&quot;I don&#39;t think they understood her significance for the world or her legacy at all,&quot; said Valerie Boyd, author of Hurston &#39;s biography &quot;Wrapped in Rainbows,&quot; published in 2003.
The change came in the 1980s.
Orange County officials wanted to run a five-lane highway through the city instead of Kennedy Boulevard, the local dual carriageway.
The Orlando crawl had already pushed Interstate 4 through the western edge of the city.
The proposal came at a time when Eatonville was still recovering from a difficult historical period.
Forced integration, along with other things, ended the relatively idyllic isolation of this community.
In the 1950s, the struggle for racial mixing brought hatred to the threshold of the community.
&quot;At that time, a bunch of white guys, they came and threw oranges and things at the people sitting on the side,&quot; Franklin said.
&quot;Actually, we had a lady here who killed it.
They threw watermelon out of the car. &quot;
In a 1955 letter to The Orlando Sentinel, Hurston questioned the Supreme Court&#39;s demand for forced integration and said of its decision in the Brown case against the Chamber of Education that it was &quot;offensive to my race rather than glorifying.&quot;
Residents now say that school desegregation, while positive in some areas, has reduced cohesion in Eatonville and undermined the courage of local youth.
&quot;Black kids were used to being hugged - I remember - you hugged your teacher in the morning, you hugged your teacher in the evening,&quot; said NY Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins and executive director of the non-profit group Preserve the Eatonville Community.
That lasted until teachers and students came from the same place, she added.
&quot;You don&#39;t hug your white teacher because your white teacher - I mean, there&#39;s a cultural barrier,&quot; said Miss Nathiri.
Civil rights, however, has helped create space for many other Zory Neale Hurstons - black writers, actors and artists who, like her, have risen above prejudices with reckless self-confidence and quotes such as &quot;How can anyone deny the pleasure of my presence!&quot;
I don&#39;t understand that. &quot;
In 1975, Alice Walker traveled to Hurston&#39;s unmarked grave and began fighting to revive her reputation.
Five years later, the acclaimed biography of Hurston by Robert E. Hemenway came to the shelves of bookstores, and she reinstated her into the American canon.
The highway project arrived just as Eatonville&#39;s most famous daughter found the ramp lights again.
Hurston&#39;s former neighbors now considered her a savior.
To show what could happen to its highway, the community began planning the Hurston Festival in 1988.
Thousands of fans arrived at the inaugural event two years later, and many return every January to celebrate.
After several years, the state withdrew from the highway proposal.
&quot;Those five currents of the highway resurrected, you would say it directly detonated, a real civic pride,&quot; Nathiri said.
Boyd put it more simply: &quot;Zora saved Eatonville.&quot;
The victory over the highway project helped change the image of the city.
Out-of-town people like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who started attending the church in 1993, began to appear in greater numbers, and residents began to rethink the past.
Eatonville joined the National Historical Register in 1998.
A new one-story library (named after Hurston, of course) was opened in 2006 on the asphalted and beautified Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville remains a Florida anomaly: just six miles from downtown Orlando, it can sometimes look like a sunken alley in summer rain, as small as when it was founded with just 27 black families in the 1880s.
(Today, 90 percent are black.)
Strangers who come to look for the story and significance of Eatonville are still often treated with caution.
Permission for most interviews is required in advance, and certain items - such as murals in Eatonville&#39;s oldest church, painted by whites depicting blacks in the fields - are not allowed to be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, such as Jones, a brave, confident teacher who likes deep red, are still worried that their isolated community will not be properly understood.
And as the Hurston Festival grew, so did domestic pride.
Young people in particular tend to see Eatonville as Hurston saw her entire race: beautiful, troubled, and so on, but not better, not worse, and as proud, creative, industrious, foolish, and diverse as other American races and ethnicities.
Franklin&#39;s nephew, 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, has a sincere love for the community as he plans to return to Eatonville after college to work for the local government or the police, which he says would receive some help.
And even younger ones, such as the eleven-year-old twins of Winter Park, Alondra and Alexia Kenon, seem to have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
&quot;Most people, when they just pass through here, think, &#39;Um, this city is nothing compared to the others,&#39;&quot; Alondra Kenon said after church recently on Sunday.
&quot;But if you really stop and look at history for a moment, it&#39;s a very nice city.&quot;
Here in New York, we all speak fluently financially
At first glance, nothing has changed here.
If tourists in Manhattan stayed away from the newsstands and huge TV screens in Times Square, they wouldn&#39;t realize they were in the middle of a storm.
They would never have guessed that in the glass beehive of offices above their heads, bankers and investment fund managers who monopolize New York have the worst &quot;bad day in the office&quot; since the 1929 crisis.
The messengers are still rattling with metal carts on the sidewalks, carrying muffin pans to breakfast meetings.
Hispanics are still moving between the towers, wearing, like human mules, fifty ironed shirts that hang from rockers on their backs.
Office rats are still waiting in line for their morning bagel at street food stalls, and it is still not possible to get a yellow taxi on weekdays between four and seven in the afternoon.
It didn&#39;t look like a crisis at all until, with all the talk of pessimism, I decided to open a savings account on Thursday afternoon.
Even though I timed this task to coincide with a late afternoon siesta at my local JP Morgan Chase branch, about twenty people were already waiting in line.
Not in front of cash registers to pick up or deposit cash, but in front of a counter where older clients order checkbooks, tourists ask for directions to Macy&#39;s general store, and new customers set up accounts.
Most of the people before me, as I learned from Starr, my &quot;licensed personal banker,&quot; came for the same reason I did.
However, in contrast to me, they have already withdrawn their savings from smaller banks in the places where they came from, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania or Staten Island.
They withdrew money from so-called thrifts (somewhat similar to building societies), monetary associations and those types of savings banks whose branches operate in only one state, and which claim to take care of their customers as a family.
Last year, 15 such banks went bankrupt silently.
A few days ago, Washington Mutual, a bank with $ 327 billion in assets, went bankrupt, and as New Yorkers returned home for the weekend of Friday night, another bank, Wachovia, with $ 440 billion in assets, tried to catch a rescue buyer.
Office and shop workers standing in front of me, afraid of further collapse, moved their cash to a bank that is seen as a safe haven and that does most of the rescue on Wall Street.
Ordinary New Yorkers have learned to be fluent in finance over the past week.
A woman in my local Chinese supermarket was talking on the phone, speaking to Lehman Borthers, the bankrupt bank, and her emaciated chief executive, Dick Fuld, with such familiarity as if she were gossiping about a lazy colleague.
And Lyn, the uniformed roughly fifty-year-old housekeeper of my apartment building, changed the subject of our ordinary conversation - Brad, Angelina, or my food delivery.
After my visit to the bank, she told me: &quot;I now have my savings in money market funds.
I moved it, I won&#39;t risk it. &quot;
Memorable Lives: Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes: As a Guildford music director since 1962, Vernon &quot;Tod&quot; Handley (obituary, 9/11) was in charge of the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and Choir.
As part of the district music plan, he founded the excellent youth choir Proteus a year later.
He was supposed to be under 21, but by the time Proteus last sang in 1979, there were almost 30 of us - we simply refused to give up the choir.
The name &quot;Proteus&quot; (mythological changer of shapes) represented the willingness and ability of the choir to play any music presented to it - whether madrigals or Messiaen, either alone or with the whole orchestra.
The musical adaptability created by such a young choir was often stunning, always exciting, all thanks to the inspiration of that one man and the passion for music that remained completely unchanged at all times.
How often has Tod told us to &quot;let the music speak for itself.&quot;
He said: &quot;The composer knows what he wants.
It&#39;s all in that music.
Then sing it! &quot;
His baton technique was perfectly clear and precise, but it was neither dictatorial nor flowery.
Wherever the musical standard was, it always raised it.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If a conductor was to be knighted, it was Vernon Handley.
I knew him well for two decades, when he conducted the Guildford Philharmonic from 1962 to 1982.
I&#39;ve reviewed more than 100 of his concerts in the last 40 years, and I can honestly say that I&#39;ve never been disappointed by any of them - and I&#39;ve been inspired many times.
Tod Handley had such a great combination of size and personal modesty.
He hated conductors who, in his words, simply &quot;pulled one or two soaked stones around the world.&quot;
Many of us will miss it.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
Your obituary William Woodruff (September 25) states that &quot;he returned to economic history in Oxford in 1946 and became a researcher at Houblon-Norman in 1950 ... while studying at BSc, MA and PhD&quot;.
This is based on Woodruff&#39;s author&#39;s note in Beyond Nab End, but it is not accurate.
From 1946 to 1953, he taught economic history at the University of Nottingham, at which time he completed a dissertation on the British rubber industry, led by Professor JD Chambers, and subsequently published it in 1958 as the British Rubber Industry.
He actually spent 1950-51 in America as a researcher at Houblon-Norman and the summer of 1952 at the University of Illinois, Harvard and New York University.
In 1953, he left Nottingham for good and moved to Illinois.
It is not known why Woodruff went through this part of his career.
Muslim graves desecrated after the Austrian right-wing break
Heinz-Christian Strache, left, of the Austrian right-wing Free Party, and Filip Dewinter of the Belgian right-wing Vlaams Belang party are taking part in a demonstration in Antwerp on Thursday, January 17, 2008, &quot;Cities Against Islamization&quot;.
They carry signs similar to traffic signs that show mosques crossed out with a red line.
Police accuse right-wing extremists of desecrating a Muslim cemetery in Austria on the same weekend that far-right parties made huge profits in the general election.
More than 90 graves in the cemetery in the town of Traun near Linz were severely damaged sometime between Friday night and this morning, and police are convinced that it was an organized event.
The culprits spray-painted Jewish symbols on some graves, such as the Star of David, but detectives believe it may have been an attempt to disguise the motives of extremists led by hatred of Muslim immigrants.
It is not clear whether this incident was in any way connected with the elections.
A spokesman for the local Islamic community said they were &quot;deeply shocked&quot; by reports of desecration coming as the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan drew to a close.
Austria, meanwhile, is entering a round of searching for its own soul after swinging to the right in yesterday&#39;s parliamentary elections.
The two far-right parties, which together won more than 30 percent of the vote, the Free Party and the Union for the Future of Austria, led a vehement anti-immigration campaign, and some of their slogans were condemned by critics as xenophobic.
Heinz-Christian Strache, chairman of the Free Party, which won more than 18 percent of the vote, protested against scarves and burqas in the campaign, and even expressed his opposition to foods perceived to be related to Islam.
At the last meeting with voters in Vienna, he spoke of a &quot;European brotherhood&quot; to prevent the rise of Islam.
Both sides are trying to ban the construction of mosques and minarets, arguing that they are political symbols of the ongoing Islamization of Austria and Europe.
Surveys and analyzes carried out immediately after the elections, which put the extreme right in the country&#39;s strongest political bloc, suggest that this change was mainly due to young voters worried about their future in the European Union.
Gary Glitter is not allowed on a trip across the border
Gary Glitter, a glamrock star convicted of child sexual abuse, has been banned from traveling to France and Spain.
Officials imposed the six-month ban on Glitter after informing monitoring authorities that he planned to travel via France to Spain.
The Kent police approved the travel ban last Thursday after handing over evidence to officials of Glitter&#39;s past convictions for child sexual abuse.
Glitter, real name Paul Gadd, did not attend the hearing at Ashford&#39;s Lower Criminal Court in Kent, but was represented by lawyers from Corker Binning.
A spokesman for the judiciary said: &quot;On Thursday, September 25, the Ashford police asked Kent police for an order that would prevent Mr. Paul Gadd from crossing the border into France and Spain until March 25.
Paul Gadd did not attend in person. &quot;
Glitter, 64, informed the authorities that he wished to travel abroad, as required by a record in the register of sexual assailants.
He must notify the authorities if he wishes to travel abroad for more than three days.
He must also pass the scheduled departure date to the police one week in advance.
If he neglected the obligation to inform the authorities, he could be sentenced to five years.
Kent police have said they will not discuss individual cases of Glitter&#39;s possible trips around the district.
A Kent police spokeswoman said: &quot;Kent police will do everything in their power to protect children in this country or abroad.
From our point of view, it is easier to follow someone who stays in Britain, because we have extensive systems here that manage potential dangers more effectively.
Protecting the people of Kent is a top priority for the Kent police, and we are working hard to monitor the behavior of recorded sexual assailants to minimize any danger to the public. &quot;
Glitter returned to Britain last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for abusing two girls between the ages of 10 and 11.
When he was released, he flew to Bangkok, where he was to board a flight to London.
But he said he was not feeling well and refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities did not let him pass passport control and eventually flew to Hong Kong.
Chinese authorities also refused to allow him entry, and he flew back to Bangkok, where Thai police and immigration officials insisted on his return to Britain.
He finally arrived at Heathrow&#39;s Terminal 3 on 22 August and remained there, while his lawyer, David Corker, went to the Uxbridge Lower Criminal Court in West London, while Scotland Yard successfully demanded an order ordering him to register as a sexual assailant.
Glitter was previously imprisoned in the United Kingdom for four months for possession of child pornography.
An Interior Ministry source said Jacqui Smith, the Home Secretary, was calm and glad that Glitter had been prevented from traveling to France and Spain.
&quot;To capture the real character, I take a picture of the master off stage.&quot; Günther Bauer - photographer
No heels, no ruffles or costumes.
Only the essence of the great masters of flamenco, detached from concentrating on interpretation - only then will I achieve a relaxed expression of a man or a woman.
On the one hand, the artist.
On the other - man.
Inseparable, apart from privacy, in those moments far from the audience - then one can see an intimate gesture, the depth of a glimpse or a passionate gesture of hands that are carefree because they are not going to appear on stage.
In &quot;Flamenco-people&quot;, the German Günther Bauer alternates the theatricality of performances with singers, dancers and guitarists with the lesser-known face of the masters.
With this intention, the photographer compiles a unique iconography of flamenco from various backgrounds.
The exhibition, part of the Mes de la Fotografía Flamenca program, &quot;reflects the growing international importance of flamenco,&quot; says the author, explaining that &quot;Flamenco-people&quot; &quot;can be any people, but when you look at the photos , you will find that these are not typical pictures of artists on stage.
These people portrayed &quot;on the street&quot; are artists able to bring passion, sadness, joy to the stage ... and completely captivate the audience.
It is not necessary to take photos on stage to capture the personality of these artists.
He carries his personality and character inside.
I was interested in creating a relaxed atmosphere that will allow me to capture the personality of the greats of flamenco.
Enchanted by the &quot;Cante de las Minas&quot; festival, in 1997 Bauer began a long journey of portraying flamenco singers, guitarists and dancers on a board camera.
These are portraits that, thanks to the choice of camera and material, resemble classic photography.
The use of different stylistic means contradicts the classic basis of the film and lends it a contemporary spirit, which is an idea that flamenco, according to Bauer himself, reflects: &quot;Music with very traditional roots, which, however, continues to surprise and evolve.&quot;
What captivates the audience is not the effect of the dance, singing or play itself, but the personality and character of the artist.
The search for the moment when we meet the most essential, the spirit that manifests itself in the way of perceiving, being and experiencing, has been and is a constant of the work presented during these days in the gallery El Fotómata.
This selection of almost seventy artists photographed is made up of well-known flamenco figures, such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales and Vicente Amigo.
The project has become a kind of anthology of flamenco and will soon have a book edition containing exhibited portraits.
Two years ago, Bauer&#39;s passion for portraiture led to the idea of repeating the idea in &quot;Portraits of Sports Veterans&quot; (&quot;SportARTproject&quot;).
Although their concept is different from &quot;Flamenco-people&quot;, the photographer admits that &quot;taking pictures of people, getting to know them and being able to enter their lives for a moment, whether longer or short - is my passion.
I think that photography is the most difficult genre in photography.
One meets or clashes with people, personalities who sometimes don&#39;t even know, or give him only a few minutes to take pictures.
Despite similar circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to realize my ideas. &quot;
A collection of portraits of contemporary flamenco called &quot;Flamenco-people&quot; is on display in the El Fotómata Gallery at 20 de la Mata, parallel to the Alameda de Hércules, and can be visited until 16 October.
Vargas Llosa admits that the novel he writes is &quot;audacity&quot;
Set in an environment he doesn&#39;t know yet, he tells the story of events unknown to him, yet Mario Vargas Llosa intends to successfully carry out his new project - working on a novel starring Roger Casemant, an Irish nationalist who lived in Congo for 20 years. he also traveled in the Amazon.
An eternal Nobel Prize winner for literature admitted yesterday at the Hay Festival Segovia that the project that is currently employing him &quot;is audacity&quot; and that &quot;everything suggests that I should not write&quot; this novel.
&quot;If I had made sense, I wouldn&#39;t do it, but I will and I believe I will finish it one day,&quot; he concluded at a festival of exchanges of ideas, thoughts and words, which saw four hundred writers, historians and journalists in the aqueduct city in four days. thousands of other people.
The author of the novel &quot;City and Dogs&quot; was one of the main characters of the third year of the word festival and met expectations.
Vargas Llosa, who won the Hay Festival Award for Most Popular Writer - an old edition of Dickens&#39; &quot;Our Mutual Friend&quot; - filled the Juan Bravo Theater to last place.
With Félix Romeo, who introduced him, he had an audience in front of him, an hour of time passed like water - the Peruvian remembered with amazing precision and a good deal of humor how from the original &quot;incredible adventure&quot; in &quot;the pleasure of a passionate reader&quot; and &quot;power&quot; to live more than I have lived &quot;gave birth to a literary mission; how he replaces the &quot;lack of inspiration&quot; by writing &quot;disciplined&quot;, carefully storing the text, correcting and rewriting; or how Faulkner, Victor Hugo, and Alexandre Dumas influenced his writing, and what &quot;memorial images&quot; are the mainstay of his stories.
A Hispano-American novelist has admitted that &quot;there is no way&quot; to find out if and to what extent books can change lives, &quot;but I refuse to believe that literature is just a fun, fleeting experience,&quot; Vargas Llosa said. acts &quot;and&quot; forces them to try to deviate from the ranks &quot;, and urged writers not to&quot; be frivolous &quot;and&quot; take responsibility &quot;for their mission.
Due to climatology, he loses his party in Pozoblanc - there are no spears
The spear performance, which closes the celebration in Pozoblanc, was canceled yesterday morning after the performers&#39; announcement that the surface of the square was not in good condition was confirmed.
That is why the company, together with Fermín Bohórquez, Pablo Hermosa de Mendoza and Leonard Hernández, decided to cancel the bullfighting.
Adverse meteorological conditions have plagued this celebration for a long time, two of the three celebrations could not take place.
On Saturday, the rain made it impossible for the second planned bullfights to take place.
During them, the formation of José Luis Moreno, Curro Díaz and Juan Bautista was to face the bulls in the arena on Castilblanca.
But this is how it was celebrated only on Friday.
The winner was Daniel Luque, who cut off three ears and was rewarded with a reward for a dynamic and aesthetically pleasing performance.
On the same afternoon, Alejandro Talavante exchanged two spear blows for greetings and one ear brought to him by the uncovered seats in the arena rather than toreador art.
Even worse was El Juli, who walked through the Los Llanos bullring unsalted lean.
In the second round of hard work without a single break, he earned sharp criticism from most of the audience.
They went to check in Álava in a van with two thousand kilograms of hashish
Five in ten minutes.
Road control Ertzaintza in the Armiñón (Álava) district.
The members stop two people driving in a van and they leave.
The cargo, more than two tons of hashish, is unstoppable.
According to a report by the Basque Government&#39;s Department of the Interior, they were chased and detained by one of the people in the van, a 38-year-old man identified as AAJ
The detainee was accused of smuggling drugs and falsifying state documents.
The incident occurred when several members of the Transport Unit carried out a roadside check on the N-1 in places where it passes the border of the Armiñón urban district.
They were about to stop the van for inspection, but the driver disobeyed the instructions, accelerated sharply, and drove off.
The members immediately started chasing the car, until the vehicle stopped at the curb a few kilometers away, at which point both passengers jumped out and fled into the woods.
Ertzaintza eventually caught up with one of them and confiscated 2,178 kilograms of hashish, which the suspects were carrying, as it turned out during an inspection of the Iveco Daily van.
The rear of the vehicle was loaded with packages of hashish, which were then transported to other police departments for detailed examination and weighing of the drug.
In addition, the police found that the license plate was &quot;crumpled&quot; and did not match the data in the delivery documents, so the detainee was also accused of falsifying state documents.
Ertzaintza continues to search for the second suspect, who, as already mentioned, managed to escape in order to finally determine the origin of the seized drug.
The detained AAJ, 28, was transferred to the police department to complete the appropriate formalities before further investigation was later carried out.
Actress Heather Locklear detained for driving under the influence of drugs
Actress Heather Locklear, a favorite of Amanda from the Melrose Place series, was arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara, California, for driving under the influence of drugs.
The witness saw her perform unusual maneuvers as she tried to leave the Montecito parking lot, a spokesman for the California Road Patrol told People magazine.
The witness stated that around 4.30 pm Locklear &quot;stepped hard on the gas, drove back and forth in a loud roar and tried to get out of the parking lot - she ran over her sunglasses several times while reversing.&quot;
The witness, who did not seem to know the actress at first, saw Locklear a moment after he stopped on a nearby highway and got out of the vehicle.
The person also alerted the rescue service because &quot;she was worried about Locklear&#39;s life.&quot;
When a police patrol arrived, she found an actress inside the vehicle, which partially blocked the road.
&quot;She looked disoriented,&quot; so the members took her to a specialized drug and alcohol center to take the test.
According to a police spokeswoman, the actress cooperated and the excessive amount of alcohol was immediately ruled out, yet &quot;we believe that Locklear was under the influence of some drugs, which was obvious to the police at first glance.&quot;
Locklear was detained on suspicion of driving under the influence of an unspecified substance and was taken into custody around 7 p.m., although she was released a few hours later.
Locklear returned from a medical clinic two months ago, where she was recovering from anxiety and depression.
Llamazares urges the Andalusian association IU to exercise its powers in the Silva case
Gaspar Llamazares, IU chief and MP for the United Left, said today that the final decision in the case of Francisco Manuel Silva&#39;s former youth and sports councilor of the City Hall of Seville, who resigned last week after being accused of negotiating in favor of his family, will be depend on the party&#39;s regional association.
&quot;I am too much of a federalist for this, it is up to the Andalusian organization to exercise its powers,&quot; Llamazares indicated the negotiations the party would have to take in relation to a former member of the Seville city council.
However, the head of the IU insisted that &quot;transparency&quot; was absolutely necessary when investigating Silva&#39;s illegal activities: &quot;The IU has always fought to make such matters as transparent as possible.&quot;
He also stressed that the party has a &quot;strict code of ethics for all public functions&quot;.
&quot;May Blood&quot; (&#39;Sangre de mayo&#39;), an epic bet by Garci
Inspired by the episodes of Benito Pérez Galdós&#39; national past, José Luis Garci in &quot;Blood of the May&quot; (Sangre de mayo) brings to life the famous Spanish uprising against the French - the most ambitious film in his filmography, with a budget of around 15 million euros.
In this way, the filmmaker wanted to &quot;portray the eloquence of the characters and the analysis of society&quot;, which he always admired in the work of the famous novelist, he explained today together with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría during the presentation of the film in front of a large team of performers.
May blood with a footage of over two and a half hours will be released in cinemas this Friday, and in the future more than a four-hour series will be prepared for Telemadrid television.
As a great admirer of Galdós&#39; literary work, José Luis Garci claims that he fulfilled his &quot;childhood dream&quot; by making this film, thanks to Esperanza Aguirre, who commissioned him to shoot the film for the bicentennial of Madrid on May 2 three years ago. accepted that the plot would be based on episodes of the national past.
The 15 million budget, to which the province of Madrid has made a complete contribution, represents a &quot;unique opportunity&quot; for Garcia to create an environment with scenery and costumes that match the image of &quot;shattering Spain&quot; mistaken for a leader to fight for - the struggle for independence led by Ferdinand VII. to the decline and backwardness of the country, &quot;he said.
However, the director regrets that he cannot count on the financial support given to the films The Sad Wing (Ala triste) or the Ghosts of Goya - almost double the May Blood - so he could not shoot some scenes from a screenplay signed by Horace Valcárcel, with whom he works film track.
The director of &quot;Start Again&quot; (Volver and Empezar) works as usual - on stage with actors he usually rehearses before filming and who doesn&#39;t choose casting because he finds it &quot;humiliating&quot; and also believes that &quot;Part of the director &#39;s profession is, among other things, to go to theaters and cinemas to find out what&#39; s going on in the craft he&#39;s involved in.&quot;
Many of the actors he has chosen for May&#39;s Blood have appeared in front of his camera several times, such as Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga and Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Garcia, with four Oscar nominations, one of which, considers that none of the three candidates representing Spain this year before the Hollywood Academy, May Blood itself, the Seven Tables of French Billiards and the last selected Blind Sunflower, represents the young generation of the Spanish film scene, but he claims that &quot;she is yet to appear.&quot;
Garcia does not expect any awards for this film.
&quot;At first you think you&#39;re working for what happens next, but then you realize you&#39;re only working to make money, so you can make another film,&quot; explains Garcia with a directing career of more than 30 years.
Isabel Bayón revives the spiritual legacy of the Seville dancer Tórtola Valencia
The Seville flamenco dancer pays tribute to another Seville dancer.
Carmen Tórtola Valencia, a Florentine father (Florenç Tórtola Ferrer) and an Andalusian mother (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in the Triana district and moved to London with her family when she was three years old.
She danced modern dance and focused on oriental dances.
She lived a life full of passion, pioneering female emancipation like Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist and a vegetarian and fought for the abolition of the corset, which prevented women from moving freely.
The life of this woman, influenced by the dance and aesthetic revolution of interwar Europe, enchanted Isabel Bayón.
&quot;I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa, and she designed this character for me - it seemed incredible.&quot;
According to the dancer, &quot;we are not talking about telling her life, but about grasping her soul.
The names of her dance performances reminded me of flamenco rhythms.
So &quot;butterfly dance&quot; evoked a thong in my guajira or &quot;snake dance&quot;.
Her dance was sensual and they told me that my dance also corresponds to this aesthetic, &quot;he claims.
The performance includes the involvement of two exceptional personalities: Miguel Poveda, who will sing to Isabella in one performance as well as in &quot;La puerta abierta&quot;, and dance teacher Matilde Coral, who made an exception and began working with her former student.
&quot;Matilde represents the elder Torrtol, a mature figure.
I am happy that she accepted the offer to participate in my project, and it is a great honor for me. &quot;
The performance also includes music and guitars by Jesús Torres and Paco Arriaga, with singing by Miguel Ortega, el Pulga and Moi de Morón; the drums of El Pájar, the viola of Rafa El Viola and the collaboration of the actor Juanfra Juárez, &quot;who has the role of an eternal guide to this kind of artists who are prima donnas with everything and who are always in love with them&quot;.
The work also takes into account the life of this woman, who took place in her time in places as far away as India, the United States or Russia, as well as throughout Europe, because she usually lived in London.
&quot;I wanted to remind her because I think she was one of those women who has a huge influence at one time, but no one knows her today, and she appreciates her work even less,&quot; says Bayón.
The performance begins today at 8.30 pm at the Lope de Vegy Theater.
J. Vicente Resino at the Faculty of Arts
&quot;I recommend José Vicente Resina &#39;s exhibition&quot; Flamenco and Life &quot;because his black and white documentaries are amazing.
They captivated me with the simplicity and strong charge with which they affect the audience, and consideration and respect for the photographed.
An exhibition that shows a lot of emotion.
Resino can capture magical moments. &quot;
The book &quot;Diary of a Newly Married&quot; also closes triennials
The launch of the first illustrated edition of The Newly Married Diary at Saint Stephen&#39;s Church (New York), where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in March 1916, is part of a program coordinated by the Cultural Council of the Autonomous Andalusian Government to celebrate the Zenobia and Juan Ramón Triennial &quot;(2006-2008), organized to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the Nobel Prize in Literature and the anniversary of their death.
The &quot;Zenobia and Juan Ramón Triennial&quot; is coming to an end with a new edition of this work, an international congress to be held in New York, the renovation of the Nobel Museum and the traveling exhibition &quot;Juan Ramón Jiménez: The Ray of the Sun&quot;, which opened in May this year, and after touring the various Andalusian provinces, it is scheduled to move to New York at the time of the congress.
The Cultural Council of the Autonomous Government of Andalusia has also ordered eight hundred copies of the &quot;Diary of a Newly Married&quot; edited by Pedro Taberner and illustrated by Jacob Pérez-Encis to continue raising awareness of the personality and work of one of the world&#39;s greatest Andalusian poets.
America without Paul Newman doesn&#39;t like it so much anymore
&quot;Sometimes God creates perfect people.
Paul Newman was one of them. &quot;
These are the words of actress Sally Field, who collaborated with him on &quot;Without Evil Intent&quot; and, under the weight of knowing that Newman has left, reveals her unhappy vision of abandoned American cinema and the whole of America.
See how long it took them to get an Oscar.
And that he has been retired since 2007.
And that he was known to be seriously ill.
Even so, he was a guy for everyone.
&quot;Sometimes what you feel can&#39;t be expressed in any way, and now I&#39;ve lost a great friend,&quot; Robert Redford said in tears, &quot;my life and my country have been better because of him.&quot;
No one was afraid he would be ridiculous or exaggerated.
The father of film and the country died in a particularly dark time of fear of terrorists and financial markets, at a time when American self-confidence is at the bottom, when reasons for pride are desperately sought.
When times are tough and people without virtues and only a handful of those who admire you - there is no need to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
For all, he embodied the almost platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was an official opponent of Richard Nixon and a fighter for lost and won cases, from an anti-drug foundation based in honor of his eldest son who died of an overdose to his own brand of homemade food and organic food.
A complete treasure for a country that has cost a lot of effort to break free from a suicidal eating culture.
A storm of admiration swept Hollywood, regardless of nationality or nationality.
The last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, stated that not one man died, but an entire era.
Another Englishman, an Oscar-winning director Sam Mendes, said working with Newman was the exaggeration of his career.
An evil boy from Australia, Russell Crowe, dared to call Newman his greatest source of inspiration.
&quot;The fox has set a pretty high bar for all of us,&quot; says George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who now has the courage to strive to live like Paul Newman lived - he is based on honesty and leads a serious private life away from the cameras.
This is not always easy, sometimes not even possible, in today&#39;s media jungle.
But fortunately such people are, and Paul Newman is their role model.
He divorced once, and has since been married for fifty years to Joanne Woodward, whom he has been faithful to, though he certainly had more than enough opportunities not to be.
&quot;Why would I go out for a burger when I have a fillet at home?&quot; he liked to joke.
Let him be proud in heaven that there is harmony on earth between his daughters and his admirers - this is not very common in America.
It is said that &quot;of all the great roles he embodied, he was most proud of his role as a devoted husband, a loving father, a willing grandfather, and a dedicated philanthropist.&quot;
Imperfect races of the Olympic Madrid
Yes, many of us long for the Olympics to take place in Madrid, and after a failed 2012, it may be 2016.
But I ask: are we ready?
If we follow yesterday&#39;s race, I say: no!
He was talked about as the perfect race, and in my opinion he was the worst I&#39;ve ever been to.
Such a handful of nonsense that immediately, if there was an evaluation and I was an examiner, it would be clearly insufficient.
But let&#39;s look at it from the beginning, pretty much one by one.
Nonsense begins with picking up a race number, which makes you have to go first.
That doesn&#39;t seem bad to me, but when you go there, give them everything (including a chip to prevent overcrowding).
But not.
Here one had to first pick up a number (first nonsense, go there just for that) and (after standing up the appropriate queue) - what a surprise! - they only had a size S T-shirt (second nonsense, because I need a size XL).
Where do we live?
Due to the crisis, they decided to buy only small T-shirts, because it is less fabric and is cheaper?
Well, these are small things compared to what happened on the day of the race.
In addition to the fact that it had to go very early for the chip and the queue lasted over 15 minutes, a backpack had to be handed over there.
The waiting time lasted over 35 minutes, which is incomprehensible at the race, where 11,000 people are expected.
So, as expected, the race started and we haven&#39;t put our backpacks away yet, and when we did, picking it up was much worse.
In addition, the wait was extended by 40 minutes of rain, which led to a general uprising and an attack on the cabin.
I believe that 500 of us will have bronchitis tomorrow, and some, like me, will not see the right time to evaluate the results because of the chip they gave me, which I assume did not record my start time correctly.
Of course, if someone asked me about a perfect race, this one wouldn&#39;t occur to me.
And so I think we will have to dream of a well-prepared Olympic city.
Microsoft is looking for a receptionist (virtual)
At a conference on new MIT technologies, Microsoft demonstrated further developments in a new system of image recognition and human interaction in the manner of artificial intelligence - not very intelligent, but able to perform basic tasks such as calling a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, a messenger moving around the campus society) and perceive what they hear in the interview.
Thanks to a camera and a system that recognizes shapes and faces, this &quot;receptionist&quot; can find out how many people are in the room, who they are - even remember what they are wearing - and listen and understand the keywords of their conversations.
He can also sort the present according to the conversation groups.
In the demonstration video, the receptionist records a third party and understands that he does not belong to the group that is talking to him and that he is not an employee of the company.
He asks her if she is following anyone and tells her that he will pay attention to her in a moment.
All without a blue screen of death.
Ravishingly.
But that is, of course, the music of the future.
Now the company has more important things to do, such as a new version of the Windows operating system.
There has been a lot of talk this week about changing Microsoft&#39;s strategy.
Windows 7 will be lighter and will not have as many associated programs.
Steve Ballmer figured that if computers had only the bare essentials, without the burden of commercial uselessness, they would be five times more powerful - man, Steve, they&#39;d be cheaper.
Discovery like thunder, considering that Microsoft adds new features and more &quot;extras&quot; to Windows from version to version.
A change of direction would be a meritorious act.
Microsoft is right, the operating system is slowly losing its relevance, and so is the software.
When Google Chrome appeared on the network, I became one of those who leaned toward the theory that it was Google&#39;s first step in competing with Windows.
Many have rightly pointed out that the browser is not an operating system.
An operating system will always be necessary because it is a necessary layer of communication between hardware and software.
It has the same function as your wife or husband when you have to tell your mother-in-law something.
It is true.
It never disappears, but you need to think of the &quot;death&quot; of the operating system not as absolute truth, but relative truth.
What Ballmer said this week confirms this idea.
People pay less and less attention to the operating system and more to the Internet browser.
The computer turns on to run Firefox or Explorer - or Chrome - and we spend more time on the Internet every day than around windows.
What are half of the applications that accompany the system?
Less is more.
And Windows 7 needs to be less, much less than Vista.
Less heavy, less loaded, less complex.
Microsoft is now interested in offering its services online and finally becoming an alternative to Google.
They desperately need it, and here is a small example.
I took this photo in a restroom for Microsoft employees in Redmond earlier this month.
There was a poster on the vending machine asking them to use their search tools: &quot;Your search. Our future.&quot;
In 2006, an independent study showed that 66% of Microsoft employees used Google to search the Internet.
By the way, the delay of the new version of Windows Mobile 7 was confirmed last week.
It will not come at the beginning of 2009, but at the end, so let &#39;s rather count on 2010.
At Microsoft, they will certainly try to launch Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 together.
The phone is becoming more and more a computer.
Since Android and iPhone are already on the market, they will have to pay dearly for delays.
Le Fabuleux Marcel
Pablo Picasso wore it to the Côte d&#39;Azur, Leonardo di Caprio shone in one in Edward Zwick&#39;s &quot;Blood Diamond&quot;, as well as Al Pacino in Francis Ford Coppola&#39;s &quot;Godfather&quot;, and is also part of the uniform of the muscular gay community.
And if we want to embark on a list of his life roles, we can dive into the image of a typical muscle man with a pointed mustache, which lifts dumbbells in a nomadic circus.
Basically, it&#39;s nothing more than a typical men&#39;s cotton undershirt, close-fitting and sleeveless.
English speakers call it a &#39;tank&#39;, but le Fabuleux Marcel from Brussels stands out above all others.
First, for its groundbreaking name - albeit popularly called &#39;Marcel&#39; - which is related to sports, because, as legend has it, it was named after boxer Marcel Cerdan, the lover of singer Edith Piaf.
&#39;Marcel&#39; stands out above the other high-quality cotton, unisex cut, distinctive label and (almost imperceptible) Belgian flag, which the models of the most emblematic vests have as a detail at the neck.
And beware, because the Belgian company does not specialize only in tank tops.
It also produces college sweatshirts, retro boxers, cashmere sweaters, cotton pants, navy T-shirts, children&#39;s clothes, mini shorts ...
Thoughtful pieces for comfortable underwear.
Although it&#39;s a shame that they are just underwear.
They are too beautiful.
Honda will attack with its bestseller for the second time
In November, Honda will launch the second generation Jazz.
If the predecessor of this one-compartment vehicle already had considerable space, it now offers an even more spacious interior.
To this are added improved engines that increase driving comfort and enable greater fuel savings.
Evolution rather than revolution.
Such is the second generation of Honda Jazz.
Although aesthetically the lines of the new Jazz are very similar to the previous model, there have been many changes to this one-seater car.
It is necessary to mention, for example, the innovative design, the new platform, larger dimensions and new engines.
Before examining the new model, it should be noted that the new Jazz is coming to the market six years after the launch of the first generation.
Therefore, the first thing we notice is the fact that Honda needed a shorter period to rejuvenate this model than other manufacturers.
Although Jazz is a lesser-known model in Europe, it has become a sales phenomenon in other markets.
This is the case in Japan, the country where the Jazz was the best-selling car in 2002, and also during this year 2008.
In Japan alone, almost a million units have been sold since the launch of the Honda Jazz.
The second market is the old continent, with about half a million units sold in six years.
However, Honda aims for the new Jazz to increase sales in its category.
So while in 2007 the Japanese company sold a total of 83,000 Honda Jazzs, in 2009 estimates are estimated at 100,000 cars, an increase of 17% on the European market.
As for the Spanish market, Honda has sold a total of 8,000 Jazz models since 2002, representing 6.7% of Honda&#39;s total sales in Spain.
As for the new generation of Jazz, the management of the Spanish branch expects to sell 2,000 units for the whole year.
It is the arrival of the new Jazz that will allow Honda to significantly mitigate the decline in sales in Spain.
The carmaker&#39;s management thus de facto expects the end of the year with a total of 22,000 units sold, which means 4,000 less than in 2007 and a decrease of 16%.
Despite this increase in sales, Honda increased its share of the Spanish market to 1.8%, compared to 1.6% last year.
In 2010, the Japanese company expects to reach 2%.
To achieve this share, Honda relies on the success of its next new model.
It is the Honda Insight, a five-door compact hybrid with a length of 4.37 meters, from which the Japanese company promises worldwide sales of approximately 200,000 units per year.
In terms of markets, the Japanese manufacturer estimates that 50% of Insight will be sold in the United States, while the remaining percent will be shared between the old continent and Japan.
The Honda Insight is expected to go on sale in the first months of next year when it is unveiled to the public in Valencia in January.
Compared to the first generation, all dimensions of the new Jazz have increased.
Its length has increased to 3.9 meters (five centimeters more), width to 1.69 meters (two centimeters more) and wheelbase to 2.5 meters, which means an extension of five centimeters.
The height, on the other hand, has not changed and is still 1.52 meters.
The increase in dimensions also increased the interior space.
This advantage was achieved both by using a new platform and by placing a fuel tank in the middle of the car, which was already used in the previous Honda Jazz.
The volume of the luggage compartment - which has a double bottom system - has also increased to 399 liters, 19 liters more than the volume of the luggage compartment of the first generation.
It should be noted that these dimensions occur in the version with the 1.4 engine, as the volume of the luggage compartment of the Honda Jazz 1.2 is 379 liters.
Another improvement, in addition to external elements - such as LED rear lights or the possibility of being equipped with a glass panoramic roof - is easier access to the rear seats.
The door leading to the second row of seats allows an opening angle of 80 degrees compared to 67 in the first Jazz model.
The engines of the second generation Honda Jazz are also new.
Initially, this small model will be offered with two 1.2 and 1.4 liter petrol engines.
Both engines use i-VTEC technology, which enables lower fuel consumption, lower carbon dioxide emissions and excellent powertrain improvements along with high torque over the full engine speed range.
The first 1.2-liter engine has 90 horsepower at 6,000 rpm with a maximum torque of 114 Nm at 4,900 rpm.
This engine - which had 78 horsepower in the previous generation Jazz - consumes 5.3 liters and emits 125 grams of CO2.
Compared to the previous engine, which in the previous generation reached 83 horsepower, the current will reach 100.
The 100-horsepower Honda Jazz 1.4 has a combined consumption of 5.4 liters and emits 128 grams of CO2.
&quot;I want to be a young mother. I don&#39;t care who the father is.&quot;
The great appearance with her sister did not prevent her from developing her own personality.
Mónica Cruz, although small in stature, is a woman full of life.
The Cruz sisters are now taking their new role in fashion very seriously.
For Mónica, this means much more than just giving some pretty, famous girls their name.
In Paris, she took part in a promotional event organized by Mango in its new headquarters, as well as the announcement of the most important fashion awards sponsored by this Spanish company.
She is cordial and timid and will get you up close.
Tell us what you do in Paris.
I came to present a new collection, which Sister Penelope and I designed for Mango for this fall-winter season, and at the same time I attended the announcement of the second year of the &quot;Mango Fashion Awards&quot; and a dinner at the Opera in honor of Valentin.
So it was a challenging but also an exciting day.
What is the basis of your new collection for the company Mango, for which you have been working for the fourth season?
My sister and I love movies from the 50&#39;s and 60&#39;s and we drew a lot of inspiration from them.
I also like to wander around the city and watch women walk dressed, combine and layer their clothes, I do this very often.
You&#39;re a dancer, an actress, a designer, a very versatile woman, aren&#39;t you?
I think so, but after all, everything is interconnected and has many connections.
For example, I liked clothes from an early age, I still wanted to go to my grandmother&#39;s, wake up in my aunt&#39;s closets and look at her clothes.
It was a sensation, almost better than going on a pilgrimage.
When I became a dancer, I always tried to pay attention to the way I dressed.
After all, you know that we dancers rely on how we are adjusted to feel good looking in the mirror during our lessons and rehearsals.
And as an actress, when they give you a costume, then you really get into the character.
So everything is connected, but with great respect for designers and professionalism.
You were 30 recently, did the crisis hit you?
No way.
I feel better than ever, I am in my thirties.
I find that the woman is ready, has experience and enjoys life with fewer mistakes.
The biological clock does not scare me.
I have been doing what I want since I was a child, and that gives me great inner happiness.
So you&#39;re thinking about being a mother, aren&#39;t you?
Of course, I know I&#39;ll be a mother because my body wants it, and besides, I want to be a young mom, I don&#39;t want to miss it.
As for my father, I&#39;m not worried about that.
But one thing I know for sure, I will give my child a feeling of happiness and I will raise him with great love.
As for the film, there are now several premieres of the films you made last year.
That&#39;s right, and I&#39;m looking forward to coming to the cinemas.
I come from the theatrical world, so I&#39;m very impatient and restless, I want everything right now, and of course I can&#39;t.
I look forward to the premiere of &quot;La última hora&quot; and &quot;En busca de la tumba de Cristo&quot;.
Deliberately, how will you like ...
A few days ago, you had your premiere on the catwalk alongside Naomi Campbell, didn&#39;t you?
Well, don&#39;t say that.
It&#39;s not like I&#39;m going to step on the catwalk as a model.
I was just called by Naomi Campbell, whom I have known for a long time, and invited me to London to attend a benefit show for her &quot;Women for a Better Life&quot; organization and the clothes we showed off - I also selected two models from our Mango collection - , was auctioned off and the proceeds were donated to this Naoma NGO.
People don&#39;t know that Naomi has such a good heart.
There are a lot of things being said about her, and since I know her, I can tell you that many of them are not true.
In addition, I will stick to the good in which he is involved.
She asked me to show off for charity, but if she asks me to do a handstand, I&#39;ll do it too.
I will do what is needed for the benefit of third world women.
&quot;Car bee&quot; prevents collisions
This time, Nissan was inspired to advance the development of accident protection technologies in nature, specifically in bees.
This Japanese company has created a robot that takes the example of flying bees and thus prevents collisions.
Such is the Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive or BR23C, which represents the first step in collision prevention technologies.
Nissan Motor Co. Center for Technical Progress Engineers The robot was developed in collaboration with the Center for Advanced Scientific Research of the prestigious Japanese University of Tokyo.
According to Kazuhir Doi, General Director of Public Relations for Brand Technology, Research and Development, the BR23C is presented as an extension of Nissan&#39;s four security shield zones.
The robot&#39;s task is to strengthen the ability of collision prevention in cars of this brand.
During the flight, each bee creates its own oval personal space, which closely resembles the Nissan safety shield.
The most important, however, are the compound bee&#39;s eyes, which are able to see in all directions at an angle greater than 300 degrees, which allows the bee to fly in its personal space without stopping.
Engineers designed what they called the Laser Range Finder to create this visual feature.
It records obstacles up to two meters within 180 degrees of the BR23C, calculates the distance to the object and sends a signal to the on-board microprocessor, which immediately converts it to a collision warning.
&quot;As soon as an obstacle is detected, the robot mimics the bee&#39;s movements and immediately changes direction by turning the wheels at a right or even greater angle to prevent a collision.
The biggest difference from any existing system is the fact that all evasive maneuvers are completely instinctive.
If this were not the case, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles, &quot;explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobile Laboratory and chief engineer of the project.
Unlike bees, the robot cannot move up and down or diagonally, its movement is limited to only two dimensions and the direction allowed by the rotation of its wheels, but not in an infinite number of directions and possibilities as with bees.
Therefore, in addition to accelerating and decelerating, Nissan also used the rotation function to prevent the robot from colliding.
&quot;The device only needs to process the information every few seconds and behave according to this data.
It does not require the retention of information or logical intuition from previous maneuvers, so it can work without interruption with only two dozen kB of memory.
It may surprise you, but we&#39;re not talking about gigas or mega-minds. &quot;
This is the first step in the development of new instant collision prevention technologies, a technology that Nissan is predicting to use in production cars in ten years.
The robot uses lithium polymer batteries, which are lighter and last longer than lithium-ion batteries.
Another possible future use of this technology could be to incorporate the unit into a GPS satellite navigation system, which would lead the driver to the destination while avoiding obstacles on the road.
Drivers repeatedly caught with blood alcohol will need to install an &quot;alcolock&quot;
The Ministry of the Interior requires a driver with three administrative penalties for driving under the influence of alcohol to have to install a system in his car that prevents him from starting the car while drunk or not breathing.
The proposal became known as early as June this year and is now included in the annual report of the Supreme Public Prosecutor&#39;s Office, according to which it is a pilot project that will last one year.
Its aim is to return the driver behind the wheel, so drivers will also have to take a traffic re-education course.
In addition to the National Office for Traffic Safety, the Directorate-General for Transport (DGT) and the Foundation of the Institute of Automotive Safety (FITSA) will also take part in this experience.
According to statistics, between 30 and 75% of motorists charged more than once for drunk driving will again get behind the wheel in this state.
Alcolock should prevent this, as it is a system connected to the vehicle that measures the level of alcohol in the exhaled air and prevents the car from starting if the driver does not breathe beforehand or if a higher than permitted alcohol concentration is detected.
Its price exceeds 1,000 euros and the culprit himself would have to pay for it.
A study carried out in this regard in the USA in 2007 showed that vehicles equipped with this device had a 65% reduction in offenses during the first year since its introduction.
In Spain, it is estimated that 115 people could save lives every year.
The measure is limited to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to address this behavior before it results in a criminal offense.
And in order to help its implementation, as the legislation can be implemented in the usual way, but the necessary adjustment of criminal provisions requires a change in the law.
The device is not yet available in any commercial version on the Spanish market, although it has already been trial-installed in some industrial and public service vehicles.
Tomorrow, the Congress of Deputies will vote on a proposal by the PSOE (Spanish Socialist Workers&#39; Party), which recommends installing this system in school buses, as is the case in France.
In Mexico and without &quot;peeptoes&quot;
At British accuracy, at 5.40 pm, as stated in the program, a Spanish Air Force plane landed in the presidential hangar at Benito Juárez Airport in Mexico, in which a prince and princess from Asturias arrived.
The sun was just setting, but its rays still forced him to cover his eyes with his hand so that a successor couple could be seen getting off the plane.
The Spanish ambassador and other officials stood under the steps.
A few hours ago, I asked a taxi driver on the street if he knew that the Spanish prince and princess were coming for a state visit.
- Yeah, that&#39;s great, it won&#39;t be possible to get to the airport to recruit people at that time ... She&#39;s from here or something ...
- No, no, sir, she&#39;s Spanish, but she lived here for a few years.
- Yeah, that&#39;s right ...
However, the Mexican press is well aware of who the prince and princess of Asturias are and how important their visit is.
Many people are waiting in the hangar at the airport next to the red carpet and the military cordon, which consists of 27 naval soldiers ready to fire a volley of honor.
The prince appears with a smile on his lips in a dark blue suit and the princess, very modestly dressed and with tousled hair, does not have her usual &quot;peeptoes&quot;, apparently she has been reported that a storm is threatening in DF.
Before moving to the hall where the official delegation is waiting, they smile at the photographers and pose for them casually.
A talkative Mexican television reporter is waiting for them at the door of the hotel where they will be accommodated, one of the four largest in the city.
Enjoy the fear before you take out a mortgage
It must be acknowledged that the US Treasury Department, in addition to having enough capital to distribute injections, also lacks ingenuity.
In the face of the crisis, and to prevent Americans from taking subprime mortgages with banks with dubious solvency, it has created a popular-science game &quot;Bad Credit Hotel&quot; on the Internet.
Not the &quot;Bad Credit Hotel&quot; ... or a confused hotel.
The hotel, and especially its receptionist, look gloomy, so that one, two or three times you think about whether it is the right time to apply for a loan.
And above all, where to apply, which is probably her intention.
The fact is that the game contains useful information, although not very detailed.
It is a site suitable for young people rather than a space for the general public.
And what happens when the game ends?
A dream room appears inside the hotel.
At least something, because you better not talk about buying a house ...
The best subsidized fashion award
There is probably no better place in the world to announce a fashion award than Paris, and there is probably no better designer and bon vivant than Valentino.
Mango has just announced the second annual El Botón-Mango Fashion Awards to enable international presentation to new talent in the field of fashion.
The prize is subsidized by the amount of 300,000 euros.
The Belgian Sandrina Fasoli, the winner of the first year, yesterday looked at her designs in the Manga shop window on the Boulevard Haussmann number 54 in Paris and almost cried with emotion.
Sure, it is the company&#39;s second largest store in Europe and has just opened on an area of 1,335 square meters.
The largest is located in London.
Many events, along with the desire to thank designer Valentin for taking over the presidency of the competition jury, caused us to finally have a sumptuous dinner at the Paris Opera Garnier.
The presidential table, ceremoniously decorated by Mango, looked a little more amazing next to Chagall&#39;s most exquisite works.
Nati, heartbroken with grief over her brother&#39;s recent death, put on her breathtaking ELAH dress and jewelry, and hung on to her son Luis - a two-foot-tall chic - accompanied Valentina at the head of the table for dinner at his honor.
Andik, the boss and owner of Mango, welcomed him and, like a true gentleman, and Baron Rothschild were left without a jacket, as they were both offered to two ladies.
Mónica Cruz, who arrived at the store in - hand-designed - trousers and a shirt and changed into a long black sexy dress for dinner, was moved by a night walk around the Opera accompanied by Goya Toledo, showed us a ballet rehearsal room and, remembering other times, caught one of the bars and hinted at the &quot;grand plié&quot;.
Inés Sastre did not stay for a tour of the palace&#39;s outbuildings, but before she left she showed us photos of her son on her mobile phone.
The next morning we were able to enjoy the presence of Olivier Martínez - another young man riding a motorcycle - and John Travolta, who arrived at the Intercontinental Hotel in Paris with his own sheets and towels and asked in advance that no fragrances be used in his rooms.
Stars under the starry Parisian sky.
Oh yes, that&#39;s life.
1001 - anti-stress number
Not 1000, but 1000 plus one way to forget the chaotic and frantic daily life.
And to make matters worse, they are all summarized in one book, which will bring relaxation to the bookstore on September 30th.
The alarm clock rings every morning at 7 a.m. as a punishment, but it&#39;s even worse to imagine yourself absorbed in the hurried rhythm of contemporary life.
The office is called stress and computer back pain.
Stress is a disease of the 21st century.
However, there are neither methods nor two ways to combat daily exhaustion and the problems of disconnecting from the world of work.
No, that number is no bigger and no less than 1001.
In addition to yoga positions, classical massages, and &quot;spa&quot; therapies, Susannah Marriott has gathered an entire &quot;menu&quot; of options on the pages of her book, tailored to each individual&#39;s tastes and timing options.
The anti-stress book is called &quot;1001 way of relaxation&quot; and thanks to Pearson Alhambra and DK will bring peace to the bookstore.
If someone thinks that it is not possible to achieve peace in areas such as work or personal relationships, the &quot;handbook&quot; denies this view.
In addition, it offers other ways to be in touch with nature or 100% natural recipes that contribute to relaxation.
If adrenaline is no longer circulating in your veins, which restores balance in your body, and stress has become a problem, it&#39;s time to sit on the couch, switch off and concentrate on reading.
Talking from sleep
Some children talk at night.
I don&#39;t mean those who wake up and actively tell us something that happened the day before, but children who talk while they sleep.
When it happens for the first time, it may scare you, but in reality it is irrelevant.
This is a harmless sleep disorder called somnolence.
It is quite common, especially in children and adolescents.
Certainly many of you were told that he was talking about sleep at night.
This phenomenon can occur very sporadically (for example, once in a lifetime with high fevers), or with greater regularity (every day, once a week, once every few months ...), the next day the child does not remember anything.
There is no single reason to explain her onset.
It is often associated with other sleep disorders, such as nightmares, nightmares, enuresis nocturna (night urination) or drowsiness, but this may not be the case.
As mentioned earlier, it can often be accompanied by very high fevers, stressful or aggravated situations.
In any case, this is a little-studied phenomenon.
The intensity with which it occurs also varies.
The child can speak in a calm voice, say individual words, whisper, or vice versa (screams, crying, long speeches ...).
In cases where it manifests with great force, it would be appropriate to observe the child and consult an expert to see if he has a problem that causes him great anxiety and manifests itself in this way.
We have said that it is a harmless disorder, so it is not treated only if it is associated with another sleep disorder that can be treated (for example, if it is associated with apnea syndrome or permanent stress).
However, we can do this by keeping in mind a few very simple preventive measures, such as:
Try not to upset the child too much before going to bed.
So look for quiet games and avoid scary or somewhat violent TV programs or series.
For very nervous children and those who are given a job to relax, it is possible to use relaxation techniques that will help them gain a certain inner peace.
This will allow the baby to sleep more peacefully.
When somnolence appears, try to stay calm.
Remember that it is harmless to the child and that he will not remember anything from what happened the next day.
Useful advice
Don&#39;t be him.
It is useless because he is unconscious and you interrupt his sleep.
Although he speaks, he sleeps, and therefore rests.
Remember that if you find yourself bothered several times in a row, it would be useful to seek advice or find out what is causing your anxiety.
If you understand what he is saying (which is not so common), avoid the temptation to interrogate him and pull information from him.
It will be useless, because when he sleeps, he is not conscious so that he can organize his thoughts.
In addition, you will hear what he says, but you do not know what he thinks about, and therefore why he says it, so be very careful how you interpret the information and what conclusions you come to.
Never tell your child that you can ask him his secrets at night.
Not for fun.
This causes great anxiety.
Don&#39;t worry, it&#39;s not a bad thing, it&#39;s just an episode that only lasts a few minutes.
Illhaeusern ... finally
Illhaeusern finally found his way to victory again after a long lean period.
Without playing a particularly big match, the yellow-blacks created more chances and managed to turn one of them victoriously.
The game did not have a fast pace during this encounter, in which the attackers found it difficult to assert themselves.
After the captain&#39;s first attempt, Kauffmann, who missed the line by a shot from a distance, Illhaeusern began to have a slight advantage and first Fonderflick from a distance, then Hirne by air, Romain on a long leg or Diebold gradually came to irritate Dannemarie&#39;s defense.
The opponent, on the other hand, built a defensive wall in the middle of the field and left only the agile Riahi at the tip of the attack.
The start of the second half proved to be decisive, first thanks to Dannemarie&#39;s two chances of Riahi and Temporale, then to the opening of the score for Illhaeusern, taken care of by Marais, well situated for processing the ball bounced after Diebold&#39;s previous attempt (53 &#39;).
However, the Illhaeusern goalie did not enjoy the joy for a long time, after about twelve minutes he was forced to return to the locker room and leave his teammates weak.
Dannemarie, however, could not benefit from it, and the eleven of Illhaeusern, who had just withdrawn a little to &quot;thicken&quot; the defense, did not cause any major problems, except for the very last seconds of the match, when the ball flew very close to the crossbar after great confusion.
Sarkozy caters to angry fishermen
Before leaving for the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will take a detour through Brittany.
To counter the demonstration of the power of fishermen who severely disrupted the accessibility of several Breton and Normandy ports on Monday, the French president decided to go to the port of Guilvinec in Finistère on Tuesday morning to meet with their representatives.
The latter promised to be accepted &quot;in a constructive spirit&quot; and hope that &quot;he will come up with concrete proposals&quot;.
The presidential visit comes at the same time as the general meeting of the &quot;crisis committee&quot; set up by Breton fishermen to take action against the sharp rise in oil prices, which peaked at an average of € 1.14 per liter.
According to Elysee Palace spokesman David Martinon, the president &quot;will talk to them about solutions that can be imagined in an effort to help their companies regain competitiveness and better secure employment and pay conditions for seafarers.&quot;
Nicolas Sarkozy is expected to fishermen with intransigence.
On Tuesday morning, they carried out &quot;snail&quot; operations (operations of slow-moving vehicles) in the departments of Morbihan and Calvados, causing almost 10 km of congestion.
The marina in Quiberon was also blocked, but connections to Belle-île were not cut.
A filter dam was put into operation on the Quiberon Peninsula.
The sailors showed their determination as early as Monday, when just before dawn, tires and pallets were burning in front of the fuel depots in the ports of Brest and Lorient, while demonstrations were taking place in Concarneau and Saint-Brieuc.
The movement spread to other ports on the Atlantic coast and the English Channel, such as the Sables d&#39;Olonne in the Vendée, where trawlers remained in the port, or Le Havre, where about twenty vessels blocked the operation of merchant ships.
Fishermen from Turballe and Croisic in the Loire-Atlantique stopped the blockade of the important Total refinery in Donges during the evening.
Those in Boulogne-sur-Mer have decided to wait until Wednesday&#39;s ministry meeting before deciding to act.
In Guilvinec, the &quot;crisis committee&quot; is due to decide on Tuesday how to continue the journey and its participation in a forthcoming meeting at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
However, some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by leaders of the state fisheries department, which has not supported their movement.
&quot;The strike will continue&quot; because &quot;fishermen will not give up&quot; and &quot;do not want to go to Paris,&quot; said Liliane Cariou, president of Lorient&#39;s fisheries department.
Professional fishermen who do not pay oil tax currently pay around 50 cents per liter, but believe that the vessel&#39;s profitability threshold is only reached when diesel is below € 0.30 per liter.
Paul Newman magnificent
Unforgettable &quot;Butch Cassidy and Kid&quot; died of cancer at the age of 83 at his home in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford and Sam Mendes bowed to the film&#39;s legend and politically engaged actor Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer maintains its delivery assumptions for 2008
The Brazilian aircraft manufacturer is relying on the supply of 215 aircraft this year, despite the threat of a recession hovering over the world economy.
The world&#39;s fourth aircraft designer, Embraer, is maintaining its delivery expectations for 2008 with 215 instruments delivered, confirmed its president Fredrico Fleury Curado.
In the first half of the year, the manufacturer delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian designer has high hopes for the Chinese market, especially considering the range of his aircraft from 30 to 120 seats.
To date, Embraer has delivered 41 devices to Chinese clients over eight years.
AIG is said to be considering transferring 15% of its assets
The insurer of the American International Group, which has been raised by the US monetary authorities, is considering transferring more than 15% of its assets in order to repay the $ 85 billion deposited to it, writes the Sunday edition of the Financial Times.
AIG is ready to examine the sale of most of its non-life insurance activities in the international field and pension activities in the United States, the daily said, citing sources close to the ongoing negotiations.
According to FT, AIG&#39;s board of directors met during the evening on Sunday to examine the possible referral.
No confirmatory statement could be obtained from AIG.
The assets that AIG intends to divest include its airline leasing subsidiary International Lease Financial Corp., its 59% stake in Transatlantic Holdings, as well as its real estate portfolio and private equity investments, FT adds.
No final decision on these transfers has yet been taken, FT continues.
AIG urgently needs to raise cash to repay a $ 85 billion loan from the Federal Reserve at the risk of the US authorities seizing 80% of its capital, thereby diluting it to the appropriate proportion of the current shareholder.
Paris. Analysis of the historic Morning Meeting
The New York Stock Exchange saw a historic decline on Monday after the House of Representatives rejected Paulson&#39;s plan to bail out the banks: the Dow Jones lost 6.98%, an unprecedented loss of close to 800 points, and the Nasdaq 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) fell by 777.68 points to 10,365.45 points.
The largest point drop to date in its history (by 684.81 points) was recorded on September 17, 2001, the day trade resumed after the terrorist attacks of September 11.

Dejected from the beginning of the session, Wall Street literally collapsed after the House of Representatives unexpectedly rejected a plan to rescue the banks, a plan that would allow a little stability to be found in the markets again.
228 votes against and 205 in favor refused to provide Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson with the funds he requested.
Nearly two out of three Republicans rejected his plan.
&quot;It&#39;s a bad signal to the market that sees that Congress is unable to adopt a plan,&quot; said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
&quot;It shows how much the market relied on this plan,&quot; she added, expressing concern that the project adopted in a few days would not come &quot;too late&quot;.
&quot;If this project is really doomed (...), the baton will be immediately handed over to the Fed and other central banks to ward off the crisis, which would further strengthen credit conditions,&quot; Brian Bethune warned. , Chief Economist at Global Insight.
Emphasizing the urgency of the situation, Piegza noted that in the United States, &quot;every new day brings the collapse of one financial institution.&quot;
Following the collapse of Washington Mutual on Friday, the authorities organized the purchase of Wachovia&#39;s banking activities by its rival Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis has suddenly picked up momentum and called for urgent intervention in favor of banks in the UK, Benelux, Iceland and Germany, suggesting that markets are not facing &quot;just the US crisis, but the global crisis,&quot; the FTN analyst added. Financial.
The bond market has risen sharply.
The 10-year cash voucher yield fell to 3.632% from 3.827% on Friday night, and the 30-year yield fell to 4.161% from 4.357% the day before.
Morgan Stanley opens its capital to MUFG
Morgan Stanley Bank announced that Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), Japan&#39;s largest bank, will enter its center, spending $ 9 billion to raise 21% of its capital. The adoption of this report was accompanied by a significant drop in its stock market price.
One week after revealing their preliminary agreement, the two banks explained that MUFG intends to buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley&#39;s common stock at a single price of $ 25.25, for a total of $ 3 billion.
The agreed price is 19% lower than the book value of securities as at 31 August.
MUFG is investing another $ 6 billion in acquiring convertible securities, which will provide it with a 10% return and an exchange price of $ 31.25.
Morgan Stanley specified that the entire operation would take place on the basis of an average uniform price of $ 29, ie 28% below its current exchange rate.
Shares of Morgan Stanley still lost 6.79% to $ 23.07 around 17.00 Greenwich Mean Time.
&quot;This strategic merger represents an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley&#39;s transition to bank holding status,&quot; said John Mack, the group&#39;s CEO.
Morgan Stanley adopted the new statute last week, which is supposed to allow him to diversify his activities, but at the same time it places him under the supervision of the Federal Reserve Bank.
His merger with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis is forcing Wall Street&#39;s biggest aces to take a far more cautious approach than before.
The terms introduced on Monday show, among other things, that the agreement has been changed over the past few days: last Monday, Morgan only announced that it would sell up to 20% of its shares to the Japanese for about $ 8.5 billion.
&quot;A week ago, we thought,&quot; Toshihide Mizuno, executive director of MUFG, explained in Tokyo, &quot;that our participation will consist exclusively of ordinary shares.
However, given the current economic and market situation, we wanted to keep risks to a minimum and also cover ourselves. &quot;
Based on the weighted average price, MUFG will pay for Morgan Stanley securities 7% less than their book value.
And the operation will result in a reduction in earnings per share of about 20%.
The agreement assumes that MUFG will be able to convert half of its preference securities into ordinary shares in a year if the latter are exchanged for a certain period of time at a price 50% exceeding the exchange price, ie. for about $ 47.
Morgan Stanley assures that the capital that MUFG will bring will allow it to take advantage of investment opportunities, strengthen its balance sheet and increase its cash.
However, group spokesmen declined to provide details on the strategic projects of the two new allies.
Following the MUFG investment, Morgan Stanley should boast a Tier One solvency ratio of around 15%, one of the best in the industry.
Morgan specified that he had &quot;significantly&quot; reduced his balance sheet since the end of August.
The last few weeks have been challenging for the group as its stock market has fallen by half, while insurance costs against the risk of non-payment associated with debt have risen sharply.
These costs developed in the opposite direction on Monday, but remained high, around 12%.
Last week, Goldman Sachs, the only other &quot;survivor&quot; of the big Wall Bank investment banks after the Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers crash and the Merrill Lynch buyout, announced it had raised $ 15 billion, in part from Warren Buffett&#39;s Berkshire Hathaway.
Rafael Correa on Monday in Quito.
Re-establishing the Republic of Socialism XXI. century.
Such is the joint project of Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, Bolivian Eva Morales and Ecuador Rafael Correy.
Last Sunday, the third party submitted to the vote, following the example of his counterparts and friends, a draft of the new Constitution.
And his mission is fulfilled, because 64% of voters, according to official results covering 80% of the vote, voted &quot;yes&quot; in the referendum.
According to these results, &quot;No&quot; received 28%, 7% of the votes were invalid and 0.7% of the ballots were empty.
In order for the draft Constitution to be adopted, it had to get half the votes plus one.
Two polls at the exit from the polling stations and an NGO calculation predicted a clear &quot;yes&quot; victory on Sunday, with them ranging from 63% to 70%.
Rafael Correa demanded the victory of his draft Constitution on the night of Sunday to Monday.
&quot;The constitution has won outright,&quot; he assured and congratulated the Ecuadorians at Guayaquil Governorate, 280 kilometers southwest of Quito.
It goes without saying that Rafael Correa received congratulations from Chávez and Morales, but also from his Chilean counterpart, Michelle Bachelet.
The vote, which, according to the Organization of American States (OEA) observation mission, took place calmly, concerned a 444-point text building the &quot;new socialism&quot; promoted by the president.
The draft Constitution sanctifies the power of the state over the economy by reserving to it the &quot;development planning&quot; of a country living primarily from the extraction of oil by foreign companies and from the foreign exchange sent by its emigrants.
The proposal, sponsored by Correa, which was elected in 2006, also extends the powers of the Head of State, who will be able to exercise two consecutive four-year terms of office and will be able to dissolve the House.
Correa has already announced that he will make use of this power and will run for a new mandate in February 2009.
Among other things, the constitution reinforces the principle of free health care and education, which the president began to implement in a country with a population of 13.9 million, where 50% of the population lives below the poverty line.
Finally, it also envisages banning the presence of foreign troops, ending an agreement between Washington and Quito to use the Ecuadorian base as a starting point for US drug operations.
Obama won on points in the first television duel
Friday&#39;s first debate between the two candidates at the White House was followed by a second debate to find out who John McCain and Barack Obama had won.
The command tents of the Republican and Democrat campaigns were not surprised when they both declared their victory in a television duel watched by a third of American families.
Political analyst David Gergen believes that John McCain&#39;s performance, however decent, was not &quot;brilliant&quot; enough to allow him to stop the decline in polls five weeks before the presidential election.
The Gallup Institute, whose poll published on Saturday gives Obama a five-point lead (49% to 44% for McCain) says the Democrat is the winner of the duel.
Among the undecided voters who matter, Obama is the winner for 39% of respondents, while, according to a CBS survey, 25% attribute the victory to McCain.
Obama should be able to confirm his leadership on Thursday with the expected good performance of his fellow candidate, Joseph Biden, during the first and only public debate with his rival Sarah Palin.
&quot;It would be a mistake to underestimate her.
She&#39;s talented, &quot;Bill Clinton pointed out over the weekend.
Seventy-year-old McCain consistently highlighted his undeniable experience in foreign policy, while emphasizing his opponent&#39;s &quot;naivety&quot; on the issues that formed the core of the first encounter.
&quot;Senator Obama doesn&#39;t seem to understand that ...&quot; the accusation was repeated.
&quot;I don&#39;t think Senator Obama has the experience and knowledge to become president,&quot; he said.
Republican TV commercials have been carried in such an offensive spirit since yesterday.
Obama, on the other hand, stressed that he represented the future.
He did not lose his head and proved to be concise and precise.
He highlighted his ability to make the right decisions and restore the United States&#39; reputation in the world.
&quot;McCain still doesn&#39;t understand, while Obama does,&quot; he said in a Democratic spot over the weekend, reproaching the Republican for failing to take sufficient account of the impact of the crisis on the &quot;ordinary American.&quot;
&quot;During the 90-minute debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you,&quot; Obama said yesterday in front of 20,000 people gathered at a North Carolina election meeting in heavy rain.
He didn&#39;t even utter words like &quot;middle class&quot; or &quot;working class.&quot; The financial breakdown clearly favors Obama, whom Americans consider more capable of saving the economy at the edge of the abyss.
&quot;Next week could be a turning point,&quot; influential Democratic Senator Charles Schumer estimated yesterday.
Democrat Rahm Emanuel, a former member of the Clinton administration, likened Obama&#39;s &quot;economic foresight&quot; to what Bill Clinton had during the 1998 financial crisis.
For the Democrat candidate, the current disaster is &quot;the final verdict of eight years of bad economic policy, as pursued by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain.&quot;
The Illinois senator reaffirmed that despite unexpected jumps on Wall Street, he should be able to reduce taxes by 95% of Americans, and noted that realizing the country&#39;s eventual energy independence by promoting renewable energy is his number one priority, along with the introduction of a health insurance system. .
McCain, in turn, plans to build a park with 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
Both candidates cautiously avoided questions about the $ 700 billion (€ 470 billion) financial aid plan adopted by Congress last night, which is highly unpopular.
&quot;What about you, did you notice that there were any elections in Minsk?&quot;
Young people and opponents of the regime demonstrated on Sunday evening in the main square of the Belarusian capital to reject the results of the parliamentary elections in advance.
Hundreds of Belarusians gathered Sunday night after the closure of polling stations in Minsk&#39;s main square to protest against the irregularity of parliamentary elections.
Although no results have been announced yet, many young people have come to demonstrate against President Lukashenko&#39;s regime: &quot;dictator, resignation.&quot;
Some admit that they did not even go to the polls: &quot;What would it be like if they still do what they want with my vote,&quot; says one young man.
They do not believe that this regime, which has been friendly to foreign observers with a view to resuming negotiations with the European Union, would be ready to make a turn towards democracy.
Sanctions, including a visa ban on 40 Belarusian chiefs and a freeze on some assets, could be lifted if the election is considered clean by observers.
According to the opposition, this was not the case.
&quot;We were kept away from the election commissions and our observers were not allowed to take part in the counting of votes,&quot; complained Yuri Potemkin, a spokesman for the Union of Democratic Forces, a diverse group of 12 parties.
&quot;This is a cosmetic change,&quot; emphasizes Alexander Milinkevich, a former opposition candidate in the 2006 presidential election and a leader of the pro-European movement, &quot;because it matters who counts the votes, and in our country it is the executive.
If any opposition MPs get into parliament, it will be by being appointed, not elected.
However, their entry into parliament can mean space on television, meetings in the regions and bills. &quot;
The opposition therefore feels obliged to participate in the political functioning, because &quot;dialogue with the European Union needs to be launched.
If our economy, deeply indebted to Russia, is hit by the crisis and we do not reform, we risk becoming a protectorate of Russia.
But we want to be independent. &quot;
The opposition fears that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which has been monitoring the elections, will not declare the elections valid.
He emphasizes that turnout seems too high and that the general introduction of early voting (26% of voters in Minsk) has opened the way for all possible manipulations.
&quot;What about you, did you notice that there were any elections?&quot; asks Social Democrat leader Alexandr Kozulin, one of the last two political prisoners released in August this year.
&quot;There was not even a foot in the polling stations.
And there will be a maximum of five opposition members in parliament, the ones who suit the regime the most. &quot;
The night silence was again in October Square.
On television, President Lukashenko and members of the Central Election Commission congratulate them on their success.
In Chad, 19 hostages were released
The Egyptian commando attacked the kidnapper of eleven tourists and their eight-member entourage, who were captured ten days ago.
They&#39;re in Cairo.
Eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian guides, held captive in the desert for ten days, were transported alive and well to the Egyptian capital on Monday.
During the morning, they were liberated by an Egyptian commando in Chad.
The hostages arrived around 3.30 pm, apparently in good shape, aboard a special aircraft at al-Maza military base, just adjacent to Cairo International Airport.
They were immediately transported, without the opportunity to speak in the press, aboard helicopters to a hospital in Maadi, a suburb of Cairo, to undergo medical examinations.
&quot;They are completely healthy&quot; and &quot;the kidnappers have not been paid a ransom,&quot; said Egyptian Tourism Minister Zohejr Garrana on the airport runway.
Since its capture on September 19 during a four-wheel drive safari at the foot of Mount Uanat, on the borders of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, a group of hostages has been dragged from one hideout to another by 35 unknown hijackers.
The group includes 11 tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian - as well as eight Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, one border guard from the director of the Aegyptous agency, the organizer of the safari.
A head of Egyptian security forces indicated that 30 members of the special forces, who approached the place on board two helicopters, set out during the night just before dawn.
&quot;There was a shootout, half the kidnappers were killed and the others fled,&quot; said the source, who wished to remain anonymous.
He indicated that a total of 150 members of the Egyptian special forces from the &quot;lightning&quot; unit were sent to Sudan, where they gained the support of German and Italian commandos.
The head of Italian diplomacy, Franco Frattini, mentioned from Belgrade, where he is currently, the role played by secret agents and units of the Italian special forces.
&quot;We have to admit that we have achieved this result thanks to the professionalism and efficiency of the people from our secret services, from the special forces,&quot; he said without further elaboration.
He also denied that a ransom was paid.
On the eve of the war, the Sudanese army said it had detained a four-wheel-drive vehicle on patrol, which had kidnappers on board, killing six, including the Chadian commander, and arresting two.
The military claimed to have been linked to a rebel group in Darfur, the Sudan Liberation Movement (SLA-U), which the movement immediately rejected.
Letters - The silent majority of the Ministry of Culture
The debate on the financing of culture fills the pages of newspapers with inch headlines and is the topic of the ongoing election campaign.
The better.
However, one area of our cultural life is still neglected.
Who will rise up to denounce the meager sums provided to small museums, archives, archaeological excavations and hunger-stricken national sites?
Which politician dares to remind the federal government of neglecting its monuments and historic buildings?
That in Quebec, as in Canada, we do not have laws that really protect our cultural heritage?
Did you know that the French Government is spending three and a half million euros to restore just Chinon Castle in the Loire Valley?
It is stated in our American neighbors in the Constitution that the protection of cultural heritage is part of the culture of Americans and that this heritage should be protected by all citizens, all elected representatives and all regional organizations, in cooperation.
In Quebec, the federation of societies for the history of Quebec, at least 40,000 volunteers grouped into 211 societies for history, monuments, archives and genealogy seek to uncover history, preserve a pile of private archives and protect archaeological remains for a few pennies.
Often, it is these companies that are the watchdogs of our monuments, driven by despair and protest as promoters and leaders launch their bulldozers at old stones and forgotten cemeteries.
When will we finally see the stands for history and monuments?
Conversation - Blood that is certain again
Yesterday, Héma-Québec celebrated the tenth anniversary of its founding and its president, Dr. Francine Décary, rightly rejoiced, as Héma-Québec became one of the most reliable and efficient blood suppliers in the world.
Above all, he regained the trust of the public, which was severely shaken after the blood-contaminated scandal in the 1980s and 1990s.
As is well known, the state blood reserve administered by the Canadian Red Cross Transfusion Department was contaminated with immune deficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus during the 1980s.
In light of this drama and a wave of public resentment, the Canadian government launched a public inquiry in February 1994, chaired by Judge Horace Krever, to explain the circumstances that led to such a tragedy and to make recommendations that the disaster not happen again.
While Judge Krever delayed delivering the report, some provinces set up a committee to plan a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, this role was taken by the Gélinea Committee.
Following Gélineau&#39;s and Krever&#39;s reports, two suppliers were established in Canada: Héma-Québec, which was to run Quebec, and the Canadian Blood Society to supply all provinces and both territories.
&quot;When Héma-Québec started its activities in 1998, barely 38% of people still had confidence in the Quebec blood system,&quot; recalls Dr. Décaryová.
&quot;The situation was daunting.
Through continuous efforts to increase the safety of blood products and constant work in this area over the coming years, we have regained public confidence, &quot;he says, proudly adding that in early 2008, almost 94% of the Quebec population already trusted Héma-Québek.
Dr. However, Décary does not lose sight of the fact that &quot;trust is something very fragile&quot;.
Since its founding on September 28, 1998, Héma-Québec has applied the precautionary principle.
&quot;At that time, we saw many cases of the human form of mad cow disease in Europe, a new variant of the disease called Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease,&quot; says the woman, who has run the company since its inception in 1998.
&quot;And we had no idea if the disease could spread through the blood.
We therefore relied on one of the basic recommendations of the Krever and Gélineau report, according to which, when we do not know it and when the spread of a serious disease is at stake, in this case Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which is characterized by degeneration of the brain inevitably leading to death, exclusionary measures need to be taken.
In April 1999, therefore, we rejected blood from people who had been in the United Kingdom for more than a month since 1980.
A few years ago, it was safely proven that this disease is transmitted through blood.
So this episode showed us that it made sense to stick to the precautionary principle. &quot;
In 1999, a much more accurate technique for detecting HIV appeared on the market: nucleic acid (NAT) tests, which allow the presence of the virus itself to be detected directly in donor blood, rather than the presence of antibodies on which the tests used previously were based.
NAT tests have made it possible to shorten the dead time that occurs between the moment the patient becomes infected and the moment when the first viruses can be detected in the blood by our techniques, the specialist explains.
We were able to shorten this period to less than a week.
In this way, we have significantly reduced the risk that some donors could become infected without knowing it and without knowing it.
These improvements have made it possible to significantly reduce the risk of acquiring AIDS through blood transfusions.
Today, one in 12 million people is at risk of getting HIV-contaminated blood.
&quot;In other words, 12 million blood products will need to be distributed before someone can get HIV.
Because Héma-Québec distributes 400,000 to 500,000 blood products each year, it will take 24 years for the first case of HIV transmission through a blood product to occur.
I think that today we can get or prescribe a blood transfusion necessary for healing in complete peace of mind, &quot;says the head of the Héma-Québek management.
&quot;The challenge for the next decade is to keep our products safe.
We never know what pathogenic element may appear in the system.
Just last year, the chikungunya virus appeared on the island of Réunion, which, like the West Nile virus, is transmitted to the blood by stinging insects.
We need to be constantly vigilant, &quot;Dr. Décary continues, stressing that in addition to a secure supply, Héma-Québec must also count on a sufficient supply.
&quot;Needs are growing as the population ages.
As a result of more aggressive cancer treatment, patients often need a new dose of red blood cells or platelets.
The aging of the population also has implications for the blood donor network, which on average consists of only 3% of Quebecs eligible for donation. &quot;
Every healthy person is at least 18 years old, meeting the eligibility criteria, but can only donate blood once every 56 days, that is, six times a year.
14% of people offering blood are not accepted on average because they are carriers of AIDS or malaria, for example, and if they have visited a country where mud fever is rampant, they are excluded for one year.
&quot;With this 3%, we can maintain a condition that meets the needs of hospitals.
Deficiencies are very rare.
However, the members of the donor network need to be supplemented in proportion to how they age and can no longer donate blood.
However, persuading people to donate blood is difficult, especially keeping them and encouraging them to become regular donors.
Life today is so unfettered that we seldom find an hour to donate blood, &quot;laments Francine Décary.
With an annual budget of $ 297 million, Héma-Québec supplies not only blood products, but also human tissue, such as bone grafts, heart valves, eyeballs, and skin, which is almost exclusively used for major burns.
These tissues are analyzed, processed and frozen before being stored at Héma-Québek, which also manages the only public umbilical cord blood bank in Quebec.
Formerly considered biomedical waste, the umbilical cord is rich in stem cell-rich blood that can be used to treat serious diseases such as leukemia.
&quot;A few weeks ago, we celebrated the deposit of our thousandth umbilical cord blood sample in a bank, and we expect to take over a thousand a year.
At the beginning of next year, we should start offering them for transplants, &quot;explains Dr. Décary, who describes the umbilical cord blood collection program as very popular.
&quot;Some mothers are disappointed that they do not have access to it,&quot; because Héma-Québec does not have enough resources to offer this comprehensive and expensive program to all hospitals in Quebec.
Football - Impact in the semifinals
Impact Montréal qualified for the semifinal round of the USL First Division elimination series yesterday at Saputo Stadium during the second and decisive quarterfinal match of the total number of goals, thanks to a 3: 1 victory (4: 3 is the goal balance after both matches) over the Seattle Sounders.
Midfielder Antonio Ribeiro scored the decisive goal in the 90th minute.
After a goalless goal in the first half, midfielder David Testo and Rocco Plancentino netted the remaining two goals of the Montreal formation.
Roger Levesque was the only one who managed to deal with Matt Jordan in favor of the Sounders.
Recall that on Friday during the first of two quarterfinal matches, Impact suffered a 2: 1 defeat at the Starfire Complex in Tukville, a suburb of Seattle.
Impact will compete in the semifinals of their strength with the Whitecaps from Vancouver.
On Saturday night in Minnnesota, Thunder leveled a 3: 1 deficit in the home game and eventually won 4: 3, but the Whitecaps still advanced to the semifinal round with a total number of goals of 5: 4.
Impact is scheduled to face Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but details of the series will be confirmed today.
In short - Kovalev&#39;s winning goal
The first attacking trio of Canadien are ready to start the season.
A unit composed of Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekance and Andrei Kosticin last night at the Center Bell encouraged the attack to win Canadien 3: 2 on separate raids.
Kosticin, the biggest star of the match, scored a goal, Plekanec amassed two assists and Kovalev reaped one pass in this fourth tricolor victory out of six preparatory matches.
Kovalev secured the victory by scoring a single goal during the individual raids.
&quot;I&#39;m not ready yet,&quot; Rus warned.
&quot;I need one more match to feel good.&quot;
&quot;He tried to do too much in the first period,&quot; Guy Carbonneau said.
&quot;But I think he appreciated the end of the match.
He had a nice round of applause. &quot;
Charest bets north
The prime minister does not rule out that he will call early elections by the end of the year
Immediately after the Congress of the Liberal Party (Parti libéral), Jean Charest moved to Jean-Talon in Quebec, where the new Minister of Health, Yves Bolduc (left), is running in today&#39;s by-elections.
&quot;Push the boundaries of our last great northern border&quot;: this is the long-term ambition that Jean Charest presented yesterday in a visually appealing way at the end of the Liberal Party Congress in Lévis, without giving details.
During his speech, pictures were projected behind him in a kind of picture mill.
A loop of remarkable images of hydroelectric dams, mines, Quebec from the point of view of &quot;Google Maps&quot;, maps, etc. ran on three huge canvases.
Generous resources, similar to the pre-election period.
At the press conference, the prime minister refused to rule out calling early elections in the autumn, even though he pointed out that he had a very busy schedule.
The &quot;Plan North&quot; forms the fourth dimension of the &quot;vision&quot; that the prime minister intends for Quebec, the vision of a &quot;new economic space&quot; that includes a labor agreement with France, a convention between Canada and Europe, and agreements with Ontario.
Despite the fact that the Prime Minister has often mentioned the opening of the North - the northern territory on the 49th parallel - in his statements recently, it has never been the subject of a presentation.
However, the prime minister merely explained why the North was a &quot;gem with huge potential&quot;, but did not state the date, the amount of investment, or a clear priority in future projects.
At most, he mentioned several approaches to points that could be further elaborated: in particular hydropower, the forest, but above all the mining sector, encouraged by the growth of rapidly developing countries and the renewal of public infrastructures.
North, according to Charest&#39;s list, contains &quot;nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and even diamonds.&quot;
This &quot;territory twice the size of France is in our country&quot;, &quot;is in Quebec.
And he is not just with us, but he is in us, &quot;he stressed, as if to show that he was invoking a certain national founding myth.
Quebec was built largely in relation to the North, highlighted by the Prime Minister: the hunt for gold in Abitibi, Quebec engineering, James Bay.
&quot;It&#39;s ours, it&#39;s our future,&quot; he added after pausing theatrically to look at the huge map behind him.
The north, 70% of Quebec&#39;s territory, includes part of Labrador, which Quebec has always demanded, the prime minister specified during a press conference.
&quot;This is a traditional position that has been repeated by all previous governments.
There is one borderline for which there is no longer a convention, and if the opportunity arises, I will take this position again on behalf of the government, &quot;he suggested.
Otherwise, &quot;our vision for the North also needs to be rethought in the context of climate change,&quot; he said, referring to the north-west crossing, which will open all year round due to the melting of glaciers.
In this new geopolitical context, the prime minister believes that taking over territory becomes an obligation.
And what about the inhabitants of the territory, the indigenous peoples and the Inuit?
The prime minister said that the Quebec government would be very attentive to them and that the project would benefit them, especially the young.
Two former ministers from two different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (a former Pequist MP from Ungava), have already begun negotiations with about 30 communities.
The inter-ministerial committee, chaired by Benoît Pelletier and chaired by Julie Boulet (Transport and Natural Resources), has opened.
The prime minister does not rule out a big meeting, &quot;not necessarily a summit&quot;, but a moment when &quot;a common vision will be set&quot;.
The development of the North should, moreover, be conducted in accordance with the principles of sustainable development.
The North Plan will be &quot;jointly designed, structured and environmentally friendly,&quot; he promised.
Jean Charest described this &quot;vision&quot; as seamlessly following the vision of the liberal prime ministers who preceded him.
&quot;Like the liberals who preceded us, we have changed our mindset to turn challenges into new opportunities for growth and development.&quot;
This was, after all, one of the ever-shaken themes of the weekend, which began on Friday with a large cocktail highlighting the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage&#39;s leadership.
One of the adopted resolutions proposes to rename the Beauharnois headquarters to the Adélard-Godbout dam.
&quot;From Godbout, who founded Hydro-Québec, through Lesage, who carried out the Peaceful Revolution and the nationalization of hydropower, to Bourass, who created James Bay, our party has been able to shape the future,&quot; said Jean Charest.
At a press conference, he referred to another authority, this time conservative, namely John Diefenbaker&#39;s &quot;Roads to the North&quot; program, premiered from 1957 to 1963.
When it was time for the Eastmain1a-Ruper hydroelectric power station, Charest stressed that its launch was planned for 2012.
&quot;I&#39;m only saying this between us, but I plan to be there,&quot; he confided to his membership base, causing a great deal of applause.
The same prime minister, who said in April that there would be no elections in 2008, and no doubt in 2009, did not rule out the possibility of calling elections in the autumn of this year, which is allowed by law.
However, he stressed that his program is busy, especially with the mission of the Federal Council in China and the Quebec-New York summit.
The weekend congress provided the Liberal leader with a platform for some nationalist resolutions, in particular certain &quot;efforts to change the constitution&quot;, which went very smoothly: the PLQ (Liberal Party of Quebec) calls in particular for recognition of the &quot;specificity of Quebec&quot; in the Constitution.
He also hopes that Quebec will appoint some members of the Canadian Broadcasting Council, who would have a veto over decisions taken in Quebec.
On the part of the opposition, Plan North was skeptical in its main features.
PQ (Parti Québecois) chief Pauline Marois has again pulled out the North Quebec Development Policy, launched by the Landry government in 2001.
According to her, when the Liberal government came to power in 2003, it renounced its implementation.
If she stuck to it, &quot;we would be on today,&quot; Marois remarked alongside her candidate in Jean-Talon (where the election takes place today) Françoise Mercure.
ADQ said it would support the adoption of Plan North in the government.
&quot;But we wish it wasn&#39;t just theater,&quot; explained Sébastien Proulx, leader representing Maria Dumont, who is returning from vacation today.
Letters - Dishonored Land
It was Vic Toews, the former &quot;justice&quot; (oh irony) in Harper&#39;s cabinet, who dared to say last summer about Louise Arbor that he was a &quot;disgrace&quot; to Canada.
To humiliate a woman who has waged a relentless struggle for justice and who deserves all our admiration says a lot about the prime minister&#39;s neighborhood and Stephen Harper himself.
We have before us a government which, as the only Western country involved, has not transferred back to its homeland its national detained in the Guantánamo concentration camp.
The government does not take into account at all the time that Omar Khadr was a young adolescent at the time of the acts alleged against him.
The only government that, despite signing the Geneva Convention, denies its word and lets a child soldier rot in inhumane conditions.
The only one that relies on a parody of justice to assess the guilt of the accused.
Recall that UNICEF, Amnesty International, and in particular the Association of Canadian Lawyers are advocating the repatriation of Omar Khadr so that a fair trial can take place in Canada.
The same government is turning a blind eye to torture: it cares little that this young man is psychologically destroyed in the future, and no doubt permanently, after so many years of torment.
We don&#39;t realize it, but we&#39;re just witnessing a creeping erosion of our rights, our freedom, and our &quot;democracy,&quot; a word that Harper is so proud of that sounds so empty of his mouth.
The time has come when there is no more morality: it is possible to torture a Canadian citizen, to mistreat him, to imprison him according to the will of the head of the hitherto minority government (as will be the case after October 14 ...).
Many voters believe they will find salvation in a party that proclaims Virtue, Law, and Order: they do not see that this government has renounced what formed the reputation and seriousness of our country.
It is a shame, Mr. Toews, in this renunciation, and not elsewhere.
Opinions - Barrick Gold&#39;s Orwell Discourse
In the September 17 issue, Le Devoir printed a letter from Patrick J. Garver, executive vice president of the Canadian mining company Barrick Gold.
With Orwell&#39;s logic, he confirms that the world&#39;s largest gold producer has prosecuted three authors and a poor small publishing house for defamation to provoke a &quot;transparent public debate&quot; and is demanding six million from them.
If it is true that judges are independent and impartial, they do not judge truthfulness, especially in the case of defamation prosecutions, but the law.
Not surprisingly, Garver completely ignores this fundamental distinction.
Or is it the best way for Barrick Gold to conduct a public debate, to bring to ruin anyone who dares to defend the opposite position?
Whatever the outcome of the trial, the authors and publisher of Noir Canada will be forced to spend respectable sums in order to be prepared to defend and fight in a very unbalanced battle with an army of lawyers backed by almost bottomless pockets of the mining company.
The tactic in these unbalanced battles, moreover, often consists in the bankruptcy of the defendants in order to enforce a conciliation procedure, which will close the mouth of the other party and, moreover, frighten anyone who would dare to do so.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, it should have presented its point of view to public opinion.
Contrary to what is happening in several countries where Barrick Gold operates, in Canada, the debate is normally about exchanging ideas, not batons.
So all the mining companies had to do were open their books, their documentation, and set up a real debate through newspapers, the media, publications, and the funding of independent scientific teams that could shed light on the matter.
However, Barrick Gold does not seem to have confidence in public opinion and has flatly rejected petitions and letters in support of the authors of Noir Canada.
Perhaps Garver could explain how he could demand a &quot;public debate&quot; while despising the views of the same public?
In the Vice President&#39;s world, the word seems to refer only to bold lawyers, not all Canadians; this is a rather narrow conception of the term.
In a democracy, even nightmares have the right to speak.
Barrick Gold does not understand - or does not want to understand - that the public, which supports the authors and publishers of Noir Canada, does so primarily because it rejects the brutal ways of the mining company.
The public is ready to hear Barrick and assess the case, but on the basis of a civilized exchange of arguments, not in what many see as a prosecution to put the defendant&#39;s mouth shut (in the prosecution of &quot;public debate&quot;, Barrick has just given a formal call the authors of Noir Canada to officially notify them that they should stop using this term ...).
Leaving aside Garver&#39;s surreal speech, the prosecution initiated by Barrick Gold is a direct attack on the university&#39;s freedom of research and the search for truth, which are essential to any democratic society.
Overall, it denies the right to cite credible sources and to debate the facts and interpretations that are the very basis of intellectual activity.
If it is impossible in a country like Canada to study and discuss topics that are not pleased with the rich companies of this world without being repeatedly prosecuted, who else can do it?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, it could have formed it if it had followed the scientific standards used by the authors of Noir Canada.
He has the right to reply.
The university environment to which we belong has long been able to manage debates and disagreements and resolve conflicts.
Barrick Gold&#39;s exaggerated lawsuit clearly shows that, despite what it claims, it has no desire to have a transparent debate.
It is a loss for the university world, as it is for the public debate in Canada, and it is time for governments to put in place measures to curb this type of unjustified prosecution.
Wall Street rescue operations - Democrats and Republicans understand
The Bush administration and congressional leaders, both Republicans and Democrats, finally reached an agreement yesterday on the largest economic rescue plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
A new version of the plan to curb the financial crisis that has plagued Wall Street for months with $ 700 billion has yet to be approved by both chambers of Congress.
In particular, it envisages: better control of elected representatives over its application, new mechanisms to ensure repayment of public money, new measures to capture the number of houses confiscated for non-payment, and the right to monitor the level of salaries paid to executives of rescued companies.
US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Republican leader Senator Judd Gregg announced the good news yesterday, after midnight, after the end of a two-day negotiating marathon.
&quot;We have made great progress and reached an agreement that will be effective in the markets,&quot; said the Bush administration&#39;s chief, Henry Paulson.
&quot;Everything has been done to keep the real economy and ordinary Americans safe from the Wall Street crisis,&quot; the Democrat explained.
&quot;This is a crucial point: if we do not, the trauma, chaos and disruption of Americans&#39; daily lives will be enormous,&quot; said Republican Judd Gregg.
In the last few hours, negotiations have been in full swing for fear of the effect that another failure would have on the mood of investors.
The set time limit was the opening of the markets this morning.
Both US presidential candidates were invited to the negotiations later, and both were more in favor of the agreement, but did not fail to express their dissatisfaction with the need to resort to such a last resort.
Democratic Sen. Barack Obama has noted that the agreement has been supplemented by some measures, in particular to enable homeowners to retain their residence, and measures on the salaries of managers of state-rescued companies.
&quot;When we ask taxpayers to take special measures because of the irresponsibility of some people, there is nothing to congratulate.
However, these measures are necessary, &quot;he explained on television.
His Republican rival, John McCain, who was asked by another station whether he would vote for the proposed plan, replied: &quot;I would like to see the details, but I hope so.&quot;
&quot;The rough features I&#39;ve read [show] that this is something we will all have to spend and move forward with.
Choosing inaction is simply unacceptable, &quot;he said.
The goal of the $ 700 billion plan is to buy out dubious receivables and risky and unsaleable assets of American financial institutions for taxpayers&#39; money.
The plan comes after 14 months of crisis triggered by the bursting of the housing bubble, which first led to the collapse of subprimes, then moved to other, more widespread forms of credit (PCAA) and resulted in a cash freeze and the breakdown of banks and financial institutions.
Republican deputies are responsible for the collapse of last week&#39;s first draft agreement.
Ever since Democrats agreed that some &quot;toxic&quot; assets of troubled companies would only be liable by the government but would not buy them out, there is a belief that the impasse has been averted.
In an effort to reconcile conflicting views in Congress, a measure has been added stating that the government will be able to introduce new fees to help it recover its deposit if it has to bear losses for five years as a result of the program.
The new plan envisages a first deposit of 250 billion, to which another 100 billion can be added if the president deems it necessary.
The deposit of another 350 billion should be approved by Congress in a new vote.
In exchange for his help, Washington will acquire stakes in the rescued companies, which will pay him dividends in the event of a profit, and which he will be able to resell when it&#39;s all over.
The federal government will be able to delay the foreclosure procedures associated with the loans covered by the plan, as well as set limits on the amount of valuations and compensation paid to executives of affected companies.
The planners would like to put it to the vote in the House of Representatives today and in the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite all the efforts made, it is not yet certain whether their plan will be green.
Yesterday, votes continued to rise against this project in both the Republican and Democratic camps.
&quot;Obviously, Washington can&#39;t hear you,&quot; Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the House Finance Committee, told voters.
&quot;Yes, we have a serious financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But making money on taxpayers is not the answer. &quot;
Democratic Representative Brad Sherman, moderator of a group of congressmen nicknamed the &quot;Skeptics Committee,&quot; presents the matter differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
&quot;Four hundred esteemed professors of economics, including three Nobel Prize winners, wrote to us: We ask Congress not to hurry too much and to examine carefully which way to go,&quot; he said yesterday.
At the same time, it has been reaffirmed in Europe that this crisis is a world crisis.
Following the extraordinary meeting, three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalization of the Fortis banking group for 11.2 billion euros (16.3 billion USD).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg became necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas announced that it was withdrawing from the purchase of its competitor, which is on the verge of collapse since losing 2 billion euros (2.9 billion USD) due to the crisis of risky real estate loans in the United States.
Fortis employs 85,000 people, is one of the twenty largest European banks and one of the ten largest insurers.
&quot;We will not lose this money,&quot; Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos said yesterday.
&quot;In return, we gain the right to vote in the bank and influence.
And this is exactly what savers and households can appreciate in today&#39;s uncertain times. &quot;
On the other side of the English Channel, the British government seems to have begun nationalizing another bank affected by the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government was to take over all existing loans from Bradford and Bringley, of which more than 41 billion ($ 75.5 billion) were loans for the purchase of real estate.
According to its announcement yesterday, the Spanish bank Santander will buy branches and accounts of British bank clients.
Bradford and Bringley will be the second bank after Northern Rock that the British government must nationalize since the beginning of the financial crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - The death of a socially engaged icon
His beauty with azure eyes had long been his trump card, others weakness.
Did this American actor with a charming smile break free from narcissism?
Yes and no.
The shyness, sensitivity, and unrelenting talent that was inherent in him also distanced him from the power category that breeds real stars.
But what a long-distance runner he was!
Paul Newman died Friday at the age of 83 on his ranch in Connecticut of lung cancer and remains one of the last icons of the fat years of American cinema.
Less magnificent than Brando, to whom he was like and for a long time somehow his rival on the screen, Newman was a more cautious actor, certainly more fragile, but also an apostle of freedom and the disintegration of dramatic conventions.
Mixed blood often gives birth to beautiful children.
Born in Ohio in 1925, his father was a German Jew and his mother was of Hungarian descent.
From these European roots, one of the famous faces of the American dream was born.
Without exaggerated ego, which is the last sign of quality.
Because it saw the whole country in love with self-made mana, a war warrior in the Pacific, wounded in battle, who studied acting at Yale in the early 1950s, then attended New York&#39;s Actor&#39;s Studio and celebrated a triumph in theater, television and soon in film.
The same man who fought for civil rights was also the second car racer to compete in the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1979, and a sex symbol, despite having been a model couple with actress Joanne Woodward since 1958. .
With him also leave the shadows of this hidden, discreet, socially engaged star, allergic to the fuss of his own show business, which will forever remain to some extent mysterious.
A decent man, in the noblest sense of the word.
Paul Newman&#39;s departure this weekend has made the film&#39;s lovers dizzy, while his big roles compete with each other on the black screen of memories.
After it, more than half a century of ever-changing American seventh art parades.
A charming cowboy from Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969) reappears in his memory, a young man who rejects his sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in Cat on a Hot Roof, a 1958 adaptation of Tennessee Williams.
From the less distant past (1990), we recall his sensitive Mr. Bridge, disturbed at an advanced age by a marriage that did not meet all expectations.
So many other Paul Newmans went down in history.
Boxer Rocky Graziano, Robert Wise&#39;s battered, violent, unforgettable offender from Somebody Up There Likes Me, a role for James Dean, taken over after his death, which made Newman truly famous in 1956.
A sympathetic gangster in the absolutely great The Sting, an Oscar for best film in 1973.
A bitter and vengeful snooker player in the amazing The Hustler by Robert Rossen (1961), he plays the same character in Martin Scorsese&#39;s The Color of Money, which will bring him the only Oscar of seven nominations in 1987.
This face wandering the ages, it was him.
And he again.
In his career, different epochs compete with each other.
Young people know him mainly thanks to the cult Slap Shot by George Roy Hill (1977) from the role of Reggie Dunlop, a non-traditional hockey coach.
Fans met him again in 1994 at The Hudsucker Proxy of the Coen brothers.
He then ended his career as the godfather of the Irish mafia in Sam Mendes&#39; Road to Perdition in 2003.
Unlike several film legends who left the craft relatively soon, Newman remained in the industry for a long time, although he condemned Hollywood with its tinsel, pomp, and concessions.
French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier, not without humor, considered it &quot;a living challenge of underplaying&quot;, judging that in his performances he put too much pressure on the saw.
For the beautiful Paul Newman, to whom the roles came as a tray, the profession was not always so tender.
However, he played the first lovers less often than outsiders: neurotics, alcoholics, thugs and desperate people, whose declines and rebellions were reflected in his perfect features.
As a director, Newman revealed little-known aspects of his shy sensitivity.
His Rachel film, 1968&#39;s Rachel (based on the Canadian novel by Margaret Laurence), starring his wife Joanne Woodward, presents a sensitive female portrait full of melancholy.
In 1984, he dedicated the film Harry and Son, a work full of shame and sadness, to his son Scott, whom he lost due to an overdose.
In a flurry of honors that Newman received yesterday, his great friend and former comrade-in-arms Robert Redford (who played together in The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) said sadly, &quot;His presence has made my life and this country better.&quot;
Generosity, love of life, such are the main qualities of a deceased actor.
Leaving aside his legendary career, the great fighter for civil rights, ecology, independent film and opponents of Hollywood&#39;s decline are also leaving.
We used to see his likeness on bottles of wine vinegar, sauces, biscuits and other foods, which may have seemed quite tasteless, although at first it was a gag.
However, the profits from the sale went to the account of his Hard Childhood Foundation.
Newman thus engaged in society until the last moment, rather than being swayed by fame.
He left a letter to his five daughters containing the following sentences: &quot;Always and until the end, your father was grateful to his happy planet.
I was honored to be here. &quot;
And it was an honor for us to be able to follow the career of such a clairvoyant and generous American artist.
And besides, after all, an exemplary citizen.
What was produced in the invoice factory of Zuschlag &amp; spol.?
Soon, on October 8, the trial will begin in criminal proceedings against János Zuschlag and his associates.
In addition to other crimes, including forgery of documents, a politician and his associates are accused of fraud committed on a long-term and systematic basis by a criminal organization, which has resulted in extremely significant damage.
According to the prosecutor&#39;s office, they used the money obtained in public tenders for their own purposes and often proved the fulfillment of tasks with fictitious invoices.
Money from the state and local governments - a total of about 65 million forints - went partly to the treasury of Fiatal Baloldal, partly to the pockets of individuals.
The method, which was also reported by the investigating authority, was that the money obtained in the tenders was collected on the basis of invoices, for which there was no real consideration, and the associations never received the commitments entered into.
According to the indictment, a large part of the invoices were false.
The forms for these invoices came from the Józsefváros market, round stamps were made in Kiskunhalas.
The names of which companies the invoices should be produced were decided, among other things, on a round trip along the northern shore of Lake Balaton, to which János Zuschlag sent István Lados.
According to his statement, the former was to look for guesthouses and restaurants.
In them, he applied for bills for his consumption, according to whose model invoices submitted in public tenders issued by, among others, the Ministry of Youth and Sports, the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs, and the Municipal Government, respectively, were produced.
Invoices were mostly issued by István Lados and his partner András Őri, who, according to our information, most often wrote the reports needed to obtain subsidies.
During his &quot;study trip&quot;, Lados found a beer hall.
According to two invoices issued by Zuschlag and his associates in 2003, the hospitality establishment provided catering for a group of 90 from the Biztos Pont association.
However, according to the head of the company, so many people would not fit into this facility at once.
The invoice issued in the summer of 2002 to a foundation called Jobb Jövőért, later Együtt and Harmadik Évezredért, was also full of formal and substantive errors.
The guest house in Badacsonytomaj had only three rooms, more than ten people could not sleep in it one evening, yet the invoice stated one hundred and thirty guests.
Fillers of forms with a rich imagination, however, exaggerated this even when they listed on the documents a company also engaged in hospitality - Pigal sro, in whose accounting, according to information provided by the Public Prosecutor&#39;s Office, documents in the name of Jobb Jövőért and Hoppá did not even figure.
Győző Farkas, the company&#39;s manager, told hvg.hu that when he was summoned to the prosecutor&#39;s office and shown him the invoices, he knew immediately that they were fake documents.
&quot;Our business name and tax number were in the wrong place on the stamp.&quot;
As he added, apart from the formalities, it did not agree that according to the invoice, they accommodated a hundred people, as they have only eleven rooms that do not have such a large capacity.
In addition, meals were also listed on the invoice, and their restaurant has not been open for a long time.
The zealous invoice producers were not convinced that the sought-after Budapest travel agency only organized foreign trips, and they foolishly stated on the invoice with payment in cash, which also did not coincide with the company&#39;s invoicing practice, as a travel agency in Hungary.
In addition, according to the investigation, they also mentioned VAT in the document, although the organization of trips to countries outside the European Union was exempt from VAT.
On four documents issued to the Jobb Jövőért Foundation by Hotel Révfülöp sro, the amount of VAT did not agree, among other things. The company&#39;s activities are not subject to the above-mentioned 25% VAT, but 15% VAT, in addition, the hotel employees issued only printed invoices, but the invoice produced was handwritten.
In addition, the &quot;issuers&quot; spoiled the invoice, for example, by stating, as a result of an investigation by the Public Prosecutor &#39;s Office, the road transport of goods, which was not carried out by a company originally based on investment advice, as an activity.
The fact that the invoices are issued to the Együtt and Harmadik Évezredért Foundation and to the XXI. Századi Kulturális Egyesület and Biztos Pont false, in addition, also collapsed due to formal deviations - inconsistent format of the invoice and a false stamp.
As in the case of Ravenna ks or the Kunfehértó Sports Camp, whose representatives denied that they issued invoices.
For example, the counterfeiters did not notice that the company HIB sro from Nyíregyházy was in liquidation at the time (2001), when a group from the Fiatal Városért association ate with it, which is why, according to our information, the company&#39;s liquidation commissioner also denied that he issued the paper .
They issued invoices consciously
The second group of invoices consists of those who knew to issue a fictitious invoice.
The Eséla Budapestért Foundation issued accounts for about four million forints for the Harmadik Évezredért Foundation at the request of Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjú Szocialisták.
According to the indictment, one of the accused, Ludovic Györfi, forced the head of Collab sro to issue a fictitious account.
Biogate sr o, currently in liquidation, also cooperated with Zuschlag and its partners, which in 2003 supplied the Jobb Jövőért Foundation and the Atlasz and Vörösfenyő associations with invoices worth around HUF 5 million, which were not actually economically active.
Not even the movement of money, because the created invoices were later canceled, which, however, the organizations forgot to mention in their documents.
Another group of invoicing companies includes those that had ties to the defendants.
For example, Iván Kubatov was the authorized representative of the Ukrainian executive of Delta Trió sro, a company engaged in the trade of fuels and motor vehicles, based in Budapest, where the company cannot be found.
In October, November and December 2005, the company issued several invoices for the sale of computer equipment worth approximately HUF 18 million.
According to the information obtained from the investigation, these invoices were purchased by the Kiskunhalas company Cash Investment sro, which had been in liquidation since 14 September 2005.
The managing director of this company was a man from Romania, to whom Iván Kubatov was also to hand over documents concerning the company in 2002-2005.
As we know, Kubatov admitted during the investigation that he had issued invoices on behalf of the company to Atlasz, Hoppá and the Együtt and Harmadik Évezredért foundations and had accepted their consideration himself.
Specifically at the request of Ivan Kubatov, the companies Fa-Bani Jos Faipari sro and Jos-Investment ks were founded by Romanian masons.
In fact, none of the companies worked, according to the defendant, because they did not get a job.
Nevertheless, the companies benefited him by issuing invoices on behalf of the companies to Atlasz and the Y-Generáció affiliated to Zuschlag, at the request of his co-accused lawyer Zsolt Szente, who also prepared their charters.
On behalf of Investment, Delta Trio, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade, Kubatov gave organizations a total of 15 invoices worth HUF 14.2 million.
The prosecutor&#39;s office concluded that Kubatov received 10 percent of the amounts stated on invoices and VAT.
The man also used the company Szi-Beri kt to issue fictitious invoices, this time for a tender for the Biztos Pont association.
In January 2006, Y-Generáció and Szövetség and Modern Magyarországért submitted proposals for a public tender by the Mihály Táncsics Foundation (TMA), a public benefit organization of the Socialist Party.
They received 500 thousand forints each, but did not spend the amounts on the goals stated in the proposals.
In order not to reveal this, TMA submitted five fictitious invoices from Works Team sro
These invoices were also found during a house search in the office of Árpád Kemecsei at the Ministry of Education.
During the trial, some of the defendants are likely to describe the process of producing invoices, as they have already done at the prosecutor&#39;s office.
It may be more interesting if the main defendant, János Zuschlag, decides to reveal everything.
His statement so far is not very detailed, and although he has promised several times that he will explain everything at length, he has not yet done so.
The question is whether it is in his interest - in exchange for compensation for a large part of the damage, fifty million forints, the socialists may have reached an agreement with him and Zusi will take it upon himself.
For the time being, he may have been offended, as his requests to alleviate the conditions of his detention, namely to be placed in house arrest, have so far remained unheard.
While the perpetrators of economic crimes, who have done much greater damage that they have not yet paid, are free to walk around or at least wait for the end of the proceedings against them in their homes, he does not have this option.
The Psychology of Trump: Why Do We Spend More Money?
At auctions, customers are willing to spend more money, revaluation of goods.
Researchers in neurology and economics at New York University have been able to uncover the neurological and economic underpinnings of this well-known - and seemingly irrational - behavior.
According to their study, published in the journal Science, people do not want to lag behind in an eBay auction competition, so they prefer to pay too high a price.
The research used an experimental auction to try to map the scheme of this &quot;game&quot; in the nervous system.
One group of volunteers bet, the other group participated in a feature auction, and the active areas of the subjects&#39; brains were examined using the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) method.
In both games, participants could win money, but during the auction game, an important element of which is to overpower the other side, the whole under the cerebral cortex, called the striatum, began to function intensively during the game.
This area of the brain plays, among many other functions, a role in the &quot;self-rewarding&quot; mechanism of the nervous system.
According to the researchers, the unscrewing of the price can therefore be explained by the effort to avoid a sharp reaction of the striatum.
To support their theory, members of the research team from among economists conducted a cross-sectional financial survey.
Under different conditions, three groups bid against one partner.
The control group was simply told what the fair value of the product was, and they made bets.
In addition, members of the other group were promised that if they came out of the game victorious, they would receive another $ 15 in reward.
The third group, on the other hand, received $ 15 before the auction, but in the event of a loss, its members also lost this money.
The difference between the two groups, then, was that one emphasized winning and the other losing.
However, the members of the group playing &quot;against the loss&quot; were willing to go higher than in the control and &quot;winning&quot; group, which confirms the hypothesis of neurologists.
&quot;These results cannot be deduced from any pre - existing economic theory.
Until now, they have explained the phenomena observable at auctions of the joys of victory and avoiding risk.
Only neurological imaging methods helped us resolve the discrepancy between the two theories, so that we have now reached the third explanation, &quot;said Andrew Schotter, a professor at New York University&#39;s School of Economics.
Hepatitis: when to see a doctor?
Approximately half a billion people worldwide suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C infection, and in Hungary this chronic liver disease is listed as one of the leading causes of death.
The number of domestic cases of hepatitis infection is estimated at one hundred thousand, but only seven thousand of them are being treated. This is because patients often do not know they are infected.
The name hepatitis is a collective term for infectious liver damage caused by various viruses.
There are many similarities in their symptoms, hepatitis and jaundice are characteristic, but the pathogens and diseases caused by them differ from each other.
Depending on the pathogen, hepatitis viruses spread in two main ways: hepatitis A and E through the digestive tract (eg infected food, water), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses through blood and body fluids (semen, vaginal secretions, saliva). .
Travelers should in any case be protected by vaccination against A and B virus, there is no vaccine against type C virus.
Symptoms of hepatitis A appear two to three weeks after eating an infected meal, and are usually accompanied by nausea, weakness, abdominal discomfort, and nausea.
Then jaundice, lightened stools and urine darken on the skin and whites of the eyes. The treatment can last for two to three weeks.
Every year, millions of people around the world die from a more serious type of the disease, liver cancer and liver cirrhosis caused by hepatitis B.
The main reason is that it is estimated that only every tenth infected is treated with medication.
Hepatitis C can also have very serious consequences: if left untreated, it can lead to liver cirrhosis or liver cancer.
Most people infected do not even know about their disease, the pathogen insidiously destroys liver cells, so the first symptoms appear in many cases in 20-30 years.
That is why early prevention, regular screening, is very important.
In three groups, the disease is much more common than average: among people who had a blood transfusion before 1991, among drug users, and among people with tattoos.
Currently, the estimated worldwide number of individuals infected with the chronic hepatitis C virus is 200 million.
As the disease can already be demonstrated by routine laboratory tests, one should consult a general practitioner if he or she experiences any symptoms of unknown origin.
Upon early detection, the disease is treatable, the virus can be removed from the body, thus preventing infectivity and preventing the development of cancer.
September 30 is World Hepatitis Day, first organized worldwide in 2004 by organizations representing patients.
Its aim is to draw attention to the chronic inflammation of the liver caused by these viruses, to the causes of its occurrence and to the importance of early detection of the disease.
The Benelux government will become part of Fortis Bank
The Benelux countries will help the Belgian-Dutch bank Fortis, which was the first in Europe to get into trouble due to the spreading effects of the US mortgage market crisis, with partial nationalization: the three countries will support a financial and insurance institution that also has a stake in Hungary by 11.2 billion euros.
The Belgian, Luxembourg and Dutch governments agreed at the top level this weekend with the President of the European Central Bank and the European Commissioner for Competition.
Fortis is the first in the eurozone to have been in a major crisis in the wake of the international financial market crisis for more than a year, and decisions taken on this issue could be seen as precedents in some respects.
According to the decision, which was born on Sunday night, all three states will buy almost half (49 percent) of the bank&#39;s local assets.
The bank will sell with absolute certainty part of its capital holdings, especially - mainly insurance - activities purchased last year from the Dutch bank ABN Amro.
Shares of Fortis Bank began to fall sharply last week, with serious signs of crisis appearing in the institution in the second half of the week.
However, analysts agree that with its 85,000 employees, the bank is too big to go bankrupt.
The company&#39;s securities fell by 12 percent on Friday, to a 14-year low.
Since January, the value of shares has fallen by more than two thirds.
Given the current share prices, the group&#39;s total market capital value is around 14 billion euros, but according to company executives, this is unrealistic.
The company&#39;s management also blames the fall of Fortis shares on the uncertainty in the overseas market related to the adoption of the plan of the American package worth $ 700 billion.
Shares rose slightly on Monday.
On Friday, a new CEO, Filip Dierckx, was appointed head of the bank.
The financial institution was also looking for private buyers, but no one has yet signed up with a more serious offer.
The Belgian government has previously announced that investors do not have to worry about losing their money.
Panic has not yet broken out among the bank&#39;s clients and the branches have not been attacked.
Fortis Bank has a separate branch in Hungary and has also acquired several leasing companies.
Whoever believes in God doesn&#39;t hurt so much?
According to recent research, faith in God functions as an analgesic that could have made death easier for Catholic martyrs.
Researchers at Oxford University have conducted an interesting experiment, examining how belief in God affects the perception of pain in humans, the British daily Telegraph reported.
As part of a rather bizarre survey, they subjected 12 Catholic believers and the same number of atheists to electric shocks, while all observed a painting depicting the Virgin Mary.
According to the results, Catholic believers were able to eliminate much of the pain.
Thanks to a technique that examines the human brain in detail, it has also been shown that Catholics have been able to activate the part of their brain that is responsible for regulating pain.
The research is the first in a series of studies in which, in addition to academics, scientists, philosophers and theologians from various parts of the university also take part.
Exactly the test was performed by attaching a sparking instrument to the subject&#39;s left hand, which emitted electric shocks.
The researchers asked the participants to stare at two paintings: Sassoferrat&#39;s Virgin Mary from the 17th century and the Lady with the ermine Leonardo da Vinci, painted in the 15th century.
The authors of the research hoped that the sight of the Virgin Mary would evoke a certain state of piety in the faithful, while they chose da Vinci&#39;s painting because it did not differ much from the first and, according to them, made a calming effect.
The subjects spent half an hour on the MRI scanner, during which time they received 20 electroshocks in four consecutive sections while separately observing a religious or general image.
Catholics said they felt &quot;safe&quot; when they looked at the Virgin Mary, as if they were &quot;taken care of&quot; and &quot;calmed down, filled with peace.&quot;
They said they felt 12 percent less pain when watching the religious image than when they had Leonard&#39;s work in front of them.
Psychologist Miguel Farias, who also took part in the research, believes that a similar effect can be achieved with any highly impressive image in atheists, you just need to find the right photo.
&quot;We would have to find an image that they will perceive very positively, from the position of a mother or father,&quot; said the psychologist.
Anglican Bishop Tom Wright welcomed the results of the research.
&quot;Practicing faith should change, and in many cases change, our personalities,&quot; Wright added.
After such great results, it is only a question of what effect it would have on the regulation of the pain of the faithful if they showed them a madonna from Leonard or a painter of a similar caliber.
Would looking at a quality Virgin Mary mean achieving even better results?
You are what you share
On its tenth birthday, Google can say that people can find it in their pockets at least as well as in the sky above their heads; they know where they have been on holiday, what professional examinations they go to and what interests them.
However, according to Eric Schmidt, one of the company&#39;s bosses, that is still not enough.
However, when it comes to skeptics who draw parallels with Orwell&#39;s dark vision, the very essence of Web 2.0 is not clear to them.
Eric Schmidt recently told the Financial Times that Google&#39;s main goal is to gather even more personal information about users, which is necessary for Google&#39;s founders to stick to their original intent: &quot;Let&#39;s organize all the information in the world!&quot;
According to an interviewed Google representative, even after ten years of world-class work, the company is still at the beginning of being able to work with all the information.
Asked what it would be like in five years, Schmidt said he would like Google to be able to answer questions like &quot;what should I do tomorrow?&quot; or &quot;what kind of job would be right for me?&quot; - However, software will not be able to answer such seemingly simple questions until they know enough information about users.
Not all Internet users are well aware that during an Internet search, the search words are captured exactly, as well as from which IP address it was searched and to which pages the interested parties moved after the search.
For example, with Personalized Search launched two years ago, users can keep a history of their surfing, look back at what they searched for and clicked on, generating much more customized findings in the long run - based on the same logic and the Recommendations service, through which the system will offer us products and services based on the previously mentioned and preserved preferences.
What if my data is used against me, what if someone looks at what I&#39;m doing? - Ask users who are afraid of looking at Google&#39;s data monopoly.
In most cases, the extent of the potential power represented by the company is threatening, the counter-reaction does not evoke in Internet users a sense of guilt, fear of punishment, desire for freedom or even a revolt against power.
However, it is a confirmed fact that all search terms are not only captured, but in justified cases can also be issued to a third party, in such legal cases, the personal rights of Internet users do not protect anything.
The most notable recent example was probably the coordinated action against Brazilian pedophiles, during which Google provided the Brazilian government with information that enabled the identification of pedophiles from the Orkut community site set up through it.
However, Internet users who are worried about their personal rights could rest in May when the company, hand in hand with the electronic rights protection organization EFF, successfully proved its truth in a dispute with the FBI: Google must not be forced by any article of the constitution in the future to provide any information secretly requested by the FBI.
(At the same time, the federal government successfully won nearly 50,000 web addresses and one thousand search terms, which it obtained citing the strengthening of the Child Protection Act years ago, but still failed to get individual user search lists or complete Web site lists, and keywords covering a period of two months.)
Opinions on Google are so contradictory: it is flogged by those who fear the provision of their personal information, because they feel that their intimate sphere and privacy will be harmed by using Google&#39;s services, and they oppose it with a revolt that belongs to multinational companies with a conservative image.
Meanwhile, American geek culture and its savage offshoot, bringing together enthusiastic computer fans, activists, and users emerging in many countries, sees it as a new generation of big companies, a &quot;corporation now squirming,&quot; unlike its rival Microsoft, considered because of Windows as the conqueror of the world, however they both fight for the same goals.
This may be because Google, unlike Microsoft, does not require an identification code from its users and does not want money for its applications; an open, free and constantly fresh source of information and a package of programs seems to be much more accessible, youthful, &quot;cool&quot; than the practice of the official software giant.
However, this may also be due to the fact that geeks accurately understand the very problematic relationship between the Internet and personal rights, which has brought with it one of the most inflected keywords of recent years: web 2.0.
Web 2.0 is about nothing more than collaboration, about intentionally leaving traces behind and using the communication channels we have at our disposal, and although their scope is different for everyone, the essence remains the same: we show ourselves.
The average young person can keep a profile on several community sites from Facebook to Xang, which he can easily connect to other services, such as Twitter or the last.fm application, which records the music he listens to, he can all connect to navigation systems, such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm, and can also write a blog that will automatically display his latest photo galleries, which he stores on Flickr or Picasa.
At the same time, we can read about a lot of exemplary cases, from which it turns out: a girlfriend in the morning looking at a flood of photos of mutual friends easily finds out who her scary boy spent the evening with, or a company can fire her employee just because sincere opinion of top management: one thing is certain, the concept of private life has been completely reconsidered today.
He who lives online life consists of what he shows, so we could define the basic thesis behind the behavior of today&#39;s youth.
And if you want to keep something secret or at least avoid the Google monopoly, you have a chance (starting with Scroogl, who uses the Google search system, but intentionally leaves no traces).
For example, many people deliberately do not register on community sites so that they cannot be found. Google&#39;s online applications, from a text editor to a photo editor and news portal, can be exchanged for alternative versions that aren&#39;t connected to giant server parks and that don&#39;t build the best possible profile for us.
Public opinion is not secretly expecting Google to show its teeth.
With a current value of $ 156 billion, the company is worth more than IBM ($ 140 billion), Intel ($ 124 billion) or Coca Cola ($ 110 billion), AdWords / AdSense advertising space threatens advertising agency investment and ever-accelerating services. they seriously upset the lives not only of Microsoft, but also of many other software designers.
However, critical observers also find disturbing counter-points: for example, senior management has completely rejected employee protests after doubling the company&#39;s kindergarten fee. that Google bowed to the Chinese government in 2006 and, in accordance with their agreement, will filter out any finding that is contrary to good taste or the interests of the Chinese regime.
One of the company&#39;s internal rules is that it never advertises new services in advance until they can be used, but it is certain that the expected problems of the coming months and years may shake the world in new places: while some believe that Google&#39;s project for scanning and archiving books and magazines is becoming so large that the company will soon have to do with the US Supreme Court, others are afraid of its Health system, because in it we can compile a complete own health profile with previous findings, doctors and problems.
The fact that Google is compiling a genetic database can then serve as a good starting point for future generations of science fiction writers, Cory Doctorow&#39;s famous short story &quot;Scroogled&quot; describes with Orwell&#39;s reminiscences a future in which one can only get close to a person with the help of data. from Google.
Two juveniles helped the two-time murderer from Ózd help remove traces
Two juveniles were interrogated by the police in a case of a double murder in Ózd, and on reasonable suspicion they were helping to remove traces of this crime, a spokesman for the Borsod County High Police Directorate said on Tuesday.
The persons have confessed to the activity from which they were suspected and are currently accused of aiding and abetting the crime.
Both juveniles, according to MTI, two girls are being prosecuted at large.
Facilitating a criminal offense is punishable by up to 5 years&#39; imprisonment.
A 23-year-old man suspected of double murder in Ózd was taken into temporary custody on Sunday.
He is suspected of the crime of pre-planned multiple murders for greedy reasons.
The investigation revealed that the 23-year-old young man owed the 53-year-old a larger amount.
The suspect did not want to repay his debt, so last Wednesday he lured his creditor to an establishment in Ózd, where he first killed a man and then his 9-year-old daughter.
According to MTI, the young man was preparing to commit the crime in advance, as evidenced by the fact that he committed the murder with a weapon hidden at the crime scene.
The weapon and the circumstances of its use are examined by the police with the involvement of experts.
The Warsaw Stock Exchange has made an offer to buy the Prague Stock Exchange
Two hundred million euros - approximately five billion Czech crowns - were offered by the Warsaw Stock Exchange for the purchase of a 100% stake in the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, chairman of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed the offer made by the Polish side, despite the fact that the Czechs had previously excluded the Warsaw Stock Exchange from the circle of possible new owners of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason is the fact that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is owned by the state.
99 percent of the shares are in the hands of the Polish state, which wishes to sell 60 percent of the securities in a few months.
As the Czech economic daily E15 writes, the offer of Poles represents the highest amount that has been offered to those interested in the Prague Stock Exchange so far.
According to Czech newspapers, the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Transatlantic Stock Exchange Nasdaq, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the Deutsche Börse have submitted bids so far.
The head of the Prague Stock Exchange, Petr Koblic, said last week that the Warsaw Stock Exchange would be the worst new owner of all those interested, and did not rule out that this could lead to the demise of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
The value of the Prague Stock Exchange is estimated by stock market experts at 5-10 billion.
According to the shareholders&#39; agreement, approximately 90 percent of the shares could be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is the investment bank Patria Finance with a share of approximately 25 percent, followed by Česká spořitelna with 14.7 percent and Tiger Holding Four S. arl with 13.5 percent.
On the financial crisis from the perspective of European newspapers
In their comments on Tuesday on the deepening international financial crisis, leading European newspapers already mention &quot;the second of September 11&quot;.
We can thank the American president for the global financial catastrophe, according to Rome&#39;s La Repubblica. The president was not even able to line up his own party in support of the hastily repaid bill, which aims to remedy this desperate situation ...
Instead of the new Pearl Harbor, which was reminiscent of billionaire and investor Warren Buffett, we could talk about the second of September 11th.
Also part of the Madrid press sees the culprit in Washington.
According to El Mundo, the lack of political leadership has brought the world economy to the brink of collapse.
The danger of the collapse of the American financial system is constantly growing, for which the whole world will eventually pay for it.
Although Bush&#39;s plan was not perfect, after the vote in Congress, there is a danger that Washington will not offer a political tool for resolving the crisis.
The world economy is hanging in the air - just as one of the greatest changes in the history of capitalism is taking place.
The threat can no longer be ignored, points out the Geneva daily Tages-Anzeiger.
For now, individual states can throw a lifebuoy in a faltering financial institution, and taxpayers can save them from bankruptcy.
However, if other banks collapse like dominoes, then neither money nor further improvisation will be enough.
In the long term, the Member States of the European Union need to move beyond their national egoism and unify control over fragmented financial markets.
On Monday alone, the remaining financial institutions received more than 100 billion euros, recalls Vienna&#39;s Der Standard, according to which fears that, like the Americans, European taxpayers will have to reach deep into their pockets to solve the crisis are becoming more realistic.
The European Union has not yet taken the crisis of the old continent like a tsunami seriously.
&quot;Rescuers&quot; do not have to wave hundreds of billions of euros right away, but it would be good if they firmly determined in which case it is reasonable to reach for taxpayers&#39; money to avoid even greater damage.
A smart car imitates the flight of a bumblebee
What would probably be the best method of developing technologies capable of preventing a collision, if not imitation of obstacle detectors occurring in the natural world?
For example, in bees.
The initial strategic idea of the surprising project, presented at the Japanese trade fair CEATEC, was inspired by engineers from Nissan by bumblebees. It was about building a new generation of collision avoidance systems.
In collaboration with the University of Tokyo, Nissan has designed the BR23C-type biomimetic robotic steering system, a robotic mini-car equipped with bee features, with the ultimate goal of helping to create a system that can eliminate all collisions.
&quot;During the flight, each bee creates its own oval personal space, which is very similar to our safety cover,&quot; explained Kazuhiro Doi, brand CEO for technology PR and research and development, at the show.
An important role is played by compound eyes, which allow bees to see in all directions at a viewing angle of more than 300 degrees.
Engineers reached for the idea of a laser rangefinder to copy the function of the compound eye.
It identifies obstacles up to 2 meters in front of the BR23C in a 180-degree field of view, calculates their distance and sends a signal to the on-board microprocessor, which is immediately converted into a collision avoidance operation.
The obstacle is captured in a fraction of a second, then the robotic car begins to mimic the bee&#39;s movements and immediately changes direction by turning the wheels to the extent necessary to prevent a collision.
Unlike any existing system, this evasive maneuver takes place in a completely instinctive way.
&quot;If this were not the case, the robotic car would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles,&quot; explains Toshiuki Ando, head of the Mobility Laboratory and the robotic car project.
It must react instinctively and immediately, as this technology suits the most vulnerable and innermost layer of the safety shield, within which a collision is currently considered inevitable.
The whole process must reflect what the bee is doing to avoid other bees.
This process must not take longer than the blink of an eye.
However, unlike bees, this movement cannot be directed upwards, downwards or diagonally, it can only be two-dimensional and only in the direction in which the wheels can be turned.
Instead of the endless possibilities offered to bees by avoidance, in the case of the robotic car only the possibility of rotating movement, acceleration and deceleration was used.
The BR23C uses lithium-polymer batteries, which are lighter and have a higher energy density, which means that they have a longer life than lithium-ion variants.
According to Ando, the important thing is instinctive, intelligent response, not the ability to process, much less data storage.
This mechanism only needs to process and respond to a few incoming signals per second.
It does not need to store and respond using intuitive logic based on data from previous maneuvers, so it constantly uses only a few kilobytes of memory.
It does not need memory with gigabit or megabyte capacity.
This is the first step in the development of instant avoidance technology, which Nissan estimates could reach mass-produced cars in ten years.
Another possible application may be to connect the unit to a GPS satellite navigation system, which, after avoiding obstacles in the way, would lead the motorist to the specified final destination.
Damn dear child already has a name
The $ 700 billion bailout package, which is to be divided into several installments and aims to buy back bad loans from banks, is already in writing.
Half of the amount will be used in the first round.
After further talks, which ended on Saturday after midnight on American Eastern Time, congressional leaders reached an agreement in a several-day debate on a $ 700 billion rescue package, Reuters reported.
&quot;We have made significant progress,&quot; said Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic Speaker of the House of Representatives, who said that only an agreement had been drafted.
The compromise on the package was also supported by both presidential candidates Barack Obama and John McCain.
Finance Minister Henry Paulson said of the outcome of the compromise: &quot;The program will work and be effective, but further steps need to be taken.&quot;
The written version of the package was published before the opening of the Asian markets on Sunday at 8 pm Washington time (ie on Monday at 2 am Central European Time), but it did not cause any special rise on the stock exchanges.
The House of Representatives will first vote on the draft legal norm hearing the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, which is to establish the program, on Monday, then it will be the Senate&#39;s turn.
President George W. Bush spoke with Pelosi on Saturday night, after which news of the agreement was also welcomed in the White House.
&quot;We are pleased with the progress made last night and we very much appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy,&quot; said White House spokesman Tony Fratto.
After all, the program differs from the Bush administration&#39;s original proposal to spend as much as $ 700 billion at a time on the purchase of low-quality mortgage-backed securities.
It is now possible to spend a maximum of half of the 700 billion in the first round, with 250 billion being used immediately after Congress is expected to decide on Monday and the Treasury will buy mortgage-backed securities for them, which are valued as poor quality, the fate of the remaining $ 100 billion will then depend on the decision of the president.
The program will be overseen by a special body, of which the chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank will also be a member.
Spending the second half of $ 700 billion will depend on another decision by Congress.
In the sense of the law, the Ministry of Finance can use a combined tactic: it can simultaneously repurchase low-quality loans, mortgages and mortgage-backed securities, or other &quot;toxic&quot; loans.
The redemption can also take place through auctions directly, said the competent representatives of the ministry.
The legal norm will allow the companies concerned to participate in an insurance program in which the Ministry of Finance provides them with a guarantee for funds constituting a cause for concern, for which the company then pays a price corresponding to the amount of expected damages.
As Henry Paulson said, the law provides the necessary resources to spend up to $ 700 billion on meeting the urgent demands of the US financial system, whether it&#39;s buying large funds, insuring them badly, or preventing the systemic risk of collapsing one of the big ones. financial institutions.
&quot;We will take the necessary steps to be ready to implement the law as soon as it is signed,&quot; he added.
Bank bosses who are in trouble waiting for state help, on the other hand, can expect the government to reduce their severance pay - which is called &quot;golden parachute&quot; in overseas slang.
Their payments will be limited only in certain cases; in addition, these restrictions will depend on the method of assistance provided by the Ministry.
The restriction basically means that if the ministry buys at auction, a tax surcharge will be imposed on the golden parachutes, unless the fallen bank directors are sent directly into retirement.
In the case of the direct repurchase of substandard loans, the government will take aggressive action to ensure that money for management is not exaggerated.
It should be added that the existing contracts for golden parachutes will not change, the restriction only applies to new contracts, which should be another incentive to participate in the program.
&quot;This is the first time in American history that there will be a legal restriction on CEO remuneration,&quot; commented Barney Frank, a Democrat chairman of the House Financial Services Committee.
In addition, the State will have the right to acquire a stake in the banks participating in the program, thereby reducing the risk of taxpayers, because once the economy and with it the rescued bank get back on their feet, they can make money from this transaction.
The draft plan states that over the next five years, the president must submit a proposal to Congress setting out how the expected losses from the financial sector can be recovered from taxpayers.
There were, of course, voices on both sides expressing doubts about the plan.
&quot;This is not what US citizens have asked us to do, because this will not protect taxpayer dollars,&quot; said Republican Congressman Darrell Issa of California.
His Democratic colleague from Ohio, Mary Kaptur, believes that those responsible for the collapse of Wall Street have urged the adoption of the provisions.
Industrial prices continued to rise
Domestic sales prices in industry increased by 0.1 percent in August 2008 compared to the previous month, and by 12.9 percent compared to August 2007, the Central Statistical Office announced.
Export sales prices in industry were 1.1 percent higher than in July 2008, down 3.9 percent year on year.

Next year to the United States without a visa?
According to Kinga Göncz, there is great hope that the US-Hungarian visa waiver agreement will enter into force around January 12, the foreign minister spoke about this in Chicago in front of the leaders of the local Hungarian community.
In her opinion, &quot;almost everything now depends on whether an electronic system of road permits or controls will be set up overseas in time.&quot;
At the same time, she pointed out that the new system will not include an entry permit, but tourists will have to register before departure.
A representative of Hungarian diplomacy continues negotiations in Washington from today.
He will meet with Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, who will present the Middle Cross with the Order of Merit Star to the Republic of Hungary and hold talks with foreign policy advisers to Democratic Party presidential candidate Barack Obama and Republican John McCain.
Both Barack Obama and McCain are in favor of a bank rescue package
Barack Obama and John McCain, the presidential candidates of the two major American parties, unanimously reaffirmed their support of the government&#39;s $ 700 billion bank bailout package on Sunday, but there are also politicians calling for the resignation of the finance minister.
After a several-day marathon of meetings between Congress and government officials, it was announced early Sunday morning: a basic agreement on a bank rescue package had been reached.
The financial package, which aims to remedy the Wall Street crisis and the frozen credit market, has become a central issue in the presidential campaign.
Both Obama and McCain identify themselves as the more suitable of the two candidates to lead the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the latest polls, as economic issues come to the fore, Obama regained some advantage and faded McCain&#39;s lead after the Republican Convention nominated Sarah Palin for vice president.
Obama expressed hope at a Detroit election rally on Sunday that a $ 700 billion package law would be passed quickly by Congress.
He emphasized that the proposal contained passages on consumer protection, which he also supported.
&quot;We must act now, responsibly (...) to your jobs, your savings, your entire industry, and the danger of the stability of the whole economy,&quot; he told a crowd of 35,000.
He did not miss the opportunity to call McCain&#39;s ideas about the economy outdated.
In an interview with ABC, McCain explained: &quot;Everyone will be a little upset (...) but doing nothing is simply not the way to go.&quot;
According to the Republican senator, the proposal includes the establishment of a commission supervising the Minister of Finance and the limitation of severance pay for top officials, on which he insisted.
Obama told CBS that McCain did not play a significant role in the negotiations, but that he himself was in daily contact with the minister.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on Sunday that the House of Representatives would vote on the bill on Monday.
Overview of the German language press
The right-wing camp is intact, only the voters inside it have become more confident - this is how Der Spiegel analyzes the weak result of the CSU in Bavaria.
The Haiders are ready to rule Austria to prevent a red-black coalition.
The mirror (spiegel.de)
In an online edition of the left-wing German news magazine, Franz Walter discusses the causes of the dramatic defeat of the CSU in his article entitled &quot;The Bavarian Revolution devours its fathers&quot;.
According to a well-known political scientist, the erosion of the CSU began long before the sad duo Beckstein-Huber took office.
The Christian Socialists have been rebuilding Bavaria for decades - and now it is these modern citizens who are turning away from them.
The change of period is a problem of the whole Christian democracy, and thus of Angela Merkel.
The debacle was not entirely surprising to the CSU, but on Saturday the process, which could have been expected for almost exactly ten years, ended: the undisputed hegemony of one state party ended.
Ten years ago, in 1998, the CSU landed at 47.7 percent, below the 50 percent mark for the first time since the 1950s.
This was repeated three years ago during the 2005 Bundestag elections, still in the so-often mentioned Stoiber period.
The reason is the modernization that the CSU has consistently carried out in this country and which is consuming its parents.
Sociologists have been predicting this for 40 years, but they have been very wrong about the pace. However, secularization, educational outcomes, and the settlement of Germans from the east and north in the developing regions of Bavaria could not without consequences for the loyalty of CSU voters.
Modernization is associated with an increase in opportunities, which also has visible political consequences.
The right-wing camp is intact, only the voters within it have become more confident, more critical, more stubborn.
It is also clear that in recent weeks, the CSU has moved the furthest away from the classic civic strata; freelancers, self-employed, individuals with a high school diploma and a university degree.
As a result, CSU support has already dropped below 40 percent.
The Press (diepresse.com)
The conservative Viennese daily, in its article entitled &quot;Who, with whom? The party presidents are reluctant to deal with the coalition,&quot; focuses on the confused domestic political situation created by the Austrian elections.
SPÖ wishes to negotiate with ÖVP.
The ÖVP prohibits the SPÖ from interfering in its internal affairs.
The BZÖ seems open to all negotiations, the Greens do not want to agree on a coalition yet.
The elections are over, now everything revolves around the coalition; in the debate held on public television, the party presidents did not give much insight into their cards.
SPÖ Chairman Werner Faymann confirmed that he wished to negotiate with ÖVP.
And the SPÖ wants to show that cooperation between the two parties is certainly possible - in some Länder and in the social partnership it exists.
Faymann left open the question of whether he could imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current chairman of the ÖVP, as vice chancellor.
As he put it, the Schüssel-Molterer course was outvoted in any case.
Repeating this direction is out of the question.
Molterer reacted cautiously to the red offers.
As he said, the cooperation will certainly not be successful if Faymann tries to interfere in the internal affairs of the ÖVP.
Whether his party chooses the opposition or joins a coalition is still completely open in the party, these issues must definitely be discussed within the ÖVP.
BZÖ chairman Jörg Haider once again seemed open in all directions.
&quot;To prevent a red-black coalition, we are ready to take on government responsibilities,&quot; Haider said.
Járóková: It is necessary to break the vicious circle of poverty and segregation
The European Equality Summit, hosted this year by France, the current presidency of the European Union, began in Paris today.
Lívia Járóková, Member of the European People&#39;s Party for Fidesz, as one of the keynote speakers in her plenary message, drew attention to segregation in education, as it is one of the most serious injustices affecting Roma children and the most serious obstacle to their use.
The summit was opened - on behalf of the French Presidency - by Xavier Bertrand, French Minister of Labor and Social Affairs, and Vladimír Špidla, European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
The meeting was attended by invited representatives of governments, European social partners, the most important European organizations for the protection of rights and civic associations operating in the field of equal opportunities.
According to the press office of the group of MEPs of the Fidesz movement, Járóková pointed out that in addition to the discrimination that occurs in recruitment, the Roma are pushed out of the European labor market mainly due to their low education.
&quot;The vast majority of young Roma do not have a secondary education and, due to the poor quality of basic education, only a small proportion of them can achieve a higher level of education.&quot;
Járóková further emphasized that education, as a fundamental human right, plays a key role in the exercise of other human rights.
Investing in the early education of Roma children can strengthen the economies of the Member States of the European Union.
According to the deputy, it is necessary to establish awareness of these connections in the widest circles - among Roma and non-Roma children.
The sooner a Romani student starts school, the greater the chances of becoming a productive member of the labor market; through income taxes and excise duties they contribute to the national budget.
&quot;Roma have the right to their right to citizenship of the European Union to ensure the right to quality education and to guarantee the elimination of their low-quality and separate education,&quot; Lívia Járóková emphasized.
According to the Honorable Member, the coherence of the European Union with an emphasis on goal and action is needed in order to accelerate the processes of school desegregation immediately, and proper compliance with existing and planned anti-discrimination regulations is of paramount importance.
&quot;It is necessary to break the vicious circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment, it is necessary to provide Roma children with opportunities given by the democratic space, so that they can participate as full citizens in the future of Europe,&quot; Járóková demanded.
Under the &quot;European Year of Equal Opportunities&quot;, everyone is guaranteed the goal of the European Equality Summit, held annually since last year&#39;s meeting in Berlin, to provide a separate forum to help achieve the goals of equality and elimination of discrimination set at European and national level.
Fox in a chicken coop
Life and health insurance companies in America often reject the possibility of taking out an insurance contract with a candidate based on people&#39;s information about buying drugs.
Data protection experts fear that the data market will become uncontrollable.
&quot;There is a data protection program which links the use of prescription medicines in any case to the consent of the person concerned.
He must be in the hands of someone independent, otherwise we entrust the chicken coop to the fox, &quot;the Washington Post quotes Richard Dick, the author of a program designed to monitor prescription drugs.
Insurance companies make premiums and amounts paid in the event of insured events dependent on the health status of the applicants, and if the risk is assessed as too great, they will not even take out insurance with it.
Previously, they sent those concerned for medical examinations and contracted only when they knew the results.
Ten years ago, Dick devised a much cheaper procedure: based on the identification number, the customer could easily find out from the pharmacies what drugs he had bought in the last year and a half, from which the program himself deduced his illness and condition.
For example, if he regularly buys a large amount of cholesterol-lowering drugs, it indicates that he has virtually uncontrollably high levels of blood fats, which immediately puts him in a higher-risk category.
There are several versions of the program in circulation, some of which also determine the risk coefficient, so that the insurance company has almost no work left, apart from paperwork, although minor problems arise.
Disadvantages include the fact that many drugs can be used for several purposes, for example, some compounds are useful against migraines or hot flashes, but they are also effective against depression.
From the point of view of commercial insurance companies, these represent a significant risk-increasing factor, while the former do not.
In order to request and process the data, special companies have been set up to ask the patient&#39;s permission before obtaining the necessary information from the pharmacies.
They are now being forced to do so by the authorities, although they have not punished them for their negligence.
Some companies have recently been processing the results of laboratory tests, which are combined with data on the drugs used, thanks to which they are able to provide an even more accurate picture of patients&#39; health.
More and more companies have access to data, and at the same time it will be more and more difficult to control their use.
There is a special law on the protection of health data, but its effectiveness only applies to health care providers and insurance companies.
A bill that will give authorities the power to control companies specializing in providing data is before Congress.
Richard Dick acknowledges that this is not enough: he has therefore developed his program in such a way that the transfer of data is subject to the express consent of the person concerned.
Another thing is that the person in question can hardly refuse permission, otherwise the insurance companies will not conclude a contract with him.
So the hens are a bit dependent on the fox&#39;s goodwill.
CSU: temporary grace
The fate of the old duo Huber-Beckstein will be decided at the end of October
Despite the shameful election debacle, heads have not yet fallen, and the debate on personal issues has been postponed by the leaders of the Bavarian CSU.
Party chairman Erwin Huber and provincial prime minister Günther Beckstein can still remain in their seats, the question is how long this grace will last.
The fate of the tandem, which suffered a catastrophic 17 percent loss of votes, will be decided by the party&#39;s extraordinary congress on the last weekend of October.
In any case, the members of the highly criticized duo let it be heard that they will not cling to their positions with all their might.
They tried to appease angry members of the faction and base, who, due to the loss of an absolute majority, demanded the day after the &quot;Bavarian tsunami&quot; to draw personal consequences.
Five years ago - true, still under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber at the peak of his career - the Christian Social Union gained 60.7 percent, now, a year after the coup against Stoiber, its strength was only 43.4 percent.
The CSU has been an &quot;autocrat&quot; in Bavaria, producing 18 percent of Germany&#39;s GDP, for 46 years.
Although the Conservatives continue to have a high position in the southern federal state, which is of key importance to the Hungarian economy, they will in any case be forced into a coalition in the future.
One of the first signs of a reorganization within the party is the fact that a member of the close intelligence team that will start probing negotiations on a possible coalition of the Munich government with the liberal FDP or the right-wing Free Voters group will include Horst Seehofer, vice-president and federal minister of agriculture. as a possible successor to Huber.
It is an irony of fate that Gabriele Pauli, who performed against Stoiber, was used by the duo Huber-Beckstein to carry out the coup, but then did a ruthlessly short trial with an ambitious communal politician.
CSU leaders are now focusing all their energy on stabilizing Beckstein.
During the transitional period, Stoiber, who has so far spun threads from behind, will also play an active role, the former provincial prime minister and former chairman of the CSU called September 28, the most bitter day of his political career.
On Monday, Huber made a few scathing remarks about the CDU, saying he would have deserved much more support from his sister party.
Other CSU politicians also interpreted the defeat as a warning to the CDU and Angela Merkel.
Following the September 2009 Bundestag elections, Merkel will not be able to become Chancellor unless the CSU, which played a significant role in the nationwide success of 2005, somehow gets to her feet together.
According to Merkel, who found it difficult to hide her disappointment due to the fiasco, the loss of CSU positions will not have a negative impact on the Berlin Grand Coalition.
Which, of course, is relative: treating the wounded CSU will not be easier, and the crisis of the Social Democrats continues.
The SPD achieved the weakest result since 1946 in Bavaria, with 18.6 percent.
Lukashenko: opposition - 110: 0
Not a single opposition member of parliament reached the Belarusian parliament in Sunday&#39;s election.
According to Russian observers, this can be explained by the prosperity and stability prevailing in the country led by Alexander Lukashenko, but according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) by the illegality of the vote count.
The OSCE, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognize the election.
Although the 110-member legislature of the 10-million-strong country has lacked opposition for a good ten years, the United Democratic Forces (ODS) opposition seriously hoped before yesterday&#39;s election that Lukashenko, who had a controversial election in 2006 his presidential term, this time he will &quot;allow&quot; several opposition members to appear in parliament.
The ODS thus abandoned the boycott previously considered.
Opposition expectations were that Belarus, which was increasingly dependent on Russia for economies, which had borrowed to mitigate the impact of Russia&#39;s ever-increasing gas imports and helped Beltransgaz, which owns the pipelines through the country, fall into Russian hands. wanted to improve relations with the European Union, where due to the Belarusian political establishment rated as anti-democratic Lukashenko and other high-ranking politicians, they do not receive entry permits.
The release previously indicated that the OSCE, when evaluating the election campaign, emphasized positive shifts and not shortcomings - for example, the ban on candidacy for a third of opposition candidates.
However, Monday&#39;s OSCE flash report already had reservations about the campaign, during which opposition candidates were virtually unable to appear in the press, especially that the opposition could not be present at the vote count.
At the same time, according to the opposition, there can be an improvement in the political system: political prisoners have been released and Minsk is willing to engage in minor confrontations with Moscow, continuing to refuse to recognize Georgia&#39;s Ossetia and Abkhazia seceded from Georgia, although Russia, with Belarus on paper, the federal state, considers the two territories independent for a month.
&quot;We have taken two steps forward and one step back, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has begun,&quot; Alexander Milinkevich told our letter.
According to the opposition candidate in the 2006 presidential election, it is desirable that it remain so, despite the fact that &quot;power has been afraid to enter a single member of the opposition into an insignificant parliament.&quot;
Looking at the results, the opposition does not plan protests, but rather tries to deliver its message to voters about the need for economic reforms.
&quot;Of course we have a lot of problems with that, we have to print opposition letters in Russia, distribution is hampered by local authorities, but I still see that more and more people support the change, even among the elderly,&quot; Milinkevich said, pointing out that Lukashenko&#39;s regime who considers the creation of social security to be his greatest success, does not consider the most supported class of pensioners to be right or officially supported.
&quot;Due to the country&#39;s indebtedness and growing trade deficit, it is only a matter of time before social security, &#39;cemetery silence,&#39; collapses,&quot; Milinkevich said.
Unlike the opposition politician, Russian observers rated the election as democratic.
The head of the Commonwealth of Independent States mission, Sergei Lebedev, told Russia&#39;s news agency Ria Novosti that &quot;people do not believe in words but in deeds&quot;, so the absence of opposition is nothing more than proof of the maturity of Belarusian voters.
Global Marseille menu
The European Union and India will double their trade turnover
As the European Union&#39;s and India&#39;s leading trading partners, this issue was dominated by other, mostly global, issues on the agenda of the ninth summit.
The Franco-Indian summit will also take place today, focusing on cooperation in the field of nuclear energy.
The European Union recognizes that India is an emerging democratic power that should be given more say in international affairs, but member states have so far failed to find a common denominator on the issue of New Delhi&#39;s permanent membership of the UN Security Council.
This issue was not even discussed further at yesterday&#39;s, already the ninth summit, held in Marseille.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy as the current President of the Union, European Commission President José Manuel Barroso and High Representative for Foreign Affairs Javier Solana welcomed Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, who also agreed to double trade in five years, or more than one hundred billion euros.
Given that trade in goods rose from 25 billion to 55 billion between 2000 and 2007, this is not an overly ambitious goal.
As a result, twenty-six existing bilateral civil aviation agreements with India have been legally aligned, so air transport has been given the green light in the future.
By the end of 2009, India would like to sign a free trade agreement with the Union.
Sarkozy promised that negotiations would be accelerated.
The aim is to balance the balance, while the EU is India&#39;s first trading partner, New Delhi ranks ninth among the EU&#39;s partners.
The summit also paid attention to global issues.
The situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan, and terrorism, respectively - was condemned by both parties in all its forms and called for the speedy convening of a UN conference.
They also dictated the end of the Doha Round, although both have played a large part in its failure so far.
The European Union has confirmed that it will insist on its energy and climate agenda, namely that it would like to reduce emissions of at least 20% by 2020.
India also agreed, as did that at next year&#39;s climate conference, a global agreement should be reached and the production of greenhouse gases reduced by 50% by 2050.
Both sides would also like to prevent rising food prices and support the convening of an international conference to analyze the financial crisis.
Today, the Indian Prime Minister will arrive in the French capital, where he is going to conclude a deal concerning the peaceful use of nuclear energy during a bilateral meeting.
Paris believes that French companies will be commissioned to build 20 billion euros worth of Indian nuclear reactors.
According to agency reports, the agreement would be valid for 15 years.
More than three hundred Italian publishers in Frankfurt
Large participation of Italian publishers at the Frankfurt International Book Fair.
More than three hundred Italian publishers will take part in the 60th edition of Buchmesse, the most important international meeting for the exchange of rights.
The Frankfurt International Book Fair expects more than seven thousand exhibitors from one hundred and one different countries, occupying 171,790 square meters of the fair with more than four hundred and three thousand titles to see, with Turkey as the guest of honor.
Deputy Minister of Culture Francesco Maria Giro will represent the Italian government at the inauguration ceremony in the Italian Pavilion: Italy will in fact participate institutionally with the Italian Center (Punto Italia) - on 264 square meters of exhibition space.
This will be followed by a meeting with the press at Room Struktur Buchmesse in Hall 5.0: it will be an opportunity to present the numbers, trends and perspectives on the state of publishing in Italy.
According to the data, the importance of books by foreign authors in relation to the total Italian production is constantly decreasing, especially with regard to literature for children and adults.
Brunetta: &quot;From now on breakfast before work&quot;
It is the first time in the history of the Chigi Palace that a revolving door has been introduced on the arrival and departure of employees.
However, from today, this new measure will start working against cunning people, against those who prick themselves and then go for coffee during working hours.
The news against the lazy was introduced today by the Minister of Public Administration, Renate Brunetta, and the Secretary General of the Presidential Council, Mauro Masi.
&quot;Revolving doors - says Brunetta - are a tool for better work, higher performance, more attendance and more services,&quot; the minister said.
&quot;A new period of accountability and transparency will now open.
This is reformism, &quot;Brunetta emphasizes.
With Chigi Palace, we will complete the implementation in all the buildings of the Council Presidency.
For Masi, &quot;the choice of revolving doors is also important from a symbolic point of view&quot;.
There were no objections from the staff, the Secretary General assures: &quot;It was a joint procedure with the staff and the cooperation of all&quot;.
In short, no more breakfast during business hours; no more coffee and croissant.
Brunetta smiles and says, &quot;There&#39;s nothing better than a proper cappuccino at seven in the morning.&quot;
During one conference at the College of Public Administration
in Rome, the minister will finally announce that within three months, the absence of public employees due to illness has fallen by 50%, ie 60,000 more people a year at work.
He will add that it is necessary for the Italian public administration to become more efficient
&quot;Its payout dynamics - the minister explains - has doubled in the last 8-10 years relative to the private sector and is far higher than the inflation rate.&quot;
Meanwhile, thousands of public employees gathered to reject the standards of Brunett&#39;s decree in line with a request supported by the Codacons.
&quot;While the Minister of Public Administration will present today figures for lower absenteeism due to illness - writes the Consumer Protection Association - the nation of &#39;hardworkers&#39; is constantly growing.
In Italy, we have thousands of productive and fair civil servants who have gathered to declare war on the illegitimate norms contained in the decree. &quot;
In Tara, the main protest will be against the exclusion of activity-based sickness allowances; extension of the period during which the patient can be checked, in what time frame control visits will be carried out, and against other standards included in the new ministerial provisions.
Accidents at work, Napolitano: &quot;Resolute prevention&quot;
Every day, 2,500 accidents at work occur in Italy, three people die and twenty-seven remain permanently disabled.
Inail&#39;s figures confirm that in 2007 we had about 1,200 deaths due to accidents at work.
These values indicate the seriousness of the phenomenon, which remains one of the main causes of death and causes almost twice as many deaths as in homicide.
In order to rekindle the attention of institutions, social and information media to this dramatic problem, Anmil is today celebrating the 58th National Day of Victims of Accidents at Work, scheduled for the second Sunday in October, in all Italian regions.
&quot;The disturbing data disseminated by Anmil and the same tragic reports these days confirm the importance of occupational safety,&quot; confirmed President Giorgio Napolitano in a report sent to President Anmil, National Association for the Disabled and Disabled for Work, Pietro Mercandelli.
The Head of State expresses his keen admiration for the constant joint efforts to ensure safety at work, to protect injured workers, to help the families of the victims and to participate in public opinion. &quot;
&quot;Naturally, outraged &#39;enough&#39; has been raised, sincerely shared in the face of tragedies, the extent of which causes a stir in the media and the participation of public opinion, but everyday reality again offers us dramatic cases, even repetitive in its dynamics.&quot;
Napolitano makes no secret of the fact that &quot;there is undoubtedly a problem of resources: it is crucial to invest in training and information.
Of particular importance are the numerous initiatives taken in the field of education to raise the awareness of young people facing the world of work.
It is necessary to draw attention to this phenomenon, not to give up due to its worrying social seriousness, to apply and improve legislative standards.
Chamber President Gianfranco Fini, for his part, emphasized &quot;how the phenomenon of death as a result of an accident at work creates an absolutely critical social situation, how it offends the conscience of each of us and forces all institutions to make a convincing effort to end this situation.&quot;
&quot;As for the data on accidents at work, they seem to show a certain positive turnaround, but this does not deny that the number of deaths due to accidents at work is alarming anyway,&quot; remarked President Anmilu Pietro Mercandelli.
&quot;We don&#39;t want this &#39;reduction effort&#39; to lead to less attention, because just when the attention stops, tragedy breaks out.
&quot;We believe that too little is generally being done to stop the injury problem and there are many activities that can have an impact on the problem.
In our view, Mercandelli emphasized, it is essential to step up controls and inspections, but also to step up the work of staff training, right from school age. &quot;
&quot;Further efforts are needed - he added - in terms of communication and public participation.
But above all, there is a need for a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers for a phenomenon which is an exceptional social phenomenon. &quot;
Finally, Mercandelli said there was a progressive degeneration of the levels of redress provided for work victims and the &quot;postponement of supportive care&quot; that the system has received in recent years. &quot;
&quot;The aim is therefore to return the insurance guarantee to the worker - he added - because the fate of those who hurt themselves must not depend on spontaneity or donation from time to time by the legislature.&quot;
Mp3 players are accused of exposing hearing to risk
Listening to loud music for extended periods of time and using portable music devices such as Mp3 players can cause permanent hearing damage.
According to a European Commission notice published today, quoting the opinion of the Committee on Science on Health Risks, which have recently arisen and been identified (Csrseri) Eu, in an official report disseminated in Brussels.
&quot;This scientific opinion - we read in the notes - shows that 5-10% of those who listen to music with portable music devices for more than an hour a week for at least five years and keep the device at a high volume risk permanent hearing loss.&quot; .
&quot;I&#39;m worried that so many young people, who often use portable music devices and mobile phones at high acoustic levels, can unknowingly damage their hearing in irreparable ways,&quot; admits Meglena Kuneva.
&quot;Scientific findings - the leader continues - show a clear risk and need to respond quickly.
Most importantly, we need to encourage consumers and make this information public.
We must continue to re-examine existing control systems in the light of this scientific finding in order to make them fully effective and to keep pace with new technology. &quot;
Brussels has asked the Independent Scientific Committee to investigate this issue, given the high use of portable musical instruments and the growing number of young people exposed to noise from this origin.
&quot;Scientists - concluded the EU executive - confirm the need to worry and now the European Commission will examine with other members and parties who have raised the issue, what measures could be put in place to better protect children and young people from exposure. noise from portable musical instruments and similar devices &quot;.
There is already a European safety standard that limits the noise level of portable music devices to 100 dB, but there are growing concerns about hearing damage that may be caused by excessive exposure to similar forms of noise.
It is possible to greatly reduce these damages by looking for solutions such as reducing the level and duration of exposure.
In its conviction, the EU Scientific Committee states that users of portable musical instruments, if they use loud music (more than 89 decibels) for only five hours a week, will exceed the currently applicable limits corresponding to the maximum permissible noise in the workplace.
Those who listen to music in such conditions for a long time run the risk of permanent hearing loss after five years.
This problem should affect 5-10% of users of such devices, and the number can be quantified between 2.5 and 10 million people in the EU.
Rome, Alemanno will leave the Commission for the future of the capital free to run
We will start today, we will close in March, we will have sums in June.
Such is the calendar given by Campidogli to the staff of the &quot;Commission for the Future of the Capital of Rome&quot;, which met this morning at its new headquarters behind the Baths of Caracall.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and 49 other members of the commission will compile handbooks for Rome.
When the door closes in March, Giunta and the city council will evaluate the analyzes and projects so that in June they can present a strategic plan for Rome with the &quot;official stamp&quot; of Campidoglio and his councilor Gianni Alemann.
&quot;The Commission is completely independent and includes all political, social and cultural ideas - Alemanno wants to emphasize - It will have to secure proposals for the development of Rome, which will eventually be used by political arbitrators, who remain the Giunta e Municipal Council.
It is not an exchange of functions, but only an attempt to have some place to work on a great project for Rome.
The work will be completed in March and then dissolved, as the institution must have a precise deadline.
In June, the mayor announces, we will present a strategic plan and use the work done by the Commission for the Future of the Capital of Rome.
To those who accuse the Commission of being unnecessary because its opinions will not be binding, Alemanno replies: &quot;It all depends on the work that the Commission will be able to do and the quality of their proposals.
If they are as good as the Attali Commission&#39;s proposals, and I am sure of that in Rome, its contribution will be decisive.
Too often, politics falls apart on everyday problems and on urgencies that arise from time to time.
On the contrary, we want to look longer and further, in a deeper perspective, to work seriously on the development of Rome and its future.
In addition, the mayor of Rome wants to emphasize that &quot;this Commission is neither a useless business nor a bluff: it is completely free, it will not cost the citizens of Rome the euro and will serve to reflect and engage the best intelligence that the capital has&quot;.
For Alemann, in essence, &quot;we need to have a strategic outline as a starting point, neither definitive nor motionless, in order to allow our city an authentic ascent to the level it desperately needs and to think with one spirit about its future.&quot;
The future, which the Mayor of Rome said, &quot;will not be limited to the current municipal boundaries, but will look much further&quot; not only in the eyes of the future metropolitan city and its legal status as a capital, but will also include the role that Rome can and must play as a capital. city of Europe and the Mediterranean &quot;.
Obama? The first anti-American president. We already know why
One well-known US president wrote that it was important for him to remain independent: &quot;Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.&quot;
The first was Jimmy Carter, whose decisions decimated the US economy and maintained relations (as he is today as a private citizen) with the enemy of Islam. &quot;
Attacks on Obama are growing as the election date approaches.
One lady from Miami wrote on the web: &quot;This man is full of ambition.
But Obama has the audacity: he thinks he will get to the top post of a nation that has had two governors and five black senators everywhere! &quot;
In fact, these attacks do not say much &quot;; they are attacks of a clearly racial origin and do not answer the question of voters: will he be a good president? And then we have polls; everyone says that Obama will win and with a big lead.
Even in this case, there are those who act according to the heart and not the brain.
A newspaper from Mississippi, from the bowels of the southern United States, wrote a comment: at least once in the polling station, we know well to whom the American patriot will vote.
One aspect of the American mentality that remained present until the last moment comes to light.
Say what you want, in the end we&#39;ll take care of ourselves, who to check, whether Obama or McCain. &quot;
There are people who swear: if Obama were to win, we would leave America.
These are things that have never been said before, the success of the black candidate seems almost certain.
But despite all these considerations for Democrats, George Bush is the main weapon.
They asked 1,500 people: what mistakes did Bush make during his term? Eighty-nine percent answered: Iraq.
America is changing.
In Vietnam, the nation lost 50,000 troops and was sent home kicked in the ass.
4,500 troops have lost their lives in Iraq and the Americans have not been forced to pack.
And yet Iraq has become Bush&#39;s weakness for the most part.
Whoever takes the place of Georgie W will have to perform a huge task.
The US economic collapse has also been felt by journalists: the newspaper is in the investigation period. And many blame the internet, the &quot;killer&quot; of printed matter.
The PEW Research Center asked five hundred journalists about the state of their profession and the prospects for the future.
Well, today almost all journalists are pessimistic about their future.
However, respondents did not openly say that they were less concerned about credibility.
She doesn&#39;t feel isolated like she used to.
The problem for American journalists is money.
For these journalists, the crisis of 2008 is a crisis of a devastated economic model.
In addition, cuts made in the newsroom, in the room where editors work to put newspapers together, are a huge problem.
According to the journalists interviewed, this is an issue that needs to be addressed if we do not want traditional journalism, as understood by the general public, to change fundamentally.
A clear but complex pessimism permeates the American journalist.
Six out of ten print journalists and senior executives believe that journalism is going the wrong way nationally.
In the local area, the executive group is 65%.
Printed against the broadcast.
It is not difficult for journalists to see where the web is going.
Larger publishers are making their way to the Internet, which many see as a &quot;killer&quot; of printed matter.
The &quot;economic pressure&quot; that journalists point out has increased by as much as 79%.
Five hundred journalists interviewed admitted that they resorted to technology in the hope that they would &quot;do something good&quot; for their journalism.
The biggest gap in American journalism is between those who run newsrooms - that is, leaders - and the reporters who work for them.
56% of leaders at the national level are sure that their reporters share their values, while at the local level the value drops to 23%.
This has something to do with &quot;job security&quot; for someone.
There are 47% national leaders who think they will lose their job within three years.
As for journalists, they are 30%.
As for the &quot;certain work&quot; concerning the staff (our editors, ndr) in America is still the order of the day.
Only 13% of journalists work on a contract.
In a nation as vast as the United States, with three hundred million inhabitants and thousands of newspapers, magazines, radio, TV and the Internet, employers often offer what they want, so it&#39;s a matter of take it or leave it.
Managers almost always receive huge salaries, and the editor can earn as much as ten thousand dollars a month in addition to paying pensions and insurance.
As for the holidays, the argument is complicated: a certain number of days after the first year, a certain number of days after the third year until fifteen days are reached after a certain number of years.
However, American journalists, according to their own confessions, often fall ill within a year.
It is just a matter of climate.
UNIPOL: COURT IN ROME, DANILO COPPOLA STAYS IN GROTTAFERRATA
The President of the Second Criminal Chamber of the Rome Court, Carmelo Rinaudo, has decided to reject the filing of Daniel Coppola, a real estate businessman, who asked to move from his city, the Grottaferraty, to an apartment in Rome.
Coppola is being investigated for bankruptcy in connection with a counter-offer in the sale of Unipol-Bnl.
During the trial at his own expense, he received his release from house arrest last week, which was converted into forced permanent residence in the Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, asked that a real estate entrepreneur could change his place of residence from a rural town to the capital.
However, according to the court, this move (against which pm spoke) would allow him to influence his company and get to the evidence that accuses him.
Elites in danger
The phenomenon manifested itself a few days ago when the House of Representatives voted against the $ 700 billion bailout plan presented by the White House: a significant number of Americans were more interested in punishing Wall Street than in saving the economy.
This is confirmed by yesterday&#39;s New York Times, which informs us that the current crisis divides the Republican Party, increasingly divided between its old East Coast soul, milder, supportive of federal institutions and the business community, and its new soul, which is conservative, hostile. towards &quot;those from Washington» and against the world of finance, strong especially in the states in the central part and in the south.
A soul that manifested itself arrogantly with the vote I spoke of at the beginning.
However, this thing just quoted is just an example of the changes, the great changes that the current economic earthquake is already showing: not just in the United States, but throughout the West, and perhaps not just here.
In both the United States and Europe, this crisis seems to be accelerating phenomena that have been in incubation for a long time, intensifying in the new climate and finally coming to light.
The first of these phenomena is the reactualization, the extraordinary revival of the market, the double category of state-power in relation to a certain renationalization of the economy.
The crisis is indeed a crisis of banking and financial institutions, which, of course, have strong ties abroad, but which mainly involve the budgets of people and families living in a single country, in a single state.
At the same time, this has created a political problem for those who run it: that is, how to respond to the difficulties and protests of people and families who are, among others, voters.
In short, the crisis appears to be economically global, but politically almost exclusively national.
Political internationality seems to be largely out of the game or that it has little to add: the European Union, which is divided, as always, between different interests and different national strategies and which cannot opt for a single common political line, has given obvious evidence.
And so everyone is waiting for the intervention of the government of each individual state, rescue plans, market recovery, new rules and especially the distribution of funds: the moment we get into trouble, only states have the economic resources, the amount of financial resources to be able to try to put everything into all right.
And they also have the necessary means and authority to use them: two sources of immense value, in certain circumstances, which perhaps no market and no international organization will ever be able to dispose of to a similar extent.
This new emphase, which the crisis places on the state-national element, is, moreover, in full accordance with the growing importance which recent economic advances are trying to attribute to one factor closely linked to it: territoriality.
Paradoxically, in fact, while we were convinced that we had entered the realm of the network, increasingly sophisticated technology, immaterial, while we were convinced that global finance was already destined to rule the world, we realized out of nowhere that our future would have to increasingly struggling with such little intangible things as water, grain, oil.
All things, who would say that, can be transported from one place on earth to another, but they are in any case connected, absolutely, to a limited space, territory.
So, whoever becomes their ruler certainly has many more cards up their sleeve than those who are not, and who is unlucky enough to live in a place without grain, without oil and without water.
I come to the second novelty, which, however, predicts a turning point.
Whoever speaks of territory, state, government, inevitably speaks of politics, that is, leadership.
Taking into account the economic crisis, two convergent phenomena seem to be emerging.
On the one hand, the realization that there is an objective need for authoritarian leadership, a request for someone who can take over the situation.
On the other hand, a wave of discredit against existing leadership, especially economic leadership, which has proved to be equally unsatisfactory and full of dark spots.
And together, something even deeper and, in a sense, disturbing: discredit, impatience, a sense of incompetence, and an absence that seeks to control the entire ruling class in more and more Western countries.
Indeed, it seems that beliefs are spreading more and more in the broad masses of the population, rather than their actions being the same as the thoughts of the hitherto popular elite, as their way of feeling and being, as their culture in the true sense of the word. indifferent to the views of the majority.
The demand for leadership simply feeds one branch from underground, but the strong movement to eliminate the ruling classes and traditional political order is reflected in sudden electoral &quot;resistance&quot; or unexpected changes in collective sentiment in recent and recent times, from the conservative rise in Austria-Bavaria to the fall of Labor in Great Britain, to the revolt of American congressmen against Bush (and perhaps the victory of the right in Italy has something to do with it).
We have the impression that traditional elites, their parties, their programs, but also their ceremonies, their newspapers, their accredited intelligence, someone would say their format, have more and more problems understanding, ie representing, which, not from today, is being created in deep layers of Western societies and that the economic crisis is intensifying, growing, potentially overly faltering.
Before that, it would be an exaggeration to talk about a lasting &quot;mass uprising&quot;.
But we certainly can&#39;t say that it means having your eyes open.
Super glue for walking on walls
Overcome the laws of gravity with super glue and walk on walls like Spiderman in the future.
This is the object of various American research centers, and now a team of four institutes has come very close to it.
The researchers managed to keep the 100-kilogram body glued to the vertical wall with a sticker measuring only 2.5 square centimeters.
STUDY - The American journal Science published the findings of some researchers at the University of Dayton, Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratories.
The material, invented by a team of researchers, is a development of pre-existing materials that use a special carbon structure called carbon dwarf tubes.
&quot;We can imagine the base of the glue as a series of tubes laid as an arranged pile of spaghetti,&quot; explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
The researchers were inspired by the legs of a gecko, covered with microscopic hairs that allow the animal to ensure perfect adhesion.
Tests performed on various materials such as glass, Teflon and sandpaper have shown that the new glue is ten times stronger than the legs of these reptiles and at the same time &quot;simply peels off the wall&quot; explains Liming Dai, a researcher at Dayton University School of Engineering.
WALKING HERE? - &quot;This material could be useful as a temporary adhesive&quot; adds Liming Dai.
Maybe walking on walls like Spiderman? Perhaps yes, but researchers are thinking of a far less fascinating use as a combination of electrical devices, because dwarf carbon tubes are conductors of heat and electricity.
Other applications could involve aerospace engineering.
No superheroes yet.
FURTHER RESEARCH - The University of Berkeley, California, is also researching a new adhesive.
In an article in the American Chemical Society, California researchers introduced a glue formed from micro-fibers like hair that cleans itself from dust by moving around the surface to still maintain a perfect fit.
Medications: never with juices
Beware of grapefruit, orange and apple juice.
If you take these drinks, which are consumed mainly in the summer because they are refreshing and full of vitamins, along with some life-saving medicines, their consumption changes the potentiation or reduction of effectiveness with serious health consequences.
To highlight the risks of both ready-made and fresh juices in combination with some medications, David Bailey, a professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, raises a new alarm at the current 263rd American Chemical Society National Meeting in Philadelphia: one glass of grapefruit, orange and apple juice is enough. to reduce the absorption of certain life-saving drugs, to nullify their beneficial effects and to put patients&#39; health at risk.
Grapefruit juice has already been accused of being responsible for increasing the toxic effects of some antiarrhythmic drugs, antibiotics, anxiolytics, antihistamines and neurological drugs.
DRUGS AT RISK - This was announced by the Italian Medical Agency itself in a newsletter two years ago, urging doctors and patients not to underestimate the dangers of this mixture and to be careful about what they drink when they take medicines, such as Diazepam or Methadone.
NOT JUST GRAPEFRUIT - According to experts, orange and apple juice also contain substances that suppress drugs.
A long list of effects attenuated by grapefruit and other juices.
Hence the call of Michele Carruba, Director of the Pharmacology Department of the State University of Milan: &quot;Such discoveries are usually immediately reported to various international and national pharmacy agencies, which may arrange and exchange information instructions for drugs.
So always read the illustrative tickets of the medicines you get, and if you come across something unclear, don&#39;t worry, but ask your doctor or pharmacist for clarification »stressed an expert for Ansa.
Nobel for economics to Paul Krugman
The Nobel Prize was awarded to American Paul Krugman for his studies of commercial models and the localization of economic activities.
Krugman is a 55-year-old New Kenyan who teaches at the University of Priceton and is a well-known editor of the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the most important critics of the Bush administration&#39;s foreign, economic and political actions.
A few months after the September 2001 assassinations, the days when Enron went bankrupt, Krugman predicted in a commentary in the New York Times that the second event would be, in terms of implications for United States history, far more important than the first.
A prediction that provoked considerable controversy and was blamed on him for years, but which turned out to be accurate.
&quot;I am surprised and shocked at the rate at which collapses like Enron and Worldcom have disappeared from public interest, Krugman said in late 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi of the Executive Committee of the Central European Bank, Krugman is &quot;an economist of great importance&quot;, but also a popularizer who has &quot;a very aggressive style, especially critical of the excesses of the Bush liberalist administration.&quot;
Open Office, here we have the third edition of the &quot;anti-Microsoft» package
It is the day of the release of Open Office.org 3.0, an open source personal production package that aims to penetrate more and more users, from home to office, from experts to public administration, as a free alternative to the more well-known Microsoft Office.
After about a year of work by volunteers controlled by the SUN Microsystem, the new Open Office is showing the general public a variety of new features: the Welcome screen and the revised and improved opening window will add more, far more substantial ones, such as compatibility with Apple Mac OS X and support for the new. ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2, the latest standard version of ISO.
Emphasis is also placed on cooperation with the 2007 Office package, Open Office is able to open a document with a new Microsoft extension (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
Of interest are the special features of some models, such as what allows you to reduce the size of a PowerPoint presentation, useful for example for electronic transmission, or the ability to transfer a PDF folder to a graphic model and preserve the original appearance of the page.
Still from this point of view, we can create &quot;PDF hybrids&quot; documents that resemble typical Adobe graphics and have the properties of a spreadsheet or word processor.
Collaboration is an element that has received many improvements within application programs: in Excel it is possible to work together between different users and avoid conflicts of change, in the text program each collaborator is assigned one color for comments to make clearer identification in the revision phase.
Some companies are also working to port some Open Office features to the Web (on the cloud), and they should see the final result in the coming weeks.
The Italian version can be downloaded at http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html, it has been added to the English version, which has been on the mirror since Friday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, as usual, the package is also available for the Linux operating system.
The installation CD can also be sent home or to the workplace on request.
And while the topic of free shipping can be a driving force for expansion in households, the Open Office package relies heavily on the business area, and can already count on various projects implemented in public administration and schools.
And there are also training, consulting and assistance services ideal for small and medium-sized companies, which could open up business prospects.
Open Office consists of five main models: Writer, for video writing replacing Word; Calc is a spreadsheet program that aims to replace Excel; Impress for PowerPoint-like presentations; Dbase, as in the more famous Access, is a program that allows you to work on databases; Draw, after all, is a graphic model.
The goal for 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads, and considering that today we are almost 3 million and 600 thousand, with the release of a new version, it is possible that this expected number may be exceeded.
Kohl&#39;s results are also positive, it is the fourth case of doping
A new positive case at the last Tour de France: this is the Austrian Bernhard Kohl, from the Gerolsteiner team, the third classified and the winner of the T-shirt of the best climber.
The report was quoted by L&#39;Equipe.
Kohl, 26, is the fourth driver to be positive for Cera, the third generation Epo, after the Italians Riccardo Riccò and Leonard Piepol and the German Stefan Schumacher, and he from Gerolsteiner.
The results of Kohl&#39;s blood samples are those performed in recent weeks by Losanna and Chatenay-Malabry Laboratories.
If the control analyzes confirm the positivity at Cer, the Austrian will lose third place on the Tour and will have to face the stipulated two years of disqualification.
The report on Kohl&#39;s positivity for the third-generation Epo is confirmed by the head of the French anti-doping agency Pierre Bordry, who informed the Associated Press that he had already informed the Austrian authorities about the result.
The 26-year-old Austrian placed on the podium behind the Spaniard Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans, he also won the polka dot shirt of the best climber.
IMMIGRANTS: NEW YORK TIMES IS ASKED, IS ITALY A RACIST?
Italy &quot;as an emigrant country has only in the last house turned into a priority destination for immigrants&quot; received with resistance.
Does it turn a beautiful country into a racist nation? So he asks in a long article by the New York Times, which devoted this article to the debate on racism in Italy, and began with the case of young Abdul William Guiber, originally from Burkina Faso, killed last month in Milan for stealing a box of biscuits.
This case highlights what the New York Times defines as the &quot;paradox of the North&quot;: the northern areas are at the same time those where &quot;more integration and more work&quot; is registered, but also &quot;the strongest anti-immigrant sentiment in the country and the strongest support from the Northern League.&quot;
To confirm the growing tensions between Italy and immigrants, the NYT cites cases of intolerance from Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampina and Castel Volturna.
Not only that.
The new legislation required by the Lega, which seeks to curb immigration and facilitate the expulsion of illegal immigrants, is also cited as an example of the changing climate in Italy.
A tendency emphasized by both the Pope and the President of the Republic: &quot;Giorgio Napolitano, after meeting Benedict XVI in the Quirinale, called for the state and the Church to work together to defeat racism.&quot;
Steve Fossett, a millionaire who disappeared a year ago, was found
The rest of the plane of Steve Fossett, a millionaire, was found and disappeared on September 3, 2007 while flying over the Nevada desert.
The wreckage was discovered on a plateau at an altitude of 3,000 meters, in the Mammoth Lakes area of Sierra Nevada, on the border between California and Nevada.
However, there were no human remains inside the plane.
Madera County Sheriff John Anderson dispelled the doubts that remained: &quot;The plane was found, we sent a team there and now we are sure that this is exactly what Steve Fossett flew on the day he disappeared,&quot; he told a press release. conference.
The sheriff therefore clarified that no human remains were found either on the plane or in the surrounding area.
The 63-year-old millionaire has been considered dead since February.
The U.S. Transportation Safety Agency (NTSB) said a few hours after the wreckage was detected, an investigation team was sent to eventually identify the plane: the Bellanca 8kcab, missing since September 3, 2007, when Fossett took off from Yerington, Nevada for a three-hour flight. .
Yesterday, still in California, not far from the Nevada border, some of Fossett&#39;s personal belongings were found by one couple near their home in Mammoth Lakes.
These are two documents with Fossett&#39;s name, both issued by the Illinois Federal Aviation Administration, about cash and one jacket.
Fossett&#39;s search was interrupted a month after his disappearance.
The billionaire gained a place in history thanks to a long collection of championships.
In 2002, on the sixth attempt, he became the first man to complete a trip around the world in a balloon: two weeks of flying alone.
Three years later, he flew around the world on a plane and without landing.
His many records also include flying at an altitude of 15,445 meters, over the Andes, albeit with a copilot.
Glk, an advertisement you don&#39;t expect
One unusual SUV with an original design and precisely defined decisive lines, wide surfaces with precise corners.
This is, in short, the last Glk born of the &quot;compact&quot; star house jeeps with which Mercedes-Benz tried to bring a whirlwind of news to this sector.
Thanks to its non-traditional design, the communication that will accompany the launch of the Suv Glk and which will be available in Mercedes-Benz showrooms from next October 17 will be unexpected and unconventional.
In this way, the advertising campaign that will accompany the debut of the new vehicle will start an unofficial way of communication also thanks to the futuristic poster campaign in 3D, which is being used for the first time in Italy for a car brand.
The maxi poster project, divided into three different phases, will dominate Milan&#39;s main shopping street, Corso Como, until 15 November.
The first phase of this new type of communication will begin with the presentation of the car in stereoscopic vision, and with the help of special glasses to be handed out near the Corsa Como, it will be possible to see the new Suv in almost true dimensions and three-dimensional format.
Indeed, when you look at the picture, you get the impression that the car comes out of the poster.
Then, thanks to the use of the innovative Elumina8 technology, the new Glk will be illuminated at various times in all its little things, so that it can then be reassembled into a single image.
Undoubtedly, Mercedes is trying to introduce something new into the stereotypical field of car communication with this advertisement.
Will he be able to arouse the interest of future customers in this way? We&#39;ll see.
So we already know who the Italian hooligans are
From Trivenet, they risk Daspo.
Who are the 150-200 boys and girls for whom Italy is now ashamed? They are part of the &quot;Ultras Italia&quot; group, which has been following the Nazionale azzurra for years and which, to be honest, has never caused excessive problems.
She never even met her opponent&#39;s fans.
The group orientation is right-wing.
The founders come from Trivenet.
From Verona, Padua, Trieste and Udine.
In Sofia, groups (actually few groups) from Campania and Puglia joined them.
They have tricolor flags on which the cities of origin of the participants appear: on Saturday evening, they were removed so that they would not be recognized.
They are inspired by English fans.
They found real Nazi fans in Bulgaria, Levsky.
Figc provided Italian fans with 144 tickets for the match: all in name, so easy to check.
And Viminale did check them all: among those who went to Sofia, there was no one with the ongoing Dasl, no one who would be forbidden to visit the stadiums.
Four blue fans who had previous offenses from the stadium were denied a ticket and banned from the match.
Now Viminale is waiting to read the reports coming from the Bulgarian police, then take action: In this case, it is possible to give Daspo for at least five years to fans who have been arrested or who have been identified during the riots.
Daspo International, which forbids visiting not only Italian stadiums, but also throughout Europe.
Our hooligans, in short, will not step on a single stadium.
Fortunately.
But now there is a fear of emulation: that is, more than one hundred and fifty will be added.
&quot;We must put out this fire immediately and not justify those who behave in this way,&quot; they confirm from Viminal.
So, &quot;really open eyes, mainly because of the national match on Wednesday in Leč&quot;.
It is in Puglia that there is a small core of supporters.
Tomorrow, the Osservatorio will meet, and on Tuesday, Casms, which can count on one part of Aise, is a secret service that takes care of problems in the stadiums.
&quot;Choral Leader-Leader and an outstretched arm during Mameli&#39;s anthem? It&#39;s not a crime in Bulgaria ...&quot;.
This is the idea of Domenico Mazzilli (expressed in a very unfortunate way), who has been the director of the Viminál Osservatorio for a few weeks (he won the post that was formerly Francesco Tagliente and then Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli was previously the Quaestor in Trieste, home to the core of Ultras Italia supporters, founded in 2002.
It is true, as Mazzilli says, that it is not a crime in Bulgaria to celebrate leaders, but of course the behavior of these 150-200 fans is a disgrace.
&quot;I am not a sociologist - adds the Osservator number one - crimes are attributed to the country in which they took place.
Until now, this group has remained within limits, now let&#39;s take a good look at what happened and evaluate it for the future.
But let&#39;s also talk about the whistling of Mameli&#39;s anthem: it&#39;s not a crime either, but if you&#39;ll allow it, it&#39;s rudeness ... &quot;.
Students fall victim to expensive rents - up to 900 euros per room
The rental market for university students does not know the crisis.
According to the latest research by Sunia, the unions for tenants, renting a single room can cost a student up to 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples, 600 in Rome.
&quot;The phenomenon has already reached such proportions that entire classes of students have lost the right to study due to the overall excessive prices that their families would have to bear - explains Laura Mariani, head of Sunia&#39;s study office - high demand from students has distorted the market in this city. that it stimulated the process of rising prices, which extended to residents &quot;.
In most cases, rental offers contain several offenses: contracts in a free manner, unregistered, without limited rent, associated subleases.
Sunji needs exceptional intervention that could regulate prices through tax revisions.
If we look at the details of the research, we will see that in Milan, in the Brianza area, about 450 euros are needed for one bed, for a single room you pay from a minimum price of 650 (Bande Nere zone) through a mean value of 800 (Lambiate zone, Udine and Fiera) up to a maximum of 900 (in the Vittoria zone).
In Florence, one bed costs an average of 350/400 euros, one room about 700.
In Bologna, where students are concentrated in zones close to the university, they need 250/280 euros per bed in a double room, from 370 to 500 in a single room.
In Rome in the central university zones (San Lorenzo, piazza Bologna) they want about 600 euros for a single room, 450 beds in a double room.
The values are slightly lower (550 euros per single) in zones close to other universities (Ostiense and Cinecittà).
We will save only if we move to peripheral areas: 300 euros per bed and 450 per single room in the Prenestina, Centocelle and similar zones.
In Naples, you need 300/450 euros per bed, 400 to 600 euros per room, with the highest prices in the Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei zones.
In Bari they want 250/350 euros for a bed, at least 350 for a single room.
In smaller cities, prices are definitely lower, but they have a greater impact on the economy of citizens.
Finally, in cities such as Perugia, where the most common phenomenon is rent for students from outside the European Union, there is another anomaly: an increase of about 25-30% in the fee they want for foreign students compared to Italian ones.
Goodbye to the old cinema Paradiso, the city is abolished by historic halls
Cinematographic historical halls close in favor of the Multiplex.
&quot;A city without cinemas is like a blind man, it&#39;s like a face without eyes.&quot;
The painting offered by director Giuseppe Tornator successfully documents what is happening in large Italian urban centers, but also in rural towns.
The process of reducing cinemas, the birth of large multi-halls in the suburbs and the subsequent demise of monos halls in the central zones of cities is one of the events that seem inevitable and irreversible, but it also has all the hallmarks of a real cultural crime.
Historical places full of memories often disappear, &quot;it&#39;s as if we lost a friend, an acquaintance with whom we shared a long way and a lot of emotions&quot;, feels the director of the New Paradiso Cinema, a film that won the Oscar and Grand Jury Prize twenty years ago. Cannes, and which told the poetry of a village cinema and the grief of a way of life that the cinema must have lost forever.
The values gained by Anec, the main association of operators, speak for themselves: in the last five years, 316 traditional-type cinemas have closed the doors, and the highest bills have been paid mainly by halls in the most important cities: 10 less in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 less in Torino, 5 less in Palermo.
Among the regions most affected by closures, Emilia-Romagna ranks first with the loss of 82 cinemas, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
And the proof that the first to be responsible for their disappearance is the advent of the multiplex is precisely the three Italian regions that have registered the highest number of new cinema multiplexes: 195 screens more in Lombardy in the last five years, 81 in both Tuscany and Emilia-Romagna .
&quot;The Italian process has evolved irrationally,&quot; says Paolo Protti, president of Anecu, &quot;it is useful to create new structures, but it would be necessary to guarantee that existing ones survive, because when one cinema in the city closes, not all its visitors are willing to relocate to multiplex.
Then let&#39;s not even talk about the insufficient subsidy to the fund in favor of the operators: the previous state debt is about 10 million euros.
From a moral and ethical point of view, it is a shame that the government does not respect existing laws.
Between € 16 and € 18 million a year would be needed to support the sector ».
Interesting is the Bologna case, the first Italian city to deal with closures and which decided to find a way out by signing a protocol between the municipality and Anec, the first of its kind in Italy to protect and promote small cinemas in both historic centers and suburbs.
Among the planned standards are tax relief steps in favor of operators and benefits for the audience in terms of mobility: spectators will be able to enter the restricted traffic zone and will have special prices to stop and in some car parks.
&quot;I like this initiative,&quot; says Giuseppe Tornatore, &quot;and I hope that other cities will follow the example of Bologna by introducing other measures.&quot;
However, it is certain that in order to oppose the great power of the multiplex, traditional halls must improve the quality of sound and image, because today&#39;s audience is more demanding.
Defending traditional cinema is a topic that has always been important: the closure of the Super Cinema in Bagheria, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was a spark that convinced me to start the &quot;New Paradiso Cinema&quot;, which I had been thinking about for 10 years.
I&#39;ve lived in Rome for 25 years, and as I walk in front of the already closed Rialto or Quirinal on Nazionale Street, where I&#39;ve shared so much emotion that I don&#39;t have to look at dust-blackened inscriptions, I turn the other way.
The connection between politics and the mafia group &#39;ndrangheta, the mayor of Gioia Tauro in prison
&quot;The mayor of Gioia Tauro was willing to adjust the election of the city office according to the interests of the mafia group Piromalli.&quot;
The allegations made by the Anti-Mafia Directorate in Calabria against Mayor and Vice-Mayor Gioia Tauro Giorgio Dal Torrione and Rosario Schiavone, and Rosarno Mayor Carlo Martelli, imprisoned this morning for external cooperation with a mafia organization, are grave.
Also in handcuffs is Gioacchino Piromalli, an old mediator between the clan and the public administration, and his grandson, a lawyer, the namesake of the boss, already accused of committing mafia crimes, sentenced to pay 10 million euros.
&quot;They ignored all legal and moral norms, as well as common sense,&quot; prosecutors wrote when two local governments expressed a willingness to pay for consultations with lawyer Piromalli.
&quot;In this way, the mafia group would allow - the judges write - to officially enter the municipal authorities and facilitate the already huge possibilities of control and management of public administration.&quot;
The president of the Calabrian Regional Commission, Agazio Loiero, makes no secret of the fact that &quot;there are many secret agreements between local institutions and the organized criminal underworld in his region:&quot; There are areas where mafia concentration is stronger than others where collusion is inevitable.
But we also have many local politicians who resist the pressures of &#39;ndranghets, heroes who are still spotless.&#39;
This morning&#39;s arrests follow last July&#39;s arrests, in which police showed that the mafia group Piromalli had received final action.
Since the end of April last year - the city council of Gioia Tauro has been dissolved since 1991, due to the then assumed link between organized crime and local government - local politicians have been stripped of their positions in the municipal administration.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, chairman of the Christian Democrats, who was elected head of the center-right coalition at the time of the dissolution after a short election in May.
He shouted over the scandal when the Prefecture ordered the dissolution of the municipal council.
He called on the then Deputy Interior Minister Marc Minniti and accused him of plotting everything for political reasons, but judges in a prison order signed this morning explain that the mob group even went so far as to ask for a change in the A3 motorway project.
Other interrogations against Dal Torrion, the prosecutors write, revealed &quot;a willingness to shift the demands of the businessman, a representative of a larger group very close, as is well known, to Piromalli, and to adapt public administration choices to the interests of the mob group.&quot;
When energy is born from waves, the big ones come into play.
It is an endless deposit that covers more than 70% of the earth&#39;s surface and is now being discovered by major global energy companies.
Waves, currents, tides, ebbs are new sources of inexhaustible energy, on which the eyes of colossi like Chevron, who are now trying to reach out to these sources, have clung.
The possibility of generating energy from sea movements has been studied for more than a hundred years, and in the 1970s, in connection with the first oil crisis, research intensified.
When the price of oil fell around 1980, the idea of using marine energy went away. But now environmental organizations and a new rise in oil prices have given the sector a new impetus.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London stated in 2007 that approximately 15 percent of the world&#39;s electricity consumption could be covered by the use of sea wave motion.
this amount would be twice the energy currently produced in nuclear centers.
In addition, there are currents and tides.
The giants are attacking.
the company that invested in marine energy was Enersis, which agreed in 2005 to build a facility in northern Portugal.
When this plan was announced, it looked like a huge revolutionary step.
After two years of betting on marine energy, more and more companies are betting on marine energy rather than traditional energy.
&quot;Chevron is studying ocean energy technology - a spokesman for a company linked to the United States oil colossus said in the Wall Street Journal - and is considering working with us.&quot;
The cooperation we are considering involves obtaining permission from the US Energy Commission, which is required to launch a project to use marine energy in Alaska.
We cannot underestimate this signal, especially given that Alaska continues to extract oil in Alaska, and President Bush recently came up with a plan for new drilling.
In addition to Chevron, Verdant Power Inc. is following in the footsteps of marine energy. From New York and Ocean Power from New Jersey, and the amounts invested so far, although not known in detail, show growing interest, according to observers.
The technology that needs to be developed.
Experts talk about the technology, which is still in its infancy, because it is not known what impact the use of marine energy will have on the environment.
So far, facilities in Portugal and some in Scotland are small in size and do not appear to be causing major ecosystem problems.
However, for greater energy production, it is necessary to use technologies with a greater impact on the environment.
The methods are different: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of fears that are interconnected.
The force of the waves, which moves up and down with the buoys, is changed by means of cylinders and cylinders to the hydraulic pressure inside these buoys.
The pressure spins the turbine, which supplies energy to the generator.
Energy reaches the shore by submarine cables.
So far, four facilities of this type are in the project phase, pending only federal approval, and some of the energy could be used for military purposes.
By contrast, Verdant Power already generates power for the mall and parking lot using six submarine turbines on New York&#39;s East River.
The movement of water during tides causes the turbines to rotate, which feeds the generator with this rotational movement.
Verdant stated that they have a long list of clients waiting for the necessary authorizations due to the possibility of using this energy.
After the waves, after the tide and after the low tide.
The potential of tides deserves special interest at this time, they say at the Institute for Electricity Research.
Although a discontinuous factor, tides are more predictable than wind, sun or waves, and therefore more reliable as a source of energy.
States such as New York, Maine and Alaska, as well as other coastal states, have already invested $ 7 and a half million dollars in 2008 in tidal energy and forecast investments of up to $ 35 million in 2009.
