28-year-old chef found dead in San Francisco store
The 28-year-old chef, who recently moved to San Francisco, was on the steps of a local store this week.
But the victim's brother says he has no idea who would want to hurt him, adding, "He's finally starting to do well."
The body found in Westfield Mall on Wednesday morning has been identified as San Francisco resident Frank Galicia, the medical examiner's office said.
The San Francisco Police Department said it is a violent death and an investigation is underway.
The victim's brother, Louis Galicia, told ABC station KGO in San Francisco that Frank, who was formerly a regular chef in Boston, got his dream job as a chef at Sons & Daughters six months ago.
A spokesman for Sons & Daughters said they were "shocked and devastated" by his death.
"We have a small team that works as a close-king family. We will miss him very much," the spokesman said.
Our thoughts and sorrows go out to Frank's family and friends at this difficult time.
Louis Galicia reported that Frank first sleeps in hostels, but that recently "he's finally starting to do well."
"He found an apartment, dated a girl," Louis Galicia told KGO.
Louis Galicia said he had no idea who would want to hurt his younger brother.
He had a kind soul and a big heart.
When he wanted to get in touch with his family, he always cooked us food, made us dinner," Louis Galicia said.
He never wanted to be involved in any quarrel.
He was a brother who took things for what they are.
"Even if everything else in the world was wrong, he was an unassed diamond that irradiated every day," he said.

Czech Railways has invested over 31 billion in vehicle modernization.
They have air conditioning and new toilets.
In the last six years, the state carrier has invested over CZK 31 billion in vehicle modernization.
A third of the cars are currently equipped with air conditioning, about half of the trains have a new system of closed toilets.
However, the amounts for modernisation in individual years, with the exception of 2012, are gradually falling.
In the last six years, Czech Railways has invested over CZK 31 billion in vehicle modernization.
A third of the cars are currently equipped with air conditioning, about half of the trains have a new system of closed toilets.
The money spent was reflected in a reduction in the average age by two years for locomotives and separate units and six years for classic wagons.
The carrier made a larger share of the investment in regional transport, which was about 60 percent of the money, and the company invested 40 percent in the renewal of long-distance vehicles.
The average age of locomotives and units currently reaches 19 years.
However, upgraded older vehicles are counted as completely new in this indicator.
If vehicle upgrades were not envisaged, the average age of ČD traction drives would increase by ten years.
On average, passenger cars are slightly older, with an average age of 23 years when noting upgrades.
If only the age from the date of manufacture were taken into account, the average age of these vehicles would be 33.4 years.
However, classic trains consisting of wagons and driven by locomotives have gradually disappeared from czech and global railways in recent years and are being replaced by motor or electric units.
Between 2011 and 2015, locomotives decreased from 280 to 223 units, similarly the number of classic wagons fell from 2716 in 2011 to 2132 in the middle of this year.
In particular, the carrier got rid of old vehicles equipped with leatherette seats and doors without the possibility of blocking the opening during the ride.
From January to July, the carrier had 110 of these cars scrapped.
Among the investments that ČD plans to make in the near future, it is possible to mention, for example, the purchase of 50 wagons for speed up to 200 kilometers per hour, which the carrier plans to deploy on the international line Prague - Bratislava - Budapest, or a framework contract for the purchase of electric units for domestic express lines.
The contract provides for the collection of up to 30 pieces of motor and 20 pieces of electric units.
The authorities have known about illegal advertising for a quarter of a year, they can't get rid of it.
We're completely helpless, they admit.
For a quarter of a year, the editorial board of the online daily Aktuálně.cz has been following the story of a billboard in South Bohemia that now attracts motorists to visit Lipno, where not only is there a touristy walk in the treetops, but also an Olympic park.
Highway officials know they're standing there illegally, but they say there's nothing they can do about it.
There are hundreds, maybe thousands, of similar ads across the country.
According to officials, a flimsy law is to blame, which makes it impossible to remove illegal mobile billboards right away.
What is needed first is a complex bureaucratic wheel.
In the meantime, however, the company will change its name and the office is short on it.
Or just move the ad a few meters and the official process has to start over.
A quarter of a year ago, the Directorate of Roads and Motorways admitted: at the main road from České Budějovice to Lipno, an advertising billboard stands on our land by the state road.
But even three months was not enough for officials to get rid of an unauthorized portable structure with a giant advertising poster.
It's as if no one minds that he's standing right next to the road, in a 50-meter protection zone where nothing can happen for safety.
Road managers say they can't easily handle a billboard because of a leaky law.
Maybe load him up and take him away.
"We can't just afford that," says Nina Ledvinová, a spokeswoman for the Highways and Highways Directorate, referring to the complex bureaucratic wheel that the removal of the billboard must legally prevent.
The case of this particular billboard, whose fate was detailed in the online journal Aktuálně.cz in the spring, is not unique and points to a general problem that the state and the authorities cannot solve effectively and quickly.
In South Bohemia only, the editorial office counted dozens of similar mobile ads placed against the rules just off or near the road.
Other regions are similarly in the same position.
"We have trouble getting companies to remove the banners," confirms Jiří Klása, head of the Transport Department of the Český Budějovice Regional Office, whose colleagues deal with similar stories.
According to Klása, a leaky law that binds officials is to blame.
First, he has to address the billboard owners in an intricate way to put the ad away.
But company bosses are often unassuched, or they know the trick that Aktuálně.cz has described in the past when it became more closely known: just move the mobile ad stand a few meters, and officials can throw the previous call to remove black advertising in the trash.
That's because the bureau has to pinpoint exactly where the illegal billboard stands.
"If someone moves it and the coordinates suddenly disagree, it is seen as a new device and we have to approach the owner again," explains Jiří Klása.
The new law won't help.
The change could be brought about by a new law that will ban billboards on highways from September next year and restrict them to Class I roads.
Critics point out that the rules for combating illegal and easily transferable ads will remain the same as before.
And the authorities won't be relieved.
Companies can continue to earn tens to hundreds of millions of crowns a year on renting illegal land and no one can afford them.
For example, the billboard attracting Lipno belongs to Commerz Billboard.
Officials know her well: the Český Budějovice Municipality is currently conducting three administrative proceedings with her for black-built billboards.
The company faces a 300,000 fine in each proceeding.
These are multiple ads that were placed in the Class I protection zone without permission.
The proceedings are not yet completed, says Jaroslav Mráz, Head of the Transport Department of the Český Budějovice Municipality.
The advertising that the Aktuálně.cz is interested in is not yet among these cases, but it will most likely be added soon.
According to Nina Ledvinová, a spokeswoman for the DSD, the company did not respond to repeated written calls for removal, and the case will be put on the table by regional and then probably municipal officials.
Commerz Billboard is one of those suspicious companies that can't be contacted.
It does not take over the post office and cancelled its official residence in Žižkov more than six years ago.
It's not even clear who's behind it.
In the past, the company's post office went to a South Bohemian businessman Anton Fischer, who famously had a bitter dispute with the head of hyundai's Czech representation.
But Fischer, whose company Euro Billboard rents the land from Comerz Billboard and offers it to advertisers, has denied any connection in the past.
This spring, when the DSD became interested in advertising lipno at the initiative of Aktuálně.cz, Fischer had civil servants send a letter to the mysterious company Commerz Billboard to his guesthouse, where the company is said to be based.
However, no one has heard from this address to this day.
A futile struggle.
Such silences or opaque changes of settlements are not uncommon.
A few years ago, we gradually fined one company czk 2 million.
But she changed the name and I.D., and there was nothing to worry about.
The bailiff returned the case, the ads continued, perhaps in other places.
We are quite powerless against similar companies and their business practices.
It's like fighting windmills, admits one of the officials on condition of anonymity.
No one has yet dealt with the amendment to the act in this regard.
Aktuálně.cz spoke to several Members who were interested in the problem.
But they haven't taken any action yet.
On the contrary, members appeared who wanted to extend the deadline for the preservation of billboards on the main Czech roads.
The government denied it.
Billboards are not only a very sensitive and somewhat schizophrenic topic for national, but also regional and municipal politicians.
On the one hand, they know about the social demand for their limitations, on the other hand, they need them themselves for advertising in election campaigns.
I don't give the fairly established impression that when something doesn't work, you need to change the law.
Farmers will harvest less grain this year, but more rapeseed and ups to the top, statisticians estimate.
According to estimates of the Czech Statistical Office, the cereal harvest will be 6.7 percent lower this year than last year.
Yet this year's crop exceeds the average over the last five or ten years.
On the contrary, the harvest of rapeseed (by 3.9 percent) and ups of the seed (2.5 percent) will be higher.
Cereal harvests will be 6.7 percent lower this year than last.
Farmers harvest 7.2 million tonnes of grain.
This is based on an estimate published by the Czech Statistical Office as of 15 July.
The initial estimate a month ago was more pessimistic, predicting a tenth decline from a year ago.
But last year's cereal harvest was above average.
This year's crop exceeds the average over the last five or ten years.
On the contrary, the harvest of rapeseed and ups and vees will be higher this year.
Rapeseed growers reap 3.9 percent more than a year ago, when they put 1.256 million tons under the roof.
This year's crop of ups and down 2.5 percent from last year's.
The projected decrease in cereal production is due both to a decrease in the yield per hectare of 3,7 % to 5,71 tonnes per hectare and to a decrease in the crop area.
Farmers have seded three percent fewer fields this year.
Winter wheat, which is the most important cereal for the Czech Republic, is estimated to be harvested 3.3 percent less this year.
The farmers, meanwhile, had it in more fields.
However, a lower yield per hectare will be signed on the decline, which will fall to 6.04 tonnes.
About a fifth of the decrease is projected by statisticians for spring barley, which is most often used for beer production.
The reduction in crop yields is due to a reduction of 15.2 percent in sowing areas, as well as a lower yield per hectare.
Winter barley, on the other hand, is born 6.3 percent more.
The harvest of rye will also increase.
Statistics estimate the rapeseed crop at 1.305 million tonnes, up from 1.305 million tonnes a year ago.
Crop areas expanded by 7.3 percent.
But the yield per hectare will be 3.2 percent lower than last year.
This year's rapeseed crop will outnume the 10-year average by 13.3 percent, but it is sedua seded on an area a third larger than a decade ago.
There have also been more and more fields of up to four years.
This year, farmers have suctuaryed it on 35,543 hectares.
Compared to 2008, when the ups and downs were grown on a record 70,000 hectares in the Czech Republic, the fields are half that.
Thanks to the expansion of sowing areas, this year's harvest of the upsuit will be richer.
It will rise 2.5 percent from a year ago to 27,423 tons.
But the yield per hectare will be 6.1 percent lower.
Olomouk police officers charged two men with knife and machete attacks, the court remanded them in custody.
Police have charged two assailants who attacked a 35-year-old man with a knife and machete in central Olomouc on Tuesday.
"Although the victim tried to escape, they caused him a cut and a cut, which required hospital treatment and further treatment," said police spokeswoman Marie Štrbáková.
Both apparent perpetrators were apprehended by police immediately after the attack.
The plaintiff filed a motion with the court to take them into custody, and the court granted it on Friday.
Both men face three to 10 years in prison.
Police have charged two detainees with assaulting a 35-year-old man in the centre of Olomouc with a knife and a machete.
The assailants inflicted cuts and cuts on him, and the man ended up in the hospital.
The attack was preceded by an incident between two groups of people that took place at noon on Liberty Avenue at noon on Tuesday, police said.
The perpetrators ended up in custody, reported Olomouc police spokeswoman Marie Štrbáková.
The mass scuffle between two families took place in the garden area in front of the Tratoria bar in the immediate vicinity of the centre of Olomouc.
After an aggressive verbal altercation, two assailants attacked a 35-year-old man with a knife and a machete.
Although the assaulted man tried to escape, they inflicted a cut and cut that required hospital treatment and other treatment, a police spokeswoman said.
The scuffle, which attracted a lot of attention in the city centre and caused several police patrols and officers to intervene on the scene, was a family feud.
Criminologists charged a 34-year-old man from Slovakia and a 37-year-old man from Olomouc with attempted grievous bodily harm and disorderly conduct.
The plaintiff filed a motion with the court to take them into custody, and the court granted it on Friday, the spokeswoman added.
The machete was also used in the centre of Olomouc in a mass brawl five years ago, it happened only a few tens of meters away, in front of the Varna disco in Riegrova Street.
Police said at the time that a group of about 10 foreigners with guns attacked the business guests who were standing outside the entrance.
According to police, they had knives, sticks and machetes in their hands.
The court then punished the two attacking foreigners with a suspended sentence.
Abandoned and empty houses in the center of Prague.
You'll be surprised, maybe you walk around them every day.
One of the most blatant examples of an unused and empty house is the large building of the former IPB headquarters in the middle of Senovážný Square.
It should have been a hotel by now.
But still nothing.
That there is a need to build new and new apartments and offices in the metropolis?
What about using existing, often architecturally valuable and protected?
Right in the center of Prague in the immediate vicinity of Wenceslas Square there are several apartment buildings, which, despite their location, size and often monumental protection, are just desolate and empty.
We selected the properties in the centre using the Prázdnédomy.cz, which maps long-term empty properties in the Czech Republic.
Houses are usually victims of financial problems of their owners, opaque relationships between companies or belong to a state that cannot or does not want to get rid of them.
There are more empty houses in the Czech Republic than there are homeless people.
Let the owners pay a special tax on them, the initiative wants

Mr. and Mrs. Clinton made $10.6 million last year.
Trump refuses to release his tax returns.
Hillary Clinton and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, made $10.6 million last year.
More than $1 million was donated to the Clintons for charity.
Most of the Clintons' income - over $6 million - is for their speeches.
Trump refuses to release his tax returns.
U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton released her tax returns on Friday, increasing pressure on her Republican rival Donald Trump to do the same.
Hillary Clinton and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, made $10.6 million last year, AP reported.
Most of the Clintons' income - more than $6 million - is for their speeches, largely from before April 2015, when Clinton launched her campaign before the election.
The tax report showed that Mrs. and Mrs. Clinton paid a federal income tax of 34.2 percent last year, as well as an income tax of nine percent at the state and local levels.
In total, they paid 43.2 percent of their income in taxes.
But Trump has a problem with a similar move, but has not yet decided to release his tax returns.
There's a possibility that Donald Trump doesn't pay any taxes at all, Clinton tweeted minutes after her returns were released.
Clinton has repeatedly returned to the secrecy surrounding Trump's income, among other things, to raise doubts about whether her opponent is actually as wealthy as she claims, AP reported.
Trump's fortune is estimated at billions of dollars.
Lower earnings would damage the Republican nominee's reputation as a successful businessman.

Polio has re-erupted in Nigeria.
Boko Haram Islamists prevented consistent vaccinations and killed doctors.
Polio cases have resued in Nigeria.
In the north-east of the country, the government has declared an emergency vaccination, as two children infected with the disease have been paralyzed.
The vaccines were delivered by helicopters.
Islamist Boko Haram terrorists were active in the affected area, defending the vaccinations and even killing doctors.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the virus circulated there undetected.
In nigeria's northeast, an emergency vaccination of children against polio will begin, as two children infected with the disease have been paralyzed there.
Polio was last diagnosed in Africa two years ago in Somalia.
The Nigerian government has announced that one million children will be vaccinated in Borno state and another four million in the surrounding states.
Nigerian military helicopters quickly delivered polio vaccines to the affected northeastern part of the country, home to Boko Haram Islamist terrorists, on Friday, according to AP.
The World Health Organization (WHO) said the virus had been circulating unnoticed in the area for many years.
Boko Haram extremists have defended vaccinations in the past and even killed doctors.
Their attacks also made it impossible on Thursday for doctors to reach areas where children with polio were detected.
Both affected toddlers came with refugees from parts of Nigeria newly liberated from Boko Haram.
Michel Zaffran, director of the WHO's polio eradication section, told the BBC that vaccinations in Nigeria would begin as early as next week.
The Islamic radical group Boko Haram has long operated in Borno state.
The area was only made available to international organisations and the government earlier this year, when Boko Haram was significantly weakened in this part of the country.
Nigerian Health Minister Isaac Adewole acknowledged that new polio cases were a major disappointment for the country, as Nigeria wanted to announce next year that polio had been eradicated there.
The WHO pointed out that although the disease did not appear for two years, it was still spreading among children.
Children under the age of five will now be vaccinated.
In 2012, Nigeria accounted for half of all polio cases in the world.
While polio was still in 125 countries in 1988, it now persists in only three areas - Afghanistan and Pakistan and northern Nigeria.
The Pope met former prostitutes in Rome.
He listened to the stirring stories of fallen women.
Pope Francis met 20 former prostitutes who escaped from a gang of pimps thanks to police.
The Pope listened to their difficult life stories and invited them to look to the future with confidence.
With this meeting, Francis wanted to draw attention to trafficking in human beings and to call for an intensified fight against it.
Pope Francis met 20 former prostitutes in Rome who were freed from the power of a gang of pimps by the police.
The head of the Catholic Church listened for more than an hour to the stirring stories of fallen women and then urged them to look to the future with confidence, a Vatican spokesman said.
Among the former prostitutes Francis visited were six women from Romania, four from Albania, seven from Nigeria and one from Tunisia, Italy and Ukraine.
Their average age is around 30.
All were subjected to severe physical violence during forced prostitution, according to the Vatican.
With the visit, Francis wanted to draw attention to human trafficking and call for an intensified fight against it, the Pope's spokesman said.
Francis often draws attention to the fates of people on the fringes of society.
On Thursday, for example, he had lunch with Syrian refugees who arrived at the Vatican in April this year and in June because of his personal invitation.
France will strike jihadist factories.
But it won't work without the help of Muslims.
France is to be helped by Muslims themselves in the fight against radical Islamism.
Moreover, Prime Minister Manuel Valls' government is preparing fundamental changes in the functioning of mosques and the education of clergy.
We have closed 20 mosques and prayer rooms since last December.
And more will follow, the Home Secretary announced.
There are over 100 jihadist factories in the country.
"If Muslims do not help the state in the fight against those who violate public freedom, it will become increasingly difficult for France to guarantee freedom to this religion," prime minister Manuel Valls said.
In particular, it intends to ensure that only imams who have been educated in France preach in mosques and places of worship.
At the same time, it wants to stop funding mosques from abroad.
Currently, about 20 percent of the money comes from abroad to build new mosques, mostly from Morocco, Algeria, and the Gulf countries.
This is also why preachers who can séed radicalism in France get into mosques.
"Our country must show that Islam is compatible with democracy," the Prime Minister added.
The key to ensuring that these goals are met will be the new French Islamic Foundation.
It should act as a bridge between the secular state and the Muslim minority.
No more foreign money.
The French Foundation for Islam, founded in 2005 by then Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin, now operates in the country.
Even then, the foundation was supposed to help make financial flows between mosques and the countries that finance their construction more transparent.
But the institution was soon hit by internal divisions and rivalries.
"It's a total failure," Valls said recently.
Already on the French political scene, after the attack on Charlie Hebdo magazine in January 2015, a debate erupted about a new institution to replace the dysfunctional foundation.
This was precimated by other terrorist attacks in France carried out in the name of the Islamic State by radicalized Islamists.
French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve recently announced that a new foundation would be created this October.
It will have two main tasks - to ensure the financing of mosques from domestic sources, and also to supervise imams.
For now, it is not clear where it will take money not only for the construction of new mosques, but also for various educational centers.
However, several proposals are being considered.
One of them is a special fee or tax on halal food.
In practice, halal food vendors would pay for this to provide certification.
Some of that money would then go to the foundation's coffers.
The contribution of 10 to 20 euros (270 to 540 crowns) could then be paid by French pilgrims who go to Mecca.
About 30,000 go there every year for a traditional pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia.
And not only that.
According to the Prime Minister, only preachers who have undergone special educational programmes at French universities should operate in mosques in the future.
This should ensure that the sermon is in line with democracy.
We're going to close radical mosques.
At the same time, the French government is in the campaign against radicals.
And more will follow, the Interior Minister announced recently.
There is no place in France for those who preach hatred in mosques and do not respect some of the principles of our country, such as equality between women and men.
There are an estimated 2,500 mosques and prayer rooms in the country.
It is estimated that about 120 of them are under the influence of radical Islamism.
Since 2012, authorities have expelled about 80 imams and are considering it for several dozen others.
But not everyone thinks that the government's actions can significantly counter radicalism.
Those who want to become radicalized will do the same.
This does not happen in mosques, young people become radicalized online, said Severine Labat, an expert at the National Center for Scientific Research.
Kelemen lost to star Baugém in the first round of the sprint.
The Czech track cyclist has to fight for promotion to the final eight in repair rides.
Track cyclist Pavel Kelemen lost a first-round match to French great Grégory Baugé, the defending silver medalist at last year's Games in London, after progressing from qualifying for the top 18 sprint.
They have to fight for the final eight in the repair rides.
27 riders took part in the start of the royal event on the track and the best Czech track rider of the moment scored the 14th best time.
He made the 200 with a quick start in 9.969 seconds.
In the main knockout stage, he was faced with the fifth Baugé in qualifying, who already has bronze in the team sprint from Rio.
Kelemen was in the end touing the experienced Frenchman, but he kept an eye on the progress.
Defending champion Jason Kenny flashed a great performance.
The 28-year-old Briton ran the third fastest 200 in history and won the qualifier in an Olympic record of 9,551.
As expected, he also handled the last advancing german, Maximilian Levy.
The British quartet also did well in the line-up with Bradley Wiggins, who set a new world record of 3:50.570 in the 4km pursuit and advanced to the final.
They improved their previous high (3:51,659), which belonged to the British four years after the London Olympics, by more than a second.
Junior doctors push: They want fresh wind in the industry
Representatives of junior doctors have gathered to approve new steps in their dispute over a new contract.
The Council of Junior Doctors (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) must ask the entire council to support further industry events in early September.
JDC says ministers have failed to resolve the treaty issues.
Junior doctors and medical students voted in July to reject a contract agreed with the BMA.
58% of its members who participated in the election were rejected.
In a letter to members posted on Twitter Thursday night, JDC Chairman Ellen McCourt said the government remained "remain silent" on issues that led to the rejection of the contract.
She said: "In this light, the JDC executive decided by vote to reject the proposed new treaty entirely and to call for new formal negotiations on all issues."
In response to the government's silence, the JDC Executive Board today formally requested a special meeting of the BMA board to approve the ongoing programme of industry action in early September.
The dispute has led young doctors to declare six strikes this year, including the first general strikes in the history of the NHS.
The BMA's junior doctors leader, Dr Johann Malawana, resigned following the decision to reject the agreed terms of the contract recommended by the BMA.
He told BMA members in pre-vote meetings in front of 54,000 junior doctors and medical students that the agreement was good and should be accepted.
After the vote, the Health Secretary said the contract would be a burden on medics in England.
Russia and Turkey: An alliance of "incompatible"?
It was a gesture that ended in crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to shake hands and announce the formal end of the eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.
But while Vladimir Putin welcomed the Turkish counterpart to the sumptuous hall of the Palace of St. Petersburg, I had the impression that Ankara wanted more of this reconciliation.
There was a handshake, yes.
But Putin did not grid, and hardly radiated warmth, even by his measured standards.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, has repeatedly spoken of his "dear friend" Mr Putin - five times, according to one of the reports.
I didn't count it.
He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their pre-crisis levels, but would be even better.
The next day, a local newspaper reported that Erdogan had acted as if nothing bad had ever happened.
I think his enthusiasm revealed the exact opposite.
But the lingering coldness emanating from Putin showed that the Russian leader had forgotten nothing.
The real cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his opening speech: turkey's shooting down of a Russian fighter jet on the Syrian border.
Moscow's reaction at the time was furious.
Putin fired shots around, accusing Ankara of shousing a knife in Moscow's back.
The outrage was all the greater because it came from an alleged friend.
Rebuilding real trust will be difficult, perhaps even impossible.
Russian public opinion has also changed since December.
State-controlled media has waged a massive nationwide campaign against Ankara for months.
Suddenly it looked like the Turks were to all the same.
More serious were accusations from top state officials that Erdogan's own family had benefited from the illegal oil trade in parts of Syria controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He vehemently denied this.
But in St. Petersburg came the official message that it was time to move on.
After all, this meeting only happened because Putin received the apology he demanded from President Erdogan.
Russia could have declared some kind of victory, too.
For Ankara, the benefits of declaring a ceasefire are clear.
In the first place, Erdogan was almost ousted from power in a failed coup last month, and therefore needs all his friends.
Repeated terrorist attacks in Turkey have also visibly shaken him.
There is also an economic motive.
Russian sanctions have had a severe impact - not only the cancellation of charter flights that carry several million Russian tourists to turkey's coast each year.
This number has decreased by almost 90 %.
As far as Russia is to be said, tour operators and charter companies will surely breathe a sigh of relief when flights are eventually resumed.
They profit from Mediterranean tourism at the end of the season.
Even this week, state television promised cheaper fruits and vegetables when imports of agricultural commodities from Turkey are allowed again.
"Tourists there, tomatoes back here," as the vedemosti newspaper put it.
But the visit had additional political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry with the West for what it sees as a poor response to the coup attempt.
Moreover, the prolonged hostility of lengthy talks on EU accession and the accession of Putin - who is longing to take advantage of the cooling and sever Turkey's ties with the West .
The Russian leader certainly earned bonus points when Ankara asked him for help from the elected authorities after the coup attempt.
You have to understand that for Moscow, which has a deep-seated fear of regime change, it is a given.
So the summit in this pompous seaside palace allowed Russia and Turkey to demonstrate what one analyst described to me as an "alliance of the incompatible": how two countries that feel rejected and exploited by the West join forces.
But, despite publicly show reconciliation, there are fundamental differences between the two countries.
The first is Syria, where Moscow recently positioned itself as a peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey are on opposite sides.
You could say that after nearly three hours of initial talks, both presidents said at a press conference that they had not even mentioned the issue.
Turkey's president deliberately avoided answering a question about the differences between them, while Putin chose to highlight those differences.
There is no clear agreement on the basis of which the two countries can find common ground on Syria.
But after months of open hostility - and given the risk of total disaster when NATO member Turkey shot down a Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better that the two leaders are at least talking to each other again.
Royal Bank of Scotland disappears for customers outside Scotland
According to the bank's chief executive, the RBS brand is to be repressed as a back office.
Royal Bank of Scotland will be lost to customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was linked to the bank's global ambitions.
Of these, it eased when it almost disappeared eight years ago and had to be redeemed from debt.
At the time, strateg brands used "RBS" to protect other consumer finance brands.
It was worth millions of pounds spent sponsoring international sport, from the Six Nations Rugby Championship to Winbledom champion Andy Marray.
But now it has been decided that it is better to make national brands stand out more.
Royal Bank of Scotland will be used by Scottish customers but will not launch new business.
All references to RBS in England and Wales, with the exception of head office and stock coding on the stock exchange, will be changed to NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other, smaller private banking brands that will come to the fore more - Coutts, Adam &Co, Drummond, and Holt's Military Bank.
During a trip to customers and staff in Inverness-shire, McEwan answered questions from Ross McEwan.
He told BBC Scotland: "The RBS brand will cease to be our investor brand and the brand for which our employees work, because we are now much more of a brand bank."
Since the bank itself became a global brand, RBS has become a global brand as well.
Now I say that we no longer have global aspirations, we have efforts focused on the domestic scene.
Each of these brands will mean something completely different in their own communities, and our workers will work under these brands.
RBS has already stated that it will not continue its sponsorship of the Six Nations Championship, has prepared a profile of individual sports sponsorship brands.
"This is a good time for us to move to a brand bank, because the fundamental question (we're asking ourselves) is how do we focus on becoming a better bank for customers?" said the CEO.
Three years ago, it would have been very cynical if we had said that we were going to become a great bank for customers and introduce those brands.
But as we focused on customer needs and not our own, I think there's a lot of change going on.
We can remind these brands, I think the time has come.
Frankie Dettori leads 3,000th winner at Newmarket on Predilection
Dettori splashes champagne after double win at Newmarket brings him 3,000 wins
Jockey Frankie Dettori secured his 3,000th British victory at Newmarket on Friday.
He reached this milestone with his second victory of the evening on his local track - on a Predilection horse trained by John Gosden.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to achieve such a result in straight races.
His predecessors are Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson.
Three-time champion Žekje Dettori, who had previously won on a Ghayyar horse, said, "It's strange."
I am very touched because my family is also here
I am extremely glad that this happened in Newmarket, because this is where I docked 30 years ago.
It's not a huge event, it's not Royal Ascot - it's a Friday night on the ground with 20,000 people.
I'm relieved and very grateful.
Dettori collects congratulations as he brings predilection after victory
Two jockeys reached this milestone in obstacle races - champion jockey Richard Johnson and 20-time retired champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who has led more than 4,300 winners to the finish line during his record-breaking career.
Lester Piggott, nine-time Derby winner, 4,493 career winners
Frankie is one of the best jockeys of modern times and it is no surprise that he has reached a milestone that only a few riders have reached before him.
He's stylish and strong, but it's his tactical fission that sets him apart from the other riders in the weigh-in.
He is a fantastic race ambassador, his enthusiasm and charisma have attracted fans to the sport for years.
A few weeks ago, I told Frankie at Epsam that if he hadn't just been racing on weekends and big races, he'd have 6,000 winners by now!
But the truth is, Frankie has ridden winners in the UK for most of his 30-year career, and that's really something.
It has a lively nature, which is good for British racing. But more importantly, he's an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated his success with his famous flying jump
From flying finishes to flying jumps, Frankie Dettori has been a messenger of British flat racing for two decades.
It was like a roller coaster ride.
A plethora of big race winners, including his famous "spectacular seven" at Ascot. But he also survived a plane crash and was banned from taking off because of drugs.
Three years ago, he first stagnated returning from a six-month ban, but he showed incredible inner strength and returned to all doubters in his best form.
And this may not be the last time - Dettori has previously stated that he would like to continue racing until at least 50 years old.
Russian President Putin sacks president's chief of staff Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly fired Sergei Ivanov as head of the presidential office on Friday.
Ivanov was one of Putin's closest associates for many years.
Ivanov, 63, was appointed special representative for ecology and transport.
A statement from the Kremlin said Putin had "relieved Ivanov of his services as head of the Russian presidential office," but no reason was given.
He will be taken over by Anton Vajno, who has been Ivanov's deputy since 2012.
Vajno, 44, was previously a diplomat.
Born in Tallinn, Estonia, in 1972, he graduated from the prestigious State Institute of International Relations in Moscow (MGIMO) and worked at the Embassy in Tokyo.
The website (in Russian) states that he later worked as head of the presidential protocol and the presidential office.
When appointed, he said to Putin, "Thank you for your trust."
I believe that the most important role of the administration is to support your activities as Head of State in terms of draft laws and checking the extent to which your instructions are followed.
Putin told a Russian television station on Friday that Ivanov had asked him to leave the post and recommended that Vajno replace him.
Convinces smiles?
This move completely mystified Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov was one of Vladimir Putin's closest associates for a long time and, like Putin, worked for the KGB.
As head of the presidential office, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin that was broadcast on state television, the two men said that he was leaving his post as head of the presidential office at his own request.
But camera smiles convinced only a few people - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.
So is this the result of some kind of power struggle?
No one knows yet.
But the official claim that the man once considered a possible president, who is suddenly eager to lead Russia's environmental policy, was met with great mistrust.
The Kremlin's website quotes comments addressed to Putin in which Ivanov states: "It is true that in 2012 I asked you in an interview to entrust me with this very demanding post, even a problematic post, for four years.
Apparently, I was president's chief of staff for four years and eight months.
Ivanov took over in December 2011.
Prior to that, he served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and previously, like Putin, worked for the State Security Committee (KGB).
In the late 1990s, when Putin was in command of the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation (FSB), which replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy.
When Putin came to power, he appointed Ivanov as one of his five closest associates.
At one time, there was even speculation that Ivanov might succeed Putin as head of state after his second term, because a third term would be unconstitutional for Putin.
But another close putin associate, Dmitry Medvedev, took over the post.
Putin became prime minister just three and a half years later before returning to the presidency.
Thomas Gibson, star of Thoughts of a Criminal, was released after he hit the director
Gibson became involved in a physical exchange on stage in Los Angeles last month.
ABC and CBS, which produce the series, announced his release in a joint statement.
Gibson, who played Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, apologized Thursday before announcing his firing.
There were creative differences on the stage and disagreements.
I'm sorry it happened," he said in a statement.
According to a statement from ABC and CBS, details of how Gibson's character disappears from the show, which follows the stories of a team of FBI agents, are a little later.
The 54-year-old actor, best known for starring in the sitcom Dharma and Greg, has been on the show since the first season in 2005.
"I love The Thoughts of a Criminal, and over the last 12 years, I have put my heart and soul into them," Gibson said in a statement released Friday.
I was hoping to be in it to the end. But that won't be possible now.
I would also like to express my thanks to the authors, producers, actors, our amazing team and, above all, the great fans that this show could ever hope for.
The series is expected to return for season 12 on September 28.
Fish mysteriously land in garden in Banff
A man from the town of Banff asked for help identifying the fish that appeared in his garden.
Kevin Bain believes that 75 pieces of fish may be sand eels left behind by a water storm.
Bain, who lives about 500 metres from the sea, posted a short film of his discovery on periscope, in the thought that someone might help him explain how the 5-inch fish got into his garden.
Queensferry Crossing: Bridge now connects with Fife
The £1.35bn project is due to be completed by May 2017
Engineers have connected the northern platform and the Queensferry Crossing and the viaduct - so the bridge now connects with Fife.
It is therefore the first of four closures between the "platform fans", which are now almost completed around each of the three pylons of the bridge.
Part of the bridge from Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tonnes.
It has 10,000 tons of iron and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 hanging ropes.
The £1.35bn project is due to be completed by May 2017.
Economics Secretary Keith Brown visited the site today and was among the first to come from the mainland to the bridge.
He said: "This is a historic moment and a symbolic moment in the construction of the Queensferry Crossing.
On this project, we are all witnessing how construction engineers used more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel to construct this part of the bridge on an impressive scale.
Despite the massive dimensions and weight of the bridge, completing the closure between the viaduct and the bridge platform was a delicate operation that required extraordinary accuracy.
In its place is now more than 79% of the total area of the bridge, concrete for the last parts of the platform is now being poured in Rosyth, so the whole platform is ready to be lifted onto the bridge.
Michael Martin, project manager for Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors, said: "The first closure in the construction of each bridge is always an important milestone.
On this amazing project, this closure represents the pinnate of building construction.
After installing the last part of the road platform and connecting it to the North Tower expansion platform, we then had to close the last gap on the north side - towards the mainland.
We did this by stretching the north approach viaduct 700 millimeters south.
This was a massive and at the same time very delicate operation.
Massive because the viaduct is 222 meters long, weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be dragged with a climb of about 3%.
Delicate because the tolerances the team worked with were very small - only a few millimeters each way.
Luckily, everything went very well.
Moelfre Bay rescue: Three men 'happy to be alive'
Three men are 'happy to be alive' after being washed away by water from their fishing boat off Anglesey.
The Moelfre RNLI lifeboat station raised the alarm at 1.20pm UK Summer Time on Friday after crews saw the incident in Moelfre Bay.
All three men tried to swim to safety while their boat continued uncontrol-controlled.
"We saw their boat circling in their vicinity and we thought the worst of it," said Moelfre lifeboat helmsman Vince Jones.
"Fortunately, the strong wind blew him away from them before we left," he added.
Two men were rescued by a local fishing boat, while a third man, aged 60, was found without a life jacket exhausted, clinging to a buoy.
They were all transferred aboard a coastal lifeboat and taken back to the lifeboat station.
Jones said: "The three men thrown into the water are happy to be alive and completely unharmed.
The ship's engine had an emergency shutdown rope, but somehow it was disconnected from the person driving the boat when it capsized.
Someone above the boy held a protective hand.
The judge refuses to take the case because of The Beater's wife.
Petr Tluchoř is one of three members who, according to the indictment, should have received a political newsagent from Prime Minister Nečas and his then chief of staff, Jana Nagyová, a lucrative post for political concession.
In 2012, it was about approving the tax package.
Snajdr, Fuksa and Tluchoř allowed him to resign.
Then they appeared in influential positions in state-owned firms.
That's why they also faced suspicion of bribery and ended up in custody for a month.
According to the court, however, they were wrongfully compensated for a total of almost CZK 2 million.
The trumpeer is now acting as a witness in the case, following the supreme court's intervention.
His wife works in a courthouse at the Fruit Market and settles civil disputes.
Nevertheless, Judge Helena Králová wants to be careful (she deals with criminal matters ) and to avoid possible objections.
The case will probably be handled by another Prague judicial district.
The King has twice acquitted Jana Nečasová, formerly Nagyová.
It was an alleged misuse of military intelligence to track prime minister Nečas Radka's first wife.
Tluchoř was not involved in this case.
According to lawyer Jaroslav Ortman, however, this is an unnecessarily exaggerated reaction.
I think impartiality cannot be interpreted in this way to exclude a court if witnesses have a wife or relatives in court.
"I'm afraid nothing could be judged," he told the newspaper.
"I think it's crazy," he added.
Roman Boček, a former official, is also charged in the case of political newsagents.
According to his lawyer, Peter Toman, however, any objection would stand a chance of success.
On June 13, the Prague 1 District Court heard the indictment of the former head of the cabinet of Prime Minister Petr Nečas Jana Nagyová (now Nečasová) and other defendants in the case of misuse of military intelligence.
Pictured, Nečasová and her husband arrive at court.
Tluchořová was supposed to deal with the statements about Peroutka.
For example, the wife of an exponent should have judged the statements of President Miloš Zeman about the democratic pre-war journalist Ferdinand Peroutka.
Zeman said he was sympathetic to Adolf Hitler.
One of the schoolgirls is already dead!
The girl is believed to have been killed in an air raid by allied forces.
She flew to Syria with her two girlfriends of the same age from London's Gatwick Airport last February.
The British Home Office has not commented on the news of her death.
Young Londoners who fled their homes were secretly taken to Syria via the Turkish border, according to police.
Shamima Begum, Amira Abase and Kadiza Sultana went to see their other former classmate at Bethnal Green Academy in London, according to media reports.
The case attracted a huge wave of attention last year, as well as tensions in relations between Britain and Turkey.
British security forces estimate that around 600 British Muslims have travelled to Syria so far, of which about 50 are young women and girls.
Many have joined militants from IS and other groups.
Those who return home pose a terrorist threat to Britain.
Dream work for a hundred thousand dollars.
A well-paid job you don't even need college for.
That's what an I.T. job looks like at first glance.
And often the other one.
The advantage is not only an extremely high salary by Czech standards (in Prague you earn up to CZK 180,000 by working in IT), but also extreme benefits.
This is due to the huge shortage of IT specialists.
Thousands of specialists are missing.
It is estimated that almost 20,000 IT specialists are missing in the Czech Republic.
Programmers, developers, network engineers and application specialists are among the most wanted, according to statistics from grafton personnel agency.
Candidates can choose between several job offers.
So it is not candidates who compete for jobs, but jobs compete for candidates, comments Jitka Součková, marketing manager at Grafton Recruitment.
College is not a necessity.
Higher education is not a necessity for I.T. students.
Higher education is a good foundation and is an overall indicator of a candidate's intelligence and education, but it often has little to do with developmental knowledge.
Developers have to constantly learn new things, which one day the graduated university will not replace, says Petr Kubačka, Director of Monster Career CZ.
The most money is made in Prague.
I.T. wages everywhere are well above the Republican average.
Most of the money will come in Prague and Brno, in the regions it is not such a chart anymore.
"The wage conditions in Brno are comparable to prague's," kubačka confirms.
Technical directors reach the highest earnings.
In Prague and Brno they can come for 120,000 - 180,000 CZK.
In other regions, the salary is lower, but even there it will not fall below CZK 80,000.
IT project managers are also in the public inquiry.
On boarding, they can earn 60,000 - 100,000 CZK.
There's a fight for the alumni.
While in some professions graduates often have to go straight to the labour office, this is not the case with I.T. students.
If companies can poach and overpay an expert from another company, they like to reach for a graduate.
They can bring him up their way.
They can't do without a tongue.
Knowledge of a foreign language is useful in every profession, but at least decent English is necessary for I.T. professionals.
Knowledge of at least one foreign language is a must for some IT positions.
On the other hand, we see a number of cases where companies are looking for a particularly professionally educated and experienced person and will settle only with an average knowledge of English.
For example, if a support worker speaks more foreign language, he or she is interesting for his employer because he can serve more customers from different countries, adds Director Kubačka.
Yes, in Google, there's paradise.
Czech workers can only quietly envy employees at Google.
Of course there is flexible working hours, the possibility of working from home or various part-time jobs, not only for mothers.
"The company provides new dads with an extra four weeks of vacation after the birth of their baby," says Martina Joneková, a Google spokesperson.
Pampering also includes health care for employees and family, catering, transport, training, wellness or massages directly at the workplace.
If you want to learn, you have the green light, no matter what new person wants to learn.
But the benefits don't stop there.
Such a full fridge for free is definitely not to be throw away.
A healthy lunch (breakfast and dinner in some locations) is available on site daily.
In addition, there are so-called micro-incubates in all offices, where people always find a healthy snack, says the spokesperson.
And so that nothing has to be thrown away, what is not to be eated, it puts in boxes that employees can take home in the evening.
And the reason for these incredible advantages for Czech conditions?
Create a creative and motivating environment!
"It is not important for Google that employees sit in the office for eight hours a day, but the results of initiatives or projects, shifts or developments, ideas and innovative solutions," the spokesperson adds.
The UN has sharply criticised Bulgaria for criminalising refugees.
Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein, the UN Commissioner for Human Rights, accused Bulgaria on Thursday of systematically violating human rights by criminalising refugees.
The Bulgarian government's official strategy "raises serious concerns that Bulgaria is not complying with international law," Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein warned in a statement.
He pointed out that "it is particularly disturbing to see how important and influential public figures are expressing public support for criminal armed struggles that are brazingly hunting refugees on the Bulgarian-Turkish border."
"One of the most serious problems is that almost all people who cross into Bulgarian territory in irregular ways are automatically made arrests," Zeid stressed.
Worse still - they are often prosecuted and imprisoned - for a year or more - if they try to leave the country.
Their attempts to leave the country are criminalised despite the fact that everyone has the right under international law to leave any country, including their own.
Bulgaria has detained 14 000 migrants this year, and 21 000 over the same period last year.
Pokémon Go - a pursuit of health and happiness that pays off
It's fascinating to see how the world is changing.
Many people have lamented over the past decade that teenagers and children no longer play outside and prefer to spend their free time over screens.
Pokémon Go lifts people off the sofas and leads them to activity.
The time spent in front of the screens was originally shruved on television, later on video games and most recently on smartphones.
It's great to see that technology and outdoor activities aren't excluded.
I am, of course, talking about the fashion that is Pokémon Go, a character-based app that first appeared in video games in the late 1990s (later, a cartoon series, playing cards and more) was created.
As with many cultural phenomena, there was a drop in interest before the launch of this new game in early July in the US, Australia and New Zealand.
Launches in other countries were postponed due to massive interest, which led to server overload.
Pokémon Go has gained more users than Tinder in a matter of days and almost as many users as Twitter has.
How does it work?
In short, players on a smartphone go out looking for Pokémon that they track using GPS, and when they find them, they can "take a picture" (via screenshot on the phone) or "catch" them.
Mania has engulfed the generation that played the game at a younger age, lifting it out of its seats and ingesting it in search of Pokemon.
In the US, thanks to this game, there has been a significant increase in the number of steps that the "average" person takes every day.
Apple's Cardiogram smartwatch app, which tracks 35,000 users, recently told the Washington Post that within two days of the game's launch, the number of people watching for 30 minutes each day jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent.
The company doesn't have information about who's playing Pokémon Go - they only see raw data on exercise levels.
Many public campaigns to "find 30," "get off the couch" and "be active every day" have fallen on barren ground, as most public health messages are boring and addressed to people who don't look good.
Nevertheless, the importance of exercise must not be underestimated.
Those who exercise regularly reduce the risk of cancer or depression.
Physical activity is involved in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that we cannot list in its entirete role here.
But the beauty of Pokémon Go is that people go out and do something they enjoy.
You cover three pillars of health - movement, fresh air and sun rays. And fun.
Some people even make new friends in the hunt for Pokemon.
As is often the case, there are, of course, some boring patrons who are looking for any excuse to complain.
And yes, someone can walk in the door.
What, like?
There's been a breakthrough.
In their day, smartphone apps like Fitbit were able to track our activity, but they didn't give us a reason to do something like this game.
The novelty is looking and interest in it will begin to decline at some point.
However, thanks to the success of Pokémon, more games will appear that will combine applications and virtual reality with real-world activity and help many people in the pursuit of activity, health and better form.

Simone Biles wins gold in women's gymnastics
Forget the pressure.
Forget the excitement.
Simone Biles is immune to all this.
Dynamic on the jump.
Effortlessly on the beam.
They were all speechless when they were simple.
Excellent at everything.
And now, finally, the Olympic champion.
The 19-year-old U.S. gymnast went straight for the multi-fight title on Thursday, surpassing the others at full strength under the Olympic spotlight.
The overall result of 62,198 clearly confirmed her lead over silver medalist and "final five" team member Aly Raisman and Russian bronze medalist Aliya Mustafinova.
Simone Biles (USA) during a performance on the beam at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on Thursday during the final of the individual gymnastics multi-fight event.
Biles became the fourth American woman in a row to win a multi-fight title, and fifth overall, confirming her reputation as the best gymnast of her generation and perhaps the best ever.
Tears appeared on her face as her overall final scoreboard came to an end, and her long journey to this point ended.
This success puts her in the same league of unique athletes of her time, such as Michael Phelps, who have added a new dimension to their sport:
Biles has dominated her sport for the past three years, winning 15 world championship medals - including 10 golds. Her stunning routines are a mixture of ambition and precision, and 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton called her "the best gymnast she's ever seen."
Her final test was in Brazil, not so much between Biles and the rest of the racers, but between herself and the burden of too much expectation.
Anything other than returning home to his family in Spring, Texas with his hand full of gold medals would be seen as a disappointment.
Simone Biles (USA), left, and Aly Raisman embrace after winning a gold and silver medal in the women's singles final at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on Thursday.
The first Biles received Tuesday, when she was an exclamation point in celebration of outgoing national team coordinator Martha Karolyi.
Biles insists that she never looked forward during her long journey to the top, which is not entirely true.
Part of her line-up in the simple - the one that features a typical triple double-turn flip for her - is set in Latin music that would just fit home, on the streets outside the Rio Olympic Arena.
It's not a coincidence.
The girl was adopted by her grandparents as a toddler, and her talent was discovered by coach Aimee Boorman's mother on her way to the gym, where Boorman trained and gained strength.
She hasn't lost a multi-fight competition since the summer of 2013 - a sequence of victories that can go on for as long as Biles wants.
Even though Mustafin took the lead briefly with two turns, it was just an illusion.
The beam and the simple - where Biles defends the World Cup - are waiting.
She took the lead with 15,433 points per beam - and finished with 15,933 points in the simple.
Raisman hugged her gently as they waited for the final score - a mere formality - and there were tears around the glittering red, white and blue shadows as biles fulfilled a wish she had once written in her diary as a child.
Raisman's performance was a bit of a payback for the Olympics four years ago, when she shared third place with Mustafin, but then she won bronze for the sum of the top three line-ups.
This time, the 22-year-old captain of the team the Americans call "Grandma" was way ahead.
After her simple, she sent air kisses to the crowd, overcome by a comeback that at times seemed uncertain.
For Biles, the post the 19-year-old athlete posted on Twitter this week, where it became a total hit, has a whole new meaning:
Police: Three victims in serial killer case shot while listening to music in car
Two women and a girl, aged 12, died in the most serious attack in decades in the case of phoenix's first serial killer, according to a police report released Thursday. They were shot while sitting in the car, talking and listening to music.
Authorities said Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis' daughter Maleah were shot june 12 in a car parked in the driveway.
The report states that the armed man was standing on the passenger side and fired eight rounds from a handgun. He then fled in another vehicle.
According to police, robbery wasn't behind the triple homicide because the assailant didn't take the wallets or the $2,900 that one of the adult victims was carrying.
Phoenix police spokesman Sgt. Jonathan Howard said investigators are looking into whether the shooting was related to any of the previous four attacks.
In two predominantly Hispanic neighborhoods, there were a total of nine attacks in four months, killing seven people and injured two others.
"It's happening in a residential neighborhood in front of houses," Howard told CBS affiliate KPHO earlier this month.
Police believe the suspect was using several cars, including a brown Nissan from the late 1990s, a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
Investigators refused to divulge what evidence led them to conclude that the attacks were related and were carried out by the same killer.
Ellis (33) was taken to a hospital, where she later succumbed to her injuries.
Lier (31) and Ellis' daughter Maleah died at the scene.
A witness told police it was not uncommon for women to sit in a parked car and listen to music.
Authorities also released a police report of a shooting that targeted an empty van just half an hour before the triple homicide. Police believe the serial killer was the source.
Investigators found shell casings and recovered a bullet from bullet residue in the seat and under the hood of the engine.
Mother of 6-year-old with microcephaly: 'His condition is improving'
Edmund Picciuto, like most children his age, loves singing, toys and, of course, his mother.
But unlike his peers, he suffers from microcephaly, which is the result of a genetic disorder that his mother, Elizabeth Picciuto, was unaware of during pregnancy.
When he first came home, the first thing I thought I couldn't do was this.
I can't do this.
I'm not ready for this.
Which is not true at all - of course you're ready for it," she said.
She and her husband Vincent learned that Edmund might never know them and that he might not survive.
Some doctors even suggested that he be placed in an institution.
"My first reaction was to think that people don't do that anymore," Picciuto explains.
Edmund walks with the help of a walker.
He couldn't sit or crawl until he was three years old. And he's still not talking.
However, some milestones are already slowly filling up.
He walks with help and rides a bike.
He also loves to play with his two brothers and loves to sing.
Elizabeth gives a sign language that Edmund uses to say, "please sing to me."
"We teach him sign language," Picciuto told CBS News.
But it's not common sign language - he says Edmund invented some of the characters himself.
Microcephaly can arise from a number of different conditions: genetic, as is the case with Edmund, and after infections during pregnancy caused by viruses such as measles or Zika.
Symptoms and prognosis may vary materially.
It is too early to say what impact the Zika virus will have on the lives of those infected.
Picciuto recalls the emotional toll that an uncertain future takes.
I keep asking, "What's next?"
What's next?
And she's still not sure.
In fact, I never asked what the overall prognosis was, because I don't expect anyone to ever be able to tell me.
But Picciuto has encouraging news for mothers of all children who suffer from birth defects caused by the Zika virus.
The situation is improving.
Know that it will be better.
You will love your child, and your child will love you.
Heavy rains and flooding have required rescue efforts in Louisiana, Mississippi
Heavy rain and widespread flooding in Louisiana prompted the governor to declare a state of emergency on Friday. More rain is expected in the state on Saturday.
The National Weather Service (NWS) has reported that after extreme downpors, a number of rivers in southeast Louisiana and southern Mississippi are flooding and widespread flooding.
Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards said state officials are in constant contact with local authorities and assistance is already on its way to the affected areas.
Mike Steele, a spokesman for the governor's office of national security and emergency preparedness, said they receive requests for vehicles for water, boats and sandbags.
Steele said tangipahoa district only asked for 10,000 sandbags.
Flood watches will remain in place in much of southern Louisiana until Saturday.
The weather service said in a statement that another 8 to 13 centimerts could fall over the sea.
In southern Alabama, a flood watch was on alert Friday as rains continued in the Mobile area.
The Comite Rivers near Baton Rouge and Amite near Denham Springs are forecast to culminate this weekend.
Meteorologist Alek Krautmann said both said they could flood a number of homes in suburban areas of Baton Rouge.
He went on to say that the danger is flooding downstream in the Ascension district, where these flooded streams will only slowly flow into Lake Maurepas.
The Tickfaw River, slightly south of the Mississippi border in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached its highest recorded level at 9 a.m. local time Friday.
Rescuers are still picking up people from torrential waters in Amite and Wilkinson counties in southwest Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and stepson were among those arrested at Gloster earlier on Friday.
Hansford (62) said the water from Beaver Creek, which is normally more than 120 meters from his house, rose rapidly overnight.
He said he was alerted by his other stepson, who lives nearby.
"We woke up and the water was coming," Hansford said.
I had it up to my waist.
According to his wife, it's the highest level she's ever seen on a river in 48 years.
Hansford said he and all members of his family are disabled, and he's the only one who can swim.
Hansford said emergency workers rescued all three huge military-style trucks and transported them to the Gloster fire station, where they remained covered on Friday.
Krautmann said that as heavy rains continue, flooding is "spreading rapidly" and authorities are considering evacuation.
According to Krautmann, an observer near Livinston reported that 35 centimeters of rain fell from midnight to Friday morning.
Krautmann said the soil has been heavily soathed since Wednesday.
Authorities said heavy rain and paid roads required residents to be rescued from their homes in Tangipahoa County and classes canceled in five school districts.
CBS affiliate WWL reported that 200 homes were flooded, according to an old man from Tangipahoa.
Residents have been evacuated to two churches, both of which are now flooded.
The village's mayor, Robby Miller, said authorities had rescued 72 people and seven pets trapped by the high water.
Shelters have been set up in Amite and Hammond for those evacuated.
"They'll be able to come home when the water starts to read," he said.
In the Tangipahoa district of Hammond, more than 20 streets were closed due to the flood, and locals were given sandbags to pick up and try to protect their homes and businesses from the water.
"We had the last major flooding here in March," said city manager Lacy Landrum.
Looks like these floods are going to be similar.
Rupert Lacy, emergency manager in Harrison County, Mississippi, said persistent rain continues on the Gulf Coast.
He said a few homes were flooded on Thursday, but none of them were reported friday.
Keith Townson, head of Shopper Value Foods in Amite, has lived in the area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in a few places I've never seen it before," Townson said, "and it's still there."
Mahaj Brown (6) - "boy shot to the hearsay," survived philadelphia shooting
According to police, a six-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia. This is the second shooting of a child aged 6 in the city this week.
The child's grandparents identified him to CBS Philadelphia as Mahai Brown.
Grandparents say the boy suffered multiple gunshot wounds, including groin, leg, arm and abdomen, but was conscious when transported to the hospital.
"He took a lot of hit, his little body was shot through like a fire," his grandmother, Delores Melendez, told the station.
I can't believe it.
The boy is in critical condition in hospital and has undergone several operations.
The family told the station that the boy should recover.
He was going to start first grade elementary school.
Mahaj Brown is among four people who were shot in the Germantown area.
Three other men were shot: two aged 29 and one aged 32.
One of the men, aged 29, is in critical condition, with two other victims in stable condition, according to CBS Philadelphia.
According to the station report, the child was found shot in the front seat of the vehicle along with a 29-year-old man in critical condition.
Two other victims were not in the vehicle, and police are investigating whether any of the injured men may have been the shooter.
Investigators told CBS Philadelphia that there may have been a shootout between several armed men.
Casings of offensive-type weapons belonging to various assault weapons were found at the scene.
Apparently, it was definitely an ongoing battle.
There were shell casings on either side of the sidewalk on the street.
So it appears that there were several armed combat persons who were actively involved," Philadelphia Police Capt. Anthony Ginaldi told the station.
Several houses and vehicles in the area were also affected.
No one has been apprehended and police are reportedly examining cctv footage.
Another 6-year-old child, this time a girl, was shot in the arm by a stray bullet Tuesday outside a house in the West Oak Lane neighborhood.
The girl is recovering and police are still looking for a suspect.
Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
This is how I picture the women's gymnastics team for this year's Olympics for several reasons.
First of all, I've been to every summer Olympics since 1984, and the U.S. has never been so dominant.
And two, there are three gymnasts on this team, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas, and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who have inspired so many young girls of color.
Everyone is proud of the composition of this team, complemented by Aly Raisman, who is of Jewish descent, and The Catholic Madison Kocian.
We finally have a team that looks like America.
He also cemented the presence of black and Latina women at the top of the sport.
Gymnast number one for the past four years has been African-American.
Simone and Gabby were first and second last year.
That means something.
At the last Olympics, Gabby Dougals surprisingly became olympic champion, and America was in the tinge.
Now the world could witness the incredible performance of three-time world champions Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, who showed unexpected but masterful gymnastics figures.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth American woman to win gold in the women's individual multi-fight.
And team member Aly Raisman won silver.
We're witnessing a sporting climax, but it doesn't look like it in the country's gymnastics class.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie made the same journey to the Olympic team as Aly and Madison.
They are the "final five" because the gymnastics team for the next Olympics will consist of only four athletes, and this is the last year Marta Karolyi has been training.
But the reality is that gymnastics is a financially demanding sport, and gymnasts train mainly in private gymnastics clubs, which are maintained by parents who pay the costs of training, equipment, travel, jerseys, competition fees, hotel accommodation (for coaches and their wards and families). And that's far from it.
Most of these sports clubs are in affluent areas in the suburbs that can support activities.
In these clubs, gymnasts have all the training, and for families of gymnasts and gymnasts it is a costly and long-term commitment.
Aimee Boorman, Simone Biles' coach, and Maggie Haney, Laurie Hernandez's coach, both coached athletes when they started gymnastics.
It is our duty to bring gymnastics trainings that are more accessible and accessible to the communities of countless young girls that Simone, Gabby and Laurie have inspired.
I started the Gymnastics Foundation 20 years ago.
In my organizations, where we offer free or low-cost gymnastics in Harlem to more than 15,000 young people within the city (primarily of black and Hispanic descent) and have trained national and international champions.
In September, we will expand into Detroit (my hometown), where we will provide quality gymnastics to young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and body coordination, and hard work, discipline and determination of the mind.
This combination means lifetime benefits for good health, achievements at school and work.
It is the inspiration of this team that will send thousands of young girls who want to do gymnastics. And that's great.
Participation in this sport is very important, especially for girls.
It's a very exciting time.
Thank you, Simon, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison, for showing "girl power" and winning Olympic team gold. And thank you for motivating so many young girls of all backgrounds to embark on a journey to become healthy, strong and successful young women.
After Jeremy Hunt's proposal is rejected, junior doctors are ready to join further strikes
Ministers had hoped that disagreements over the changes would be ended after the revised contract was concluded with representatives of the British Medical Association (BMA). But 58 percent of the 37,000 junior doctors who took part in the election rejected the contract.
Hunt unveiled plans to force the contract in July, saying the NHS was in a "no man's land" and further delays would have a detrimental impact on staff and patients.
The first junior doctors have already signed a new contract, which includes changes to night and weekend working practices to improve care in non-social hours.
In a statement last night, Dr Ellen McCourt, chair of the BMA's junior doctors committee, said: "Junior doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, particularly in the sense that there will be an increase in the current labour crisis and therefore fair treatment of all doctors."
Just eight weeks before the first group of doctors goes under a new contract, progress must be made and time is running out.
The BMA's efforts to resolve disputes through negotiations have been met with reluctance to involve dr and often deafening quiet on the part of the government.
This is despite Jeremy Hunt's promise last month that this possibility is still open.
"Jeremy Hunt must now act, push for enforcement and address the concerns of junior doctors."
If this does not happen, then young doctors are ready to take further steps.
During the last strike at the end of April, nearly 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 visits were postponed as nurses and specialists were called in to take the place of doctors who were among the protesters.
Ministers had hoped that disagreements over the changes would be concluded after the revised contract was concluded with representatives of the British Medical Association (BMA).
The BMA wants higher weekend pay for the 54,000 junior doctors who would be contracted.
Daniel Mortimer, chairman of NHS employers, urged junior doctors not to go on strike.
Mortimer said: "Little or nothing will be achieved by the industry, but there will be pressure on already overburdened teams and services and there will be increased concern, exhaustion and disruption for patients, nursing staff and their families."
Over the past two months, we have been in negotiations with the Board of Junior Doctors and, together with the Ministry of Health and others, have responded positively to their concerns about the role of supervision and whistleblower.
Employers hoped that continued positive involvement on other important issues - such as workload, flexibility in training, additional training for those returning after career breaks, training costs, mutual recognition of subjects, sabbaticals and the gender pay gap - was proof of how seriously employers, Health Education England and the Department of Health are taking the agreements reached with the BMA in November , February and May.
Sixty crowns a day can reduce the risk of a heart attack
Thousands of patients at risk of heart attack will be able to take the drug, which costs around 60 kroner (£2). Authorities recommend administering it to more patients for a longer period of time.
The anti-clotting drug Ticagrelor reduces the risk of seizures occuring again in people with heart disease.
The drug is now administered after a heart attack for 12 months to reduce the risk of stroke or other seizure.
NHS watchdog NICE recommends that the drug be given to people for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
But now NHS watchdog NICE recommends that it be given to people for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
In England, around 140,000 people suffer a heart attack every year, and a quarter of them suffer another heart attack or heart attack.
Heart attack and stroke are caused by the accumulation of fat, which forms a continuous layer on the walls of the arteries.
If this layer is torn off, a blood clot may occur, blood access to the heart may be blocked and a heart attack may occur.
If the clot is released, it can continue through the bloodstream, blocking the blood supply to the brain and causing a stroke.
People who have already had a heart attack are at a higher risk of another seizure.
Ticagrelor, produced by british firm AstraZeneca and sold under the trade name Brilique, reduces the risk of clots being less likely to occur.
The draft NICE directive, published today, recommends that patients receive 90 mg of ticagrelor for 12 months and then 60 mg along with aspirin, twice daily for the next three years.
Professor Carole Longson, director of nice's centre for technology assessment, said: "Despite the availability of effective secondary preventive treatment, there are a quarter of patients who have had a heart attack and who will suffer another heart attack or stroke - often with devastating consequences."
Fear of repetition can have a significant negative impact on the quality of life of the patient.
Ticagrelor in combination with aspirin has been shown to be effective in reducing the risk of further heart attacks and strokes in people who have already suffered a heart attack.
We are pleased that, with the preliminary recommendation of Ticagrelor, we can expand the treatment options available to many thousands of people who will be able to benefit from it.
Since information on the efficacy and safety of Ticagrelor - especially the risk of bleeding - beyond three years is limited, treatment beyond this time is not recommended in the proposal.
With computer culture, fraud began to flourish in Muslim areas
Tower Hamlets Mayor Lutfur Rahman was removed from office last year for corruption, a government report has revealed
A culture of political correctness has led to the disregard for spreading fraud in Muslim communities, a government report said today.
Ex-minister Sir Eric Pickles has sharply criticised police, election inspectors and town halls for ignoring voter abuse because of "hypersensitivity to ethnicity and religion."
The former community secretary, now the ruler of anti-corruption crackdowns, said that intimidation of voters based on their religion is so bad that the police should make cordons outside polling stations and protect out-of-control voters.
He recommended that voters take their ID with them so they can prove who they are during the election.
Nowadays, voters just need to state their name and address.
The report also proposes to put indelible ink on people's fingers when casting their vote to prevent anyone from voting twice.
Whistleblowers should have more protection, pickles says.
It calls for greater access to meeting documents and decisions taken by unofficial committees or working groups.
"This is not only about protecting against electoral fraud, but also about protecting the local government from the wider corruption and financial fraud that goes hand in hand with it," he said.
The report was requested by Downing Street as a result of the tower hamlets election scandal in west London.
Last year, a special electoral court ruled that the city's acting mayor, Lutfur Rahman, should be removed from his post after being accused of corruption and illegal practices.
The court found that Rahman had "cynically intervened" in the religious feeling of his Muslim community and silenced his critics with accusations of racism and Islamophobia.
Rahman, he said, "campaigned in such a way that it was the religious duty of devoted Muslims to vote for him."
Up to 300 votes have been cast in question or as a result of identity theft, where a person votes and impersonates someone else.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud across the country.
He expressed particular concern about the fraud in the mailing vote - which is said to have put pressure on people to vote for the candidate they voted for during the vote.
Sir Eric, pictured, made several recommendations on how to clean up the electoral system, including presenting an IDENTITY card
Its report states: "Evidence has been presented that vulnerable members of certain ethnic minorities, particularly women and young people, have been pressured to vote at the will of the elders, particularly in communities originating in Pakistan and Bangladesh."
"There are fears that... state institutions turned a blind eye to such behavior because of their "politically correct" hypersensitivity to ethnic origin and religion."
Sir Eric made 50 recommendations on how to clean up the system, including prohibiting political activists from manipulating correspondent votes to prevent "vote-rigging."
The report, now being assessed by Theresa May, also calls for more thorough checks on registrations to prevent the use of electoral lists for immigration and benefit fraud.
Consider asking voters to present proof of identity before voting.
Use indelible ink on people's fingers when voting to prevent someone from voting twice.
Carrying out systematic checks on the nationality of persons to ensure that they can vote.
Limit requests for automatic correspondence voting to a period of three years.
Prohibit political agitators and activists from manipulating submitted mailing votes and election envelopes.
Give the police permission to create cordons around polling stations.
Change the laws to make it easier to prosecute people exerting illegal coercion under the 1983 Reform Act.
Prohibit taking photos at polling stations.
Require only English people (with the exception of Wales) to work at polling stations.
Strengthen training to ensure that workers follow the rule that voters go to the polling booths individually.
Sir Eric criticises london police and says it is "surprising" that no criminal charges have been brought following the Tower Hamlets case.
"The Elections Court has expelled Lutfur Rahman and his agent for a litany of corruption and illegal practices," he said.
For a number of reasons, he was found guilty beyond reasonable doubt - in the strength of the evidence of the crime.
He also criticizes the fruitless "check boxes checks" in the voter registration departments at City Hall.
Sir Eric said: "Last year's court decision in the Tower Hamlets case was a wake-up call.
Our nation has a proud legacy of parliamentary democracy, but the disturbing and hidden spread of electoral fraud and the state of rejecting it by some institutions threatens this reputation.
Infatuation with Duchess Kate's cycling double and other celebrity look-ins at the Rio Olympics
Fans of the Rio 2016 Olympics went crazy this week for French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, who looks strikingly like the Duchess of Cambridge.
But the 24-year-old Olympian is far from the only athlete seeking gold this year, boasting her own celebrity doppelganger - at least not according to social media.
To celebrate the Rio Olympics and all the celebrities currently appearing on our screens, FEMAIL's Women's Column has compiled a list of Olympians who are more than remotely similar to Hollywood celebrities.
Like a hunted game: American archery team member Brady Ellison (left) has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since he was a child
In addition to kate's doppelganger on the bike track, a number of people online were quick to point out that a certain archer could be the twin of star Leonardo DiCaprio.
American archer Brady Ellison caused a storm on Twitter after images surfaced of him strikingly resembling a Wolf of Wall Street.
Brady himself noticed the media frenzy and admitted that he had heard about his resemblance to Leo since he was a child.
"He doesn't see much resemblance himself, except perhaps his beard," Brady told the Huffington Post.
"He's cool and he looks good, so I think it's a compliment."
One of the most popular comparisons from London 2012 will undoubtedly be highlighted even more this year: the striking resemblance between British long jumper Greg Rutherford and popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
Russian gymnast Aliya Mustafin, with her big, expressive eyes, was said to be a copy of Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And looking at the swimming pool, South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared to Gell star Matthew Morrison for several years.
And for a change: The user thinks nathan with the 'athletic version' of the actor from the film Inception
Another long-standing comparison is the comparison of tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, who have similarly thick eyebrows and lips.
Russian silver swimmer Yulia Efimova not only boasts the same dark skin and blond hair as Annalynne McCord. And about Team USA's Nathan Adrian, fans say he looks like "an athletic version of Joseph Gordon Levitt."
Profusive women: football star Hope Syl (left) and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter (right) have similar facial and eye shape
Not just one: Twitter user was very pleased that others noticed the similarities
On the waves of theory: According to this user, there may be a reason behind the similar appearance of couples
A Twitter user recently expressed her satisfaction on the site that "the rest of the Internet thinks Hope Sal and Jennifer Carpenter are in fact identical."
Football star Hope Sal and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter have incredibly similar face and eye shapes.
Other popular comparisons include Kerri Walsh-Jennings and her smile, which is almost identical to that of actress Laura Linney, or gymnastics gold medalist Gabby Douglas, who boasts her beautifully broad smile that seems to follow the smile of Gabrielle Union, star of Bravo, Girls!
CBC Olympic commentator apologizes for saying Chinese swimmer 'exploded'
Viewers of Wednesday's live broadcast of the Olympic Games on CBC were outraged by commentator Byron MacDonald's analysis of 14-year-old Ai Yanhan's performance. The swimmer finished fourth in the women's 4x200m freestyle relay
Canadian station CBC was forced to apologize after one of its commentators said that a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer "dragged like a smell" and "exploded" during the race.
Commentator Byron MacDonald thought his microphone was off when he began to spew his own opinions at the end of the women's 4x200m freestyle relay final.
MacDonald, who was supposed to bring a "revival" to the CBC commentators' team, said, among other things, "That little 14-year-old from China gave up, you foolish."
Too much excitement, stretching like a smell, exploded.
thanks to.
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan (14) swam the second relay of the race in 1:57.79 - 1.61 seconds slower than Canada's Taylor Ruck, allowing the Canadians to finish China.
Viewers in Canada quickly started to get in touch online and were horrified by the tone and language the commentator used
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted: "The cbc announcer said that a 14-year-old swimmer from China "exploded" ????."
That idiot didn't notice he was still on the air."
Ai Yanhan of China in the final of the women's 4x200 meters freestyle relay was described as: "That little 14-year-old from China gave up, you foolish one."
Byron MacDonald's criticism on Twitter came from all sides, with many demanding his removal
When Twitter users learned how insensitive Byron MacDonald was, they didn't hold back
Another user, Sarah Paradis, wrote: 'Wow #ByronMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada, and it sounds like we're a bunch of #znechucení.
Soon after, Scott Russel, who hosted the CBC broadcast, apologized for MacDonald's live commentary, saying, "We apologize for the comment on the swimmer's performance that was leaked to the broadcast."
It was an unfortunate choice of words, we're sorry it happened."
CBC eventually apologized more than 90 times to people who tweeted in response to the comment
Co-commentator Scott Russel had to apologize on behalf of MacDonald
Cbc then copied and posted their apology in response to more than 90 Twitter users complaining about MacDonald's comments
The network also quickly apologized and released a statement.
She sincerely regrets that the words were said, she should not have been on the air.
We quickly apologized to our viewers on the air and to those who follow us on social media.
To be clear, Byron's comments were about the swimmer's performance, not the swimmer herself.
In other words, it was an inappropriate and unfortunate choice of words. Byron is deeply sorry for what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, Byron MacDonald apologized on live television and tried to explain his remark by saying he didn't want it to sound like a personal attack.
"I would now like to apologize for the comment I made last night after the women's relay," he said on CBC's Olympic broadcast.
"I was referring to the performance of the swimmer and not the swimmer as such."
"Needless to say, I had no intention of disrespecting me, and I'm very sorry."
Primark customers outraged by woman who shamelessly tried on underwear in the middle of a store
When the woman undressed to try on panties on the sales floor in the middle of Primark, shoppers weren't sure which way to look.
To make things worse, she tried to fit her size, undressed her panties and put them back on the shelf.
She continued to browse and eventually tried on four pairs of panties at the store at Bouverie Place shopping centre in Flokestone.
Primark store in Bouverie Place shopping centre in Folkestone where a woman tried on panties before returning them to the shelf
Mother-of-two Jenny Davidson, who was at the store at the time, said the mystery woman "got dressed again after trying on her underwear and walked out of the store without buying anything."
She said, "People couldn't believe their eyes."
She stood in the middle of the store, took her panties off the shelf, took off her own pantyhose and panties, and put them on.
"She wasn't even trying to find a discreet place - she was just standing there, sassy as a monkey."
"Everyone was just staring at her panties being undressed again, and she obviously didn't like them because she put them back on the shelf."
She did the same thing with three others before finally decided she didn't like anything, got dressed again and left.
"She didn't seem to mind who was watching - or thinking of the person who might buy the panties she was trying on."
Miss Davidson (33), who lives in Kent, said: "The idea of someone taking home panties that someone else was wearing and no one cleaned. That's disgusting."
The incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon.
Miss Davidson added: "When she left, I collected things that she was obviously trying to get me to take off the market - which is also the only right thing to do."
"I'd be terrified of the idea of bring home new panties and find out that another woman was wearing them, undressed them, and they weren't washed."
A Primark spokesman said: "Primark is known about an incident that occurred at our shop in Folkestone on Tuesday, August 9."
All products concerned were withdrawn from sale.
How to defend yourself against a gun attack with Krav Maga
The world outside is dangerous, but thanks to this Dailymail.com could make it a little safer for you.
We spoke to Rhon Mizrachi, grand master of the New York-based Krav Maga Federation, to find out how to deal with armed robbers at close range.
This video will show you how to suddenly gain the upper hand over a rapist, whether he's coming up to you from the front or from behind.
If he approaches you from behind, mizrachi says, then the first thing you have to do is turn around to see your attacker and "have a free shot path."
You then grab the gun between your forearm and shoulder just before you hit it in the face with a loose elbow.
Then the knee to the groin follows, and while the attacker is squirming in pain, you twist the gun out of his hand, hit him in the face and start retreating, holding the gun pointed at him.
If an armed man from the front approaches you, it is a similar technique - get your body out of the line of fire, grab the gun and wring it so that the rascal can not shoot.
At the same time, put force into the weapon and hit the attacker in the chest, then wriggle the gun out of its grip and start retreating, still pointing it at him.
Does that sound complicated?
Watch the video to see exactly how Mizrachi does it.
But remember that the safest way to get out of a mugging - unless you're grandmaster of Krav Maga - is to hand over all the cash.
Traveler Ian Wright licks europe's dirtiest places into travel guide
A British traveller has decided to put his immune system and gag reflex to the test - licking the dirtiest and most dyed places in Europe.
Presenter and travel writer Ian Wright (51), originally from Suffolk, licked a euro banknote, a railing at Piccadilly Circus, a toilet flush button on a train and a Russian public phone in a testament to the strength of his immune system.
Before licking every object, he used a luminometer to show himself and all of us what he was getting into.
However, the experiment on the basis of which Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength was made yielded interesting results.
The idea of licking the flush button on a train used by thousands of other people may seem utterly repulsive, but there are actually many more harmful bacteria in the kitchen sink.
Throughout his tour of Europe, Ian Wright has spoken to doctors and health specialists about strengthening gut bacteria and his own health.
Fortunately, nothing he licked left anything worse in his mouth than a afterthesta.
Ian Wright is famous for testing the durability of his intestines on trips around the world and eating strange and wonderful things.
During this mission, he tested his immune system safely - from public railings at train stations to flushing
In the film he made about it, he says, "I haven't cared much about my health since I was a kid, and I put everything in my mouth, from dirt to eating worms and muddy water."
In the film, he certainly confirmed his reputation.
All he refused was dirty public toilets in Russia.
After a simple swadd, the luminometer showed a value of more than 4000 units.
By comparison, freshly washed hands should be less than 60.
But one public toilet in Russia refused to be licked after its luminometer showed more than 4,000 units, while freshly washed hands have less than 60
Ian Wright and Finnish dairy manufacturer Valio made the traveler's film The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, which shows the number of bacteria in different places, such as the bathroom
In the movie, he said, "This is almost the ugliest thing I've ever felt in the bathroom."
There's nothing dirtier than this!
I'm not licking anything because it's disgusting.
Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength was made in collaboration with Finnish dairy producer Valio.
The company provided Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains lactic acid bacteria and vitamins C and D, which help strengthen the gut bacteria and immune system in humans.
Niko Vuorenmaa, Valio's senior vice president of snacks, juices and new categories, said: "We wanted to offer consumers something really new.
Something that would follow with passion while allowing us to explain the benefits of probiotics.
We came up with a bunch of crazy ideas that ended up with the idea of "let's call Ian."
It is said that interest in bowel health is becoming a worldwide phenomenon.
Instead of just talking about products, we wanted to put them in a broader context - good and bad bacteria in our daily environment, the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system.
The growing interest in healthy intestines is a worldwide phenomenon and through this document we have brought consumers more detailed information in an interesting way.
I also think there's a great sense of humor in the movie!
Tom Hakala, who directed the film, adds: "Let's put it this way, Ian would lose my respect if he licked some of what I asked him to do - like that disgusting Russian toilet that appears in the movie."
Licking some things was naturally easier for Ian, others pretty hard.
I'm glad we filmed some of the dirty stuff."
Valio conducted a survey in 2015 that found that 84 percent of respondents associated lactic acid bacteria primarily with stomach and bowel health, and 58 percent said they at least occasionally use products containing added lactic acid bacteria.
A family of socially needy people damaged a council building in Saltash, Cornwall, before eviction
A socially needy family has left £50,000 worth of damage to their council home after being accused of terrorizing their neighbours.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were evicted from their home in Saltash, Cornwall, after a long series of complaints against them.
After their forced eviction from the house, housing association officials were shocked to find that the property was in a state of disrepair.
There were holes in the walls, the floor coverings were torn, garbage was lying all over the floor, and the walls were defamed.
The family has already moved out and is thought to be living in private accommodation
Donna McEvoy, director of housing at Cornwall Housing, said she was concerned about whether the house could be saved.
She said: "It's been a nightmare for the people here and I don't think people should live like this.
A number of circumstances need to be considered, as this property is likely to become known as a "not-so-nice part" of Cornwall.
The family is infamous, and their names are infamous.
The couple have three sons who sometimes stayed in the house, and police said the horror the family had caused included street fights using baseball bats, intimidation of nearby residents, drug use, drug distribution and loud shouting, arguing and swearing.
Skeldon (47), whose name was mentioned on the lease, was given a sentence for antisocial behaviour in June.
Smelly garbage was found in several rooms in the house, which may be demolished.
In the house where drugs were distributed in the past, the floor covering was torn out
Neighbors say they were seen fighting in the street, and people called the police regularly.
Cornwall Housing forcibly evicted her and her partner from their home this week after they were given an additional 11-week period to evict voluntarily.
Neighbors who were relieved welcomed the eviction, saying their lives were living hell.
One of them said, "They didn't care about anybody at all."
We lived next door to them for 20 years, and it's always been like this.
How many times we've seen the police here, you can't count.
"We couldn't sleep this morning."
We got up because it was incredibly quiet here - we're not used to that!
It's going to be nice when they're finally gone.
Adam Fitzpatrick, neighbourhood supervisor at Cornwall Housing, said the family had been unable to work with local authorities.
The family lived in the house for 20 years, the house was regularly called by the police
Garbage and old toys were lying around in an overgrown part of the council house
He adds: "It is a shame that the tenant has failed to take responsibility for her own behaviour and for the behaviour of her family. Eviction is always the last step cornwall housing is considering.
It was a very complex case because their behavior was extreme and their actions, according to the witness, must have scared her neighbors.
I appreciate all the work done by my team, devon and cornwall police and members of the local community who have bravely informed us.
I hope that this move will bring a little comfort to our neighbours and, at the same time, carry with it a message that we will not tolerate antisocial behaviour.
Fitzpatrick said all three of the tenants' sons who lived in the house at different times were in their 20s.

Workers will now have to remove piles of rubbish left around the house
In 2014, police raided the house and found more than 70 grams of cannabis, scales, equipment and £1,700 in cash.
Skeldon was fined when she was found guilty of possession of class B drugs she wanted to sell.
She claimed the money was intended for the foundations of a house for her son, Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
Tanya and her partner are now thought to be living in private accommodation in Plymouth after being evicted.
The walls in many rooms of the house were painted with graffiti.
Police say they will seek to evict tenants who violate the rules of their leases
Angela Crow, of Den and Cornwall Police, said the eviction was a clear message to other tenants who will continue to break the rules.
"This is a message to all those who think they can behave with impunity and to those who would like to follow this behavior," she said.
Den and Cornwall Police will never tolerate criminal and antisocial behaviour and will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal terrified after low-level military jet over beach
Tourists enjoying the sunshine in Aveir, Portugal, were terrified to death
Portuguese Air Force P-3C Orion flew incredibly low
The Air Force said it was a training flight and insisted there was no threat to safety
As the low-flying jet thrusted over the crowded beach, terrified tourists panicked.
Dramatic footage shows the military plane getting close to the sun on a sandy beach near the town of Aveiro in northern Portugal.
Tourists began to rise after being disturbed by the noise of the jet's engines without seeing what would emerge from the clouds.
The incident took place yesterday afternoon on costa nova near the town of Aveiro.
Daniel Fernandes, one of several holidaymakers who posted videos of the dramatic fly-by on social media, said: "The plane flew over twice really low and at one point it seemed to crash."
Nuno Arroja adds, "I was surfing, and I really thought the plane was going to fall on my head."
Tourists on the beach in Aveir were horrified when a plane flying low emerged from the darkness
The Portuguese Air Force said today that the pilot of the P-3C Orion was on a training flight to identify fishing boats off the coast and had to come down low because it was the only way to inspect the ship.
The aircraft reportedly flew slightly lower than normal due to poor visibility caused by smoke from nearby forest fires. However, the Air Force insists that people's safety has not been compromised.
Forest fires destroyed parts of mainland Portugal this summer, claiming four lives on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese Air Force said today that the pilot had to fly low due to thick fog and smoke from fires that prevented him from viewing
The aircraft was on a training flight and the pilot was asked to identify fishing boats as part of the training.
Half of funeral homes don't follow the rules.
Half of funeral directors do not comply with the law.
The Czech Trade Inspection Authority (CTEI) found this out during inspections in the second quarter.
According to her, funeral services most often do not inform the survivors of their prices or do not issue a written confirmation of receipt of the order.
The C.I.A. imposed 41 fines totalling CZK 73,000.
Today, its spokesman Jiří Fröhlich informed about this.
Inspectors found errors in 47 of the 95 inspections.
In addition to not informing about prices and missing confirmations, some funeral services also sold products or provided services at different prices than agreed.
In five cases, the products sold were not properly labelled and once the seller used an officially unverified gauge.
The inspection therefore prohibited the sale of 23 products for a total of CZK 7077.
This concerned urn wrappers, candle covers and vases which were not properly labelled with mandatory information.
"As there are still violations of the law in this specific area of services, the control action will continue in the next quarter of this year," Fröhlich added.
London schoolgirl who joined IS killed in Syria
It has been reported that Kadiza Sultana, one of three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join IS, has died in Syria.
Solicitor Tasnime Akunjee said the family learned of her death in Raqqa, Syria, a few weeks ago.
ITV News reported on Thursday that she was likely killed in a Russian airstrike in Raqqa, the group's stronghold in the country.
Sultana was 17 years old and, according to her family, died just as she was preparing to flee the war-torn country and return to Britain.
"One wants to believe that the only good thing about this whole thing - as a message and a warning to others that these are the real dangers associated with going to a war zone - is that it discourages people from ever making decisions," Akunjee said.
Sultana and two other schoolgirls from east London boarded a plane to Turkey in February 2015 and then a bus to the Syrian border.
Sultana's family learned that she had married an IS fighter in Syria - and was married within months.
Reid says that if Clinton is elected, she will keep Garland as a Supreme Court nominee.
Democratic Senate Leader Harry Reid says he believes Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton will nominate Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court if elected.
Senate Republicans blocked Garland's appointment, even though President Barack Obama nominated him back in March.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says the person who replaces the late Supreme Court justice will be chosen by the future president.
Reid said on a conference call Thursday that he believes Clinton will pick Garland "with a degree of credibility."
Reid's spokeswoman later said that he had not spoken directly to Clinton about whether she would nominate Garland, and that he was merely speculating.
He praised Garland and said that the Clinton team would not want to "swing the boat" by choosing someone else.
Garland is the chairman of the Federal Court of Appeals in Washington.
Reid said the Republicans blocking Garland's appointment are "minions" and "lackeys" of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He said Trump was not fit for office.
According to Treats magazine, nude calendars are for "both women and men"
Treats magazine works closely with photographer David Bellemer to publish the 2017 calendar, inspired by the Pirelli calendar from the 1970s.
But instead of revealing celebrities, they're trying to find the next generation of top models for their 2017 NU Muses calendar.
Treats President Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his magazine full of old-school playboy is different from Playboy because "Playboy is for men."
I do it for women.
Apparently, he thinks the calendar does, too.
"We need to go back to depicting timeless and classic photography, where both women and men feel comfortable and are inspired by photos of a woman's body," Shaw said in a press release for the calendar release.
Women want to be part of this project because it's a wonderful piece of art.
Models can send their pictures online or in person during open auditions in Los Angeles and New York.
Where does vinyl go: who really buys record records?
Vinyl is loved by lonely middle-aged men.
Before you decide to flood the comments section with peppery comments under the pseudonym Don't All The Man In The Age, we note that this statement is based on actual data.
According to YouGov, the much-discussed revival of record records is associated not with a boom in millennials who want to enjoy the originality of owning a physical object, but with middle-aged nostalgia.
Those who have recently bought an album on vinyl are most likely people between the ages of 45 and 54.
Young people aged 18-24 are the least likely.
It's not really about hoarding an enthusiastic fan - it's all emotional: older people who buy record players are more likely to want to keep their feelings (56% versus 53%) and they like to be alone (69% versus 66%).
But are YouGov's results true?
If this blog were broadcast as a TV story, I would be followed by a camera as I set off on a busy street in Soho, dressed in a subtle grey suit and gesticulated broadly. Then I'd stop, pull out my hands and say something authoritative, like, "Let's take a look at this."
Let's take a look at this.
While its charm and charm are slowly fading from the heart of Soho - buildings once occupied by independent vendors, now filled with hotels, restaurants and dining rooms, confects and office supplies - some fantastic specialist record stores are still left.
I'd probably ask the camera to stop filming for a while. I'm going to stand near different men in these stores and try to see what their age and emotional state are.
Stuart (55), a Glasgow native I follow from Sister Ray (numbers: two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (numbers: eight middle-aged men, one woman in her 20s) has an afternoon meeting in London and looks at shops to fill in a few hours of time.
I'm asking him if he's a collector.
"I think so," he says.
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 recordings.
All these recordings line the walls of his living room - in the picture above (he emailed me the photo, I didn't follow him all the way home).
He also has this huge number of albums and singles because he can afford it: he can now buy record records that he couldn't afford when they were originally released, and he's buying back what he sold when he was young and didn't have a dime.
"A lot of what I buy is from the late 1960s and early 1970s. These are things I would have published when I was 11 or 12. I was too young to get them back then," he says.
He agrees that those who buy recordings are probably introverts who like the company of themselves. He adds, "I don't smoke or drink much.
This is my sin.
Wez (25) works at Sister Ray and also thinks that many of the customers she meets fit the YouGov profile.
He also noticed a new influx of people affected by the media wave. People who had heard of the comeback and felt compelled to buy their old record back.
According to my interviews, people got rid of their collections most often between 1998 and 1999.
Customers who once sold their record and bought CDs are now selling their CDs to buy their record back," he says.
This could explain the boom in record lovers of a certain age.
But what about the alleged emotional importance of record records?
It won't take you more than a few seconds to find out in a store like Phonica that you'll find a pleasant community of people with similar feelings in music stores.
According to Wez, some older customers are particularly offended by the contactless payment system.
Some fans of record players may feel overwhelmed in the digital world and have opted for the familiar environment of record covers, things that evoke memories of peaceful adolescence.
"I think filling a gap or owning something tangible can bring a certain comfort," says Wez.
I'm a collector myself, that's the way it is for me, and I think with a lot of people, too.
It's an easy way to fill a spot in your head.
"We're all like their social workers!" says a co-worker from a pile of record players.
An ICM survey in April revealed that nearly 50% of people who had bought a vinyl album a month earlier had not yet listened to it.
According to the survey, 41% of those surveyed have a record player they never use, while 7% of those who buy record records do not.
At this point in the story, he probably seemed really concerned as he scrolled through the pile of bossa nova compilations.
The "trophy" aspect and the revival of interest is something jonny (42), who works at Sounds of the Universe (number: three middle-aged men), noticed.
"Someone came in recently and said, "I don't have a record player yet, but I want to buy it on a Radiohead record so we can display it on the shelf,"" he says.
The percentage of such is not large, but it happens.
It's more about the product side than the music.
We have people coming to us who say, "I don't have a record player."
These are younger people, not the older, grown-up teenagers who are getting into it.
Fopp, where almost the entire floor is currently reserved for record records, has much more diverse visitors when I arrive.
There are couples in their 70s, tourists taking pictures, teenagers and middle-aged women.
While the atmosphere isn't as relaxed as the stores used to be - instead of the tattered jazz, the latest Wild Beasts pop full of synthesizers and sex echoes from the speakers, it's good to see different customers.
None of them look particularly lonely, but it's hard to tell an intrusive mental trauma when you're standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora (27) takes a few minutes in Fopp to browse various record records on sale.
She's one of those people who looks at storefronts rather than spending feverishly.
She says she doesn't make much money, so there's no way she's collecting record.
It costs a lot of money.
It's easy to listen to music on your computer or something. But record records have their charms...
I can't explain it - it's unique.
My last stop is a shop that supposedly inspired a new generation of record lovers: Urban Outfitters.
I pretend to be very interested in the calves of girls in tight jeans and watching a group of teenage girls clustering around Polaroid cameras right now. Then father and daughter decide to buy a Crosley turntable.
On the left is a staircase, the wall of which is covered by the gramophone records of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary and classical music, the basis of any average collection of gramophone records.
No one is looking at them - perhaps precisely because they are just for decoration and some are so high on the wall that they cannot be reached.
It's a pure vinyl trick.
But since any attraction to it could mean more money for the industry and send a few customers to the depths of Soho for more, there's not much to complain about.
Unsurprisingly, the demographic area, where there is more time and money than in other areas, is also where the most spent on the most luxurious goods that vinyl certainly is.
But while my findings seem to make YouGov's results accurate - at least in record stores, they don't take into account the large number of vinyl collectors and lovers that actually exist, in record stores and online forums.
These people probably work hard in schools or offices.
I'm sure he doesn't spend Thursday morning wandering around the record stores on Berwick Street, going through the tapes and avoiding the sight of a strange, 30-year-old fake TV presenter hiding behind the backs of unsuspecting middle-aged men.
Greenland shark is the longest living vertebrate - video report
According to scientists, the Greenland shark has the longest life expectancy of any vertebrate on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, who studies sharks, says the footage shows a female whose age is estimated to be between 272 and 512 years old and measures five metres
Court in France refuses to demolish shops in Jungle refugee camp
A court in France has rejected an order by the authorities in Calais to demolish dozens of makeshift shops and restaurants in the Jungle camp, home to thousands of refugees.
During a court hearing this week, authorities in Calais argued that the state should be able to close a total of 72 makeshift shops where people inside the camp sell goods range from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer haircuts, sell tea for 50 cents in makeshift restaurants, or basic meals for several euros.
The Prefect's office in Calais argued that places need to be demolished because they represent a parallel, tax-free economy and because they pose fire hazards and health risks.
Humanitarian organizations said in court that shops and restaurants are vital and that the free meals offered by the state-sponsored association and other groups do not provide food supplements for the growing numbers of refugees in the camp.
Disputed makeshift shops and restaurants often provide shelter and free food to people in need.
The Court in Lille ruled that there was no legal basis preventing people from running 72 makeshift shops, but said the objections of the Prefect of Calais were "entirely understandable."
Judge Jean-François Molla said food outlets, cafes and restaurants have a much bigger role to play than simply serving food to people who "live in extremely desperate conditions."
He said the premises provide quiet places to meet refugees and volunteers.
One of the places threatened with demolition was the camp's café, Jungle Book Kids, run by a nonprofit that offers 200 meals a day, English and French lessons and asylum counseling for hundreds of vulnerable unaccompanied minors in the camp.
More than 170,000 people have signed a petition to protect the "children's" café.
The Guardian received a letter saying that closing the café "would be a disaster for these children, some of whom are only 8 years old."
The charity Help Refugess and L'Auberge des Migrants estimated on Friday that the number of refugees in the camp had risen to more than 9,000 after a sharp increase in arrivals over the summer - the highest ever.
He thought he was dead.
Ulč resurrects itself and volleyball Usti.
"I've been able to train normally since March," he said at the start of the summer training in full force.
What was your time?
I had a bilateral pulmonary embolism, and then heart problems because of it.
Because when I was at the Korean Universal, I didn't know I had any blood problems.
So a long flight to Asia caused the trouble?
I had a clot in my calf for two years, and I didn't know it.
It hurt, no one found me anything.
Then the clot went up.
There's a damaged vein in the calf, it's going to hurt all the time, especially when the weather's working or changing.
But nothing to limit me, more like an aesthetic thing.
Were you afraid for your life?
had.
Last year at the summer tournament in Wooden House, I didn't know I had an embolism, and I couldn't move there anymore.
I threw up blood last night.
The doctors told me it was something else entirely, I was completely finished for five more days.
I really thought I was dead at Wooden House, even my girlfriend and family.
I've seen you somewhere else.
How did you deal with it?
I guess I had to go through it, now it's just going to go up.
I know I have some blood problems, that I have to be more careful when I fly somewhere.
But there's everything we can do about it.
Only when I wanted to return to příbram preparation last year, there were still heart problems.
Everything's fine now.
Since March, I've been preparing myself at home to be able to play again.
I'm going to knock, physically, I'm better off than I was before.
What do you expect from Usti?
I'm looking forward to it, the group looks good, I know most of the guys.
I'm curious about the other two strangers coming.
Hopefully we'll sit down humanly to make it work.
Will you lift the Mouth?
It had a reputation as a beat-up, but every season is different.
Brno was eighth two years ago, now it has finished second.
There's a new team in Usti, only a few players left.
It was last in the extra league, so there's a lot of room for improvement.
How we use it is up to us.
We'll see after the first rounds who's going to be hammered, we're not going to be.
Is Coach Brom the guarantee of success?
He's experienced and he's been through a lot, he'll think better than last place.
But my arrival had nothing to do with his, I made a deal sooner.
There were other coaches in the game, I'm a great friend with one and it was agreed that he would be working here.
I'm not going to say the name.
Finally, Mr. Brom came, and I'm glad.
He's got a big name, he's been in good clubs, he's coached for decades, he's a good former player.
He's going to move us up.
What will you bring?
This team is going to fight, which is my position.
I like to fight, I like to hectic, and I like to get opportunities on a not-so-top team.
I was in Příbram for two years, but Ústí is a bigger challenge than being in the sixth team because it starts from the bottom.
You mentioned a foreigner, an Australian, Boehm, is already training in Usti.
What does he look like?
I know him, we played against each other in a group at the universal.
And we talked there a few times, sometimes we sat together the night after the games, so we already know each other in a friendly way.
We beat them 3-1, I immediately gave it to him at the start of the summer preparation in Ústí.
He's got a Slovak girlfriend, he's nice.
American Nadazdin and Brazilian Ze are yet to arrive.
Do you know anything about them?
I've been texting an American, he seems like a nice guy, Brazilian, who knows how he's going to speak English.
You contacted the American?
It seemed like a good idea.
I'm the recorder, the one who creates, so I should communicate with everyone.
I immediately found out who these players were, I looked up on the Internet how he plays, I saw some videos.
He seemed pretty cool, the kid jumps, he's tall.
We wrote a few messages on Facebook, he seemed like a joker, he'll fit in with us.
How are you looking forward to being number one?
I didn't want to take anything else.
I'm going to be 24 after all, and I don't have the temperament to take turns.
I'd rather be in the spotlight, I'd rather lead the team than have someone else lead it.
I guess I wouldn't want to play anymore if I had to be a second record player and devote myself to it at full time. When something isn't done to the fullest, it sucks.
How many times have you been number one?
Six months in Příbram, when Kust couldn't do it as captain, he got hurt, then there were money problems, and he left.
We've been climbing up ever since, and I've been playing all the time.
In Brno, of which I am a boy, I alternated one and two.
An excellent year was in the Old Town, after which I had a lot of offers and chose Příbram.
From there, Budějovice wanted me, I stayed, but I did not finish the season because of the embolism.
Now it's a new beginning.
Gold number 22.
The short position remains Phelps' domain.
"Being on the podium again and hearing the anthem is as sweet as ever," Phelps laughed, his eyes filled with tears again.
His fiancée and mother were once again in the audience, while his son Boomer slept peacefully with headphones on.
I'm having an incredible week at the end of my career.
It's crazy - 20 years ago I started swimming in a race and in a few hours it'll all be over,' he said emotionally.
In the final, Silver Japanese Kosuke Hagino, who won the long position, was nearly two seconds behind Phelps.
The bronze was won by Wang Shun, a Bronze Medalist in this discipline from last year's World Championships.
After Ala Oertero (discus) and Carl Lewis (distance), Michael Phelps is the third athlete to dominate the same discipline at four games in a row.
For most of the race, another American, Ryan Lochte, and the home team, Thiago Perreira, led phelps.
While the defending champion of gold in the final round of 50 put on a crushing finish, they fell outside the medal positions.
The American superhero will have at least one more chance to expand his unique medal collection in Rio.
Shortly after the ceremonial announcement of the positional position, he advanced to the final of the 100-meter butterfly race.
Even compatriot Ryan Murphy, who won the sign double after 100, won the double track in Rio after 100.
In the final, he left Australian swimmer Mitchell Larkin 37 hundredths behind, while Russian Yevgeny Rylov finished third.
While Murphy is only fifth in the 200 from last year's World Championships, he has become the signer's king in Rio.
He dethroned Larkin, who won the same double at last year's World Championships.
But he only won a medal at the Olympics now.
Canadian Penny Oleksiak and American Simone Manuel shared gold in the 100.
For 16-year-old Oleksiak, it was the fourth medal at these Games, manuel's second after silver in the relay.
She won swimming gold at the Olympics as the first African-American woman in history.
I believe I can be an inspiration to others.
This medal is for everyone who comes after me, sport becomes love for them and they get to where I am, said an emotional Manuel.
Swede Sarah Sjöström, who won the 100m butterfly in Rio in a world record, was third and still has silver in the 200m.
Australian Cate Campbell finished sixth.
The breaststroke doubles was won by Japanese Rie Kanet, for whom it is the first Olympic medal at the age of 27.
It has no valuable metal even from the World Championships, its maximum was fourth place in this discipline in 2013.
The second silver in Rio went to Yuliya Yemimova of Russia, who is facing the hostility of spectators and competitors due to her start at the Games despite her doping history.
I made a big mistake once.
But I won in court, and I don't see why I should keep answering those questions.
"I'm so tired of it," said the Russian swimmer.
She only claimed the right to start in Rio with a special CAS sports arbitration panel just before the Games began.
They dealt with my appeal, and I won.
Whether someone likes it or not, or if they have a different opinion, they should go to the arbitration court, she added.
Hermann: Disappointing, we could have won.
And the launch at midnight?
I don't remember.
The Czechs had a special day.
It wasn't until less than an hour before the game that they knew who he was going up against.
They had to make a quick tactical preparation.
And then, in an unconventional time, the match began on small court number one.
They didn't start the first set well, then took the lead, but at 19:19 they didn't make it to the end.
In the second they were clearly better and levelled, but the decisive tie-break did not work out for them.
In particular, a series of broken service meant a 10-15 loss and a farewell to the Olympic tournament.
"We could have beaten Russia," Hermann regretted.
How would you rate the match?
Hermannová: After an unfortunate start before I started, we got into the game beautifully.
At the end, in the last balloon, I missed the reception I had become accustomed to before.
We lost a set, which was crucial.
In the next set, we started on them with an overview on the court, a different defense and pushed on the service.
There were some very bad serves in the tie-break, that's where we went down that page.
It was disappointing because we could beat the Russians.
Sluková: Pity at the beginning of the first set, we missed it there.
We were able to pull it back, but we were missing the points.
The second set was great and in the third the service decided.
We've made too many mistakes.
We gave them five points, and that was five, we hesitated a lot there.
It's a shame because Russians were playable.
How did you play in little court number one?
Sluková: Similar to china in the backyards next door.
The environment and atmosphere were different.
It was one o'clock at night, total silence, music not playing, nothing.
That was the difference from downtown.
We wouldn't choose those conditions, but we can't choose.
How was the preparation for the match when you found out the names of the opponents an hour before the game?
Hermann: She was special.
We started warming up for the game without knowing our opponents, so we couldn't do tactical preparation like the other teams.
But Simon (Coach Nausch) has prepared tactics for almost every option that was there.
He had a lot of paperwork ready with tactics, so we were pretty well prepared from that point of view.
Do you remember ever starting a game at midnight?
Hermann: Probably not.
We played at 11:30, but not at 12:00.
Russian Birlova's block in the playoffs at the Olympics in Rio.
Beach volleyball players Markéta Sluková and Barbora Hermannová in a hug in the run-up to the play-offs at the Olympics in Rio.
Was it uncomfortable?
Sluková: By playing the last two matches in the group from 10, we had the mode postponed before.
This was two hours more.
It's strange, I can't imagine another sport has athletes who have to perform at 12 o'clock.
But I think we prepared as best we could.
We knew it was going to be like that, but it's not exactly typical, and it's probably not going to be my favorite time to play.
How do you rate the Olympic experience?
Hermann: Since progressing from the group was our goal, on the one hand it is fine, good.
We did what we said.
But now after the game, I'm sad.
Sluková: I will sleep it off and from tomorrow I will remember the Olympic tournament only positively.
Big Brother's here, here comes the first peeping SIM.
You can't escape her.
The new rules are to apply to all persons without a Thai passport who decide to purchase a SIM from a local operator while in Thailand.
That is, not only for tourists, but also for people with long-stay visas who, for example, work or have married there in Thailand.
Takorn Tantasith, Secretary-General of the Office of National Broadcasting and telecommunications, informed that there would be no exceptions.
The plan to sell SIMs intended exclusively to foreigners was presented by the national telecommunications regulator at the beginning of August.
The authorities intend to introduce a new measure to monitor their location within six months.
According to Tantasith, this is a means of maintaining national security, which will make it possible to deal with criminal activities committed by foreigners.
In addition, the so-called tourist SIMs are intended to help detect people who exceed the allowed length of stay.
Special SIMs for foreigners should appear alongside SIMs intended exclusively for Thais within six months.
The tracking feature will be different, which will be permanently turned on for cards intended for persons without a Thai passport.
You will not be able to turn it off.
"This sim feature is not for Thais, because we can always easily monitor them," Tantasith added.
It should be added that in Thailand, prepaid subscriptions are not anonymous as in the Czech Republic.
The seller requires proof of identity.
On the other hand, for several years, one of the operators gave out free starter SIMs to tourists at airports.
They were so completely anonymous.
Ten telecommunications regulators from other Asian countries, including Malaysia and Singapore, are also considering introducing the same measure as Thailand.
They also currently have mandatory SIM registration, but legal use of the surveillance system is not possible.
However, the forthcoming measure does not oblige foreigners to acquire a local operator when entering the country of SIM.
They can, of course, use roaming services with their own home SIM, in which case the Thai authorities will be short on them.
The operators of a given country know only relevant network information after crossing the border, i.e. after the SIM has logged on to their network.
Therefore, they know the phone number, but not the owner information.
However, the difference in roaming prices from the rates of local operators is so wide that even most tourists will start looking for local SIMs during their stay in Thailand.
The authorities' efforts to supervise the movement of foreigners have been legally criticized by foreigners living in Thailand.
Tantasith is reassuring the situation and compares the forthcoming system to the obligation to provide a residential address in immigration documents in the context of privacy protection.
In addition, the police will need a court order if a person needs to be monitored.
Any abuse of the system will be punishable by an unspecified penalty.
"If the service provider monitors the sim location without a court order, it will be charged with a crime," Tantasith added.
In addition, the system should also maximize the use of prepaid cards.
While a specific number is currently recycled only after the 90-day period after which the SIM has not logged on to the network, the number could now be restored after 15 days if it leaves Thailand.
Luxury apartment in a new building in Vinohrady has a swimming pool and hot tub on the terrace.
Why did you choose an apartment in a new building?
We were looking for a carefree apartment where most of the care of the property is provided by the caretaker.
The condition was enough parking space and an elevator in the house, which basically disqualified the older development.
Not to mention problematic acoustics in old houses, problems with floor swinging, high energy performance and so on.
Large terraces were also a condition, which the old building is not able to offer.
Other interesting visits can be found in the magazine Modern Apartment.
The whole interior was designed for you by architect Lenka Langerová and her colleague Kamila Poláková from artiga studio.
Why did you approach them?
Would you recommend working with an expert to anyone?
We would recommend cooperation with the architect to everyone if they design the apartment from the beginning, because it is a very complex technical process.
The second level is the interior design itself: designers have a significantly better idea of the range of possible materials and are able to properly harmonize the interior based on the client's wishes.
We cooperated with the architect Lenka Langerová already on our mountain apartment, at that time on the basis of the personal recommendation of another client, and since everything worked well, it was a clear choice for us even during the reconstruction of our new apartment in Vinohrady.
What were your practical and aesthetic requirements?
We wanted a generous social-living space with adequate facilities for a family of four conceived as a modern but not cool interior.
The priority was to connect the apartment with the terraces and to realize intelligent household control.
And, of course, it was necessary to monitor the quality of the design.
Did you leave everything to the experts, or did you interfere with the final design of the interior yourself?
All designs, including technical drawings and samples of materials, were approved, however, the design always came from architects.
At the beginning, we set out what we expect from the design and showed some elements of the interior that we would like to incorporate into the design, such as carpets or paintings.
I think it is our collection of mostly Czech authors, including works by Karel Malich, Karel Vysušil, Václav Špála or Otto Gutfreund, that helped the architect to orient herself in our tastes.
Also, the combination of black, white and walnut wood was the architect's idea as well as individual pieces of furniture, walls, flooring, lighting, carpets, textiles, art, etc. We then verified that everything matched together using visualizations.
Have there been any complications in the realization, due to which you had to give up the original ideas or, on the contrary, to accept new ones?
Perhaps only in the initial phase of the project, when we came to the construction at the moment when it was first possible to climb to the height of our floor, and found that the views we planned actually shaded the surrounding buildings.
That's when we literally changed the layout overnight from the ground up.
Granite was used on the kitchen counter and on the lining of the fireplace wall.
The interior is dominated by wooden surfaces complemented by leather, for example, on the upholstery of Norma dining and bar chairs from Arper.
How would you characterize the interior?
Are you making any changes here, or is there anything you wish you had differently today?
I believe that it is a modern airy interior that primarily serves its purpose.
We are not planning changes, most of the modifications after moving in took place in the plane of shielding and settling of terraces.
Perhaps the only resentful is to the floor, when walnut wood turns out to be too delicate for a household with a dog.
The word of the architects, Ing. arch. Lenka Langerová and MgA. Kamila Hornychová, author of the realization.
The apartment is on the last floor of a new building, so it was possible to carry out a completely new layout and several other modifications within the construction.
For the interior, an important element is the placement of fire guides in the ceiling of the corridor and the main toilet.
This gave us daylight to the darker areas of the apartment.
Also direct access from the main bathroom to the roof terrace to the pool from USSPA is one of the building modifications which was very beneficial for the function of the whole apartment.
There is also a swimming pool and a hot tub.
You are not negative compared to the French, says a Muslim woman living in Prague.
You're from France.
Where did you live before you moved to Prague?
My parents are originally from Algeria.
I was born in the south of France, near the Spanish border.
I've been moving around quite a bit.
I've lived in Toulouse, Lyon and Marseille.
I studied journalism in France, which led me to a job at a magazine.
Then why did you decide to move out of the country?
I was starting to feel like I was suffocating in France.
I just didn't want to live there anymore.
Mainly because of the atmosphere between people.
I felt like every Frenchman was very negative.
People in France are negatively attuned in general, but it has gotten worse lately.
It's interesting that you're mentioning negativity.
Some people judge czech character this way.
Trust me, you're not negative compared to the French.
Some people may not find it that way when they come to France because they don't see it as tourists.
But it was too much for me.
Money is a big issue.
People feel that they are short of money, yet the minimum wage in France is fifteen hundred euros, which I think is enough.
Now there's also a problem with people's behavior towards Muslims.
That's completely incomprehensible to me.
For example, on the street I lived in, my non-Muslim neighbor started looking down on me just because I'm Muslim.
It's like I'm some kind of evil.
That's why I didn't feel good in France.
But my family stayed there.
So you decided to go to another country.
Why did you choose the Czech Republic?
I was looking for a job pretty much anywhere else, and I came across a vacancy at Air France here in Prague.
I confess that at first I did not know Prague at all.
I knew something about the Czech Republic, my father even told me about what was happening in Czechoslovakia, but I had no idea what to expect from Prague.
I've been here three years now, and I can't imagine not living here.
Was it a big difference when you moved from France to Prague?
Mainly because of a completely different atmosphere.
Maybe it's because I don't speak Czech, so I can't catch any negative reactions or insults, but I feel like people here are freer.
That I can do anything, dress any way I want, and no one will judge me.
In France, you're always looked at unpleasantly, like when you're wearing special clothes and stuff.
In Prague, I started to feel really free.
I don't think praguers care about such things.
Where do you work now?
After working at Air France, I worked for a travel website for a while.
Then one of my friends and I started a website where people offer and look for shared housing.
So far, we only operate in Prague, but we would like to extend it to the whole of Central Europe.
Do you have any Czech friends in Prague?
I have two very close friends here, who are half Czechs, and two other friends of czechs.
I have to say that another specificity of the Czechs is that they initially keep their distance more.
They don't let anyone near them any time soon.
That's quite different from where I grew up.
In the South, everyone hugs and kisses on the cheek.
It's different here, but I understand it's a cultural thing, so I'm trying to adapt.
You mentioned you don't speak Czech.
Is the language barrier a problem for you?
On the contrary, it is quite simple in Prague, because everyone here speaks English.
Even in curfey or grocery stores.
I'd like to learn Czech, but I don't have that much time.
And by being able to communicate at least a little in English, I don't have that need to learn the language quickly.
And every time I have a problem, there's someone who can help me.
Have you encountered any negative reactions?
Maybe because you're Muslim?
Not really.
Perhaps it is also because I work in an international environment that is more tolerant.
I can think of an experience.
My manager, a Czech, once told me about the French football team and said something to the effect: They are not French, but Africans.
That kind of touched me.
But if anyone had a problem with me being Muslim, that hasn't happened to me yet.
This is despite the fact that a colleague once warned me about some anti-German demonstrations.
He told me not to go downtown, that they'd call me names.
Anti-German demonstrations are partly related to terrorist attacks.
How does the current situation affect you?
Are you afraid, for example, that something similar to paris, nice or Brussels could happen in Prague?
I feel safe in Prague.
But the problem is, anything can happen anywhere these days.
Until recently, for example, I could not have imagined that something like this would happen in France.
And it's not just about Muslims.
Moreover, Islam does not recognize violence at all.
To me, the people who kill are not Muslims.
The Koran says man has no right to kill because he is not God.
How do you feel about terrorists backing up your faith?
It's very hard.
I feel shame and guilt, even though I shouldn't feel that way at all.
I try not to follow the violence reports too much, but every time I read something, I feel the need to apologize for something that's not really my fault.
I'm a completely different person, so why should I apologize for terrorists?
We met in The Square of Jiří of Podebrady.
On Wednesday, Czech Muslims and Christians demonstrated against violence.
Did you register it?
I didn't know about that.
But I take it these people feel the need to prove that they don't agree with violence.
I don't think they have to do that.
Why should they feel guilty about something they didn't cause?
Do you meet other Muslims in Prague?
My collaborators are from Egypt and other Muslim countries, for example.
They're a little more religious than I am, so sometimes we have some pretty wild discussions about Islam because we all see it a little differently.
I come from France, so I went through a different education, they were studying Islam at school.
We have different approaches, but we respect each other.
People sometimes associate Islam with a woman's subordinate position.
How do you feel about that?
There's no way I'm subservient.
Rather the opposite.
I'm a woman, I have strength.
It has to do with the fact that you don't wear any headgear.
Like a hijab?
And it's mainly the way I was raised that's been signed.
My mother, for example, is a very principled Muslim.
He prays five times a day, but he just doesn't wear a scarf.
She always taught me that faith is a purely personal thing.
It's up to everyone how they interpret it.
When you read the Koran, you should make up your own mind about these things.
So when I read a passage in the Koran that said God told the Prophet to hide his wives from the eyes of others, I thought, "I am not the Prophet's wife, so why should I hide?"
On the other hand, I respect that, and if I come to Iran or Saudi Arabia, where scarves require, I will marry him.
Are you planning to stay in Prague?
So far, yes.
I haven't felt so good anywhere else.
I thought about Poland for a while, but I feel great in Prague.
I can even imagine eduing my own children here.
I think Prague is the ideal city for this.
Czech Muslims, together with Christians, demonstrated against violence.
Yachtsman Kozelská Fenclová was blown to the top of the leaderboard in Rio.
Friday's sea rides in Rio de Janiero, Brazil, were released by Czech yachtswoman Veronica Kozelská Fenclová.
In the Laser Radial class, she moved up to 10th place before the final two races.
This would ensure the Czech's participation in the final ride.
You collect the packages like Pokemon.
They want to compete with the carriers.
Tv director Matěj Liška and prague music club manager Marek Greger are behind the idea of using the already planned routes for transporting shipments.
With the idea, they breathed life into a trio of applications with different geographic reach.
We launched the national transfer app in May.
At the moment, there are 1,000 cities recorded in it, and we will be expanding the network.
In the Czech Republic, we want to learn this before focusing more on foreign countries, says the 41-year-old manager iDNES.cz-year-old in an interview with The Czech Republic.
How does the Transfer app work and who can benefit from it?
You will download it and register for free.
You can then enter the route and details of how big the package can be transported and how much you want for it.
Someone might be asking for a transfer that day.
When both the route and the delivery time are satisfactory, it pairs and they both get mutual notification.
At that moment, the chat opens, where the couple arranges a handover.
How many people do you think would have to register for each package to always find their courier?
I do not know the ideal condition, I cannot estimate how many registered and how many routes it takes for coverage to be completely optimal and each offer paired with demand.
It already works on the main roads and it is logically easier than, say, the journey between villages.
The more people, the greater the potential for speed and accuracy.
Meanwhile, people are also building trust and finding that no one will run away with the package.
You haven't had to deal with a case like this yet?
How many users does the service have two months after launch?
Right now, we have about 5,000 to 6,000 people making routes.
We consider this a success and believe that more will be packed.
Isn't there a danger that the sender will wait too long?
We hope to be a competitor for large conglomerates just because we are able to deliver the thing on the same day and at a fraction of the price.
At a large company, you pay several thousand for delivery within two hours.
Here you can pay a hundred or less, because that's a way someone's already doing.
Should traditional carriers be worried about possible customer decline in the future?
We hope that's the way it's going to be.
The market has huge potential, feeding on huge multinational carriers, as well as retail chains, where everyone started buying and gradually found that quality did not correspond to what they were paying for.
No one wants to find a note in the mailbox saying to pick up the package at the branch, not until after 7:00 that day at the first time.
By then, I had needed the package for six hours, and I was waiting at home because it was important.
We want a better, faster and functional service that doesn't annoy anyone and sends a signal to the competition to try.
Marek Greger (41) and Matěj Liška (39).
Neither has ever been in the itinerary industry.
Marek Greger works as a music club manager, Matěj Liška as a television director.
In 2014, they started preparing shippansee LTD, which uses already planned trips between the world's capitals, especially by plane, to transport packages.
In 2015, they entered a project for processing a company that created applications for example MALL.cz, Jobs.cz or ČSFD.
Programming lasted three quarters of a year and the app was launched in March 2016.
They started developing the Transfer app in December last year and released it in May this year.
It is a local version of Shippansee adapted for the Czech market.
The app was developed by Mesík and Mesík Profi from January this year and made available to users at the end of July 2016.
The intention was from the beginning to do all these applications that will one day merge into one.
In the Czech Republic, they want to fine-tune the application and then, in cooperation with a strong investor, focus more on the global market.
The sharing economy has been a theme lately, and this is a service like AirBnB or Uber.
Aren't you worried about working in an area that no one can say yet, where the line of sharing is and where the grey economy is?
It's the same, just a different product.
We know that if this is successful and we go up with it, we will be another thorn in the bottom of the grey economy.
But even if someone saves and someone makes money, it's not the intention to bypass tax authorities and tax controls.
Every user, on one side or the other, will be encouraged to tax their income if they make income from it.
What makes you think the service has so much potential?
The sender saves and the ferryman earns or reduces the cost of the trip.
That's the strong idea that unites interest on both sides.
In an age of social media that divides people, we'd like this one to converse.
Nice stories can be created, people are happy to help someone and they will talk about it.
Maybe someone will bring you forgotten glasses, keys or pills.
I think people have been lacking in personal access for a long time, we say this app is a service to people.
So how do you guarantee that the courier will not with the package?
Each user of the application scans the ID card together with the registration and lists the bank details, payment or credit card.
These are channels that give credibility to both the service and the person.
Couriers also collect stars based on the sender's rating.
We will also offer insurance, we are still fine-tuning the details.
An unsured consignment is liable for loss or damage by a courier, but does not assume responsibility for the content under criminal law if there is something illegal inside and does not know about it.
If the police stop him and find a submachine gun or 10 kilos of hash in a sealed package in his trunk, he will be held criminally liable to the sender.
Is there no risk of misuse of sensitive data from the database?
If necessary, the registered are traceable by the administrative authority, which will be the only one that will be able to consult it, nor are we able to see it ourselves, the data is protected against misuse.
How much money does a courier get after successfully delivering a shipment?
The courier determines the price and gets the full amount he's going to be interested in.
The sender is charged an additional few percent for facilitating the contact.
This money is our profit, but it's only a few percent because we want to push for volume.
The courier can also not be accused of not delivering the shipment when he actually delivered it, both the takeover and delivery are verified using QR codes.
Are there any restrictions?
Whether in relation to the size or content of the package?
You can transport anything.
We have three sizes, as small as a cube of butter, medium as a plato of eggs and the size of a case of beers.
After that, there is no further restrictions, and if someone has a place in the car, they will transport, for example, a refrigerator.
Plus, the sender has the option to take a picture of the package in the app, so the courier can see what is wanted from him.
You don't even have to pack the thing if you don't want to hide the content.
You put a forgotten sweatshirt in the courier's hand and that's it.
Who came up with the idea and how long did it take to start the service?
A friend of mine had an idea over two years ago, I didn't pay much attention to it then.
Then he showed me a demo app with a transnational range that mainly targets air passengers.
That's when I told him I wasn't going to look for an investor, but I wanted to become one myself and put my savings into it.
It took another year of development before we established Shippansee LTD in London due to the greater creditiability of the whole product.
But this is not the version you are focusing on right now.
No, we focused marketing on the Czech Republic, where we try to catch up with the application because it all had birth pains and there is still something to solve and improve.
We try to respond to customer feedback and we do not deal with the foreign market so much at the moment.
We know it's a long run, but we're not teasing, we want to create a really good product for people.
Shippansee LTD was the basic and most expensive application, the other two were upgraded in their own way.
I took over when we said that the national segment could be much more interesting and that we would at least learn it in the Czech Republic.
The third application of The City is local, for the city.
But he can send a package to the exact address to the other side of the world.
It works for the sender in the same way as I take over, but the difference is that in it, as a courier, you can see shipments in the form of points on the map that are closest to you, thanks to the geolocator on your mobile.
We have called the application for couriers who want to make a living from this.
So someone can make extra money picking up packages around town?
Exactly, the last application will be downloaded in Prague by a taxi driver, a student, a mother on parental leave, someone who wants to make the way to work.
Now that everyone's messing with those Pokemon, they can collect this just like that.
One sees where the orders are around the city, comes to it, clicks and sees when it has to be delivered and transports the shipment.
It's set up cheaper than competing services.
At the moment, we are still doing a web interface, which will be crucial for shipping companies, they will fill in their data on the web, so they will create points on the map.
We are then able to invoice them for the use of the service every month.
Are you now working on the project full-time?
It makes us feel better, but it's normal at work so we can make a living and develop the project.
There is no strong multinational investor behind us, we are two guys, one of whom had a brilliant idea and the other jumped in with other stimuli and ideas.
We are now looking for an investor strong enough to handle the Czech market with us, but who should, with the ball's passing, come with us to a global product and become another huge player in the market like AirBnB and Uber.
Titanfall 2's story part is supposed to bring almost forgotten variety.
This will correct the second part and the solo game will be more varied in it than in Call of Duty, according to the first information.
The length will be around the standard eight hours and the content should be based on the concept of networking in the first part.
Therefore, you can look forward to freedom of movement, which in addition to running includes the possibility to use a fighting titan.
In addition to action passages, the game will also contain levels focused on dexterous movement.
They will resemble platformers and include puzzles.
Double jumps, running on walls and rope slides are therefore essential for overcoming them.
Moreover, sometimes it will be necessary to eliminate enemies.
There will also be maps resembling mazes and levels with special concepts.
In one, for example, it will be possible to lift and move platforms and close massive doors.
You will thus modify the form of the battlefield.
As a result, the pace of the game should ossiulate between fierce action and quieter moments for exploring an unknown planet.
We're going to play pawn Jack Cooper dreaming of a pilot's career.
Cooper, along with Captain Lastimosa, crashes on the alien planet Typhon, inhabited by enemy soldiers, at the beginning of the campaign.
And the wilderness there won't be lenient with him either.
In addition, Lastimosa will take fatal blows in the crash, and Cooper will therefore be tasked with getting the captain's titan up and running.
His dream of a piloting career will come true sooner than he expected.
But the first step will be to steal the battery necessary for the robot's repair.
Cooper's conversations with the titan will also be significant.
It will serve as a source of information about the soldier's past, but at the same time humorous moments will arise with robot-personed communication.
For example, if titanium dryly lists all the injuries cooper is in danger of in a planned jump.
The first information about the Titanfall 2 campaign was provided by the Polygon server.
In addition, the result can be assessed in just two months, and Bonusweb will give you the first impressions of the network game after Gamescom.
Titanfall 2 is released on October 28 for PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
The THQ brand comes to life, but the original label remains dead.
Swedish company Nordic changes its name to THQ Nordic.
After the collapse of THQ in 2013, it acquired a number of its brands and the right to use both the logo and the company name.
Nordic has released darksiders 2 deathnitive edition and red faction collection.
In addition, another 23 games are being created for the publishing house, 13 of which have not yet been revealed by the company.
Thirty years ago, by the time I retired, my wife, after 30 years of marriage, had found a man 20 years younger, our neighbor.
I knew it from the beginning - at first she obviously tried for a long time, then they got together.
She's such a big guy, probably her type, because she dated a guy like that before me.
She's completely out of her mind.
In those first days, her voice even changed, she had this girlish, love voice.
But when I told her I knew what was going on, she denied it.
But I've been watching the whole thing.
He was coming home from work regularly at 3:30, so she always left at 3:00 to shop.
Every day she tried to at least see him.
Later, I found out they were meeting at his house, in the laundry room.
How many times have I known they were there?
I got the keys, I was determined to catch them there.
But I don't know why, I always ended up sitting at home.
I've never been able to go in there, make that decisive move.
You may laugh at me, but I believe my wife was mind-controlling me.
I think she soon found out that I was controllable, that I'd do whatever she wanted.
And I actually did.
Maybe I'm just a slipper.
At the time, the neighbors were telling me that they knew about it, too.
I was such a jerk, I never asked them what to do.
I was afraid if it all broke, it would be bad.
Only my daughter suspected that it would affect everyone in the family.
So I've always put it off, over and over again.
But I went to his apartment once and said I needed help with something in the laundry room.
He went with me, and I told him that I got an anonymous call, that he was seeing my wife, and that everything indicated that.
I asked him what he had to say.
He stood there, shrugged, looked at the ground, and didn't say a word.
Then I also met his wife once on my way home from the store.
I told her, but she didn't believe it at all.
She didn't respond to it, and she didn't tell me anything either.
Nobody told me anything back then.
I'm the kind of person who's never gone out much, who's having trouble meeting someone, let alone finding a woman.
So I haven't even thought about a divorce.
I kept relying on it to end one day.
I thought I'd forgive her for all this and life would go on.
But that wasn't the case.
And I've basically never come to terms with all of this.
It's still inside me today.
I used to show it to her a lot, but in the end, I gave it up for peace.
He lives in the house next door, and I live with her.
She's just more than my housekeeper's wife.
At home, she always did everything - cooked, washed, cleaned.
She's hardworking.
I always thought she was trying to make sure I had no other reason to complain.
And you could say she's nice, too.
But sometimes I want to stroke her, hug her, and she won't let me.
We go for walks and shopping together, and everyone thinks what a happy marriage we have.
But she once told me she never loved me.
That she loved me and she loved me, but that she didn't love me.
And I see she still loves him to this day, he's her god.
And I don't enjoy living like that.
Even when it started and I took it very badly, I once told her that I didn't want to live, and I asked what she would say if I ended it.
I wanted to know if she'd agree to it or not.
And that's what I wanted to hear from her: Yes or no.
But she thought about it, and finally said, "But there's plenty of room."
Prime Minister Manuel Valls wants to establish a new French Islamic Foundation to serve as a bridge between the state and its Muslim population.
In the wake of the terrorist attacks, France is stepping up its fight against radical Islamists, and the government and the local Muslim minority are calling for help.
"If Muslims themselves do not help the state against those who violate public freedom, it will become increasingly difficult for France to guarantee their freedom of religion," prime minister Manuel Valls said.
He intends to ensure that only spiritual scholars in France preach in the country.
It also wants to stop funding mosques from abroad, where jihadist-inoculated preachers often come up with the money.
By October, Prime Minister Valls wants to establish a new French Islamic Foundation to serve as a bridge between the state and its Muslim population.
The new institution will replace the current French Foundation for Islam, founded in 2005 by then Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin.
Even then, it was supposed to help make financial flows between mosques and the countries that finance their construction more transparent.
Soon, however, she was struck by internal contradictions, and it never really worked.
"It's a total failure," Valls said.
The new foundation is likely to be headed by former Interior and Defense Minister Jean-Pierre Chevènement, who is known as a supporter of the secular state.
There are about 2,500 mosques and prayer halls in France, about 120 of which serve radical Islamism.
Since 2012, French authorities have expelled some 80 Islamic clerics from the country, and several dozen others are considering the move.
German police also cracked down on jihadist clerics this week.
The imams were reportedly recruiting fighters for the Islamic State.
One of them ran an area where worshippers allegedly became radicalized and later attacked a Sikh temple in Essen.
Immediately after the attacks on Charlie Hebdo in January 2015, a debate erupted in France about a new institution to replace the dysfunctional foundation.
This was hastened by other terrorist attacks carried out in the name of the Islamic State by radical Islamists.
The new foundation will have two main tasks – to ensure the financing of mosques from domestic sources, as well as to supervise imams.
However, it is not yet clear where it will receive funding, although several proposals are being considered.
One of them is a special fee for halal food, i.e. mainly for meat derived from slaughter according to Islamic principles.
In practice, halal food vendors would pay this tax for granting a permit.
Some of the money would then go to the foundation's budget.
A contribution of 10 to 20 euros could also be paid by French pilgrims who go to Mecca.
About 30,000 of them leave France every year for a traditional pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia.
Moreover, only preachers who have passed through educational programmes at their universities should operate in French mosques.
As a result, their preaching should be in line with democracy.
The government is also closing radical mosques.
"We have closed 20 since December and more will follow," said Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve.
"There is no place in France for those who preach hatred and do not respect the principles of our country, such as equality between women and men," he said.
Zaragoza.
His ex-wife was seriously injured by an unknown gunman on Friday morning at a shopping centre in zaragoza, northern Spanish, the Independent reports.
The shooting occurred after a woman and her daughter left the garage area in their car.
The man was waiting in his car outside the mall, where he also opened fire.
According to witnesses, the man then turned the gun on himself, the Independent reports.
The woman was taken to hospital by an unharmed daughter, and an ambulance had to arrive for the man in critical condition.
The incident occurred around 11 a.m. in the central part of the capital of the Autonomous Region of Aragon, near the local university.
Citing the Spanish agency Europa Press, the Independent reports that the motive was probably the unresolved recent divorce of both partners.
Rolls with asparagus, wakame algae, ginger and chilli sauce.
Summer wishes light, well-digestible meals, but we Czechs are rebels and we have our tastes and our heads.
And so the summer gardens smell of grilled neck, pork belly, pork belly.
Nothing very healthy, not too light, except sometimes with the exception of lettuce or roasted vegetables.
True, barbecues are economical for time and dishes, plus it's a social thing and no one has to be locked in the kitchen.
But there are other alternatives to make yourself well with delicacies that make dining special, their preparation is a small ritual, but at the same time there is no need to boil, bake, fry or suffocate anything for a long time.
And they're going to contribute to our health.
Whether it's homemade sushi or sashimi, where quality ingredients and a few well-adopted grifs are enough to make the preparation fun and the food itself a real exotic delicacy.
As well as even easier rolls in rice paper from today's recipe.
Here, even the more time-consuming cooking and cooling of rice is no more time-consuming.
The paper can only be softened into water for a moment, and then it is up to the chef's imagination how he intends to play with fillings and accessories.
There's no eyelash like an eyelash.
The advantage of many Asian dishes today is that ingredients are usually already widely available.
Including pickled sweet and sour ginger, which is one of the basic delicacies accompanying sushi or fresh rolls.
You can also prepare it at home, but the real pink gari ginger has a unique spicy sharp and at the same time delicious taste thanks to a secret recipe, according to which it is mixed from several types of vinegar and ginger.
So it is enough to buy a bag of the appropriate size, and the attachment with demonstrable antibacterial effects, supporting digestion as well as resistance to cough or flu, is ready.
Banana leaves.
They are mainly used in Buddhist and Hindu cultures to serve and decorate dishes as part of a variety of festive occasions and rituals.
Long ribbed banana leaves are widely used in many countries in Asia or South America as an "aid" for preparing a variety of baked, cooked and fried dishes, which are packed in them similarly to allobal.
The banana leaf then also serves a specific flavor to the dish.
In our country, they can be bought in stores with exotic fruits and vegetables, even cut in advance into the shape of wheels.
However, choose only leaves of rich green, and therefore healthy - not cracked and without stains.
Similarly easy is the preparation of salad from wakame algae, sesame and sesame oil.
You can buy it frozen again.
Those who often eat or prepare sushi will probably know especially the nori algae.
In Japan, it is one of the most important types of seaweed, from which it is produced by cutting, pressing and drying the so-called nori leaves – that is, sheets intended precisely for the production of sushi.
Wakame – a dark green algae growing in the waters around Hokkaido Island – is also fresh and dried and is as popular as nori algae.
By the way, who doesn't know miso soup with wakame, supposedly Asian women have been using it since time immemorite to recover from childbirth.
And in general, this algae has almost miraculous effects.
It cleanses blood, strengthens blood circulation, even supposedly prevents hair graying and is literally loaded with minerals.
Dried and crushed wakame also serves as a spice, for example, to season rice.
Fresh algae are first allowed to leach in water, then rinsed, put in boiling water and boil for half a minute.
Then they cool in icy water, cut out the central ribs and continue to be adjusted, for example, as a favorite salad.
However, buying it already ready, frozen, is the simplest solution.
All that remains is to roll with an easy vegetable filling, delicious and light, full of healthy tastes.
Such a longevity bombshell.
If you resist and do not throw in extra grilled belly.
Eat healthy, light and summery.
Asians know how to do it.
Just a few special ingredients and a little skill, and you have an interesting fresh food that combines flavors deliciously.
And it's done in no time.
Four pieces of rice paper, 40 g carrots, 40 g white dilute, 100 g green asparagagme, 60 g cucumber, 60 g wakame algae and 60 g sweet chilli sauce.
A handful of meatd coriander, a teaspoon of black sesame, a teaspoon of sriracha chilli sauce, 20 g of mango and 40 g of pickled gari ginger, a little pine nuts.
First, we prepare the rolls.
Soak the rice paper in cold water for five seconds.
Then we take it out and wait for it to soften.
Meanwhile, in hot water we briefly boil asparagus shoots, after about three minutes we put them quickly cooled into ice water so that they do not lose color.
Put a vegetable filling on the authorised paper and wrap.
Prepare the filling from white water, carrots and cucumbers, which we cut into fine noodles, mix with sweet chilli sauce, add chopped coriander, mix thoroughly and put on rice paper.
Put asparagus shoots on the banana leaf, add rolls and at the end decorate the whole dish with wakame algae, pickled ginger, a slice of mango, sprinkle with black sesame and add a few pine nuts.
Britain must settle for silverware in sevens rugby, Fiji selection takes gold
Great Britain's impressive performance in sevens rugby ended in a devastating finish at the last hurdle, with Fiji beating the British 43-7 in the final on Thursday night at Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.
The Fijians taught a masterful lesson in processing, landfill, evasiveness, support play, line running and brute force - and won gold, their first Olympic medal ever.
The defeat came with an unexisting consolation prize in the form of a silver medal - Britain's third on the day - and the British could be proud of their performances in the inaugural Olympic Sevens Rugby Tournament, beating New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
A hard-earned 7-5 win over the South Africans in the semifinals on the same day may have frozen them in the final.
However, Fiji would beat a 15-man team in full health in their form.
It may not be a consolation for the British, but they can rejoice that at least one of them will have a gold medal around their necks tomorrow: the Fijians' head coach is Ben Ryan, the former England boss at Wimbledon.
Great Britain has come a long way.
Eight years ago, under Ryan, they lost every game in the Adelaide Sevens.
Here they lost only one.
This defeat hurts, but progress is undeniable.
Fiji got off to a spectacular start, reflecting the British intruses for joy.
For captain Tom Mitchell and his teammates, it was like running behind a row of buses in motion, and the World Cup champions led 5-0 when Osea Kolinisau emerged from around the corner.
The timer showed four minutes and Jerry Tuwai added another down on the right wing that converted.
12-0 and Britain barely touched the ball.
The great Mitchel tried to stop the huge Leon Nakarawa and prevent him from scoring for the third time, but only slowed the Fijians down.
In the seventh minute, Jasa Veremalua threw a touchdown into the right corner, and the British were down 17-0.
Nakarawa added another on his return with more than 1 minute left on the clock... from the first half.
Vatemo Ravouvou then broke through the maladid British and rushed to the line, where he scored.
The conversion to make it 29-0 was followed by a break.
It was as if Fiji had been born for Rugby 7s while the British were still learning the handover.
That's exactly how it is.
The British made mass changes after half-time and stopped the Fijians' onslaught... for a full four minutes, which was good compared to the first half, until Josua Tuisova broke through after Fiji's brilliant interplay.
Dan Norton tried to get an opportunity for the Brits, throwing a touchdown into the left corner to make it 36-7. But the match had long since been won by the inhabitants of the Pacific islands, and their fans sang, waved flags and danced in the gallery.
It was hard not to blame the fijians' utterly exudable attitude.
In the closing moments, Mata Viliame sweetened the Fijians' victory with another try.
There was a whistle, the Fijians hugged, and the British fell on the lawn completely overwhelmed.
Earlier that day, Fiji beat Japan 20-5 in the semi-finals, and Great Britain beat South Africa in a tight semi-final - by a difference of one conversion.
Kyle Brown put the South Africans in the lead in the first half, but Dan Norton broke through the defensive line with his dazzling footwork and scored under the hook in the second half.
A brilliant late dump by Marcus Watson, brother of Anthony of the 15-man England team, secured victory - and ultimately a silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning were inspired to win the rowing race by the trainer's battle with cancer
You won't find more emotional gold at these Games - and that's something to say.
From the first shot to the last, during 220 punishing exudations, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found further significance in their golden moment at Estacio de Lagoa.
Although there were two oars, there were three voices in the ship. As the ship squealed across the water for its second consecutive Olympic gold in the women's doubles race, they still had the voice of coach Robin Williams still present. They are the first women in the history of British sport to achieve such an outcome.
Their dominance was absolute, overall it was their 39th race in which they remained unbeated.
What we see - two excellent athletes flying across the water with swan elegance - does not reflect the nature of victory completely.
Behind each gold medal from rowing is a battalion of auxiliary hands, which, piece by piece, make a difference. And no hands were more helpful than the hands of a coach who 30 months ago didn't know if he'd live to see that day when he was diagnosed with cancer.
In his words, it was uncertain.
I had bladder cancer that could be operated on, and I underwent this surgery.
Anything could happen without surgery.
It would be a very bad situation.
It's going to change your perspective a little bit.
Williams was diagnosed with cancer in December 2013.
The luck for the trio was that he could start treatment in early 2014, off-season, and thus reduce the blackout to a minimum - if we can call it that under such circumstances.
I needed to make money, so I had to get my act together fast.
That was the impetus.
I was in the hospital walking around the room - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said a few steps was enough.
That's how it started.
Rowing in itself is a journey, but this was a little more challenging.
Immediately after the victory, their first thoughts were on Williams, who was very nervous this morning, speaking less than usual as he tried to manage his own unease.
Stanning, captain of the Royal Artillery Regiment, which is on a mission in Afghanistan, said: "I've been down with emotions this week, maybe it's a bit extreme, but it means so much."
It highlights once again how much this means to me, how much Helen and I worked, and so did Robin.
Up until now, it's been three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin, we wouldn't be anyone, so he's a huge thank you, he's the best coach in the world.
I couldn't ask for a better person for training or a better coach.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning haven't lost a race in five years.
The pair put on a stunning rhythm that their rivals couldn't match.
Even in the final 500 meters, when crews from New Zealand and Denmark began to approach, Stanning and Glover had a very large margin.
We were as focused as possible at the moment.
Helen was screaming, "Don't stop, don't stop."
It's really important not to get carried away.
We got off to a good start and at the same time we didn't want to achieve anything great.
We weren't looking forward to today's fireworks, we just wanted to row well, go out and win the race, which we did.
The couple will take a year to think about it before deciding what to do next.
Glover is getting married next week, her bride-to-be being is TV adventurer Steve Backshall.
Now he wants to savor the moment.
I didn't mean to say this was going to be my last race.
That would mean too much pressure.
It took about six months in London to find out I was an Olympic champion.
It was all so new and I was so stressed.
It took about four minutes here.
I feel much better about it," she said.

jail?
Rather, let them drive people for free, says taxi-driver Rubes to the break-even indictment.
Six taxi drivers and a former municipal official in Prague are, as reported by ČT, defendants.
You've made a series of stories in which you've uncovered fraudulent practices even for those who are supposed to be in a group that's going to stand trial.
You've faced some unpleasant skirmishes with exposed actors because of it.
How much is the news of the indictment of members of an organized group a break for you?
I was expecting a trial.
I'm mostly curious about the verdict.
But I don't think they should be in jail.
That's no good.
First of all, they should return all the stolen money.
And they should return them by transporting all the people for free.
That's a rather quirky solution.
Does this mean that you do not see any punishment as effective enough?
What's enough for me is that some of them are so scared they don't do the job anymore.
For example, one makes a ping-poo, another delivers pizza, and one totally blows it off.
In theory, defendants can get two to eight years in prison.
Do you think that's an adequate rate?
In general, I have a prison problem.
I consider it a bad punishment.
Arresting someone in prison, especially in that case, is nonsense.
Such people should return the companies that took it.
For a quarter of a century, they've been doing this to destroy our country's name and rudely rob people.
Let them make a good card now and deliver people for free.
I can't imagine it any other way.
It would work as community service.
As someone goes to collect garbage, they would get a car and drive people around Prague for free.
No, I really think they're going to get parole eventually, and they don't care.
They'll find another way to cheat somewhere.
He studied at the Miroslav Ondříček Film Academy in Písek and subsequently at Tomas Bata University in Zlín.
He is one of the people who started with viral videos and videos directly for the web in the Czech Republic.
He works as an editor for internet television Stream.cz, where he participates in a number of programmes, and now prepares the Prague Guide programme, which is intended primarily for foreign viewers.
Rubeš advises them in the form of short reports on which services to avoid in Prague and which, on the contrary, he recommends using them without fear.
He used to shoot a series with the titles How to Do It, City of Deception?, Life in Luxury, And Enough! and Prague vs. Money.
The indictment referred to them as an organized group.
The police have been following her for months.
Can such a network of fraudulent taxi drivers be described as mafia?
They're such cute mobsters, not the kind we know from The Godfather.
They're more like junior mobsters, but they're organized for sure.
Just in that they guard each other's stepladds (taxi stations).
Prague is all dismemed.
I have traced that, for example, the main station does not like Paris, Parisian does not like taxi drivers waiting at Karlovy Vary (disco club)
Everyone just watches their own place, and every group is organized somehow.
It's probably a convoluted network.
But the defendants are only seven people, six taxi drivers and one former magistrate who warned the driver about the checks.
As you say, the undesirable phenomenon has not disappeared from the streets.
So what percentage of Prague taxi scammers do you estimate?
It's a very small percentage.
The worst ones on the street are still there.
I'm talking about Aleš Ryjáček, for example.
This is a man who is really dangerous - he carries a telescopic baton in his car, and every Friday and Saturday he stands by charles bridge and drives people.
Last time I drove with him, he asked me for 700 for three kilometers.
His police didn't stop for some reason.
Only a few people from the whole big group picked out.
However, the situation is the same in other locations in Prague.
Thus, by prosecuting seven people, it is difficult to eradicate prague's already famous schmourd, which seems to have much larger dimensions.
Of course, it's not entirely useless.
It will help, but all evil can't be eradicated, that's true.
Do taxi drivers who steal from foreign tourists still perform in the same places you showed in the reports, i.e. at Charles Bridge or paris street?
Yes, that's right.
In these locations they stand every day and every day they violate the decrees.
This is ignored by both the municipal police and the Prague City Council.
It's not even a cat anymore, but total indifference.
Business of Prague taxi drivers in numbers
Yet some of them, even if it's only part of the group, go to trial.
It's already a breakthrough.
So I have to ask: do you feel satisfaction?
If I took it as satisfaction, it would be wrong, because my goal was, is and always will be, to make the center of Prague better.
And even if I feel like I need to do a little better, I'm going to keep doing it.
You need to push the door from the other side.
Even if the last thief stays there, we should still be doing something to eliminate him.
You can't be satisfied with that.
But it's not like that, of course there are more.
Are you still trying to confront them right in the taxis?
Sometimes I do test drives and I have to say it's still bad.
Just last week, I caught a cab driver, by the way, from the same group, and he was very surprised to see me again.
He charged 560 crowns for three kilometers, although then claimed that it was 56 crowns (he used a decimal trick).
He had a receipt, the police came, and this taxi driver was so cutely rude that he kept going to the cops and asking them when someone was going to give him the 56 crowns.
It's a similar case.
The taxi driver glued a decimal point on the meter and robbed tourists of 357 crowns.
Is it fair to say that the impudence of fraudulent taxi drivers has not subsided even after you have shown in your footage the faces of those who charged meaningless sums for a short ride?
Their insolence is still unbelievable.
What happened to the taxi driver who asked for 56 crowns?
The officers sent him away, saying they couldn't discuss it with him on the spot because he had issued a receipt.
And I think that will be a problem in the court (six taxi drivers and one ex-officer).
There'll be a taxi driver with his receipts on one side, the police on the other.
But according to the decision of the Supreme Administrative Court, the magistrate may not use secret recordings from a taxi service vehicle as evidence in court.
When I was filming episodes about their scams, the cabbies themselves brought this precedent to my attention.
But I've always wanted to use the footage only for the story.
Are you concerned that this fact might protect them from trial?
I hope every judge understands that no taxi driver could drive for six or ten crowns a kilometre because he wouldn't make a living out of it.
You were talking about a decimal trick, which, especially in front of foreign clients, underwater taxi drivers move.
Is it still up-to-date, or are they worried about continuing to use this trick after your stories are published?
I think we've popularized this trick by airing the show.
I was driving with a cab driver the other day, he was in front of me, that he was the honest taxi driver.
But then I noticed black cardboard glued to the side of the meter.
When I asked him what it had in there, he said, "You know what it is."
If fines didn't work too well for fraudsters, can they be warned about being judged by the trial of their colleagues?
Is there anything that can deter them from fraud?
You talked about how you think they'll always find a way to cheat.
I don't think anything can put them off.
But someone can push them out of those places.
And those are fair cabbies who should fight harder to get them out of there.
In my experience, the fair taxi drivers in Prague fortunately prevail.
But do they want to go against those who ruin the reputation of their services?
They taste good, but they lack skill.
They don't know how to walk in it, and they can't say exactly what they want.
When they organized the demonstration (because of the proposal for a nationwide restriction coming from the office of Mayor Adriana Krnáčová), it was not very clear what they wanted.
They once said they didn't protest Uber, that they just wanted to have the same conditions as the service, then they said they wanted more than Uber.
As it turned out, they just blocked Prague and it turned out to be only the best possible advertisement for Uber.
How do you overall assess the approach of the Prague Municipality in solving the problem of overcharging?
It's hard to see that the criminal police had to step in to sort something out.
The magistrate was short on that.
They had a mole that was passing out information, which means that the taxi department had been doing its job for several years for nothing.
I hope they charge the clerk until the last check for all the thwarted checks to make him realize what he's done.
That's what the worst part is.
I even went on one inspection ride with him, which I only found out subsequently from their schedule.
It's been months since the last episodes of the series were published.
What's the response?
I mean, especially with foreign viewers, which is actually the most focused series.
Every time I have friends from abroad, I show them the videos.
And then when we walk down Old Town Square, it's a surprise that the same people in the footage are really standing there.
The infamous Prague celebrities.
But seriously.
I'd put a mold around them so people would look at them.
Museum of Communism right on the street.
My last question is clear.
Do you take a taxi when you need to?
brightly.
I drive with services where I do not have to pay cash, but by card.
I use services like Uber or Liftago where there is no possibility of fraud.
But there are also many dispatchers that are fair.
I've only taken a cab on the street once since.
The driver said to me after getting in the car, "Wow, you've got guts."
A beem disguised as an Italian tourist.
Fraudulent practices of taxi drivers were reported back in 2005.
In the same year, former Mayor Pavel Bém went on a control ride disguised as an Italian tourist, and at the first attempt the driver cheated him by two hundred.
Editor Rubeš had worse experience.
Taxi drivers charged him CZK 820 for driving from the Old Town to Wenceslas Square, which costs about CZK 195 per kilometre, as calculated by the report's creators.
The Prague Municipality set the maximum price at CZK 28 per kilometre.
There are also other surprising sums in the filmed report: for example, the two-kilometre journey from Paris street to Carving street cost a tourist 400 crowns.
Expensive rides were also provided by taxi drivers waiting at Charles Bridge.
They charge even 600 crowns for a ride on Anděl, which has 2.5 kilometers.
Marble is washed mostly with clean water, as much as possible without chemistry and the longer the better.
Dirt from it goes well, although sometimes dirt has to be put down with a scalpel, it needs to be taken out of the folds.
It is not easy and it does not go quickly, said the restorer Vanesa Trostová from Oldřichov in Hajy.
Hats off to her: the tombstone is surrounded by scaffolding, which needs to be climbed and climbed countless times.
"The restorer should be careful, patient and unpretentious to the working environment," she said.
In Frydlantsk, this is far from her first restoration work.
Thanks to it, stone elements of the façade in the rear wing of the Frýdlant Town Hall were restored, and it also restored statues of St. Mary Magdalene in Zátiší, St. John of Nepomuk in Frydlanta, Piet in Frýdlant's Ring Road, Marian Column in Frydlant or the Atlantic in the façade of the spa in Nový Town pod Smrkem.
The restoration of the tombstone of Melchior, Christopher and Kateřina from Redern began in Frydlant already in 2011.
Now the surface of the stone elements is cleaned of dirt and crust, the loose stone parts are secured against falling and shifting; either anchored to the wall or to each other.
They will also be treated and preserved.
The inscriptions on the tomb will be gilded again.
"Then it will begin with gilding of the inscriptions on the marble slabs with pure sliced gold," said Věra Sobotová, a state heritage officer for the Frýdlant Municipal Office.
There are no records from the past of the tombstone going through any repairs.
On closer inspection, the holes drilled in the marble columns will take an interest.
They're hundreds of years old, and they're the remains of a tombstone decoration.
It was richly decorated, unfortunately after the raid of the Swedes during the Thirty Years' War everything disappeared.
They literally combed the tombstone, Sobotka noted.
In the Church of finding the Holy Cross, restorers are at home with a slight exaggeration.
After the flood in 2010, it was necessary to fix the tombstones that were underwater, the baptist's baptismal church, the murals in the tomb and now the tombstone were restored.
"We would also like to start schming in the future," Said Sobotová.
The church is otherwise in very good condition, we put money into maintenance and repairs every year.
Restoration work on the restoration of the Redern tombstone will total CZK 128,000.
They will be covered by subsidies, the city will not put any of its money into this part of the restoration.
One hundred thousand crowns will come from winning the regional round of the Historical City competition in 2015, the remaining CZK 28,000 is a contribution from the Ministry of Culture, said Dan Ramzer, mayor of Frydlant.
The council decided to release the winnings for the restoration of the tombstone.
Opinions of experts on future developments in selected foreign markets monitored through indices and comparison with the Czech capital market (PX) within a period of one month and a half years.
Low volatility and growth prevail in the markets.
Who knew that at the beginning of the year?
The US S&P500 index, which was going through a 12 percent correction in February, is now at a new all-time high, having gained 7 percent since the beginning of the year.
This reaffirms the iron rule that traders should never go against the interest of central banks in the long run, which have always achieved their own.
With US stocks at an all-time high, volatility is disappearing again, currently at its lowest since 2014, when markets rose contentedly and fearlessly thanks to quantitative easing by the US central bank, and when, as now, the Volatility Index (VIX) remained stable below 12 percent.
And that he doesn't.
Although the Fed continues to prepare markets for a gradual rise in interest rates, quantitative easing in europe and Japan is in full swing, and last week the Bank of England, which will buy £70bn of bonds over the next six months, also took a hand.
So a new wave of quantitative easing is pushing already low yields even lower, contributing to an almost complete elimination of risk and fear of the future.
How long will this condition last?
That is, of course, a million-dollar question.
But there are no risks in sight at the moment, the world economy is going through almost constant growth without major fluctuations, the situation in the commodity market and china is stabilising, and Brexit is basically no longer an issue, so we should probably not be too surprised if US stocks continue in a similarly calm regime.
Too bad Juncker doesn't study Klaus!
I am very glad that my friend Michel Barnier has accepted this important and challenging task.
I wanted an experienced politician for this difficult job, said Juncker, the Head of the European Commission, when he appointed a French politician (really experienced, because he had so many different supranational political functions that we would find it difficult to find a better example of the so-called European elite) as the European Commission's chief negotiator on the terms of The United Kingdom's departure from the EU.
Juncker's selection dashed signs of hope that it was in the EU's grave interest to seek forms of future friendly coexistence with Britain.
However, most british media have accepted Barnier's name as a Juncker act of war.
Barnier is a starding European federalist.
He hates Great Britain.
As Commissioner for the Internal Market (2009-2014), he was in charge of reforming European banking law.
He conceived it in a way that only he could: a hardened enemy of the Anglo-Saxon concept of the free market and the model of capitalism.
A proponent of multilateral regulation, he co-authored the concept of a so-called banking union, and with a resentfulness of everything that comes from london's city financial center, he pushed through legislation on excessively tough regulations on the financial sector and services.
So this Michel Barnier, the representative of Paris in the dispute with London, will be a tough, adamant and probably ruthless negotiator.
I don't think that's good news.
In this context, how not to remember the peaceful and friendly division of the Czechoslovak Federation, to which the balance, overview and empathy of Prime Minister Václav Klaus contributed so much.
That is why Czechs and Slovaks can be closest friends and allies today.
It is a pity that Juncker did not learn from Václav Klaus - at least in this one.
It would be for everyone's good!
The earthquake around Putin?
The Kremlin ruler released his loved one Ivanov.
Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday fired Sergei Ivanov as head of the presidential office.
Anton Vajno will take his place.
Russian media reported this, citing an announcement by the Kremlin's press service.
Putin, meanwhile, indicated that he was releasing Ivanov at his own request.
At a meeting broadcast by Rossiya 24, the president said he was accommodating Ivanov's wish when he took office that he wanted to be head of the presidential office for a maximum of four years.
At the same time, he announced that Ivanov would be his special representative for ecology and transport.
The news of the exchange at the head of the president's administration, now led by Ivanov's current deputy Vajno, is considered quite surprising.
Ivanov, who is 63 years old, is described as one of Putin's closest associates.
For example, this former KGB officer has held the positions of Minister of Defence and Deputy Prime Minister in the past.
He will now also leave the seat of a member of the President's Security Council.
But ivanov, in a meeting with Putin, said that the length of his stay at the head of the head of state's administration was actually a record holder.
He lasted four years and eight months.
In this context, he recalled that in the 25 years since its establishment, 11 people have already taken up the post.
Kvitova and Deblists Uncleová and Šafářová will not play in the final.
So far, neither of Friday's tennis matches has been turned into a final appearance.
Petra Kvitova was the first to lose her fight, succumbing to Puerto Rican surprise Monica Puig in sets of 4:4, 6:1 and 3:6.
Kvitova was soon followed by Czech deblists Šafaryvá and Uncleová.
The Williams sisters' slayers reached for a win in the first set, but squandered two set points and the Russians eventually snailed the set in a shortened game.
They then lost the second set 4-6.
Czech rowing scored half the success in the morning program in Rio: skier Ondřej Synek won his semi-final with an overview, defeating the second Damir Martin from Croatia by almost a second despite the slowing down in the end.
Good today, conditions were great, the wind calmed down.
I tried to save as much as I could, Synek said.
It was his opponents, unlike him, who had to fight for promotion.
So it's taken some of their strength away, which could make it easier tomorrow.
But I'm not saying it's going to be easy, it's just playing into my hands, said the rower of Prague's Dukla.
Mirka Topinková-Knapková, however, did not walk in Snyk's footsteps.
The 35-year-old occ skier finished fourth in today's semi-finals and will start in the B final on Saturday and fight for 7th to 12th place.
Gold from London won't be defended that way.
It's not the first time I've made it to the finals at the Olympics.
I'm a little sorry, but on the other hand, I went to a quality race and gave it everything I could.
The opponents were simply better, Topinková Knapková bowed before them.
She fought to the end and believed she could make it into the elite six in her fourth game.
She gave up the fight just before the finish line.
I knew the girls were even, that anyone could come out of that field.
I was surprised the Chinese woman had such a finish.
And I thought I could make it to the finals through the Austrian.
Unfortunately, she went to the race of her life today, said the 2011 world champion.
Far beyond the final gates in Rio remained young shooter Filip Nepejchal, who failed to make it out of qualifying for the second time, this time a small-caliber lie-in.
In it Nepejchal took 33rd place.
Qualifying worked best for the Russians.
Sergei Kamensky moved up from first place with 629 points, while Kirill Grigorjan (628.9) came in second.
Nepejchal's shot was worth 620.5 points.
Athletes, including Czech sevens players Kateřina Cachová and Eliška Klučinová, also spoke for the first time in the program in Rio.
Cachová ranks 11th after the second event of the Olympic competition, czech record holder Eliška Klučinová is 22nd.
She is led by The Briton Katarina Johnson-Thompson, who jumped to a height of 198 centimeters, as well as the second Belgian, Nafissatou Thiam.
Both ensured the best ever altitude performance in the sevens.
They tried to jump 201 centimeters, but they failed.
German, Russian, who's worse?
Apart from the absurdity of the question asked in this way: German society has undergone deep self-reflection, whereas Russian society has not.
In both major Eurasian nations, dictators came to power in the 20th century, and regimes that were inhumane, brutal, and terrible came to power.
From 1917 to 1989, Russia's Bolsheviks contributed largely to the 94 million victims of communism cited in the Black Book of Communism, whether it was daily individual repression, targeted famines, incompetent warfare, or inhuman experiments.
The Nazis wiped out about 6 million Jews in an inhumane manner, and the total sacrifice of World War II is estimated at 60 million.
Both the Germans and the Soviets carried out atrocities in the occupied or deserted territories.
In Germany and the USSR, not only a few individuals were guilty, but a large part of the nation participated in these crimes either actively, passively or only through cowardice or by sticking their heads in the sand.
This is not just the specifics of these peoples, we Czechs are similarly guilty.
In Germany, the denacification, the Nuremberg Tribunal, came immediately after the war ended.
But the most important thing came later.
When the children grew up, they began to ask, "Daddy, Grandfather, why did you participate in such atrocities?"
How could you!
This brought real reflection and curing of society.
Until recently, Germany's elites cared mainly about the country's prosperity, the elimination of poverty, the well-being of their citizens.
Now they have other (often naively idealistic) goals, but they certainly don't want to reconnect Alsa-Lorraine or attack someone - revanch - militarily - perhaps everyone will admit it.
After the Cold War in Russia, there was no great reflection.
The window of possible positive changes finally closed at the turn of the millennium when a former KGB officer (sic!) came to power. Vladimir Putin.
Russia's often criminal past is now celebrated.
The policy of Putin's russia is to revanch, conquer lost territories, humiliate the West.
The health, prosperity and future of our own people is of no value to the faithful.
Beat yours, and strangers will be afraid.
I still believe that it is only those decades of despotic regime that Russians are not genetically or culturally inferior - destined for Asian (self-) tyranny.
Who benefits from rising tensions around Crimea?
Ukrainian army.
In recent days and hours, the situation on the Ukrainian-Russian border in the Crimea region has deteriorated.
Who benefits from rising tensions?
After a prolonged period of relative calm, relations between Ukraine and Russia have deteriorated again.
The pretext of the Ukrainian side was the Crimean peninsula, which was annexed to Russia more than 2 years ago and is part of its territory.
Of course, reports from both opposing sides are at war and are difficult to independently verify, so we only have the opportunity to think about the old familiar question of who is benefiting?
According to reports from Moscow, there have been terrorist attacks on Crimea from the Ukrainian side, which, of course, Ukraine rejects and, on the contrary, accuses the Kremlin of provocation.
Information about the arrest of ukrainian special forces on the territory of Russia was already answered from the case of pilot Savchenko, that they were allegedly kidnapped on the territory of Russia.
If we were to accept the Ukrainian version, how would Russia benefit from the deterioration of the situation around Crimea?
The simple answer is: nothing.
The escalation of tensions around Crimea can only harm Russia, especially from the West, in the form of further sanctions and an intensification of the anti-Russian campaign.
In the last year, against the backdrop of the immigration crisis in Europe, attention has been retreated from the situation in Ukraine.
Ukraine's leadership has already lost its credit to its people, with president Poroshenko's current support hovering around 15%.
Ukraine's economy would have gone bankrupt long ago had it not been for generous financial injections by the EU and, most importantly, the IMF.
In this situation, the Ukrainian regime needs to draw attention to its country once again in order to justify its further requests for financial assistance and to try to improve its resonate in front of voters in its own country.
Once again, President Poroshenko and other members of the leadership of the forces want to prove to be strong men who are not afraid to stand up to a great Russia.
One can only hope that all those who are trying to start an open conflict between Ukraine and Russia will eventually realize their enormous responsibility for the lives of not only soldiers, but all ordinary people on both opposing sides, and stop their hostilities in time.
Bulgaria reports inflation for the first time in eight months
According to national statistics, bulgaria's monthly inflation rate reached 1% in July.
This is the highest in several years (since June 2012) and the first non-zero since October last year, when a positive inflation rate of 0.2% was published.
The annual average inflation rate, as measured by the CPI, over the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016) compared to the previous 12-month period (August 2014 - July 2015) was -0.8%.
The consumer price index in July 2016 was 101.0% compared to June 2016, so monthly inflation was 1.0%.
The inflation rate since the beginning of the year (July 2016 compared to December 2015) was -0.2%, and the annual inflation rate in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -0.2%.
Compared to the previous month, the following consumer goods groups saw an increase in journeys in July 2016: food and soft drinks (1.7%), transport (1.8%), culture and recreation (6.3%), restaurants and hotels (1.2%), other goods and services (0.3%).
Prices fell for clothing and footwear (2.2%), furniture, household equipment and routine maintenance (0.5%), health (0.1%).
Prices for alcoholic beverages and tobacco products, housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, communication and education remained at the same level as the previous month.
U.S. intelligence has reportedly been tracking Russian hacking for a year.
News of the Russian attacks became public last month when the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) announced that it was investigating an attack on the servers of the Democratic party headquarters.
However, there is no official report on Russia's involvement in the attack.
Moscow has denied involvement in the attack.
The surveillance report on the alleged Russian attack was top secret because it would reveal that U.S. intelligence is monitoring the hacking, and the way they do it and what resources they use could also be revealed.
Two Russian intelligence agencies are said to have been involved in the attack.
New Cybersecurity Advisory Council
The material on tracking the Russian trail was encrypted and only a small group of experts had access to it, Reuters reported.
Of the public officials, only a small group of eight congressional leaders, called the Gang of Eight in the US, was informed.
It consists of the heads of both chambers, Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan, the Democratic leaders in both chambers, Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid, and four members of the congressional intelligence and security committees.
Acting Democratic Party Leader Donna Brazile announced Thursday that she is creating a cybersecurity advisory council to "prevent future attacks and ensure first-class protection of Democratic Party servers."
There was a dangerous parasite in the smoked salmon from Albert.
The chain apologized.
On the basis of the consumer's suggestion of health problems after eating the food Salmon wild smoked - pieces 100 g, expiration date 22.11.2016, Prague health inspectors carried out a check at albert stores on Wenceslas Square and On the Bridge.
The inspection found that batch L23012562/T4 with a use-by date of 22.11.2016, which was brought to the customer's attention, was no longer available and therefore a product of the same batch with the use-by date of 11.12.2016 was removed.
Laboratory examination confirmed the presence of Anisakis spp. Anisakis simplex.
It is a parasitic worm of the digestive tract of marine mammals.
This is dangerous for humans - larvae in the body cavity or muscles of fish are a strong allergen, and man-made living larvae can penetrate through the gastric wall into the internal organs, Šticha said.
We are very sorry to customers for the problems with this branded product.
We immediately withdrew the batch from sale and, as a precautionary measure, we also withdrew all other batches of this item.
The misconduct occurred on the part of the supplier we are dealing with and at the same time we had this product tested ourselves, Albert spokeswoman Barbora Vanko told News.
If a customer has purchased this product, they can return it in any of the chain's stores and get a refund.
Larvae destroy frost and sufficient heat treatment
The seller was Nekton - Vrňata.
Health officials informed the Prague and Central Bohemian veterinary administrations about the presence of a dangerous product.
According to bezpecnostpotravin.cz, people may become ill with anisakiosis after insureing the parasite, which will manifest itself in severe abdominal pain, vomiting and nausea, or the disease may occur without symptoms, ČTK reported.
Symptoms occur an hour to two weeks after eating an insufficiently heat-treated infected fish.
After three weeks from the onset of the disease, the larvae usually spontaneously leave the digestive tract.
Adult worms and larvae are sensitive to both higher and low temperatures, therefore they are killed either with sufficient heat treatment of fish meat or when it is frozen.
Veterinarians have currently checked the salmon with the recipient of imported goods in the Central Bohemian Region.
Three of the five samples examined had a parasite in them.
The shipment of 1700 products came to the Czech Republic according to the State Veterinary Administration (JRC) at the beginning of April.
Exported, overwhelmingly to the Ahold chain, there have been 919 packs to date.
Currently, unsold stocks of the product are being with downloaded from stores, SVS spokesman Petr Pejchal told ČTK on Friday.
Veterinarians immediately after finding positive samples prohibited the sending of other products from the warehouse.
A 17-year-old British woman wanted to flee Raqqa, apparently killed by a Russian airstrike.
After the initial enthusiasm and quick marriage to the jihadist, who was soon killed, sobering came.
The expected paradise of the caliphate has turned into hell on earth for British girls, from which there was no escape.
According to relatives, the girl was in contact with her sister Halima.
She phoned her repeatedly to Britain and confided that she wanted to go back home.
Leaving the Islamic State is like trying to flee Alcatraz.
They are ordered to shoot in no time, The Telegraph quotes the late girl's family lawyer Tasnim Akunjee as saying.
The last traces led to Raqqa, from where the girl made her last call.
Then came the news of her death, which cannot be verified.
The family communicated with her from an east London flat.
Together they discussed how she could get out of Raqqa and cross the Turkish border.
There they hoped to reunite with the former student.
But Kadiza was probably killed before she could escape because the house she was in was flattened by an airstrike in May, Britain's ITV News reported.
The network added that the bomb was apparently dropped by a Russian plane attacking an IS stronghold in Syria.
You could take the blue from the sky just to get your child out of a dangerous area, said Tasnim Akunjee, the family's lawyer.
In the week that (Kadiza) was thinking about fleeing Islamic State territory, an Austrian woman was captured trying to escape and was reportedly publicly beaten to death.
I think she (Kadiza) interpreted it as a warning and decided not to take any chances, says Akunjee, according to the BBC.
The family would do anything.
Kadiza Sutlana, along with her 15-year-old school friends Shamima Begum and Amira Abas, set off on February 17 last year.
All they said at home was they were going out.
But they headed for Gatwick Airport and from there via Turkey into IS-controlled territory.
According to the lawyer, the girl's family did everything in their power to get Kadisa back.
You could take the blue of the sky just to get your child out of a dangerous area, and this family did everything they could, stretching out all their strength to get their daughter home.
But it was not possible without risking being caught themselves, the lawyer added.
The only positive, he says, is that Kadisa's fate may serve as a deterrent to other girls or even boys who are being tricked by Islamist propaganda.
"There are many cases where people have gone there, they have realised how things are there, they have understood how far this is different from the promises of Islamic State propaganda, and they wanted to go back," Akunjee said.
The fate of Kadizia's classmates is unknown.
But since they have also paused, their families must accept that they are most likely dead.
To prison for money.
In Scotland, you can go to jail without committing a crime.
For many centuries, the village of Inveraray was the regional centre and seat of the Duke of Argyll.
From the middle of the 18th century, courts were held at the town hall and the basement under the hall served as a local prison.
The conditions in which the convicts resided were deplorable, and many prisoners tried to escape.
A lot of them have been successful.
That's why city officials decided to move the prison premises to a new location.
The new building was completed in 1848 and was much more prisoner-friendly, with heating and gas lighting.
Either way, it was not in operation for a long time, it was closed for economic reasons at the end of August 1889, because smaller correctional facilities were expensive to operate and did not pay much.
Convict stories and ghost hunts.
The prison opened to the public a century later, visitors can compare the old building with the new one to see for themselves how different the conditions were.
Guides in period costumes enhance the authentic experience.
There is also a torture room where visitors can learn what forms of punishment were applied to criminals, whether it was breaking fingers or burning body tags.
As part of the tour, tourists can be locked in one of the cells, mostly for a souvenir photo, or to feel the feeling experienced by prisoners behind bars.
In addition, Inveraray Prison is one of Scotland's most famous haunted sites.
Several groups of paranormal hunters have already gone there, and to this day the museum allows people to come and hunt some ghosts.
However, such a night costs £300, which is roughly 9,500 crowns.
In addition to this popular tourist attraction, the villages also attract great food, surrounding panoramas and history.
"Animé" effect on Snapchat is criticized as an Asian caricature
According to Snapchat, this filter is inspired by an animé, but some observers say it is racially insensitive.
The Snapchat app allows about 150 million users every day to change reality and toy with identity in ways that border on absurdity.
You can make yourself a pineapple, a dog or a character that looks like it came out of a Roy Lichtenstein painting.
Filters are simple tools that distort reality and generate over 30 million enhanced selfies every day.
Any error will be made public immediately.
Snapchat filters have earned criticism in the past, with accusations that the app promotes blackfacing or that it promotes white skin tone as an ideal of beauty.
So when she offered users a filter this week that left them with slanted eyes, crooked teeth and puffy cheeks, some critics called it a racist caricature of Asians - "yellowface."
And they asked if these repeated contentious issues point to a larger problem for society - the diversity problem.
On Wednesday, Verge and Motherboard wrote about it, and news and outrage quickly spread, and Snapchat said the next day that it had canceled the feature.
The company offered an explanation: The filter was intended as a manifestation of the accounts to the characters of the cartoon, not as a caricature of Asians.
But to observers who witnessed racism, the filter reminded them of painful stereotypes in action.
Others, bluntly, rejected the comparison to the animé.
Grace Sparapani, an American art student from Korea whose tweet about the photos was widely shared, said in an email that the filter was "harmful and embarrassing to say the least."
She added that "it's hard to argue against comparing the obvious Asian caricathus with the effects of the filter.
It turns out that the filter is not only about the yellowface, but that the yellow face is dragged to a contemptuous extreme.
Snapchat is not the only company that has crossed these cultural limits.
American culture seems to have an endless struggle for diversity and inclusion, from meeting rooms in corporations to Holywood and the devices we all carry in our hands.
And the huge number of young people on Snapchat - who are more racially diversified than their older partners - can mean that even more sensitivity can be expected.
"When one Snapchat filter creates an image that's offensive to some users," Katie Zhu, 25, said in an interview Thursday, "it's very hard to go unnoticed these things today, like they used to."
Katie Zhu, a product manager and designer who works for Medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account on Thursday and urged others to do the same.
In an article for Medium and in a phone interview, she said she believes racially motivated issues reflect a lack of diversity in Snapchat hiring.
Katie Zhu criticized the predominantly white, all-male leadership of the company, and ended the article with a hash tag: #DeleteSnapchat.
"It's either that they have no diversity and people of color when these things are decided," said Zhu, who is of Sino-American descent, "or people of color work there, but not in positions to feel safe or comfortable to speak."
Other observers share her opinion - a complaint that Snapchat has largely left unsued.
The company does not publish figures regarding the diversity of its employees, on the basis that it has the status of a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat declined to talk about the racial origins of its employees, but according to a spokesman, the company recently hired a recruiter to focus on underrepresented populations and internal inclusion management.
Zhu adds, "I wonder if they really need other users like that who can say it's not okay," adding that their account will remain closed.
Army officers misrepresented INTELLIGENCE on IS, says parliamentary committee
In a report released Thursday, a parliamentary committee said that officers from U.S. Central Command were changing intelligence reports to paint a more optimistic picture of the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than the events of the country provided.
According to a preliminary report by a task force compiled by the Republican chairman of the Armed Services Committee, the Intelligence Committee, and the Defense Subcommittee, there was "widespread dissatisfaction" among Central Intelligence analysts that their superiors were changing their assessment of America's efforts to defeat the Islamic State.
Central Command, known as CentCom, is the army's central command in Tampa, Florida, which oversees U.S. military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
A press release on the report said: "Intelligence reports approved by Centcom's senior officers typically offered a more positive picture of US counterterrorism efforts than confirmed by facts on the ground, and were consistently more positive than those obtained from other parts of the intelligence community."
"What happened at Centcom is unacceptable - our fighters are damaged when a flawed analysis is presented to senior policymakers," said Ken Calvert, a Congressman and Republican from California.
Centcom's leadership failures reach to the top of the organization.
The 10-page report details the continuing problems of the Central Staff in describing and analyzing U.S. efforts to train Iraqi forces in 2014 and 2015.
While there is no decisive evidence that top Obama administration officials ordered the reports to be amended, the report said analysts felt they were under pressure from Centcom leaders to present a more optimistic view of the danger posed by the Islamic State, or IS.
"In the first half of 2015, many of the central staff press releases, statements, and congressional testimony were significantly more positive than what the events actually were," the report states.
For example, a Centcom official has publicly stated that a major military offensive to retake Mosul could begin as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city, remains under Islamic State control.
"This is very clear after months of investigation," Rep. Mike Pompeo, A.D., A.D., said in a statement.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, top U.S. Intelligence Officials manipulated the outputs of the intelligence services of the joint chiefs of staff in order to downplay the dangers of IS in Iraq.
Republicans formed a task force after learning of analysts' concerns that intelligence information related to the Islamic State was being manipulated.
The report, published on Thursday, must be followed by a more detailed investigation.
Centcom's intelligence services are conducting yet another investigation led by the Department of Defense's inspector general.
On Thursday, Democratic members of the Intelligence Committee released their own findings, which were consistent with some of the conclusions of the Republican task force.
"Between 2014 and 2015, Centcom created a very narrow process for compiling assessments of information about IS and Iraqi security forces," Representative Adam B. Schiff, chairman of the Committee and a representative of the Democrats, said in a statement.
In The Words of Adam Schiff, this process "led to a distortion of intelligence output," damaged morale among analysts, and "insufficiently took into account dissenting views."
However, Schiff and the Democrats say they have found no evidence that the White House was trying to pressure Centcom analysts to adjust their conclusions to "the draft or the political situation."
The preliminary results of the parliamentary inquiry were published in the Daily Beast on Tuesday.
Last August, the New York Times reported on an ongoing investigation by the Pentagon's inspector general, which was launched following complaints from Centcom analysts.
Cmdr.-Lieutenant Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, said in a statement that the Department of Defense would not comment on the parliamentary report because the inspector general's investigation is still ongoing.
But he said that "experts sometimes disagree on the interpretation of complex data, and that the intelligence community and the Department of Defense welcome healthy dialogue on these fundamental national security issues."
The investigation has implications beyond the question of whether the US-led bombing campaign in Iraq and Syria is a success (a statement now claimed by a growing number of defense officials).
However, last year's accusations raised question marks about the extent to which President Obama can rely on the Central Staff to honestly assess military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria, and other crisis sites.
Criticism of intelligence coverage of the Islamic State has reflected conflicts for more than a decade, with Centcom intelligence analyst Gregory Hooker writing a research paper that said President George W. Bush's administration - despite the objections of many analysts - defended a small unit in Iraq and devoted little time to thinking about what would happen next in the 2003 invasion.
Hooker also played a key role in opposing Islamic State intelligence services.
Last year, authorities announced that Hooker's team had concluded that despite public statements to the contrary, air strikes against Islamic State refineries had not significantly weakened the terrorist group's financial resources because the group had built temporary refineries and sold oil on the black market.
The Times reported in September that the findings had not been passed on outside the central staff.
Centcom's commander, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was then criticized last year after many lawmakers found the Senate testimony too positive in its assessment of the war.
General Austin resigned in April and was replaced at Centcom by Gen. Joseph L. Votel.
The U.S. won field hockey for the fourth game in a row, so today will be the deciding match for Team Great Britain.
Katie Bam scored three goals in a 6-1 victory against Japan, and just a day later scored the first two goals of a match in which America beat India 3-0 on Thursday.
Five wickets in two matches is a success worth remembering, but Bamova (27) said she wasn't sure she'd ever succeeded in doing anything like this.
"I have no idea," she said.
I'm not one of those people who writes down their goals.
But here's what he knows: The Americans lead the Olympics 4-0 and share first place in the group with Great Britain, who remained undefeated on Thursday after a 2-0 defeat by Japan.
Great Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the final match of the first round.
Both teams have qualified for the quarter-finals and the match will decide which of the six teams finishes first and who finishes second.
The first-place team will avoid the strong Danes, who are at the top of the second group, a little longer.
Whatever the end of Saturday's match, the Americans caused a stir here with their surprise ride, four years after they finished among the 12 teams at the London Games.
Bam was on that team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and first picked up a field hockey stick when she was 3 years old (her older twin sisters played in Drexel) and joined the national team when she was 16 and became his youngest player ever.
She missed the 2008 Olympics because she didn't make the final roster.
Then came 2012, when neither she nor her teammates did very well.
The next year, Englishman Craig Parnham was appointed coach and things started to change.
"Cultural change, mental change, physical change," Bam said.
We didn't have the pace of work in London that we have today.
We made a complete U-turn.
On Thursday night, Bamova opened the scoring in the first half with a close-range goal.
India entered the match without a tournament victory, but the team proved surprisingly tough and held a 1-0 lead until the end of the third quarter when Bam took the opportunity.
She escaped down the left side of the field, then clicked through to center and scored the ball into the net to give the Americans a 2-0 lead.
Melissa Gonzalez added the final goal midway through the fourth quarter.
The elimination of American goalkeeper Jackie Briggs, who helped to one goal in each of her three victories, was the first ever in the tournament.
He's in great shape.
Just like Bam.
"We're in a good place now," Parnham said, but how good it is will depend on the outcome of Saturday's game.
Zen trampolines in the midst of olympic fury
It doesn't matter where you are, no matter what time it is - it's the Olympics.
The events in Rio de Janeiro make you feel a persistent, indescribable and biased alternation of competition and effort.
It's how the Olympic torch itself would be a hot relay pin, handed over from a archer to a swimmer, a gymnast and a triathlete.
You can't turn on the TV, read the paper, or listen to your neighbor's conversation in line at the café without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the animosity between Michael Phelps and Chad le Close.
And then there's Logan Dooley.
Dooley, the upcoming darling of women with dimp faces, is at the Olympics for the first time and could also be among those whose names will be heard in prime-time homes between commercials and sponsor spots if he were a swimmer, gymnast or even a swordsman.
But Dooley (28) of Lake Forest, California, is fighting for Olympic gold in trampoline jumps.
The Olympic fire doesn't shine the same on all competitions.
Away from the center, a little shaded are sports that are not universally recognized: shooting air pistols, archery, badminton, taekvondo.
We will always have success in the classic swimming style - and it will probably rule for a long time.
But if I may name my extraordinary favorite, let me draw attention to the inconspicuous charm of the trampoline.
While trampoline jumps have been an Olympic sport since they were first shown at the Sydney Games in 2000, after 16 years of intervention, the sport has remained almost unnoticed - many of the people I interviewed didn't even know it was an Olympic sport.
It may be regional indifference.
The USA never won a medal in trampoline jumps, and until 2012 none of the athletes even made it to the finals.
Awards in the male category are usually divided between China and Russia, and in the women's category between China and Canada.
This year, dong dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will be hugging the gold medals from London.
But trampoline jumps are even more unlucky, partly because the unedued's eye will seem more suited to clown college than to the Olympics.
I have to admit, I'm not an expert, but just an enthusiast watching from the ground.
It has comic potential - comic vibrations of endless bouncing - but also the grace of gymnastics and diving, two sports it combines.
The word "trampoline" is derived from the Spanish "el trampoline", which means "jump board."
Aspiring champions jump on a huge trampoline that shoots them up to nearly 10 meters high and performs assemblies with several elements (flips, screws and combinations) before finally landing on their feet again.
According to the official Olympic program, they are rated according to execution, difficulty and "air time".
Thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women will compete in Rio.
The usual trajectory of the Olympic track is forward.
Gold medal fighters have to go further, faster and higher, sometimes to the end, sometimes back and forth, up and down.
They are trying to catch up not only with the finish line or the starting wall, but, as the tv news reports state, also another imaginary line: a world or Olympic record.
This unanimous effort is noble, admirable, a little fanatical - and enough to bring the audience to tears.
But I think it's also a little exhausting when you watch the Olympics.
Jumps on a trampoline in this regard bring relief.
The track of an athlete on a trampoline is upwards.
The point is not to move forward.
He or she bounces as if they were in a weightless state like astronauts, flying up, then down, and then effortlessly up again.
Without competition and, of course, difficulty, it is impossible, but for the duration of the set-up there is no fierce struggle to reach the goal, no distance measurement, but only a perfect, graceful stretch of time and gravity.
This is the closest the Olympics and Zen will ever come.
The women's qualifiers and finals take place on Friday afternoon, at 1pm Eastern time, and the men's competition on Saturday at the same time.
NBC will broadcast the finale as part of an afternoon block that begins both days at 2 p.m.
In the midst of olympic madness, they promise quiet, pleasant moments that you will probably miss through other fights.
And if the only way to get attention is for male athletes to be the subject of love looks and materialization - as USA Gymnasts recently suggested, according to the Wall Street Journal - then Logan Dooley is just waiting for his new fans to gasp.
"Protesting generation" in Ethiopia, a longtime U.S. ally
Violent protests in Ethiopia
Demonstrators demanding political change in Ethiopia have encountered violent opposition from the government.
Witnesses say many protesters were shot during clashes with police.
Is there a war in Ethiopia?
Over the past decade, it has been one of the most stable nations in Africa, a solid Western alliance with a rapidly growing economy.
But in recent months, the country has been engulfed in anti-government unrest, spreading to more and more areas.
In the last week or so, thousands of people have taken to the streets demanding major political changes.
According to human rights organizations, the government's response has been ruthless.
Witnesses say police shot and killed crowds of unarmed protesters.
Circulating video footage of the protests, believed to date back to late last year or early this year, shows security forces beating young people with sticks after being forced to stand against a wall on their hands.
The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights is now calling for a thorough investigation.
"It has always been difficult to keep this country together and to move forward will be even harder," said Rashid Abdi, horn of Africa project manager for the International Crisis Group.
Ethiopia is the second most populous nation in Africa after Nigeria, and its stability is supported by the West.
U.S. military and intelligence services are working closely with Ethiopians to eliminate the danger of a terrorist attack in the region, particularly Somalia, and few African countries, if any, receive such assistance from the West.
Ethiopia's economy was developing at an impressive pace.
Its infrastructure has improved significantly - there is even a new suburban train in the capital Addis Ababa.
And the streets of the city are typically quiet, safe and clean.
But Ethiopia can hardly be described as a model of democracy - human rights organizations constantly talk about government repression - the opposition in the country has been suppressed, dissidents effectively silenced.
Many were banished, imprisoned, killed or driven far into the desert.
However, this may change.
"When you suffocate people and they have no choice but to protest, there will be a break," said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer at the University of Central Ethiopia.
All the youth are protesting.
A whole generation is protesting.
There are many complaints, relatinging to everything from land disputes to absolute control of the power of the ruling coalition.
After last year's elections, which were widely criticized, the ruling party and its allies won the last seat held by the opposition and now control 100 percent of parliament.
At the same time, pressure is mounting on the border with Eritrea. The conflict along this imprecisely marked, disputed border claimed hundreds of lives in June.
Anylitists fear that separatist groups that have been more or less suppressed in recent years, such as the Orom Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, may try to exploit the turmoil and re-arm themselves.
There are several factors that explain why, now, after years of smoldering beneath the surface, these bitter feelings have re-insummered.
The first one is seemingly harmless: smartphones.
Many Ethiopians can communicate via social networks only in the last few years, when cheaper smartphones have become widely available and internet service delivery has improved.
And even if the government bans access to Facebook or Twitter, as is commonly the case, especially during protests, many people can still communicate via internet proxy to hide the location of these people.
Several young Ethiopians spoke of how they had gathered for protests.
There is also greater solidarity between the Oromas and the Amhars, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia.
The Oroms and Amhars are not natural allies.
For ages, the Amhars, mostly from the Christian hills of Ethiopia, excelled in politics and trade, using oromas, many of whom are Muslims and live in the lowlands.
But that's changing, too.
"We are on our way to unified leadership," said Mulatu Gemechu, leader of the Oroms.
The largest protests took place in areas occupied by Amhara and Oroma.
Many Amhars and Oroms believe that Ethiopia is unjustly dominated by members of the Tigray ethnic group, which makes up about 6 percent of the population and controls the military, intelligence, trade, and politics.
The third cause of unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.
Zenawi, a former rebel leader, was Ethiopia's prime minister for 17 years until his death in 2012, when he succumbed to an unlisted illness.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could see around the corner.
Analysts say he has been particularly masterful in detecting early signs of dissatisfaction, using envoys to process opponents and win over him.
"The current regime lacks basic knowledge," said Abdi, a conflict analyst.
Ethiopia's new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, has been pulled from relative disrena veils to replace Zenawi.
Unlike Zenawi, who came from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Hailemariam comes from the south.
Analysts say he has no confidence in the Security Services controlled by the Tigers.
Many fear that the result will be further blood shedding.
The last time Ethiopia experienced such unrest was in 2005, when thousands protested against what analysts described as elections that the government had stolen and then stolen.
A crackdown ensued, during which many protesters were killed - though less so than in recent months - and this period of unrest passed relatively quickly.
Development experts praised Ethiopia's leaders for visionary infrastructure planning, such as a new suburban train and measurable progress in combating poverty.
But it is quite clear that this has not stopped the gradual increase in disputes within the Ethiopian government.
And there is dangerous ethnic formation.
Last month, protesters in the Amhari city of Gondar attacked Ttigrejci-owned businesses, and resentment against the Tigers on social media became increasingly common.
Analysts say the protests put the US and other Western allies in an awkward position.
The U.S. government is using Ethiopia as a base for drone strikes over neighboring Somalia, although it recently said the base had been closed.
While the West clearly wants to promote democracy, it also does not want its ally to fall apart in an already volatile region.
"That," Abdi said, "is a very sharp edge of the blade."
Donald Trump explains his statement on Obama and IS funding as "sarcasm"
Donald J. Trump on Friday tried to downplay the latest controversy engulfing his campaign by saying he didn't mean it when he insisted several times this week that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the "founders" of the terrorist group Islamic State.
The explanation raised new questions about the Republican presidential nominee's ability to speak clearly to the American public.
It also puts his supporters in an awkward position, who have defended him vigorously during the turbulent times and must explain that he may not have meant his remarks.
After that proposal at a meeting On Wednesday night, Trump confirmed the statement on Thursday, insisting in interviews that he did not really intend to say that the President and Mrs Clinton had created IS.
But in a Twitter post Friday morning, Trump said he was merely being sarcastic.
The post was the opposite of a statement just a day ago, when Trump said in several interviews that he was serious about his accusations.
When conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt tried to help Trump soften his remark by reminding him that Obama was seeking to destroy IS, the Republican presidential nominee did not respond.
The latest storm comes as Trump has tried to focus his campaign's attention on the economy, while his poll preferences are declining.
Trump and Clinton took part in a duel on economic issues in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Trump tried to get back on the subject.
On Twitter, he again warned that Clinton's proposals were linked to tax increases, saying that he thought her speech was boring.
Trump has used sarcasm defenses before.
At the end of July, when he received a wave of criticism when he came forward with a suggestion that the Russians should hack Into Clinton's emails, he later explained his remark by saying, "I'm sarcastic, of course."
This approach allows Trump to push the boundaries of political statements and moderate them as needed.
"I think it's his way of testing the extent to which some of the messages resonate with his supporters to see how they react, and then "explain" them one way or the other," said Ruth Sherman, a communications specialist who followed the language used by both candidates.
But I also think he is skilful in his statements and knows that they are vague enough to be explained differently.
As polls continue to fall in his favor, Trump has taken an even more snuffly tone in recent days, instead of moderating things for the general electorate.
A new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist poll released Friday showed Tump well behind Clinton in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado, and well behind her in Florida.
Trump tries to avoid apologies for the provocative statements he says, but often accuses his critics of misinterpreting his words or misunderstood his sense of humor.
But as Trump faces increased attention in the final months of the presidential campaign, Trump's jokes have put his loyal supporters, who must stand behind him publicly, no matter how provocative his remarks.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former mayor of New York City who is one of Trump's most emousted supporters, had to defend the candidate extensively in an interview with CNN on Thursday.
"I think what he's saying is a legitimate political commentary," Giuliani said when asked about the veracity of Trump's claim that Obama and Clinton founded the Islamic State.
That's true in the sense that before Obama, IS was almost unknown, a small organization that he quite erroneously called a newcomer. And it happened because he withdrew his troops from Iraq.
Most mainstream Republicans are trying to argue that the Obama administration, in which Clinton served as secretary of state, allowed IS to ramp up and not be able to handle the situation in the Middle East aggressively.
Before Friday's rallies in Pennsylvania, Trump continued to fire the media around him on Twitter for moving every word he said and being biased against him.
He laughed at the "pathetic, pathetic" TV pundits who were trying to understand him and said, "They can't do that!"
Several Democrats sneered at Trump's apology, saying it was just more proof that he was unfit for the presidency.
The café was pushed out of the market by prices. Now returns in Greenpoint
Verb Cafe was a shabby place in Williamsburg where you could only pay cash, without Wi-Fi, but where coffee had been served for 15 years.
Naturally, she was pushed out of the façade of a bedford avenue house.
Soap Cherie - the store that Verb replaced in the summer of 2014 - sells cupcake-shaped soaps.
Locals mourned it as the last loss of a sprawling city.
Artist Molly Crabapple tweeted: "New York is a change, I know, but I still can't believe CBGB is dead, chelsea hotel ransacked and Verb is now a soap shop."
But if New York is a change, it's also a rediscover.
The resurrected Verb Cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of its original location.
The new Verb has wifi and accepts credit cards, but some of the original staff work there and there is a similar, modest atmosphere.
Also the coffee is still good.
The manager of the new Vertbo is Cisco Rodriguez, a longtime employee of the original café, who is also the owner and CEO of the new place.
He started in Verb in 2001 and stayed until the end.
When one of the customers offered to pay for the move to a new location, he said he would be happy to do so.
Rodriguez (36) left a lot of things as they were.
Verb still has the same pastry supplier and bought the same model of espresso machine.
He even reused the lighting from old Vertbu.
But Rodriguez said he also wanted to try something new.
He started using new ingredients.
The menu includes ham, egg and cheese sandwiches and toppings such as capers and fried onions.
There are also bowls of brown rice.
The café no longer serves beer, but offers fresh fruit juices.
After nine months, Rodriguez noticed a steady influx of original regulars.
"Many of the original customers also had to move out of Williamsburg because of the prices," he said.
Last Sunday, there was one of those customers, Rebecca Oliveira.
Mrs Oliveira (34) lived in Williamsburg and went to the Verb Cafe often.
It even came when the café moved to Greenpoint.
She said that when Verb closed, she stopped drinking coffee for a while.
"I've found that what I like is coffee and culture in Ve verbo," she said.
Now she's drinking coffee again, but on that day she had a mixed chai instead of her usual iced coffee, another novelty.
Tom Rosenthal, another longtime customer, has been a devotee of Vern since 2003.
You go before work and always order the same thing.
"At quarter and eight every day, like clockwork, I come here and they're preparing my bun for me with everything and butter," he said.
Photo: Rodriguez said he wanted to try something new and add new ingredients to the menu.
Mr. Rosenthal continues to order what he usually does, but sometimes he gets bacon, eggs and ham on his bun with everything.
Rodriguez said he's not sorry the soap store took up his old job.
The truth is that soap cherie's owners offered to make a special soap for Verb and use filtered coffee from the café as an ingredient.
"I think we could still use it," Rodriguez said.
The traditional Polish residents of Greenpoint also received the café well.
One of the new customers translated the offer into Polish, and Rodriguez said he wanted to find a place to put it on display soon to make his new neighbors feel at home.
The new place has other advantages.
A local fruit juice maker wants to bottle and sell filtered coffee.
There is an opportunity for the café to expand into the adjacent building.
Many customers are sufficient to get their old favorite back.
Joseph Whitt was a regular, and when the café closed, he said it broke his heart.
Mr. Whitt says that when the café reopened, coming in and having coffee was like coming home.
"I missed the smell," he said.
Depressing food from the time of crisis - in the "Square Meal"
Shortly after taking office in March 1933, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat in the Oval Office having lunch.
Gourmet President Roosevelt enjoys selected 5th Avenue dishes, such as goose-y pâteau and Maryland turtle soup.
But his menu for the day was more modest: deviled eggs in tomato sauce, potato puree and plum pudding for dessert.
"It was an act of culinary solidarity with the people who suffered," Jane Ziegelman said.
Her husband, Andrew Coe, added, "It was also a message to Americans about how to eat."
The couple, who live in Brooklyn Heights, are dedicated to gastronomic history.
Andrew Coe's latest book, "Chop Suey," was about Chinese cuisine in America, while Jane, in her book "97 Orchard," tells the life story of a residential building on the Lower East Side through food.
Their new joint work, "A Square Meal," which Harper will publish on Tuesday, is the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression.
They showed their culinary solidarity and met with a reporter for dinner at Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a small austere buffet in the Flatiron district that has been in operation since the crisis, since 1929.
Jane (54) ordered cream cheese and a chopped olive sandwich, Andrew (57) had turkey, mashed potatoes and mixed vegetables.
The reporter ordered a meatball, which according to the couple was perfect for talking about food during the crisis.
"Meatballs were very popular," Ms. Ziegelman said.
Peanut, liver and bean meatballs were sold.
They were made from the admixxation and other cheap foods that set the ingredient.
Imagine the amount of peanuts you'd have to eat for dinner.
Andrew Coe grinned.
"They'd be like lead in your stomach," he said.
In the years before the crisis, American cuisine, especially in rural areas, was served buffet-style with what you eat.
Teams of women cooked for farm workers, and freshly baked cake was served for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
It was the Americans who sent food to starving Europeans during World War I. "A Square Meal" tracks the way the nation dealt with the fact that it was suddenly not a land of abundance.
"It was a time when food became a focal point, a feared point for the American people," Coe said, explaining why he and his wife decided to write about it.
Equally feared was the new budget diet: Mysterious foods such as meatballs and casserard dishes spread, casserles as "an amazing way to take advantage of leftovers," Ziegelman noted, because chefs could hide unaesthetic ingredients under a layer of cream sauce.
Fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dried fruit.
Meat - for years the focal point of American food - has become an austerity luxury.
Strange mixtures, which were supposed to serve as a caloric and nutritional filler, took precedence over taste or even common sense when cooking.
During her research for the book, which contains recipes, Ms. Ziegelman prepared a period dish of baked onions filled with peanut butter.
"It wasn't a popular addition to the dinner table," Andrew Coe said.
Jane Ziegelman emphasized, "It was surreal."
Peanut butter with baked onions doesn't go together.
It was typical of a lot of homemade recipes.
Like never before and never since, domestic economists - among them Louise Stanley, the head of the Federal Bureau of Domestic Economics from 1923 to 1943 - have driven the country's eating habits.
They published recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, called on women to take the reins of the budget, and transformed schnausts such as creamy spaghetti and carrots into tasty dishes.
The book "A Square Meal" is a celebration of historical aches.
In particular, desserts were created in the government's response to its hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover's "I'll have a cake" pose.
While publicly praising the simple Iowa farming cuisine of his childhood, he was dining as the chosen millionaire he became.
"He liked to eat continental cuisine, like fish with cucumber sauce," Andrew Coe said.
He ate in an almost gilded room, wearing a tuxedo.
He was incredibly old-fashioned.
President Roosevelt would probably have made the same mistake if his wife Eleanor hadn't made him set an example on his own stomach.
As the book tells it, Mrs. Roosevelt hired a housekeeper who wasn't interested in taste at all. This led to the White House "not only served almost the most subdued food in all of Washington, but also prepared in the most disassure way."
Many of the crisis-era eating habits subsided as soon as the country got back on its feet.
The legacy has remained in our constant exploration of calories and nutritional values, says Ms. Ziegelman, and in the way science is applied to cooking.
The couple say that while writing the book, they better understood the eating habits of Ms. Ziegelman's mother - for example, why she couldn't throw away food.
"She was really worried about wasting food," Andrew Coe said.
Ziegelman recalled, "People were sick of her."
There's been an accident with the soothsayers.
When the tables were clean at Eisenberg's, she and Mr. Coe pulled out a dessert they had prepared at home: a plum dessert that President Roosevelt ate for lunch.
"It's called plum cream," Ziegelman said, adding that the usual trick was to give modest recipes elegant names.
There was no cream, just plums, a little flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Everyone reluctantly buried the spoon in a thick brown mass.
Surprisingly, it was wrong.
Andrew Coe added, and then one more time.
And as a proper householder, he said to his wife, "We could use a little meatcrow."
Europeans: Migrants go for benefits.
Most of the refugees pouring into Europe come for economic reasons.
Young Russians make fun of themselves.
This is what tv shows would look like if we did them.
A group of Russian artists who call themselves 2D Among Us make fun of their native country.
Using Photoshop, he creates collages that humorously show what it would look like if famous series and movies were shot in Russia.
Gilead is entitled to reimbursement of legal costs in the hepatitis C patent case against merck
A district court judge ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to reimbursement of attorneys' fees incurred in its lawsuit over a hepatitis C patent against drugmaker Merck &Co Inc.
In June, a ruling that Gilead was to pay $200 million in damages for violating two Merck patents related to Gilead's highly successful drugs, Sovaldi and Harvoni, was overturned after a federal judge found merck's repeated illegal actions, including lying under oath and other unethical practices.
Federal Judge Beth Labson Freeman said in a filing Thursday that Gilead is entitled to a remission of fees incurred in connection with representing the case.
Merck is trying to catch up with Gilead, which dominates the market for next-generation hepatitis C drugs that can cure more than 90 percent of patients with this liver disease.
The case dates back to 2013, when Gilead and Merck sued each other, claiming to own basic laboratory research for sofosbuvir, an active ingredient in Gilead drugs.
U.S.-backed military forces claim to have gained full control of manchule city
U.S.-backed troops have regained full control of the northern city of Manchuria near the border with Turkey after the last Islamic State fighters fled the city, a spokesman for the group said Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) are now combing the city after the departure of the rest of the group of militants who were hiding in the city.
The troops freed more than 2,000 civilians held by the militants, Sharfan Darwish of the SDF alliance and the Manchules Military Council told Reuters.
"The city is now fully under our control, but we are still searching it," he told Reuters.
The Clintons earned $10.75 million in 2015 and paid a federal tax rate of 34.2 percent
Hillary Clinton released her 2015 tax return on Friday, 2015, 2015, disclosed that the Democratic presidential nominee and her husband had $10.75 million in income that year and paid a real tax of 34.2 percent.
In 2015, the Clintons donated $1 million to charity, mostly to the Clinton Foundation. Former President Bill Clinton contributed nearly $5.3 million in speaking fees to the joint box office, and the former secretary of state admitted $3 million in income from Simon &Schuster for her book on her time at the State Department.
Clinton's running mate, U.S. Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, and his wife Anne Holton released their tax returns for 10 years.
They paid a real tax of 20.3 percent in 2015.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to be models of financial transparency," Jennifer Palmieri, clinton's campaign aide, said in a statement.
Against that, Donald Trump hides behind false excuses and backs away from his earlier promises to release his tax returns.
It is customary for CANDIDATES FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES to release their tax returns, even if the law does not allow them to do so.
Trump, a Businessman from New York, and his lawyers cited an audit by the U.S. Treasury Department's tax department as a reason for his refusal to release his tax returns.
"Your move," a Hillary Clinton campaign aide said on Twitter, following on from the Democratic nominee's tax returns.
Michael Cohen, a special trump adviser, told CNN on Thursday that he would not allow Trump to release his tax returns until the audits are over.
According to Trump's critics, including 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney and other GOP members, his refusal raises questions about his net profits, charitable contributions, business transactions, and various other relationships, including relations with Russia.
Clinton has been strong on the issue, releasing a video Friday in which she recalls how senior Republicans are urging Trump to release his tax returns.
On Thursday, he addressed economic issues in Michigan.
"He refuses to do what all the other presidential candidates have done for decades - release their tax returns," she said in front of people.
Politico reported that Trump paid no or very low taxes in the last two years of the 1990s, and a New York Times columnist cited a number of tax advisers and accountants who argue that may still be the case today.
Federal tax rates have become a topic in the presidential race.
Clinton is pushing a rule named after billionaire Warren Buffett that would ensure that anyone who earns more than $1 million a year pays a tax of at least 30 percent.
President Barack Obama also supports the proposal.
Last week, at a Clinton rally in Omme, Nebraska, where Buffet's Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate is based, Buffet called on Trump to meet and exchange tax returns.
Buffett said he also passed an IRS audit and that Trump is "not afraid" of the IRS, but of voters.
The Clinton campaign released her tax returns retroa back to 2007.
The Clintons, who now live in Chappaqua, New York, paid an average federal tax of 32 percent and a combined tax of about 40.5 percent between 2007 and 2014.
The Clintons' 2015 tax returns show that, unlike most Americans, their incomes are only $100.
Their main investment was a low-cost mutual index fund, from which the Clintons reported a dividend and interest income of $109,000.

Condoms filled with chili or fireworks to protect elephants in Tanzania
Conservationists in Tanzania use an unorthodox way to prevent elephants from going to human dwellings - throwing condoms filled with chili powder at them.
This has worked, and honeyguide, which came up with the idea a few years ago, together with the American environmental organization The Nature Conservancy, promotes this practice and trains volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania how to use this nonviolent four-step procedure to protect their homes and crops without harming animals.
Many of them used to use spears to defend themselves.
Friday is World Elephant Day, dedicated to protecting these animals.
"Since they developed this ... toolbox, we have noticed a change in behaviour in these communities. People are much more confident that they can keep elephants out of their fields without hurting them," Honeyguide Foundation Executive Director Damian Bell said in a statement.
The first and second step is to light the passing elephant with a flashlight and lower the horn.
If this does not deter him, the so-called "cloud of chili" will be thrown away.
The chilli powder mixed with salt is wrapped together with the firecracker in a condom, its end knotted so that only a wick can look out of it.
After detonation, the condom explodes and a fine chilli powder is scattered in the air.
Usually one whiff is enough, and the elephant goes in a different direction.
The last option is to set off fireworks, which will cause a loud, bright explosion.
Jewish director leans into Berlin hotel for removing code for calling Israel at "request" from Arabs - RT News
A French film director of Jewish descent caused a stir in the media after finding out that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin did not have a code for calling Israel, according to an employee based on a "request" from Arab clients.
Claude Lanzmann, author of the Holocaust documentary "Shoah," vented his frustration at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin in an open letter to the German daily FAZ.
During his recent stay, Lanzmann tried to find Israel in the list of codes for calling the hotel.
However, the state was not listed among the countries to which it is possible to call directly from the room.
How is it possible that in 2016 Israel was removed and deleted in Berlin, the capital of Germany?
Lanzmann wrote.
Hotel Kempinski Bristol instead offers the possibility of calling Israel via its own call centre.
The director was looking for an explanation and contacted the hotel reception with a problem.
The answer he received shocked Lanzmann, he said.
A hotel official replied that the measure had been "decided upon at the discretion of kempinski hotels management."
The reason for this move further irritated the director.
"Most of our guests are Arabs, and they demanded that Israel's call code be deleted," Lanzmann quoted the employee as saying in his letter.
According to the Suddeutsche Zeitung, Israel's ambassador to Germany, Yakov Hadas-Handelsman, called the case a "great shame."
We were horrified and shocked by the event.
It's a huge shame in itself.
The fact that something like this happened in Germany and in such a hotel chain is an even greater shame.
No further explanation is needed.
We expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions," he said.
The event provoked a strong reaction online, with people calling it scandalous.
Some believe that the Kempinski Hotel has simply been "lost" in the demands of Arab customers.
"Shame on you," says another post, pointing out that the hotel, located on the elegant Kurfurstendamm Street, is close to the synagogue.
According to Spiegel, the hotel itself quickly dismissed any accusations by calling the incident an "oversight" and "apologizing" to Lanzman.
"No direct order has ever been issued" not to include Israel in the list of call codes, suddeutsche zeitung quotes a representative of the Kempinski Hotel as saying.
Adds that the call code has been added to the list.
Police used tear gas and rubber bullets against protesting Brazilian students
The clash between students and police took place in San Paulo, Brazil, on Thursday as students gathered for a demonstration against government reforms in the public education system.
Police used tear gas and rubber bullets against the protesters.
The problem escalated when government riot police tried to disperse the students, which ended with police using rubber bullets and tear gas.
Several hundred students took part in the demonstration to express their concerns about the plans.
Among San Paulo State Governor Gerald Alckmin's proposals to save money is the closure of nearly 100 public schools and the relocation of 300,000 students.
Some of the demonstrators could be seen spraying signs against interim President Michel Temer on the wall.
The latest protest comes just days after demonstrators took to the streets in mass in support of deposed President Dilma Rousseff as the country's senate decided to impeach her.
Trade between Russia and Iran up 71% - RT Business
According to Russian Ambassador to Iran Levan Dzhagaryan, trade turnover grew by 70.9 percent year-on-year after the lifting of sanctions between Moscow and Tehran.
As the ambassador said, since the lift of international sanctions against Iran, there has been an increase in interest from Russian companies doing business in the country.
Russian companies are restoring existing ties with Iran, while new firms are ready to enter the market.
Further expansion of trade is, of course, one of the main priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran," Dzhagaryan said.
He noted that in the first five months of 2016, trade turnover between Russia and Iran grew by 70.9 percent compared to the same period in 2015, reaching $856 million.
In particular, Russia's exports to Iran jumped 91.5 percent to $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 percent to $158 million.
The supply of machinery, ground vehicles and weapons ensured a jump in trade," the ambassador said.
Dzhagaryan also expects Russia to visit a record number of tourists from Iran this year.
Last year, russia's diplomatic mission in Iran issued about 35,000 visas, mostly travel visas, to Iranian citizens.
Moreover, Iran has reached the top 20 countries for the first time by the number of tourists arriving in Russia.
It is safe to say that the record numbers of tourists from Iran in Russia last year will be surpassed," he said.
At the same time, a relatively small number of Russians visit Iran. The ambassador hopes there will be a change.
"I can personally recommend a visit to the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, where the preserved monuments of ancient Persian civilization are in good condition," he said.
Scot Callum Skinner rushes home after Brits win gold in cycling
Callum Skinner of Scotland entered the Hall of Fame last night in the men's team sprint at the Rio Velodrome as the VB trio defended their London 2012 title.
The 23-year-old Glasgow native was in the role of the brake taken by Scot Sir Chris Hoy, and the youngster delighted the legend as he rushed to the finish line and stole the victory from the favoured New Zealand.
Britain surprisingly won four years ago, and Hoy won the fifth of his six Olympic gold medals.
And they repeated the same trick after finishing a modest sixth at the Track Cycling World Championships in March, although Hoy has since ended his career.
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of specialist opener Jamie Staff.
Hindes appeared just in time.
After Hoy's departure, there was also a vacancy that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to fill.
Skinner was a man of British trainers and the search for potential has now been confirmed.
Kenny Hindes - who was champion with Hoy four years ago - and Skinner set an Olympic record in qualifying, but New Zealand took the jersey in the first round.
And the British trio won gold in the team sprint.
Hindes was slightly behind after his lap, but Kenny pushed the team forward and Skinner held the lead.
The change of strategy was a big part of the transformation, with Hindes going to a higher gear to slow down and allow Kenny and partly Skinner to keep up the pace.
Hoy watched the race from his position as a BBC commentator, and when Skinner, Kenny and Hindes took to the stage, he didn't take his eyes off them.
Skinner, 23, a native of Glasgow, said: "It's a flattering comparison."
I'm here to get the best out of myself and honor my name.
We set an Olympic record in the finals and beat the best.
It was just unbelievable.
There's no better way to win this thing.
After triumphing alongside Kenny and Hoy in London in 2012, Hindes admitted that he had deliberately fallen on the track after a poor start.
He later withdrew the remark, and Britain's rivals had no way of appealing.
This time there was no such problem around this victory.
Hindes said, "With all the British flags in the stands, I felt like I was in London."
In the last three months, we've all come together as a team.
We've lost in a lot of world races, so to win the Olympics again is just amazing.
It's one event, one gold medal for a nation that has won seven out of 10 competitions in Beijing and London.
If this is to be an indicator of progress over the past five months, then we have a successful five days waiting for us at the velodrome.
With the form Kenny has shown, it's no inconceivable that he would repeat Hoya's success and win three gold medals at the same time at one Olympics.
That would also mean a total of six golds and one silver medal for Kenny - who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy on the day before Hoy (a date that seems sacred to British sport, steve redgrave, mo farah and roger bannister also celebrate his birthday on that day).
Same as hoy got.
Next up, Kenny will take part in the sprint, which starts today and lasts another three days.
The 28-year-old Bolton native said: "I'm enjoying this one now.
A team race is always the best.
You win with the others.
To tell you the truth, winning for yourself is a little lonely.
Hindes said, "If he wins two more gold medals, he should get a knighthood."
It was the only medal race of the day, but there was more good news for Britain.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified as the fastest in the team's 4km pursuit race.
They finished with a time of 3:51.943.
The world record set in London in 2012 is 3:51.659.
The first round and final (22:42) take place on today's second day of the race, which wiggins will surely focus on.
Yesterday, before the qualifying race, he was debating with the commissioners when the judges asked him to take a high.
Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie set a world record with a time of 4:13.260 in a similar women's race that continues and ends tomorrow.
The VB team has relied on its strong track cycling team to dominate the mid-season of the Olympic Games and win a lot of medals.
After truly exceptional performances, showing complete dominance in Beijing and London, expectations have lowered in the run-up to Rio.
Dramatic events unfolded in the background, not least the resignation of technical director Shane Sutton in April over allegations of sexism and discrimination, and the end of the careers of greats such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
However, as evidenced by the first night of the velodrome races, it seems that the legendary reputation that the Great Britain team can deliver a top-notch performance with perfect timing could be reaffirmed.
Uncertain future of Portland seraching after energy contract closes
The future of The Portland Aluminum Sage Plant in Victoria - and the jobs of hundreds of workers - is uncertain because of the power plant, which supplies electricity to the company and which has informed one of the sage owners of the electricity supply contract. All electricity supply contracts are expected to be shortened.
The move comes after the Victorian government decided earlier this year not to extend the granting of subsidies to keep the business running.
The fixed 20-year subsidy expires in November.
Up to 2,000 jobs could be at risk at Alcoa Portland.
Closing can put up to 2,000 jobs at risk - direct or indirect.
And because the seraline consumes about 10 per cent of Victoria's total electricity generated, there may be further avalanche impacts.
Alcoa closed the Point Henry smeaze plant in 2014, leading to the closure of anglesea power station last year.
Alcoa's steeding in Portland is a foray and is in danger of closing.
The move follows years of speculation about the future of the business, initially in response to the strong Australian dollar and, more recently, over plant production prices.
AGL, which supplies electricity to a large aluminum smea power plant from the Loy Yang A power plant in latrobe valley, said it expects one of the other three owners to also decide to terminate the contract.
The majority owner of the plant is a joint venture between Alcoa and Alumina, with small business interests held by Citic in China and Marubeni Corp in Japan.
"AGL expects the Portland plant to continue to operate, in other words, that demand for electricity from the sludg will continue," she said.
AGL stated that the contracts were so-called "hedging contracts", which were due to enter into force from November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month notice period, so they will actually expire in 2017.
"AGL continues to expect contracts to share in the profit for fiscal year 2017," the power plant said.
Any potential impact on AGL's profits from fiscal 2018 is also currently limited due to the strong outlook for the commodity market for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL said it had already written down the value of the contracts under its books of $187 million "in case the exit occurred."
Alcoa stated that the decision to terminate the contract 'does not affect its ... the ability to operate a serching shop or to secure the supply of electricity to the serite.'
The U.S. company said it entered into a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010, which was due to take effect in November of this year, although it has yet to explain why it withdrew from the contract.
Analysts are very cautious about the possible closure of the Portland steeding plant in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle due to the weak economy in the sector.
AGL's head of operations Stehpen Mikkelsen, who contacted analysts earlier this week, said Portland consumes about 600 megawatts of electricity annually and Tomago about 900 megawatts.
If both of these undertakings were to withdraw from the market, this would mean a substantial reduction in demand on the [electricity] market.
It wouldn't be good for us as a manufacturer," he said.
Kendall is not only the star of the Kardashians' reality TV show - she's now the cover of September's Vogue
Kendall Jenner (20), a model and fourth daughter of the clan's mother-manager Kris Kardashian-Jenner, appeared on the cover of the September issue of American Vogue magazine.
Kendall, an ambassador for Estee Lauder who performed at fashion week in Milan, Paris and New York, announced the news on her Instagram account on Thursday.
"In a room full of people I love, I want to cry at the sight of this front page," Kendall wrote.
The unveiling of the front page was followed by a bizarre (or simply a sequel to kardashian humor?) a staged video that had the entire Kardashian-Jenner family (bar rioters Rob and Caitly, along with all their favorite showbiz uncle, Keeping Up producer Ryan Seacrest). They forgot their sister's cover, only for the scene to end with a classic twist: they're throwing a secret party.
It's the storyline of almost every "birthday" episode of a children's TV show (Seacrest says, "Did you think we'd forgotten about you?" with the sincerity of a cartoon rabbit on the show at 8:00 a.m.), but Kris somehow needed to make sure that the other girls could feed off the publicity.
Because if we look at the September issue of Vogue, we've definitely entered a new era for the Kardashians.
Older sister Kim may have pushed Kendall on the cover of Vogue (she was there with her husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a different league.
The September issue of Vogue is the best-selling issue of the year.
The edition, which looks more like a book for advertising purposes than a fashion magazine, attracts a number of advertisers (Fashionista calculated that of the 832 pages last year, 615 pages were with advertising content).
The unveiling of the star, which will appear on the front page, is eagerly awaiting, so it's no wonder that in the past two years, the magazine's images have been leaked before it was officially published.
Women who have appeared on the cover in the past include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evandelista and Kate Moss.
In recent years, more "celebrities who model" than "models who are celebrities" have certainly appeared on the front page.
Jennifer Lawrence, an Oscar winner and Dior brand ambassador, made headlines in 2013, and a year later, Lagy Gaga was honored.
But while it's highly unlikely that Kendall - described by the magazine as a "groundbreaking model" of her generation - will fall into the first category, she'll be in very good company.
These celebrities are not related to famous people, nor to the stars of reality shows, or the kids of today who know how to make a well-edited video (even if Jenner represents all of this).
They are demonstrably talented women who excel in the entertainment industry.
Beyoncé, who made headlines last year, had one of the strongest years of her career with the release of lemonade.
Of course, not everyone is thrilled with Jenner's success.
Her position in the fashion world will always be difficult because of her participation in a reality show.
Stephanie Seymor, the former Victoria's Secret model, criticized Jenner and her co-star Gigi Hadid in June, calling them "whores of the moment."
Those feelings flared up again with the news that Jenner would appear on the cover of Vogue.
But this dissatisfaction is out of place.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of September's Vogue.
She's a supermodel in the truest sense of the word.
He's doing a show for Mark Jacobs.
He sells you makeup from Estee Lauder.
She and all her sisters sell you pictures of themselves on their own paywalls.
She sells photos of Cindy Crawford's daughter that she took for LOVE magazine.
And in her free time, she's on a reality show, maybe just one way to see Kourtney and her kids.
Community legal aid centres turn down 160,000 people a year
More than 160 000 of the most vulnerable citizens are rejected each year in community legal aid centres and are preparing for the impact in the sector itself, which will have further restrictions on already over-busy services.
In Queensland, three out of five people - mostly people of advanced age, immigrants, endangered workers, victims of violence and people without funds to fight unfair evictions and the like - are already being rejected when they are seeking free legal aid and representation.
Community legal services, which are already stretched to bursting, are about to make further cuts.
From June next year, these legal aid centers will lose another 30 percent of their federal funding.
James Farrell, director of community legal aid centers in Queenslady, said that according to the latest summary report from the National Association of Community Legal Aid Centers, 5,000 people were rejected each year.
Mr Farrell said the situation would deteriorate without overturning the federal government's decision.
"Community legal aid centres in Queensland are chronically underfunded, which means thousands of people are being denied the vital services they need," he said.
People who have escaped from relationships with rapists, people with excessive and crippling debts, families going through separation, workers who are unfairly dismissed - all of these people have problems with legal dimensions, and this report shows that they have no chance of getting the help they need.
The federal government will cut funding by 30 per cent from June 2017, leading to thousands more queenslanders at risk having to navigate complex legal problems without help.
We call on The State's Attorney and Queensland Senator George Brandis to immediately prevent this funding cut so that people get the help they need when they get into legal trouble.
In the past year, the State Government has fulfilled its commitment to ensure the financing of legal aid up to the national average.
Now is the time to look at the needs of community legal aid centres and their client communities, and the Palaszczuk Government must invest in this important work.
Donald Trump's campaign lawsuit after a staff member allegedly point a gun
New York: Donald Trump's campaign has been sued for alleged inaction after being told that the North Carolina director of operations had point a gun at a crew member while driving a Jeep in February.
The incident was described in a court filing handed over wednesday in Charlotte State Court by Vincent Bordini, a former campaign software trainer in the state.
Bordini said he waited months for the situation to be resolved internally before concluded that "this will not happen."
Principal Earl Phillip "pointed his fingers at the gun, put his right index finger on the trigger, and pointed the barrel at Vincent's chauche," Bordini said in the lawsuit.
The file states that Bordini found out after a complaint to the local and regional campaign management that at least four other people had experienced the same thing with Phillip.
"Guns don't have to fire to cause damage," Bordini said in the lawsuit.
The lawsuit comes just two days after the Republican presidential nominee caused an uproar when he told voters in North Carolina that gun owners and holders (as provided for in the Second Amendment in the US) could step in if his opponent, Hillary Clinton, is elected and can appoint her judges.
The Trump campaign says that the media took his words out of context and that Trump did not advocate violence.
In the lawsuit, Bordini seeks compensation from the campaign for negligent surveillance and phillip for endangering personal safety, unlawful use of violence, and causing emotional distress.
Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment.
Attempts to get a statement from Phillip were unsuccessful.
WCCB, a local news outlet in Charlotte, reported that Phillip recently left the campaign.
A call to his consulting firm Innovative Consulting Services was not answered within a short period of time.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump is running a controversial election campaign.

Britain must continue to spread the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will also be a source of renewal and prosperity not only for our local communities and across London, but across the country.
For me, Heathrow is hugely attractive, just as London 2012 was, when we made extraordinary efforts to ensure that all our nations and regions could benefit from the Olympic Games.
The Olympic Games have made huge contributions to both Startford and the East End.
And we will do it again by creating opportunities for local people and businesses near Heathrow.
We will create 10 000 new teaching jobs, 40 000 new jobs for our local communities and put an end to youth unemployment around the airport.
As before the London Olympics in 2012, there will be those who will think heathrow expansion is too great.
I was told that Britain would never be ready for the Olympic Games and that we would be ridiculed on the world stage.
Doubters were wrong in 2012, and even with Heathrow, it turns out they were wrong.
Obstacles will always have to be overcome, but Heathrow can answer every question that concerns it.
Like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is an infrastructure project involving many people and companies, not just a few.
The expansion is an opportunity to create 180,000 new jobs, economic growth of £211 billion, and to leave a legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and across the UK.
We have a great team at Heathrow who have implemented an £11 billion infrastructure investment programme on time and on a budget, from the T5 terminal - which was voted the best terminal in the world five years in a row - to the T2 terminal, which was built between two of the busiest runways in the world.
They are now ready to deliver a third runway, worth £16 billion of private investment.
The 2012 London Games were a huge success for the UK and I am convinced that expanding Heathrow will be one too.
It is time for us to continue to spread the spirit of the Olympic Games and expand Heathrow, secure business for the future and leave behind a legacy of skills and employment that Britain can be proud of.

Adblock Plus - Facebook in cat and mouse game in ad blocker
Attempts to bypass ad-blocking programs have become a cat-and-mouse game for online marketing companies. At least that's what one of the companies that programs such software says.
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced that it would block ad filters on its desktop pages, Adblock Plus posted a post on its site edging that users can update filters in their program and re-block advertising on the social network.
Facebook said Tuesday that its desktop website will change the encoding around ads to make it more difficult for ad filters to figure out which parts of the page are advertising.
But Adblock now claims to have bypassed the new codes.
Adblock spokesman Ben Williams wrote in a blog post that "this kind of war between the open source ad-blocking community and those trying to get around them has been going on since ad blocking was invented," and that Facebook is likely to come up with another custom fix of its own.
The fact that the company that owns the world's largest social network has engaged in war only proves how big a problem ad blocking has become for the industry.
According to a study conducted by Pagefair last year, about 200 million people worldwide use ad filters - almost four times what they did in 2013.
Mobile advertising now accounts for 84 percent of Facebook's ad revenue, with 1.03 billion active users visiting Facebook from mobile devices every day.
However, a spokesman said the company is opposed to desktop advertising filters because mobile ad filters for mobile apps for the social network and Instagram don't work.
Desktop ads still represent a profit high enough for Facebook to decide to invest in.
Facebook also said on Tuesday that it would update its "ad preferences" tool to give people the ability to better control how they see ads.
On Thursday, Facebook said they were concerned about Adblock's new filters because they could also block content unrelated to the ad on the site.
"This is not a pleasant experience for people, and we want to solve this problem," a Facebook spokesperson said in an emailed statement.
Ad blocking is an insensitive tool, which is why we'd rather focus on building tools like Ad Preferences that give people control.
Woman hit by car on Swiss highway
The victim was lying on the highway in the middle of the night.
Police are looking for witnesses to an incident in which a woman who is believed to have attempted suicide was run over by several cars on the highway in the early hours of Thursday morning.
The accident happened on the A1 motorway near Morges in the canton of Vaud shortly after midnight on Thursday.
Police in Vaud said in a statement that the "desperate act" was lying in the dark on the road and was run over by several cars.
It is clear that the victim, a woman aged 49, tried to kill herself and was hit by several cars, including a truck.
She died at the scene.
Several drivers have already been interviewed, but police say they have not all been identified. Police are appealing for these drivers and anyone else who witnessed the crash to come forward.
A criminal investigation has been opened, a "logical" move in a situation like this, attorney Gilles Hofstetter told Le Tribune de Geneve.
It is still necessary to determine whether any of the drivers involved will face any charges.
Was it possible to prevent the impact?
That's what the prosecutor needs to find out," Hofstetter said.
Based on two similar cases in the past five years, it appears that drivers will not be held responsible.
In both cases - one of which involved a person walking on the highway - it was decided that motorists could not expect pedestrians crossing the highway in the middle of the night, the newspaper reported.
Last year, a police officer was cleared of negligent homicide after she hit and killed a man lying on the A1 near Paynerne on the night of August 2014.
The court heard that the victim, aged 22, was drinking alcohol and fainting on the road.
The court found that the police officer - who responded to the distress call - was driving in an appropriate manner and that the man's presence on the road was "a completely exceptional and unpredictable situation," the judge said.
Anyone with information about Thursday's incident at Morges should contact police on 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
A tolerant city.
Prague is a popular destination for the LGBT community.
The Association of Czech Travel Agencies (AČCKA) expects up to 20,000 visitors to Prague Pride.
Kateřina Petříčková, Executive Director of the Czech Republic, announced this on Friday.
The sixth year of Prague Pride began on August 8, the festival brings the life of lesbians, gays, bisexuals and transsexuals (LGBT) closer.
Last year, about 35,000 people attended the event.
"Prague is one of the most popular destinations of the LGBT community, for its high tolerance rate and a wide range of specialized businesses," petříčková said.
According to a survey of organizers, foreign festival-goers spend an average of CZK 3,100 per person per day.
Gay tourists are available to support their travel with special maps of Prague with a complete list of Prague gay and gay-friendly bars, clubs, cafes and restaurants in the form of mobile applications, etc.
"For tourism in general, LGBT clientele is very lucrative, is interested in staying in higher price ranges with a high standard of travel services and spends more than others," petříčková said.
The first Pride Tourism Symposium is held this year as part of the festival programme.
It is lectured by lgbt tourism experts from Europe, the USA and China.
The festival continues until Sunday, August 14.
Love is the main theme this year, but the event will also address several thematic areas, such as family, AIDS prevention and transgender issues.
The highlight of the festival on Saturday will be a traditional procession with allegorical cars, which will go from Wenceslas Square to Letna.
The parade, which has been attended by thousands of people in recent years, will this year honor with a minute's quiet the memory of the victims of the June attack at a nightclub in Orlando, where an assailant shot dead 49 people, mostly gay.
Pat and Mat are forty years old.
The insurrectible DIY pat and mat, whose efforts usually end in disaster, have entertained both small and large viewers for forty years.
The pilot of this evening series by director Lubomir Beneš premiered on August 12, 1976.
Behind the creation of this animated series, which is now known to viewers in more than 100 countries around the world, were cartoon jokes by the artist and director Lubomir Beneš, which he invented for a magazine with two handy men, Mr. Ouholíček and Mr. Seddec.
Beneš then invited the dramaturgist Jiří Kubíček and the artist Vladimír Jiránek to cooperate and together they created the film Kuťáci.
In 1979, when a series for Slovak television began to be created in the Short Film Prague, the characters got their present appearance with a yellow and red T-shirt and a ball and a radio.
The names Pat and Mat were given to the HANDYmans in 1985, this time it was shot directly for the Short Film Prague.
In 1990 Lubomír Beneš founded his own studio of animated film AIF Studio in Prague and Zurich, where other works were created.
After his death in 1995, other works continued with other creators, many of which involved Beneš's son Marek.
Nowadays, there are over ninety episodes with the stories of these HANDYmans, who are all over the place, but never angry with each other and are always full of optimism, ideas and DIY enthusiasm, and in the end they are satisfied with their work, which they will amoud with the famous gesture "... and that's it!".
Pat and Mat have even moved from TV screens to books, DVDs and theatres, and characters and other toys depicting Pat and Mat are a hit with every toy store.
A fairy tale for Fiji and two-year-old Harmonia.
The end of the week is marked by fairy tales, we have chosen one sports and one of life for you.
They both have a good ending.
Let's take a look.
Fiji has achieved historic success.
What is the reason for the joy of the whole country?
A two-year-old British girl has an identical friend and is happy with her.
And what things do people spend the most on at airports?
This is a Friday review from the world's websites.
First medal from the Olympic Games.
The island state of Fiji is a historic success.
The archipelago's rugby selection was beaten by a Great Britain team in the final of the Olympic Sevens Rugby Tournament.
It is the first medal fiji has won for itself at the Olympics.
It took sixty years after the first expedition to the Olympic Games to be won.
The Fiji coach has a lot to do with his success.
Ironically, however, it is British Ben Ryan.
He has led the team since 2013 and after the final as a British citizen he could be satisfied, unlike his compatriots.
"Let's play loose and easy and see if we can handle the biggest game in our history," the coach said before the finals.
Fiji eventually dominated it, and the small state of 900,000 now relives the Olympic fairytale.
The news was reported by the French daily Le Monde.
A new friend and happiness for a little girl.
Harmonie-Rose Ivy Allen, 2, who has lived without arms and legs since she was 11 months old, has been given a new friend.
A doll that looks like her.
"Mom, she's like me," the 2-year-old rejoiced, as her mother told ABC News.
She added that her daughter likes to take off her arms and legs and then sit together without prostheses.
Harmony was diagnosed with meningitis type B in less than a year of life, with doctors giving her only a 10% chance of survival.
There's nothing I don't love about her.
She's beautiful, smart, funny, and she never gives up.
He's got perspective.
I saw her introducing myself to other children with the words Hello, I'm Harmony and I don't have hands,' added her mother.
Look at the joy the doll has brought.
What do we spend the most on at the airport?
CNN reports that people at airports spend the most on bottled water.
Hudson's travel essential stores has released data for the past year, summarizing the 10 products customers buy most often at its airport stores.
The water was sovereignly the first.
Drinks were generally very popular, with eight in the top ten.
The ninth place was occupied by a large pack of coconut-flavoured M&M candies.
And can you guess who's closing out the top 10?
It is the only one of the above things that cannot be eaten.
According to CNN, it's The Wall Street Journal.
Other popular newspapers sold at airports include: The New York Post, The New York Times USA Today.
Among the magazines are US Weekly, In Touch and The Economist.
Rowing sovereigns.
We're just going to win, Murray and Bond laughed.
New Zealand's Eric Murray and Hamish Bond have dominated the two-man category without a helmsman for seven years and have confirmed their dominance at the Rio de Janeiro Olympics.
At first glance, the disparate pair switched to a smaller crew after the Beijing Olympics and have been crushing competition since 2009.
Rodrigo de Freitas' lagoon claimed its 69th straight win in Thursday's final.
How are we different from the others?
We're just prettier,' Murray joked during the Olympic regatta, when he was due to answer questions about the New Zealand pair's dominance.
Frankly, we're not doing anything different from the others.
We just train hard, really hard.
And we're constantly trying to improve our technique, that's our philosophy, Murray said more seriously.
Their domination is also remarkable because they are physically different.
Murray is almost two meters tall and a hundred-kilogram chalet, the academic-looking Bond is five centimeters smaller and 15 kilograms lighter.
Moreover, they have different natures.
Bond is studying and fundraising, murray has a charity boxing match, for example.
That's why they don't spend much time together outside of rowing.
Eric's getting on the ship basically, saying we can't lose.
We're just going to win.
"I tend to think about what can go wrong," admitted Bond, who demonstrated at the press conference that Murray is the dominant man on the pack.
He was the one who always answered first, and Bond was waiting for his chance.
On the water, however, they destroy their opponents with calm force.
They're on their way, and although they're often not in the lead halfway through the track, their opponents haven't found a recipe for gradual acceleration.
We race on a 2km track and we never wanted to go the first kilometre to the end.
We're just trying to set a pace that no one else can.
"We know what we have to do to win," murray, 34, said.
He won seven gold medals at the World Championships with his partner of four years.
They also triumphed in 2007, when they were both members of the golden four without a helmsman.
It was after the unexpected failure of a larger crew at the Beijing Olympics a year later that they decided to move to number two without a helmsman.
At the London Olympics, they probably amoneed the biggest defeat of their careers and confirmed their dominance in Rio.
London was very intense.
We did everything the coach told us to do, and they didn't ask questions.
It was a little more fun this time.
We knew it was going to be bloody hard, and we had to make sure we were doing well mentally, Murray said.
We know they all want to overthrow us.
We still have that target on our backs.
But we try to be half a step ahead of everyone, he added.
NASA climate model: Venus was once habitable
According to projections of NASA's new climate model, Venus was once habitable.
Scientists at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies have developed a model for exploring Venus using tools and algorithms similar to those used by climate scientists.
The model was designed to determine whether conditions similar to those on Earth might once have reigned on Venus, whose surface is hot, waterless and co2-insuered.
Scientists have previously suggested that Venus' low rotation rate can be explained by its dense atmosphere.
According to the latest simulations, however, venus once seemed to boast a sparse Earth-like atmosphere while rotating slowly.
The model also dealt with the former topography of Venus.
The planet's areas were probably dryer than those on Earth, but once there was enough water and geographical diversity to rule life and provide protection against rapid evaporation.
Venus had also previously used the sun, which was 30 percent more subdued.
"In a simulation of the GISS Venus model during slow rotation, it exposes its daily side to the sun for almost two months at a time," explained GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio in a new report.
In this way, the surface is heated and rain is formed, which creates a dense layer of clouds that act like an umbrella and protect the surface from excessive solar heat.
The result is a climate with average temperatures that are actually slightly lower than currently on Earth.
The model compiled a story of Venus similar to evolution, which was previously hypothetically compiled by planetary scientists.
Although Venus has probably been habitable in the past -- over several billion years -- it has been exposed to excessive heat and ultraviolet radiation.
Its oceans evaporated, and the water vapors were burned by ultraviolet light.
Hydrogen escaped, leaving only a dense atmosphere of carbon dioxide with the deadly effect of a greenhouse gas -- venus as we know it today.
The researchers published their results from the new venus climate model in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy resigns as coach of the Colorado Avalanche
Patrick Roy resigned Thursday as coach and vice president of hockey operations for the Colorado Avalanche, citing the impossibility of participating in the team's decision-making process as a reason.
Colorado Executive Vice President/General Manager Joe Sakic confirmed the move and said the club would immediately start looking for a new coach.
"For the past three years, I have served as head coach and vice president of hockey operations for the Colorado Avalanche, with energy, passion and determination," Roy, 50, said in a statement.
I've been thinking long and hard over the summer about how I can improve the team, give it the depth it needs and take it to the next level.
In order to achieve this, it is necessary that the visions of the coach and vice president of hockey operations are in line with the vision of the organization.
They must also be able to participate in decisions that impact team performance.
These conditions are currently not met.
Sakic, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked him for his contributions to the team.
"Patrick informed me of his decision today," Sakic said.
We appreciate everything he has done for our organization and wish him good luck in the future.
Roy was nominated for Jack Adams' best coaching job during his first season with the Avalanche in 2013/2014.
He led the team to 112 points and first place in the Central Division. Colorado, however, faced Minnesota in the first round of the playoffs, and over the past two years, it hasn't always had a season-long playoff run.
The Avalanche took a 39-39-4 lead in the 2015-16 season and were five points short of earning their second wild card in the Western Conference.
Hall of Fame goaltender Roy has won the Stanley Cup four times -- twice with the Montreal Canadiens and twice with the Avalanche.
Workers on North Sea oil rig resume talks and suspend strike
Senior party officials said strikes over wages for North Sea oil rig workers were suspended while all parties to the dispute agreed to a new round of negotiations.
Strikes against oilfield services company Wood Group sporadically took place on North Sea platforms operated by Royal Dutch Shell.
"Wood Group and the Unite and RMT trade unions can confirm that they have agreed to resume the process for resolving current disagreements," the statement said.
Starting next week, we will have a series of all-day meetings over the next few weeks, where we will try to look at the problems from new angles.
According to trade unions, their recent action, which they say was the first in more than 25 years, is up to 30 percent in protest against wage cuts.
Wood Group cut rates this year and paid out about 9 per cent less to its North Sea suppliers due to negative market pressure.
The company's rate cut comes after a 10% cut for offshore companies in 2014.
The company argues that further cuts would give the company room to cope with the market downturn.
Shell, on the other hand, has removed thousands of people from its payroll and announced plans to abandon oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries to modernize its processes - in the wake of a mega merger with British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure because of low oil prices, the economic situation associated with Britain's decision to leave the European Union in June.
Scottish MP Dave Anderson met union leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest labour disagreements in a generation that led to the North Sea strike.
The North Sea, he said, is vital to the region's economy.
"In the North Sea and across the country, we need an economy that works for everyone, not just some," he said in a statement.
By comparison, nearly $1.4 billion of investment in new North Sea projects is expected in 2016, compared with an average of about $7 billion over the past five years.
Kepler measures the rate of rotation of stars in the Pleiades
The kepler space telescope's latest mission to help astronomers is to get an almost complete list of star rotation rates from the Pleiades cluster.
The new data help astronomers understand why stars in the cluster rotate at different speeds, as well as how rotation time is related to the formation of the planet.
"By comparing our results with other clusters, we hope to learn more about the relationship between stellar matter, its age, and even the history in its solar system," Luisa Rebull, a researcher at Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, said in a new report.
The Pleiades cluster is located 445 light-years from Earth.
Many of the clustered stars are now reaching their state of adulthood and have been formed for over 125 million years.
Now it rotates the fastest.
At maximum rotation speed moments, these teenage stars release huge amounts of stellar wind.
Because these winds move along the magnetic fields of stars, they have a slowing effect on them.
As the star agees, so does its rate of rotation.
Kepler measures the rate of rotation of each star by measuring the time between the discovery of recognizable points on stars -- similar to sunspots.
According to the latest data on rotational speeds, larger stars rotate more slowly than less massive stars.
Rebull compares stars to dancers, bigger pirouettes slower than smaller ones.
"In "ballet", we see that slower-spinning stars are more massive, while the ones that spin the fastest are usually very light stars," Rebull said.
Because the Pleiades cluster is so close, it serves as an ideal space laboratory for comparing the quality of stars and the speed of rotation.
"The Pleiades provide us with an anchor for theoretical models of stellar rotation in both directions, in younger and older stars," Rebull said.
There's still a lot we want to know about how, when and why stars slow down their speed of rotation, so to say "hang their dancing shoes on the nail."
Rebull and her colleagues detailed the latest analysis of Pleiades' rotational speeds in three studies, which will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal.
Is a qualifying agreement necessary?
If I did not apply, then the qualification agreement would not be concluded and after a few months I could move to another hospital?
Is it even possible to work after studying without enrolling in specialization education?
My point is that in the field in which I would like to work, there is now a vacancy only in a somewhat more distant hospital, but in about six months there could be a vacancy in another, where I would then like to work.
So I do not know how to deal with the situation for about six months, the question continues.
Answers Mgr. Lenka Vlková.
No legislation provides for the obligation to conclude a qualification agreement with the employer - the hospital.
A qualification agreement is a legal institute governed by the Labour Code and may be concluded between the employee and the employer in order to ensure the return on the costs incurred in increasing or deepening the employee's qualifications.
In the field of health, there is long-term pressure not to conclude these agreements with a view to ensuring the labour mobility of healthcare professionals, and not all hospitals currently require this agreement.
According to Act No. 95/2004 Coll., on the conditions for obtaining and recognizing professional competence and specialized competence to perform the medical profession of doctor, dentist and pharmacist, participation in specialization education is considered to be a deepening of qualifications (not an increase in qualifications).
This means that a qualification agreement can only be concluded under the Labour Code if the costs reach at least CZK 75,000.
No legislation even provides for the obligation to apply for specialization education.
The act merely lays down the conditions for an application for inclusion in the field of specialization education.
However, the doctor is legally entitled to pursue the profession of doctor already thanks to the completion of the necessary university studies, although under the conditions laid down by law (under the professional supervision of a doctor with specialized competence in the relevant field).
The act foresches a situation in which professional experience completed in another field of specialization can be included in the specialization education of the doctor, provided that its content and scope correspond to the relevant educational programme.
In theory, this would be possible to count the time worked elsewhere, which would correspond to the questioner's situation.
However, in view of the fact that I do not know the more detailed circumstances of this case, consultation with the relevant department of the Ministry of Health (Department of Science and Medical Professions) can be recommended, since the Ministry of Health by law provides a consultancy and consulting service related to the inclusion in and course of specialization education.
The advisory service is also provided free of charge by the Czech Medical Chamber, of which every doctor must be a member.
Doctors in Halab, Syria, are asking for US intervention.
The United States has made no effort to end the siege (rebel-held parts of the city by government troops) and has not used its influence to enforce the protection of civilians, AFP quoted from a letter addressed to the White House.
"We don't need tears, compassion, or even prayers; however, we desperately need to create a no-fly zone over East Halab to stop the attacks, and we need international action to ensure that Halab is not surrounded again," the doctors said.
Russian forces, which support an army loyal to President Bashar al-Assad, have announced that they will halt strikes in the Halab area for three hours every day from today to allow safe passage for humanitarian convoys.
From 09:00 to 12:00 CEST (09:00 CEST) all military activities, air strikes and artillery fire are to be stopped.
While welcoming this, THE UN's head of humanitarian operations, Stephen O'Brien, stressed the need for at least a two-day ceasefire.
According to AFP, 15 of the 35 doctors operating in the rebel-controlled eastern part of Halab contacted Obama in the letter.
They write that during the five-year war they witnessed the violent, cruel deaths of countless patients, friends and colleagues.
The world is watching and stating how complex Syria is, but it is doing little to protect us.
Recent offers to evacuate residents from the Syrian regime and Russia sound like slightly veiled threats, pediatricians, surgeons and other doctors have pointed out.
Doctors said there have been 42 attacks on medical facilities in Syria in the past month, 15 of them at the hospitals where they work.
What sads us the most is that we have to decide who lives and who dies.
Small children come to the emergency room with such serious injuries that we have to choose among them those most likely to survive.
And sometimes we don't even have the necessary material to help them, the doctors described.
Two weeks ago, four newborns suffocated when an explosion disrupted the oxygen supply to their incubators.
They gasped, and then their life was over - before he could really begin, they recalled.
An army loyal to President Bashar al-Assad, backed by Russian forces, has surrounded the rebel-held eastern part of Halab in recent weeks, with more than 200,000 people without food supplies inside.
The rebels, who are under constant strikes by Russian and Syrian air forces, managed to break through the siege on Saturday after three weeks and launch a counteroffensive.
Reinforcements were then added to the city and its surroundings.
