Parliament did not support the amendment liberating Tymoshenko
The Ukrainian parliament today rejected a proposal to repeal the section on the basis of which the opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko was convicted as part of an amendment to the Criminal Code.
The amendment, which would pave the way for the release of the imprisoned former prime minister, was rejected by the deputies at the second reading of the proposal to reduce penalties for economic offenses.
Tymoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison in October for concluding an allegedly unfavorable agreement with Russia to buy natural gas.
The verdict is not final, the appeal of the convicted person is to be heard by the court in December.
Tymoshenko describes the verdict as the political revenge of the regime, suspicion of court bias has provoked trial in the West.
The proposal to delete section 365 from the Criminal Code, on the basis of which the ex-prime minister was convicted, was supported by 147 deputies in the vote.
It required 226 votes to approve it.
Libyan victory
The story of the Libyan liberation, or Libyan rebellion, already has its losers.
Muammar Gaddafi is buried in an unknown place in the desert and is without him after the war.
It remains to define the winner.
As is customary in the region, Islamists will win the election, but it is a matter of moderation or radical.
The Transitional National Council has subscribed to customary Sharia law and we already have some idea of it.
Libya will become a country without crime, as the hand is cut for theft.
Women can forget about emancipation, possible apostates from the faith will be executed and so on.
Instead of the person of the dictator, a society consisting of rival tribes will unite the Qur&#39;an.
There will be an order in Libya that we cannot imagine and that we certainly would not want.
However, our way of life is neither the only nor the objectively the best, and it would probably not suit the change just mentioned by the Libyans just mentioned.
In fact, it is surprising that Islamic militants have taken help from unbelieving dogs.
The only excuse is that, from their point of view, NATO was not led by a general from America, but by Allah, whose greatness they celebrated in every successful intervention.
So when winners are sought in Libya, the West is not one of them.
We took part in the shootout, served Islam, and our politicians, in the person of the dictator, got rid of the political ally without guaranteeing any profit.
After fresh bad experiences from Afghanistan and Iraq, we are not occupying Libya militarily.
Thus, the local eliminates the problem of expelling the &quot;crusaders&quot;.
But will they have Libyan black gold for their mouths without occupying the oil company?
It may not be enough, and the West will finally be able to boast of selfless protection of human rights.
Unless, therefore, those followers of Sharia law prevent us from doing so.
A new era of crisis is beginning.
France and the rest of Europe have found themselves in the search for investors
The statistical storm swept across Europe on Tuesday.
Individual countries published data on GDP for 3Q.
The Czech economy stagnated quarter on quarter, Germany and France are growing.
But the bond market is breaking records today.
Investors are no longer looking only at Italy, but also at Spain, France, Austria and others.
Statistical authorities of the euro area, Germany, the Czech Republic and some other European countries have published preliminary estimates of economic development for the third quarter.
Germany&#39;s GDP grew by the expected 0.5%, France by 0.4%.
At the same time, both countries adjusted the data for the second quarter, in which Germany next door did better than expected (growth of 0.3% instead of the original 0.1%), but France stated that it appeared in a slight decrease of 0.1% ( the original data spoke of stagnation).
The Czech economy grew by 1.5 percent year on year in the third quarter of this year.
However, quarter-on-quarter gross domestic product (GDP) stagnated and, according to the CZSO, thus confirmed the trend of a gradual slowdown in economic performance growth.
The results are worse than analysts&#39; estimates.
The most important events:
The Czech economy grew by 1.5 percent year on year in the third quarter of this year, but stagnated quarter on quarter.
According to preliminary and seasonally calculated data, the German economy grew by 0.5 percent in the third quarter.
The economy of the euro area and the European Union grew by 0.2 percent between July and September compared to the previous quarter, which is in line with analysts&#39; expectations.
The Greek economy contracted by 5.2 percent year on year.
The yield on its 10-year bonds is 28.45%.
Italian and Spanish bond yields are rising to critical levels.
Problems are also beginning to be felt in Austria, the Netherlands, France, Belgium, etc ...
Yields on Czech 10-year bonds remain below 4%, although the situation in the region is deteriorating.
There are voices from Germany that the ECB should be a creditor of last resort.
The Czechs qualified for the EURO.
They have won 1-0 in Montenegro and are celebrating a promotion for 200 million
The football team managed the most difficult task of the season!
In Montenegro, thanks to the great Czech and beautiful goal of Petr Jiráček, she won 1: 0.
Czech football, even with a great deal of luck in the second half, defended the luxurious lead from home revenge and will not be missing again at the European Championship.
IHNED.cz watched the progressive match in a detailed report.
Almost no excitement in the first half and a great deal of luck in the second.
Thanks to the domestic frustration at the end, the great Czech and hero Jiráček, the Czech national team happily won 1-0 in Montenegro and is celebrating advancing to the European Championships.
Due to the precise defense of the Czech team, the Montenegrins did not come under pressure until the second half.
The losers of the match were Damjanovič and Vučinič, who burned two big chances.
Even thanks to the great Petr Čech, the Czech national team will not miss the European Championship next year either, and the reward of approximately 200 million crowns will be added to the national football box.
A lot of fighting football was played from the very beginning minutes.
Both teams had a hard time getting involved in the combination and were played mostly around the halfway line.
That is why the pressure of the domestic football players did not come in the first half, because the Czech defense precisely averted long trenches for the defense.
Iranian students are ready to die for their country&#39;s nuclear program.
They created a living shield
Several hundred college students created a living shield around a nuclear facility in Iran.
With their gesture, they want to express support for their country&#39;s nuclear program before a possible Israeli attack.
Students prayed in front of the building at noon on Tuesday and then shouted death to the United States and Israel.
Several hundred university students in Isfahan, Iran, created a live shield around the Isfahan Uranium Nuclear Technology Center on Tuesday.
They show that they are ready to defend their country&#39;s nuclear program with their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) stated in a recent report that Iran did not appear to have stopped pursuing a nuclear weapon.
A possible attack on Iran&#39;s nuclear facilities is being talked about in Israel.
Students prayed at noon before entering the Isfahan nuclear facility and then shouted death to America and Israel.
In the event of an attack aimed at paralyzing Iran&#39;s nuclear program as much as possible, according to the Israeli press, in addition to the Isfahan center, the target would also be the Natanz facility, in which uranium is enriched.
Obese child&#39;s diet: no breakfast and cold cuts for dinner
More than a third of children aged 9 to 13 have overweight problems, with 9 percent of schoolchildren being overweight and 5 percent being obese.
Obese children usually come from families with unhealthy lifestyles, as the current survey has shown.
It shows once again how important the environment in which he grows up and the patterns with which he is surrounded is important for the healthy development of man.
For example, sausages appear on the tables of obese children up to half as often as in families of children with normal weight.
More than 19 percent of obese people had fried fries for dinner the day before the research associated with the awareness event called Obesity.
It is also not customary in families of fat people to play sports, which is true of most families of today&#39;s schoolchildren - only 15 percent of children said that their parents find time for active movement at least once a week.
Survey among 900 children
The survey took place at the end of last school year and was attended by almost 900 children from primary schools from all over the Czech Republic.
It was the second year of the Obesity is No Coincidence event, which is supported by Všeobecná zdravotní pojišťovna and Unilever.
So far, more than 12,000 schoolchildren from 4th to 8th grades have joined the project.
Proper nutrition and enough exercise in the family is one of the determining factors, which causes a dramatically increasing number of overweight or even obese children.
&quot;Only half of the respondents, for example, said that they eat five times a day in the breakfast-snack-lunch-snack-dinner regime, which is one of the basic prerequisites for proper nutrition,&quot; said one of the results of the survey.
Without breakfast and cold cuts in the evening
Experts point out that relative details, such as regular family breakfasts, are also important for healthy development.
In the Czech Republic, at the same time, only 23 percent of schoolchildren have breakfast.
In most families, everyone has breakfast alone.
And the worst thing was finding that in a tenth of households they don&#39;t eat breakfast at all.
Breakfast is the basis of a proper daily diet.
The questionnaire showed that unhealthy fries are much more often consumed in families of obese children.
Almost everyone - regardless of weight - drinks sweet lemonade every day (70 percent).
Although more than 40 percent of the children surveyed play sports regularly, the result for their parents was less than half - 15 percent.
Build your menu
Another part of the survey allowed selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to compile their own diet from the options offered according to their own taste and opinion.
&quot;The dietary preferences of Czech children aged 12 to 15 are far from ideal in terms of healthy nutrition.&quot;
Among their favorite dishes are a lot of floury, meat and sweet dishes.
&quot;The great popularity of sweet lemonades is particularly alarming,&quot; the survey said in the final report.
For lunch as a main course, pasta won just over poultry.
However, the children practically did not want legumes at all, and the popularity of fish and lunch vegetable dishes is also low.
Leaning towards health
At the same time, the survey showed that children are willing to adjust their eating habits if they are given the right information.
&quot;In the control group of survey participants who filled out the questionnaire after the obesity lecture, there is no coincidence in many cases, there was a significant shift in preferences towards the principles of healthy nutrition,&quot; the project said.
This was striking, for example, with sweet lemonades, where more children would start to prefer ordinary water.
Children were also much more likely to tick poultry and fish as the main meal of the day in the questionnaire and would reduce sweet foods and dumplings.
The stylist must also be a good psychologist, say the pros
In the introductory article on how stylists learn, I complained so much that there was already a lot in the introductory class.
I had no idea what would follow.
Lectures by three professionals from the field, dressing problematic characters and a seminar on how it goes on the spot.
And it will get worse.
The closer to the final exam, the more information and practical tasks await us.
And even though the course takes place every Saturday and Sunday, it is really &quot;trampled&quot;.
This time, director Alenka and I discussed (there is not a single boy in the course) how to dress a woman who does not have a perfectly symmetrical figure.
And the vast majority of them are.
Some have a short neck, some have a boyish figure without proper curves and some are overweight.
The stylist must know how to optically soften wide shoulders, lengthen the neck or deliver the necessary curves.
We got tips on how to emphasize the figure nicely with a woman like Jennifer Lopez, ie bigger breasts and hips and a narrow waist, and at the same time not dress the woman too defiantly.
For example, if the difference between the waist and the hips is such that the skirt or trousers do not really fit, then it pays to have at least one such piece tailored.
You will definitely not regret it, because perfectly fitting clothes are priceless.
You will feel much better in a tailor-made skirt than in one that is constantly shifting, rolling up, standing out at the waist and the like.
The boy character, on the other hand, can afford to wear clothes with ruffles, applications, embroidery or gathering.
Of course, there is a lot of such information and character types, so I&#39;m glad I have a whole week to sort all the information in my head.
And I&#39;m still afraid that, given the homework assignment, it&#39;s up to that.
Each of the course participants was assigned an celebrity to come up with two outfits: day and evening.
We have to take into account the current look, fashion style of the personality and type of figure.
I&#39;m going to &quot;dress&quot; Miranda Kerr, maybe you know her from Victoria&#39;s Secret campaigns.
In my mind, I&#39;m cheering, definitely better for me personally than Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, who has recently gained perhaps a hundred kilos (please take exaggeration), or the young Selena Gomez.
We have to cut out the clothes from magazines or search the Internet and print them out and then process them graphically.
Moodboard, as the whole result is called, then expresses our personal style and relationship to the graphic design.
It is also important to think about the graphic side of styling.
The stylist not only dresses physically, but also creates, for example, so-called product pages in magazines (for specific assignments, such as trendy handbags, coats, etc.).
Stylist and designer Mario Kameník told us about it.
But not until Sunday.
The stylist must have a general overview
Saturday&#39;s lecture, full of information about the types of characters, was enriched by three guests from the field.
Stylist Honza Pokorný, fashion designer Jakub Polanka and fashion photographer Ben Renč.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and a stylist should be able to use it.
And a skilled stylist can work with one piece of clothing in different ways.
Variability is key in this case.
For example, such a trench coat (or, if you want originally a trench coat) can be worn classically over jeans and a T-shirt as a coat, but you can also wear it on the bare body, put on pumps and take pictures as a dress.
Or just roll up your sleeves or collar and the whole look looks different.
&quot;Play with it,&quot; he stressed.
But what I appreciated most was the following advice: &quot;You need to know the rules perfectly to work.&quot;
&quot;Then you can start breaking them,&quot; Jakub said.
Finally, it is clear to me why we are crushing all the lessons, what to combine with what, why, why, when we often see something else in fashion magazines.
Not to mention the shows.
Thanks to photographer Ben, I know that the stylist must have many more clothing variants ready than there are photos to be photographed.
So for a fashion story that will have ten pages (that is, ten outfits), I have to be prepared to &quot;set up&quot; at least fifteen.
And also that in the photo the clothes look and work in combination with other pieces sometimes completely differently than in reality.
So we have to take this into account when creating an outfit.
Honza Pokorný confirmed to us that image and style sometimes do up to half the success.
Just look at Madonna, who is not exactly a miracle singer, but her image and marketing have made her a world star.
In the Czech Republic, the approach to using the services of stylists is still rather cold.
Even familiar faces sometimes consider it useless (it is enough that I can do something, the way I look at it is secondary).
And if someone has a styling created by us, then we have to reckon with the fact that they most likely dictate a completely different (smaller) size to us than they really have.
Then all that remains is to googgle and see if the boulevard has written that the celebrity has gained weight / weight and the like.
On Sunday, both Honza and Mario told us that it was not enough for a stylist to orient himself in fashion and be able to put together an outfit.
In his work, he mainly communicates with the people he dresses, so it is important to be a good psychologist.
To be able to guess people, not to encourage oneself, to stand up for one&#39;s opinion.
&quot;When a manager orders you to sort her wardrobe and add nice pieces, you can&#39;t throw her out of the closet and say, for God&#39;s sake, that&#39;s horrible.&quot;
&quot;Find at least a few things to praise and recommend what to wear,&quot; says Mario.
He also specifically showed us what all the so-called &quot;placovka&quot; must contain, or a bag for a place.
It&#39;s the one you fasten around your waist and you have all the necessary properties with you.
In addition to clear things, such as scissors, a hair roller or safety pins, there is also a nylon thread (with it, the stylist helps with the shooting of products such as handbags or hats), special clips to fasten the back of clothing, if larger (pin or other staples are not allowed, they would damage the garment) or the sewing kit.
In order not only to listen, but also to try something in practice, we learned how to glue the shoes properly.
Even when shooting in a studio where the surface is flat, the sole could be damaged, let alone outdoors.
And so we glued and glued.
We must not even use the scissors to touch the shoes so that they are not accidentally damaged.
So you really need skill.
Mario pleased me when he praised my creation without reservation.
The mentioned skill is really not my friend.
This is just a tiny fraction of what we heard about the second weekend of the course.
It&#39;s becoming increasingly clear to me that a professional-style styling isn&#39;t really a walk in the rose garden, no matter who wants what.
In Need for Speed: The Run, they race across America.
Review
Originally a carefree ride, it turns into a routine morning trip to the shift due to a series of completely unnecessary sloppy mistakes.
The ambitions have been largely fulfilled, but this is not valid when no one clearly wanted to do anything extra.
The new episode, subtitled The Run, raised high expectations before its release.
He promised to move the age-old racing series Need for Speed a bit in a new direction again, and from the playable demonstrations he seemed like a game that wouldn&#39;t have to be just in numbers in the action racing genre.
We were also curious how the inserted passages would turn out, in which the main character gets out of the car and runs his own way.
However, as is customary with the NFS series, many are a little different than we expected.
These are potentially decent arcade races, but the whole thing pulls down a few unnecessary mistakes that have been appearing in the series for more or less several years.
So it&#39;s not really a mistake, but rather a manifestation of some incomprehensible laziness of the developers.
The adventure starts very well.
You are introduced to a story whose main character Jack has certain personal problems and as a solution is to participate in an illegal race across America.
You will get behind the wheel on the west coast of San Francisco and your task is to arrive in New York first.
The idea carries several interesting elements.
The route is divided into ten stages, and then into more than fifty races.
It follows that each race is run on a different track and the stages are set in different, sufficiently different and interesting environments.
One does not feel even for a moment that the game would always offer the same thing.
In addition, some of the environments are very nice to look at, although the technical level of the graphics corresponds to the previous parts of the series.
So it&#39;s nothing world-breaking.
But driving across the desert, autumn landscape or high in the snowy mountains is very visually pleasing.
In addition, the races are diversified from time to time with some atypical element.
In the desert, for example, you get caught up in a sandstorm, which greatly reduces visibility.
In the mountains, on the other hand, you have to be careful not to be overwhelmed by an avalanche.
In addition, the individual races are deployed quite well in a row.
There are only a few types, but that&#39;s enough.
For a while you try to overtake the required number of opponents (basically a classic race), then you catch up again (classic duel with a stopwatch) and then a duel with a single opponent awaits you.
From time to time, the police will get involved, making your whole effort even more uncomfortable.
A novelty are the passages outside the car.
It&#39;s more just an interactive animation, where Jack usually runs away from someone and you have to help him by pressing the right buttons at the right moments.
Nothing complicated.
But it is surprising that there are far fewer of these passages in the game than you would expect (specifically, perhaps even just three).
As a result, however, it is to the benefit of the matter, because this element does not have a chance to become annoying, and in the context of the above, it is one of the elements that diversify the game.
The ride model follows in the footsteps of previous parts.
This means that it is definitely not anything nowadays, but it cannot be said that it is a negative.
If you are looking for a realistic simulation, you will have to look elsewhere.
But the local driving model still suits the more action-packed racing quite well, even though we could find a better one in the competition.
So far, everything is in perfect order.
But problems start to appear after a while.
Unlike the driving model, the collision model is no longer very good.
We don&#39;t expect this type of game to calculate complex deformations and collisions, but if you have virtually no idea how your car will behave before virtually any impact on any object, then everything is probably not quite right.
Typically, when overtaking or passing cars in normal traffic, sometimes you only lick each other slightly, but other times in an almost identical situation, your car will end up in wild pirouettes.
Or even straightforward.
Thanks to the system of restarts, it doesn&#39;t matter much, but it will upset you reliably.
Restarts are solved in such a way that if you smash or drive far off the track, the game throws you back to the last clue point on the track.
But there are only five restarts available in each race.
When you run out of them, you have to start the race again from the beginning.
So it&#39;s more of a tool in case something goes wrong than you can rely on them.
But sometimes even restarts don&#39;t help, they will only be solved by the need to memorize a given section of the race.
The big draw of the game is that the same things often happen in the same places.
For example, some corners need to be traversed in a specific way, otherwise you simply cannot fit into them.
Other times, you will always meet &quot;civilian&quot; cars in the same configuration, whether you arrive first, fifth, five seconds earlier or a minute later.
This is especially annoying in situations where you see an opponent passing easily between two oncoming cars in front of you, while when you get there, the cars are already in such a position that you have to go around or brake them.
It doesn&#39;t matter when you reach them, because it is &quot;calculated&quot; so that the situation always occurs just before your nose.
Opponents have another advantage.
During the entire game, you will come across several places where, again regardless of the time, you will always be overtaken by the same opponent in the same place.
It hits the hardest at the end of the game on the long bridge, where you go in the opposite direction.
The opponent must get there in front of you, obviously at any cost.
When he drives in front of you, it makes your overview of oncoming cars worse, so at first you get around a few times.
You can understand the intention to make the game more exciting and adrenaline-fueled, but the design is so obvious that it will reliably disgust you quickly.
And it&#39;s a shame, because despite the simple driving model, playing is fun and sometimes so action-packed that sometimes you literally don&#39;t have time to watch where something is flying.
And it basically doesn&#39;t matter whether the concept with fifty unique tracks, the arrangement of races so that boredom doesn&#39;t stand a chance, or anything else is responsible for that.
An unconventional idea is to change cars during the races.
You have to watch out for petrol stations on the road, because that&#39;s where you can change your car, even though in the vast majority of cases you can do with what you have.
The cars are divided into three categories.
Sports cars are suitable for urban areas, strong American crashes on straight highways and exotic supersports for technical riding, for example on winding mountain roads.
The main story mode goes hand in hand with the challenge mode, which are races in individual locations that you know from the story.
Here you get not only medals, but also experience points for your profile, which is common to challenges and stories.
To gain a higher level of driver, various objects are unlocked: starting with the cars and ending with the background for the profile.
At the same time, it is again connected to the online Autolog function, which, among other things, compares your results with other players and provides other community functions.
One of the other hard-to-understand kicks is the situation from the last race in the story.
With your car you get to the subway tunnel (be it), where you drive in the dark on the tracks (be it).
The numbers on the tachometer flash between 150 and 200 km / h (so be it), and the subway train comes in from behind and scrapes you uncompromisingly.
In the newsroom, we will probably have a discussion for a few more days about whether no one really thought even a bit when creating the game, or whether the authors consider us to be really big idiots.
The technical side of the game is nothing extra, but at least the overall visual impression is in most cases very pleasant and in some cases even great.
It freezes so that in some tense moments the shooting decreases, and in some cases quite tragically.
However, this applies especially to crashes with a larger number of participants, when smooth shooting would no longer be valid for you anyway.
The sound page is fine and the soundtrack is a matter of taste.
In an effort to please the widest possible range of rather younger audiences, a soundtrack from the category &quot;every dog a different village&quot; was created, but it can be assumed that because of listening to music, someone will probably not buy the game just like that.
The overall impression of Need for Speed: The Run is so embarrassing.
If the game avoids completely unnecessary mistakes, then we would not be afraid to say that The Run is the best work of NFS in the last few years.
But this is how the game looks unfinished.
Fun is definitely nice, but be prepared for the mistakes to strike you in the eye with the power of airport searchlights.

Ambassador to the EU Vicenová:
The Czechs have a reputation for being negativists and Eurosceptics
&quot;The Lisbon Treaty has quite upset the balance between the institutions.&quot;
&quot;I didn&#39;t expect it to be such a tough war.&quot;
&quot;It will take five or six years for the situation to stabilize, calm down and all players get used to their new roles,&quot; Czech Ambassador to the European Union Milena Vicenová began her lecture at the Faculty of Law.
She took her motto &quot;Clearly and openly about Europe&quot; seriously in the first part of the lecture, when she managed to describe the individual EU institutions and their relations in such a clear and understandable way that many lecturers from the Faculty of Law of Charles University could envy her.
Vicen also praised the work of the new permanent President of the European Council, Herman Van Rompuy:
&quot;At first there was criticism that he was indistinct, that he was a gray official, that he could not play any role, and I must say that everyone was breathtaking, that he did that role well.&quot;
&quot;He is a man who can listen to twenty-seven Member States, communicate well with them and has a clear vision of where the European Union should go.&quot;
She then explained the new post of High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy in response to the question: &quot;Who is this European Union? Which telephone number should I call?&quot;, Ie as an important step towards unifying and making EU policy more readable to states such as China or India.
Nobody wants to ban us cheeses
Vicenová also addressed the agenda that the European Council has lived, lives and will live in the near future.
She called the Czech presidency a success last year.
The Czechs were resolving the coming financial crisis, resolving the gas crisis or holding a summit for the Eastern Partnership.
She then described the fall of the government at this time as a great negative, which severely damaged the Czech Republic.
The Czech representation in the EU is currently very busy.
In the words of the ambassador, the &quot;fact frmol&quot; was not only the presidency, but also the subsequent financial crisis, which is still being addressed today.
In addition, the Union&#39;s new seven-year budget has yet to be approved, which is complicated by the current economic situation.
Whether the budget will be lean and austere, which sectors will be given priority, which countries will be supported more and which less will all be on the agenda for future negotiations.
The ambassador also recalled her main slogans with which she came to Brussels: &quot;Understandably Europe.&quot;
&quot;I really don&#39;t like ugly abbreviations, foreign words, gimmicks that no one understands.
How should a citizen understand that curved or round cucumbers, bananas of various sizes are not really invented in Brussels, or that someone really has to forbid us cheese. &quot;
It also wants to make better use of the EU environment and get more Czechs into European institutions.
A multi-speed Europe awaits us
According to the ambassador, the Czechs have a reputation for Eurosceptics and people who notice the negative rather than the positive aspects of things.
In addition, she regrets the low representation of Czechs in European institutions.
According to her, many factors are to blame, such as the modesty of our candidates, their inability to write cover letters, but also the low support from the Czech side.
In addition to the successful Czech presidency, she highlighted the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Four.
&quot;Believe me, when a Pole and a Hungarian come to me and a Slovak is approaching, the Frenchman next to me will say, &#39;Look, what are you meeting there, what about your Visegrad Four?&#39;, And he doesn&#39;t look enthusiastic about it at all.&quot;
In the future, according to Vicenová, the Union will mainly face new hard rules for the budgetary policies of the member states.
He sees the concept of a two-speed, if not multi-speed Europe, rather than a new &quot;European federation&quot; as very real.
&quot;We have eurozone countries and countries outside the eurozone.&quot;
&quot;We have the Schengen area, we already have the institute of enhanced cooperation.&quot;
&quot;For the first time, it was said that only the countries that want and those that do not want to work together should work together.&quot;
&quot;There will be more of those institutes and it will be a strong two-speed Europe,&quot; Vicenová expects.
In this regard, she also praised the role of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuy in promoting the principle that all issues that have an impact on the Union as a whole should be discussed between all Member States, not just between euro area countries.
Brand story:
The IBM innovator begins the second century of its existence
If someone was looking for the word that most accurately reflects IBM&#39;s strategy, the closest would probably be &quot;longevity.&quot;
For the general public, IBM is a symbol of the technological revolution, a company that is perceived as very contemporary, and yet a hundred years have passed since its founding.
The basis of this longevity was laid by the company&#39;s first boss, the visionary Thomas J. Watson Sr.
He has already coined the motto that many of the world&#39;s problems can be easily solved if people are willing to think.
His motto &quot;Think!&quot; it thus became the imprint around which the life of the future giant will unfold (and also the name of an internal magazine, which began publishing in IBM as early as 1935).
It was also the basis of Watson&#39;s carefully built corporate culture.
&quot;For us at IBM, long - term thinking means a continuous move towards the future.
IBM survived and prospered for a hundred years because it remained true to its core values without being afraid to change everything else around it.
This allowed us to transform technology, business and society during our first century.
We hope to be able to achieve even more in the second hundred, &quot;said Samuel J. Palmisano, the company&#39;s current director, on the anniversary.
Sophisticated system
In the 1930s, Watson approached the care of his employees similarly to Baťa&#39;s entrepreneur in the Czech Republic - IBM people were one of the first American employees to have paid leave, employer insurance plus an elegant employee uniform and a sophisticated system for rewarding the best inventors and traders.
IBM has a long-standing relationship with the customer.
From the beginning, the company has been a genius in talent mining - as one of the world&#39;s first companies to eliminate any discrimination, so it could choose.
In line with the anti-discrimination strategy, the current plan is for Palmisana to be headed by IBM next year - a woman - Virginia Rometty.
She has been with IBM for thirty years, and still holds the position of Head of Sales, Marketing and Strategy.
In recent years, IBM has been doing so-called pits, online brainstorming, from which many future strategies and innovations emerge.
No wonder there are plenty of ideas - the company employs almost half a million people.
Institutions with a good reputation
A strong position in business is ensured by the company&#39;s strong internal and external image.
&quot;From the beginning, IBM had the concept of an institution rather than just a technology company,&quot; Rosh Moss Kanter, a professor at Harvard Business School and author of an IBM book, told the Economist.
&quot;IBM is not a technology company, but a company that helps solve business problems using technology,&quot; added George Colony of Forrester Research.
As the company itself says, the difference between entering the market and creating the market right away.
IBM - or &quot;Big Blue&quot;, as it is famously known for its logo in the United States - has grown into one of the world&#39;s largest companies in a hundred years.
It is probably the most versatile technology company - it develops hardware and software, infrastructure, hosting and consulting services in a range of products from servers to nanotechnology.
It holds the most patents of any American technology company and five of its employees have won the Nobel Prize.
Her inventions include, for example, an ATM, a payment card, a financial swap, a bar code or a floppy disk.
IBM, with about $ 220 billion, became the second largest technology company by market capitalization this year (Apple is the first) when it overtook Microsoft for the first time since 1996.
Looking ahead
Not all products and innovations have met the tastes of customers and times - for example, IBM has failed to bet on its own OS / 2 operating system, Prodigy online services or IBM PCjr computers.
&quot;If your business is built on moving forward, you can&#39;t be emotionally attached to the past,&quot; notes Samuel J. Palmisano.
That&#39;s why IBM has no problem building its foundations on many platforms - and if they don&#39;t work, abandon them.
Unlike, for example, the competing Microsoft, which basically stands and falls on the Windows operating system.
Perspective technology
Services account for the largest share of IBM&#39;s revenues, with software and hardware accounting for about a fifth.
At the same time, in 1990 he was the strongest representative of hardware with more than a half share.
Since 2000, IBM has sold $ 15 billion in low-yield assets, while investing $ 58 billion in the purchase of promising technologies.
It has continued to invest since 2008, when the modern financial crisis swept the world for the first time.
IBM is following the legacy of its first boss, Thomas J. Watson, who also increased investment during the Great Depression.
So far, IBM seems to be intact with the current crisis.
The share price of IBM has risen by a rocket of 120 percent since the beginning of 2008, the company&#39;s net profit is constantly growing.
IBM&#39;s corporate motto is to change everything but its values.
It can therefore be expected that even if another crisis comes, this flexible giant will handle it.
IBM History: From the cheese slicer to space flights
IBM (International Business Machines) was founded in New York a hundred years ago, originally with the complex name Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
It took over the name IBM only in 1924 - it was originally a brand used for the company&#39;s branches in Canada and South America.
The basis for the later IBM was laid by the merger of four companies whose history dates back to the eighties of the nineteenth century.
They owned technologies such as the famous &quot;punchers,&quot; ie hours that record the employee&#39;s arrival and departure.
The architect of the new company was businessman Charles Ranlett Flint, who until 1930 also chaired the company&#39;s supervisory board.
Flint hired rival company firm Thomas J. Watson to help him run the company.
The leader then overshadowed the founders of IBM - an invincible corporate culture and identity are still built on Watson&#39;s ideas.
Watson ran the company until 1952.
IBM, as its name suggests, began manufacturing and selling all sorts of business machines - from meat and cheese slicers to cash registers.
During the first four years that Watson was in charge of the company, turnover doubled to nine million dollars and the company&#39;s extensive expansion to all continents began.
Watson was so indispensable to the company that after almost forty years in his boss chair, he was replaced by his son, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under his leadership, IBM began working on the development of artificial intelligence, developing the first programming language.
In the 1960s, people and computers from IBM helped NASA control space flights - to Mercury, Saturn and, in 1969, the famous human flight to the moon.
Meanwhile, in 1964, IBM developed the first family of computers - the IBM System / 360 series.
The classic &quot;caregiver,&quot; which set the computer standard of the time, was called the IBM 5150 in 1981.
Twenty years later, IBM sold its computer manufacturing business to Lenovo&#39;s Chinese company, bought PricewaterhouseCoopers&#39; consulting business, and began to focus fully on high value-added consulting and services.
The strategy that has paid off for IBM over the last three years is the concept of Smarter Planet, a &quot;smarter planet&quot;.
Its goal is the clever use of technology in hitherto unplanned areas, and the improvement of the situation, for example in transport or urban administration.
For business, IBM recently introduced the &quot;Smarter Commerce&quot; platform, which helps merchants manage the entire business cycle.
IBM has a strong history in the country.
It established its branch in the then Czechoslovakia as early as 1932 as the first country in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, in addition to IBM CR, it also operates a strategic outsourcing center in Brno.
The headquarters for Central and Eastern Europe is located in Prague and there is also a world-class research team dealing with voice recognition.
Rychtářová about her unfaithful husband:
Iveta, keep that donkey, I don&#39;t want him anymore!
Darina Rychtářová (53) said the end!
After her husband Josef Rychtář (53) became not only the protector of Iveta Bartošová (45), but also a lover, Darina still hoped that Josef would wake up from a pink dream and return home.
But now she does not intend to wait and has set clear rules for the rest of her life.
&quot;Pepa can return home, but no longer as my partner,&quot; Rychtářová explained.
When Darina Rychtářová granted Bartošová asylum in her house in the summer, she probably didn&#39;t even think how her marriage would end.
Despite the fact that Iveta moved from Říčany at her urging after 30 days, Pepa did not leave the singer.
He even publicly admitted that he loved her.
Over time, Darina resigned, seemingly reconciled with her husband&#39;s relationship, and now even said goodbye to him forever.
The magistrate doesn&#39;t care who his wife sleeps with
If Rychtář and Bartošová broke up only once, the open arms of his wife would not be waiting for him at home.
&quot;He is the biological father of my sons, and if he wants to live his life in our common house, no one will drive him out.&quot;
&quot;However, he will live to see him not as my beloved, lost old donkey, but as a person with whom I have certain ties,&quot; Rychtářová revealed, saying that she had already detached herself from her husband and insisted only on mutual decency.
Josef doesn&#39;t mind Darina closing his back door yet.
&quot;I respect my wife&#39;s decision.&quot;
&quot;I&#39;ll be with Iveta and I&#39;m not going to change that.&quot;
&quot;My wife has set up a paper marriage, and I respect that.&quot;
&quot;The company goes on, I take care of repairs, garden, real estate, I buy.&quot;
&quot;Darina and I are talking quite normally, just that we don&#39;t share a bed,&quot; Rychtář told Blesk.
If Rychtářová also found a new love, she would not be prevented from doing so.
&quot;We don&#39;t sleep together and I don&#39;t care where he goes, who he goes with and if he has a boyfriend.
I know it&#39;s my fault, I fell in love with Iveta and I take all the responsibility, &quot;Josef concluded.
Worst female bad habits: Do they affect you too?
When you ask men if they can name some typical female vices, they usually put them out of their sleeves very quickly.
Dear women, do you recognize yourself in the following lines, where there are some female vices that can perfectly pump men&#39;s blood in their veins?
Shopping
Does your other half blame you for being addicted to shopping?
Do you have to buy at least one cloth a week?
Do you like to shop in bulk at discounts?
Then, in your case, you can talk about shopping as a bad habit.
Some women realize that they should at least tame their shopping passion.
But tell me who would resist just walking through clothing stores, looking for top-fitting uppers, and then try them all (ideally in different colors) in the booth?
Although shopping is a hobby for most women, it can literally become a finished hell for men.
Just remember how many times you&#39;ve told yours to wait for you in front of the entrance ...
Constant dissatisfaction
&quot;Am I too fat?&quot;
&quot;I need to lose at least five pounds - should I start exercising?&quot;
&quot;Do you even like me?&quot;
Don&#39;t these sentences remind you of something?
Right?
Then you are one of those women who is obsessed with how they look.
Not that you should stop taking care of yourself, but a lot of men are directly allergic to their partners constantly complaining about their appearance.
The stronger sex also agrees that the higher the frequency of this complaint, the more annoying women are.
Tidiness and cleanliness come first
It&#39;s like an endless carousel.
Washing windows, vacuuming, mopping tiles, wiping dust, scrubbing the bathtub - at least twice a week.
Do you blame your partner for stepping his dirty feet on the clean tiles, for the children for soiling the scrubbed washbasin and covering the glass living wall, which you put so much work into polishing?
If you suffer from this &quot;deviation&quot;, try to realize that nothing should be exaggerated and order and cleanliness should definitely not happen within the family in the first place.
This harmless desire for purity can jeopardize your relationships and family well-being.
Digging
&quot;Throw those used shorts in the trash.&quot;
&quot;Are you going to wear those old socks tomorrow too?&quot;
&quot;A wet cloth doesn&#39;t belong on the ground.&quot;
If you dig into your partner several times a day, know that you can reliably dial him.
Of course, you don&#39;t mean it badly, you want to make sure everything is in order.
Maybe if men knew, women wouldn&#39;t have to dig so hard into them ...
Gossiping, gossiping
For some women, slander, gossip, but also insult and association against someone are also inherent.
Women are focused on relationships, so they like to discuss things like who, where, with whom, how and why.
Perhaps each of us will release a little harmless gossip or slander here and there.
Hand on heart, it is proper to perhaps all women.
The opposite, however, is the gossip of the coarsest grain, which they like and often scratch, perhaps despise for everyone and are especially dangerous for their surroundings - especially within the women&#39;s work team.
Jágr and Voráček helped with the assistance of winning Philadelphia
Hockey striker Jaromír Jágr took part in Monday&#39;s NHL game with two assists in the Philadelphia 5: 3 victory on Carolina&#39;s ice and is again at the forefront of the productivity of Czech players in the competition.
In both cases, Claude Giroux benefited from the list of the 39-year-old star, who added another pass and was declared the best player of the match.
Jágr&#39;s teammate Jakub Voráček also recorded two assists in the match.
After the match, Jagr told overseas journalists that he had predicted a big evening for Giroux.
&quot;I told him before the match he would give a hat trick.&quot;
&quot;I felt it.&quot;
&quot;Sometimes you get that feeling,&quot; explained Jágr, after whose action Giroux scored a goal from the first Flyers shot.
A moment later, the team&#39;s second hit had a Czech track.
Voracek won the disc behind the goal of Hurricanes and presented it between the circles to the scoring Maxim Talbot.
The second before the first break was reduced by the home player Patrick Dwyer, but the beginning of the second part again belonged to Flyers.
Specifically to Giroux.
After working with Jáger, he scored the third goal, then converted his shot into Wayne Simmonds&#39;s fourth goal.
&quot;I love playing with him.&quot;
&quot;I don&#39;t want to say that he is the best player in the league, but he is definitely among the top three,&quot; Jágr praised his center.
&quot;It never occurred to me that at the end of my career I would play with a hockey player like him.&quot;
&quot;I&#39;m happy about that.&quot;
&quot;I want to play him.&quot;
&quot;All those years in the NHL, my teammates have been trying to play me, now it&#39;s turning around,&quot; Jagr added.
Carolina made the match a drama, with a goal by Tuom Ruutu and again Dwyer, who made his mark from a penalty shot, got the difference of one goal.
However, another complication was not allowed by Matt Read, who ended the renumbering two to one.
&quot;Pronger hit well in our zone.&quot;
&quot;He pushed the wheel, I picked up speed and (Read) drove to the far post.&quot;
&quot;I tried to hit him and I&#39;m glad it worked out,&quot; Voráček described the last goal of the match from his point of view.
With victory, Philadelphia took the lead in the Eastern Conference.
The Czech defender of Montreal Jaroslav Špaček did not finish the match against Buffalo, in the second period he resigned due to an injury in the upper body.
In addition to the experienced defender, the Candiens also lost their two-goal lead and lost after a 2: 3 penalty shootout.
One of their raids was not transformed by Tomáš Plekanec.
The home coach was saddened by the extensive marodka of the back rows rather than the lost points, while the match was played by only five defenders.
&quot;It is bad.&quot;
&quot;We only played the match with one experienced player, the rest were youngsters.&quot;
&quot;But there&#39;s nothing you can do about it, we have to deal with it,&quot; said Jacques Martin.
&quot;Rotation after rotation came over us and we couldn&#39;t resist.&quot;
&quot;We had to simplify the game more, move the puck out of our range.&quot;
We had gaps in that, &quot;added one of PK Subban&#39;s defenders.
The Czech goalkeeper Ondřej Pavelec contributed thirty Winnipeg hits to a 5: 2 victory over Tampa Bay.
The goals of the Jets, who interrupted the five-match series of losses, were shared by five different shooters.
How tour prices have evolved since 1989
Until 1989, only five state travel agencies were allowed in what was then Czechoslovakia: Čedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist.
At that time, travel agencies sold the vast majority only trips to the countries of the socialist bloc, as travel to the west was very limited.
Czech tourists traveled on holiday to the sea to the GDR (German Democratic Republic), the Soviet Union (Sochi in the Crimea by the Black Sea), Bulgaria, Romania (both to the Black Sea) and Hungary (Balaton).
A clear exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, when it was possible to travel to Yugoslavia, but then the Yugoslav regime leaned to the West and the trips of Czech tourists to Yugoslavia were subsequently very limited.
The great paradox of the socialist era was that the citizens of the socialist bloc (ie also Czechoslovaks) were not allowed to travel freely individually, even within socialist countries.
If a Czechoslovak citizen wanted to travel individually to Poland or the Soviet Union, for example, he needed an invitation letter from that country, otherwise an individual trip was not possible.
At that time, travel agencies also offered trips to the West, but it was necessary to stand in line overnight with a sleeping bag or to have &quot;good acquaintances&quot; in the travel agency.
However, it was not won anyway.
The so-called the foreign exchange promise, which was a condition for travel to the West, was not given to &quot;politically unreliable people&quot; who could not travel at all.
The Czechoslovak currency was not a freely convertible currency, so without a foreign exchange promise it was not possible to obtain funds (Western currency) for a trip to the West.
By far the most common, however, the Czechs spent their holidays in the country, which resulted in a large number of cottages and chalets that the Czechs bought, and this custom survives to this day.
The travel of Czechs has thus experienced a real revolution since 1989.
While until 1989, holidays in the GDR or Bulgaria were our maximum, last year Czechs spent 4.5 million holidays abroad in countries around the world.
A huge paradox, which we no longer realize today, is that it was not possible to travel freely to our currently most popular Croatia until 1989 until it was part of the then Yugoslavia.
In the early 1990s, the visa requirement for neighboring Western European countries was abolished, which started a huge wave of short-term visits, especially to Vienna and Germany in Austria.
For a long time, the Czechoslovaks could not get enough of trips to the West, everyone wanted to look there, at least for a while.
In Paris, for example, Czechs&#39; tours in the parks slept in tents, as our income at the time did not allow us to pay for a hotel or boarding house.
A typical feature of Czech travel at this time was bringing their own food, canned food, salami, etc. to save money.
Another important moment was the introduction of the freely convertible Czech crown, which allowed our tourists to finally freely buy the Western currency after many decades.
However, our standard of living and with it our average salaries rose, which resulted in another important moment around 1997.
Due to the increased demand for travel, travel agencies have been preparing to arrange tours on charter flights on a regular basis since 1997, making air tours incredibly cheaper than in the past thanks to the possibility to negotiate volume discounts.
By the end of the 1990s, Czechs already had visa-free travel to virtually all developed countries of the world, except the USA, which continued to facilitate our travel.
Another interesting moment in the history of post-revolutionary travel occurred in 2000, when, thanks to considerable demand, the historically first direct charter flight to exotics was sent from the Czech Republic to Thailand.
Since this year, direct charters have been flying with Czech tourists to warm distant countries every year, and this winter it will fly directly from the Czech Republic to twelve exotic destinations.
Exotic countries are currently visited by around 100,000 Czechs a year!
Another interesting moment in this period, which symbolizes our post - revolutionary development, came in 2008.
On November 17, 2008, the USA canceled visas for Czech tourists, making our country one of the most developed countries in the world.
In 2008, for the first time in history, Czechs also spent more than half of their holidays abroad (50.3%) and for the first time in history spent more than 15 thousand for one holiday abroad, including costs at the place of residence. CZK per person.
The general meeting is to find the chairman, but again there is a threat of a stalemate
For almost five months, Czech football has been without a chairman and there is a risk that Ivan Hašek&#39;s successor at the head of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FACR) will not be known even after another extraordinary general meeting, which will take place on Thursday in Nymburk.
There is still no agreement on which electoral rules will be followed.
Without it, there will be no vote on which of the three candidates will be elected.
Jindřich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Paclík are interested in leading Czech football.
Hasek resigned in June and when he left he called on his colleagues to unite and find a strong personality who would lead football in the future.
But in the post-Hašek era, football slipped back to the quarrels between the two federal chambers, which cannot agree on a common candidate.
This became fully apparent on 16 September, when the new chairman was to be elected.
The delegates of the General Meeting gathered unnecessarily at the National House in Prague-Smíchov, as the meeting remained blocked and it was not just a matter of election.
There was no agreement on who has the right to vote at the meeting - whether only the statutory representatives or even the officials authorized by the power of attorney.
There has been a partial consensus on this single point since then, which was helped by the recommendation of the Institute for State and Law, according to which representation on the basis of a power of attorney is not possible.
But there are still disputes over the electoral order.
The executive committee, which is no longer dealing with anything else in its meetings, whether regular or extraordinary, has not brought the situation too clearly.
The view of choice has changed several times, but the neuralgic point is still the same.
The question is: how to proceed in the 3rd round to exclude the possibility of a heel?
&quot;The dispute is whether to proceed in accordance with the statutes or find another model,&quot; said Dušan Svoboda, one of the three vice-chairmen of the FACR, who represents professional football in the leadership of the association.
According to the model proposed by the statutes, in the third round, the candidate with the greater percentage support in the chamber for which he is running will win.
Moravia is reportedly willing to go for a concession to win a candidate who gets a higher sum of percentages of votes from both chambers.
And the Czech side enforces the condition that the winner must gain at least a two-thirds advantage in this percentage census.
&quot;But then the two previous rounds would lose its meaning, it would completely negate the two-chamber concept,&quot; he understands the objections of the Moravian party Svoboda, according to which it would be best not to bend and vote according to valid statutes.
Somewhat surprisingly, Tomáš Paclík agrees with this, although it is estimated that the electoral rules determined by the statutes suit Pelt the most.
&quot;I want to be elected according to the statutes at most.&quot;
&quot;In order not to invent any surrogate nonsense as at the last general meeting,&quot; said the owner Viktorie Plzeň, who is running for the first time and in his statements he defined himself mainly against Pelt.
Pelta remains optimistic.
According to him, the new president will be known in Nymburk and he believes that the candidates will cooperate constructively together in the future.
&quot;All passions will be calmed by today&#39;s possible progress of the national team to the European Championships.&quot;
&quot;Football will be on a happy wave again, there will be a greater willingness to cooperate,&quot; says the Jablonec official, who has the greatest experience of managing football at both the professional and regional levels.
Rajchl is more reserved.
&quot;I hope for a deal, but unfortunately the situation is very divided.&quot;
&quot;It&#39;s not among the people of Bohemia and Moravia, but there are efforts to purposefully adapt the regulations.&quot;
&quot;This may cause the general meeting to be blocked again.&quot;
&quot;But I hope common sense wins,&quot; Rajchl said.
There is not much time left for an agreement of all parties.
Some negotiations were supposed to take place directly in Montenegro, but who knows if the football general will be complete by the match.
The air special, in which Vice-Presidents Dalibor Kučera and Rajchl, among others, were to travel to Podgorica, did not leave Prague in the morning due to a technical failure, and an alternative option was sought to transport part of the executive committee to the site of the retaliation.
In the end, a ministerial meeting may be decisive, which may reportedly take place on Wednesday.
The Minister of Education, Youth and Sports, Josef Dobeš, would like to get the divided parties within the strongest sports association in the country to reach an agreement.
There is a lot at stake: state subsidies, the credibility of football and also the upcoming general meeting of ČSTV, which will address the new direction of Czech sport after Sazka&#39;s financial problems.
Paclík goes to fight for the chairman because he does not see a suitable candidate
If the head of the football players of Pilsen, Tomáš Paclík, had seen a strong candidate before the extraordinary general meeting, who would have met all his ideas about the new chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FACR), he would not even have signed up for the top position.
&quot;If a quality adept exists, I will fight for him and I will not go to the polls.&quot;
&quot;But in the current situation, no one like that could be found,&quot; Paclík told ČTK.
In the duel with Miroslav Pelta and Jindřich Rajchl, Paclík is motivated by motivation to try to prevent Pelte, the alleged favorite of the elections, from getting in the way at the head of the FACR.
Paclík also emphasizes that in the event of his victory, he would last in the role of chairman only until 2013, when the regular general meeting is on the agenda.
In the future, he would like to see an experienced and top manager in office, who is not very connected with football events.
&quot;I&#39;ve talked to some people who might be eligible.&quot;
&quot;It was crazy for me when some said that at the moment they didn&#39;t even want to identify with Czech football.&quot;
&quot;I would like to change that view,&quot; he said.
Paclík is now most annoyed by Pelt&#39;s connection with the chairman of the Pilsen Regional Football Association, Roman Berbr, a man with a controversial reputation, who is known behind the scenes as a powerful lobbyist with the ability to influence the voting of delegates at the general meeting.
It is so unacceptable for Paclík for Pelta to hold the presidency.
&quot;If he won, the current situation would be preserved and nothing in football would move forward.&quot;
&quot;Combined with the support of Berbra, who is a skilled businessman, it would not benefit football even more,&quot; Paclík said.
He also points out that Pelt&#39;s name was heard in wiretaps years ago during the investigation of the corruption scandal, from which, however, Pelta came out without punishment.
&quot;I don&#39;t know what prestige Pelt&#39;s victory would bring to football.&quot;
&quot;And what would we also look like in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA,&quot; said Paclík, who, however, is already taking into account his former statement that he would &quot;sell the Pilsen club if Pelta became chairman&quot;.
In the event that Paclík triumphs in Thursday&#39;s election, he would be able to imagine future cooperation with Celta.
Another candidate, Rajchl, whom Paclík supported before the September general meeting, which ended in fiasco, thinks the same.
&quot;He (Pelta) would be the first one I went to.&quot;
&quot;He has great abilities.&quot;
&quot;I could imagine him, for example, as the head of the national team.&quot;
&quot;But he would not be able to manage the association.&quot;
&quot;I also don&#39;t stick my nose where I can&#39;t,&quot; said Paclík, who attracted a lot of attention in September by standing behind the dismissal of a panel of judges headed by Luděk Macela, who was replaced by Dagmar Damková.
Paclík claims that he would dare to lead the association.
He relies on his skills in managing private companies, and since last summer he has also been the head of Pilsen, which, with his support, celebrated its premier league triumph in May.
&quot;I have the strength to make a difference in the football environment to contribute to a certain cultivation of it.&quot;
&quot;In order to limit the influences of some interest groups, which, for example, tend to influence the disciplinary and appeals commission, which treats into disgusting situations,&quot; said Paclík, who does not hide his antipathy to, for example, the Spartan boss Daniel Křetínský.
He would also consider the strengthening of the FACR&#39;s relations with the Czech Olympic Committee to be one of its priorities, with the help of which it would lobby political leaders to get more money from the lottery tax into sports.
&quot;It&#39;s one of the key things the new president should do.&quot;
&quot;If gambling is taxed, as the political parties declare, I understand their argument, but they have to say, flatly, where the money will go,&quot; he said.
Paclík now does not take his connection with the Pilsen club as a burden, although he himself claims that the chairman of the FACR should be &quot;supra-party&quot;.
Pelta is again connected with Jablonec, Rajchl with Prague&#39;s Dukla.
&quot;It&#39;s not perfect.&quot;
&quot;But I don&#39;t even see the point of hypocritically transferring my shares to someone in the Pilsen club and returning there in a year and a half,&quot; Paclík said.
Pelta promised new statutes of the FACR, which would exclude the election stalemate
Two days before the general meeting of the football association, one of the candidates for chairman, Miroslav Pelta, promised that in the event of an election, he would push for the FACR to have new statutes that would definitively rule out disputes over the electoral rules in the future.
The Jablonec official is optimistic before Thursday&#39;s meeting in Nymburk and believes that the pre-election fight will significantly dampen the eventual success of the football team today.
Even before the unsuccessful election in September, Pelta promised that he intends to focus on representation and raising funds in the event of an election.
He decided to go to the election before the last general meeting at the last minute, so a two-month postponement could be useful for him to defend his ideas about football management and present them in a broader context.
&quot;People at all levels have been playing football for a long time and expect the chairman to be known on Thursday.&quot;
&quot;He feels it&#39;s high time someone led the association,&quot; said the man, who is primarily associated with the Jablonec club, but who worked for many years in Sparta and the union&#39;s executive committee.
That is why he believes that he has enough experience to be able to drive Czech football.
He is convinced that the current problems with the election are due to the euphoria that prevailed during the reign of Ivan Hašek.
&quot;Unfortunately, at the June general meeting, the statutes were approved, which were not as perfect as everyone thought.&quot;
&quot;If they did not allow different interpretations, we have had the chairman since September,&quot; Pelta warned.
He conceived the reworking of the most important document of the civic association as a twig to the delegates.
&quot;If I become chairman, I will take it as a personal task and I am willing to take personal responsibility if it fails.&quot;
&quot;It&#39;s a matter of principle that we can&#39;t be without,&quot; Pelta says.
He continues to try not to limit himself against his opponents.
He had previously announced that he could imagine working with Jindřich Rajchl, whom he recognized for his legal education, and he knew very well that his opponent would be its first vice-president.
He did not attack Tomáš Paclík for a long time either, who, on the contrary, did not leave the thread dry on Pelt.
&quot;He&#39;s been in football for a little over a year, he&#39;s already had some success.&quot;
&quot;However, his attacks were undignified and a lot of people were taken aback by the election campaign.&quot;
&quot;This is one of the reasons why many of them now doubt its true nature,&quot; he said to his opponent, Pelta, who is said to remain faithful to the proclamations he announced in September.
According to him, his strongest weapon is his knowledge of football from the lowest competitions to the national team.
It should be a showcase for football.
&quot;And I would also try to end all affairs, starting with the Bohemians case or the echoes of last year&#39;s corruption scandal.&quot;
&quot;Immediately afterwards, I would throw myself into negotiations with the private and state sectors to secure enough money for the entire football team,&quot; the 46-year-old candidate told ČTK two months ago.
At the time, he also promised that his arrival at the helm of football would not mean any personnel purges.
&quot;I would first have to get acquainted with the content of individual employees,&quot; he pointed to Strahov, where there is an understandable nervousness about the long anarchy.
Despite the current catastrophic scenarios that accompany the forthcoming general meeting, he believes that delegates will not go to Nymburk unnecessarily on Thursday.
&quot;If the only point of contention is how he will be elected in the third round, then we can move on.&quot;
&quot;Football needs credibility, and it will only gain that by finally having its leader again,&quot; Pelta remains optimistic two days before the possibly decisive day of his official career.
Rajchl promises that the FACR would start working hard under him
If the current vice-chairman Jindřich Rajchl were elected the new chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic at Thursday&#39;s general meeting, many people in the association would not be pleased.
Rajchl promises that if he is elected, he will start working hard.
It wants to enforce systemic changes and make the members of the executive committee responsible for individual football areas.
He also promised to resolve the Bohemians&#39; case, improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, bring more money into football and continue the work begun by previous chairman Ivan Hasek.
&quot;As President, I would like to focus on football as a whole.&quot;
&quot;From international contacts with UEFA and FIFA through national team, professional football, performance football to youth.&quot;
&quot;But I&#39;m not saying that I would do everything myself,&quot; Rajchl told ČTK.
&quot;I am a team player and I want to divide competencies in the executive committee so that each member focuses on a certain area.&quot;
&quot;And I will give away hard tasks in order to move football one mile forward in each of these segments.&quot;
&quot;A lot of people probably wouldn&#39;t be happy, because it would start to work really hard and not just criticize the work of others,&quot; he added.
Due to the critical atmosphere in the football movement, he allegedly considered not running again.
&quot;I know I work 20 hours a day.&quot;
&quot;But I need to know that it will make sense and that I will not have people behind me who will constantly throw sticks at my feet and question my every step,&quot; he explained why he hesitated.
&quot;But a lot of people told me I shouldn&#39;t give up, because then others would give up.&quot;
&quot;It&#39;s a trust I can&#39;t just throw away,&quot; he said.
He is also said to be motivated by continuing the work he started with Hašek.
&quot;A lot of work has been done in those two years, and I don&#39;t want to throw it away now.&quot;
&quot;Processes have been started, which will have an impact after a few years, for example, and I would not like anyone to stop them,&quot; he said with concern that if another candidate, Miroslav Pelta, was elected, the situation at the union could return to before Hašek.
&quot;I believe in systematics, and that&#39;s something I don&#39;t think Mirek Pelta can do.&quot;
&quot;Above all, there are people behind him who would make football in such a way that it would only be for the chosen ones.&quot;
&quot;I can be blamed for a lot of things, but certainly not for being a side member.&quot;
&quot;I try to be objective.&quot;
&quot;I want to make football for everyone, because then everyone will be fine and not just the chosen ones,&quot; Rajchl remarked.
He also refutes the claim that he would only be the Czech chairman.
&quot;Even though some people are trying to say the opposite, I plan to do the maximum for Moravia.&quot;
&quot;For example, it is time to think that the second league would be divided into the Czech and Moravian parts, whose winners would go to the first league.&quot;
&quot;This would not be the current situation where there are only three Moravian teams in the league, which is a problem for young players in Moravia,&quot; said Rajchl.
As the head of the Pilsen club, Tomáš Paclík, also took part in the fight for the chairman, Rajchl does not dare to estimate his chances of being elected.
&quot;But I still feel strong support in the Czech Chamber, which elected me as its vice-president and sees clear success behind me,&quot; said Rajchl, who considers his success to save tens of millions of crowns on unfavorable contracts, negotiate television contracts and negotiate lottery negotiations. of the law.
On the contrary, he takes part in the fact that the union does not pull together.
While he claims about Pelt that he is &quot;disqualified for restoring confidence in Czech football&quot;, he considers the second of Paclík&#39;s rivals to be a strong candidate who has something to offer football.
&quot;No one can doubt that he did a great job in Pilsen that year.&quot;
&quot;If he were elected, he would hopefully continue the things that Ivan Hašek started here and would not fundamentally change the staffing of the commissions.&quot;
&quot;He wouldn&#39;t want to twist it in his favor,&quot; says rivals Rajchl.
The most beautiful pools in Europe
Jump into the blue
Julia Stanek
Ufon&#39;s paddling pool, a luxurious swimming pool in Budapest: Those who travel in Europe can experience their blue miracle - and after exploring cities or traveling, let their tired feet relax in the thermal baths.
The book will show where the wellness by the water is the most beautiful.
When Iris Meder set out on a journey of discovery for the past one and a half years, her luggage was not to be missed: her swimsuit.
Lying on the water, looking up at the artistically shaped domes, she swam opposite the marble putti (figures of a small naked boy, a child (with wings)) waiting for her at the edge of the pool, admiring the carefully restored Art Nouveau swimming pools.
If she liked a swimming pool, she instantly entered it in her notebook - even with remarkable details about the construction and history of the building.
More than 200 swimming pools have been explored in this way by Meder, a historian of architecture, and now present them in her just-published book &quot;Badefreuden&quot;: People&#39;s Swimming Pools in Munich, Historic Swimming Pool Palaces in the Black Forest, &quot;Hard Core of Concrete Buildings&quot; in Taunus.
Her &quot;Journey to the Most Extraordinary Spas in Central Europe&quot; led her through 13 countries: In addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she visited sites in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland - and always one city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia. .
The 46-year-old German woman is a real enthusiast of swimming culture.
It doesn&#39;t exaggerate much with sports, says Meder - it&#39;s just something else in the water.
The only rage is that swimming fans have to settle for blue tiles and the smell of chlorine, while health runners can inhale the intoxicating scent of spruce forests or listen to the cheerful chirping of birds in the park.
&quot;One day I asked why swimming pools always have to be so ugly,&quot; says Mrs. Meder, who lives in Vienna.
&quot;So I started collecting nice swimming pools.&quot;
The water level doubles the architecture
Splashing in the diving pool and essential oils for the sauna - the well-being factor is therefore so great that it affects all the senses, so much Mrs. Meder.
And when the founders tried, swimming pools can be a real feast for the eyes: &quot;Instead of a floor, one has a water surface in a spa.&quot;
&quot;On the one hand, it is transparent, but on the other hand, it reflects the beauty of the whole building.&quot;
Everything is optically doubled: high vault, colorful tiles, diving boards.
The small-format picture volume &quot;Badefreuden (Joy of Bathing)&quot; provides everything you need to know about the architectural and cultural history of historical wellness oases on 190 pages - but above all it arouses the desire to jump into the blue.
Remarkable specimens were discovered by the swimming pool collector Mrs. Meder during her search in Hungary.
In addition to the wonderful healing baths, such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi Baths in Budapest, nitrate water has been found in the original karst cave (the cave baths in Miskolc-Tapolca) and the thermal baths, whose pools are filled with alkaline water and housed in a bottle-shaped building Thermal bath in Jászberény).
Many heated open-air swimming pools in Switzerland and Austria, on the other hand, offer a wonderful spectacle. While you can see the whole city from the Zurich rooftop swimming pool, you can take a dip in the St. George&#39;s rooftop swimming pool. Anton watching the snow-covered Arlberg - a: In the steam bath there is a window from which it is possible to watch the bustle of the ski slopes.
Perhaps the most remarkable design of the pool awaits spa guests in Längenfeld: The Ötztal Aquapark looks like a ufo that has just landed in the Alps.
In the winter, steam rises from three up-open basins as it rises to the sky in the background of the Ötztal mountain.
The Alhambra and the Black Forest
Not every swimming pool, Mrs. Meder&#39;s pool collector, had the smell of chlorine in her nostrils.
Many thermal baths smell of sulfur, in the Árpád Spa in Békescsaba, Hungary, it smells of fuel oil to such an extent that one can hardly believe that one has entered a medical spa.
The smell comes from healing water containing alkaline bicarbonates, which is almost black and whose deposits adhere to the skin as soon as a person slips into the pool - a somewhat special wellness experience.
However, Iris Meder was also disappointed in her search for beautiful spas: when she wanted to visit the Czech solar and climatic spa Luhačovice, she came across an enclosed terrain.
The spa, designed in 1902 by architect Dušan Jurkovič, was closed in the meantime.
When Mrs. Meder looked through the crumbling windows of the red-white-yellow Art Nouveau building, she saw the weeds growing heavily among the tiles.
Extinction, on the other hand, took place in a magical swimming pool in the Black Forest: the Palais Thermal in Bad Wildbad.
These spas have already completed three phases of construction; one can discover not only the neo-Romanesque elements that date back to its inception in 1844, but also the Moorish Alhambra-style hall, which was annexed around 1900.
Since a careful modernization in 1995, the Palais Thermal has been a popular spa resort for pool expert Iris Meder, not least because it comes from the Black Forest.
&quot;It&#39;s already a performance to combine such diverse building styles into such a beautiful complex,&quot; says Ms. Meder.
For such a palace, immersion in a thermal pool is probably a side issue.
Agrarian speculation
Deutsche Bank has its commodity trade inspected
Christian Teevs
Does Deutsche Bank leave its trade in agricultural raw materials?
According to SPIEGEL-ONLINE, Josef Ackermann commissioned a working group to investigate the consequences of speculation for the world&#39;s poor.
In January, the head of the group wants to draw conclusions from this.
Hamburg -
For the citizens, the matter is clear: according to one study, 84% of Germans find it unacceptable for banks to speculate on agricultural raw materials such as wheat or corn.
Two-thirds of respondents even demand that Deutsche Bank and other credit institutions withdraw from this deal because it exacerbates the problems of the world&#39;s poorest.
This is the result of a Forsa survey commissioned by the consumer organization Foodwatch.
The study is based on a report presented by Foodwatch in mid-October.
In it, author Harald Schumann shows that bets on global commodity exchanges drive up prices and that banks are therefore complicit in the global problem of hunger.
The consumer protection campaign is aimed specifically at Deutsche Bank boss Josef Ackermann, although big banks such as Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley also do the same.
Commodity bets were originally intended to insure traders against price fluctuations.
In the meantime, however, most experts agree that capital market participants interested in high-risk trading have detached themselves from supply and demand - and made profits at the expense of the poorest.
Other than competitors in the United States, Ackermann responded to criticism: He promised to investigate the allegations and said that no deal &quot;is worth putting Deutsche Bank&#39;s reputation at stake.&quot;
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international working group is reviewing complaints about the Foodwatch-Report.
The audit is to be closed by the end of the year, after which the results will be presented to the Board of Directors of Deutsche Bank - together with a recommendation on how to handle it.
At the end of January, the bank&#39;s representatives want to announce what consequences it will draw.
In the end, there could be a reduction in commodity trade or even a complete rejection.
Ackermann works on his own self-image.
Foodwatch boss Thilo Bode welcomed the report, but stepped up his criticism of the financial industry: &quot;Betting on rising food prices is showing particularly drastically how ruthless banks are harming the common good today.&quot;
May Ackermann, as the top banking lobbyist, live up to his responsibilities.
&quot;Deutsche Bank must remove from its portfolio all items that use money for food price bets,&quot; Bode said.
&quot;It doesn&#39;t matter if Mr. Ackermann is concerned about people suffering from hunger or the reputation of Deutsche Bank.&quot;
Ackermann&#39;s view seems surprising at first glance, but it is clear that the group boss would like to leave a perfect picture a few months before leaving office.
On Monday, Deutsche Bank announced that the head of the board of directors would not join the supervisory board other than planned.
By turning away from controversial agrarian speculation, he could improve his image.
And he doesn&#39;t have to worry about possible losses - his successor should eventually deal with it.
Every second would stop investing in raw materials
Foodwatch tries to keep the pressure on the manager.
So far, more than 30,000 Internet users have participated in the organization&#39;s campaign.
On Tuesday, Bode published a survey in which the Forsa Institute interviewed 1,001 people on November 7 and 8.
According to this, eleven percent consider it legitimate for Deutsche Bank to offer investments that involve food price bets.
Many bank customers would also draw personal consequences if they learned that their bank was involved in such transactions: Every second would, as a result of the survey, terminate all investments in which money flows into speculation on raw materials.
43 percent would warn acquaintances against such a bank, 49 percent said they would consider terminating their account and move to another institution.
21st century house in Vienna
Relocated pavilion
Ingeborg Wiensowski
A story of architecture with peaks, falls and a happy ending: The Austrian pavilion from the World Exhibition in Brussels in 1958 won prizes, became a museum in Vienna, remained empty and deserted.
It is now reopening as an exhibition house.
When it comes to modern post-war architecture, clear forms, glass halls, bold booms and new building materials that are typical of the belief in technical progress, then the Austrian pavilion of architect Karel Schwanzer for the 1958 Brussels World&#39;s Fair is an apt and famous example.
Schwanzer&#39;s pavilion received the Grand Prix d&#39;Architecture at the time for its light and sublime steel and glass construction.
The building is still considered a milestone in contemporary architecture.
He made the architect famous by also building the pavilion of Austria during the next world exhibitions.
With its legendary four-cylinder BMW Palace plus a key building in Munich, it finally became internationally famous in 1973.
His pavilion, designed as a temporary exhibition building after the World&#39;s Fair, was placed in the Schweizer Garten near Vienna&#39;s Südbahnhof (South Railway Station), renovated and opened the 20th Century Museum in 1962 - it was named &quot;20th Century House&quot;.
However, the building was not suitable for the museum, neither spatially nor technically - there were no walls for hanging art exhibits, no suitable climate.
Nevertheless, it was used until contemporary art received a new stand in Vienna.
Since 2001, the building has been empty and dilapidated more and more.
Now the architect Adolf Krischanitz has reconstructed the pavilion, it is now called the &quot;House of the 21st Century&quot; and will be used in the future as a Museum of Contemporary Art.
On Tuesday evening, the Belvedere Museum, to which the palace belongs, will open the first exhibition there - a happy intention in every respect.
A new beginning was introduced by Agnes Husslein-Arco, who in 2007 became the new director of the Austrian Gallery Belvedere.
Husslein-Arco, a graduate art historian with a distinguished career, including figure skater in her youth, later at Sotheby&#39;s, the Guggenheim Museum and as the founding director of the Salzburg Museum of Modern Art, strongly pushed for reconstruction among politicians and conservationists.
In addition to contemporary art, the works of sculptor Fritz Wotruba should be exhibited by the foundation of the same name, a café and a bookstore should be established, and an office building had to be built.
Strict supervision, low budget.
Krischanitz was then the ideal cast for the execution.
Not only did he sensitively renovate and expand Joseph Olbrich&#39;s Art Nouveau buildings in Vienna and win the competition, but because he studied at Schwanzer at the Technical University of Vienna and the pavilion was an &quot;extremely important place&quot; for him to view exhibitions &quot;almost every weekend&quot;.
He knew the original project and also knew the problems of the building, which had already lost its generosity and lightness when it was relocated to Vienna and changed.
There were far bigger problems with the current renovation: The building was a &quot;catapult for energy,&quot; says Krischanitz.
The window profiles of the glass facade were replaced, fiberglass-reinforced insulating glass was used and the glass roof was replaced with special safety glass.
Cold bridges-steel girders have been reinforced or replaced, and asbestos-filled ceilings have been repaired.
Two underground floors provided space for new uses, a recessed lighting channel between the building and the street provides lighting, and a bridge leads to the entrance - almost a new building, but still a stately Schwanzer pavilion.
The original entrance door has been preserved, the building is painted in the old anti-corrosion red-brown color tone.
And the movie theater is even exactly the same as it used to be.
And all this under the strict supervision of the monument office and a low budget.
&quot;Often material had to be found that was good and cheap and also liked the monument office,&quot; says Krischanitz, pointing to the broken basement floor.
Despite all the pressures, problems and renovations, the building remained flexible and airy.
It was said to have been difficult with the pavilion, &quot;which came here from Brussels,&quot; Krischanitz, a typical &quot;drop-in-the-city-history&quot;, said recently.
Such an architecture is said to be &quot;always in the wrong place&quot; and still wants to &quot;inspire proper self-confidence&quot;.
In this case, however, the 21st Century House is not in the wrong place, as an urban happy coincidence has taken place: A completely newly designed &quot;City District at the Central Station&quot; with office and residential buildings is being built in the area around the Schweizer Garten.
And perhaps another lucky coincidence will occur: The 21st century house could receive support from another Krischanitz building, as the collector Francesca von Habsburg bought the Berliner Temporäre Kunsthalle and, as they can hear, is already negotiating a neighborhood with the city at the Schweizer Garten site.
The track is planning a package for the winter crisis in the millions
The track has launched a contingency plan to prevent train outages during the winter.
The number of employees is to be doubled.
It will cost millions.
According to a newspaper report, Deutsche Bahn is spending another more than 70 million euros this year to fight the winter caused by train outages and delays.
The newspaper &quot;Bild&quot; reported in advance with reference to the internal group plan, that it is said that a total of around 300 million euros is expected by 2015.
It is supposed to be used to make better use of trains and the rail network, even in extreme weather conditions.
Among other things, it is planned to double the number of internal and external employees to 16,000 people to remove snow on railway facilities and platforms.
The goal is to get rid of the platform before the start of operation and 90 percent for the operation of the necessary switches during four to five hours of snow and ice.
Two months ago, after a summit with government and industry, the chief of the railways, Rüdiger Grube, warned of train outages and delays during this winter as well.
In the last winter, the railway had considerable problems in passenger transport, because, among other things, it had a lack of reserves under difficult weather conditions.
Thus, numerous new regional trains have been waiting for years for approval by the Federal Railway Authority.
In addition, there are delays in the departure of ICE trains
For many years now, the railway has also not been able to have the axles of ICE trains checked more frequently by a workshop when an ICE train at Cologne Central Station is destroyed.
Deutsche Bank pays a million in the US
Following the uproar over Chief Josef Ackermann, there are new troubles in the USA: Deutsche Bank has to pay millions in compensation there.
As if Deutsche Bank no longer had enough problems at home, the industry giant caught up with his past in the US: The Frankfurt institution is paying $ 145 million (€ 106 million) in one settlement to settle disputes over the bankruptcy of five large cooperative banks during the financial crisis.
This is a sale of mortgage certificates.
The financial market regulator NCUA blames a number of large banks for having led cooperative banks with false promises to buy financial products; that the risks may have been reduced.
Such securities lost considerable value during the crisis and dragged banks into the abyss.
&quot;We are pleased to have been able to resolve the issue without having to drag the parties to court,&quot; a spokesman for Deutsche Bank in New York said.
The bank does not admit any guilt by the settlement.
This also applies to Citigroup, which has pledged $ 20.5 million.
NCUA President Debbie Matz welcomed the helpfulness of both financial institutions.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for cooperative banks in the United States and assists in bankruptcies to protect customer claims.
NCUA is trying to get compensation for billions in damage.
The now settled settlements are the first of their kind.
The regulator also clung to other large banks and sued JPMorgan Chase, Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs in the summer.
Doubtful mortgage certificates are so-called Mortgage-backed Securities.
These are based on bank loans.
When the US real estate bubble burst in 2007, it became fatal for many financial companies.
In September 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, US-Investmentbank Lehman Brothers changed its mind.
Although the events took place a few years ago, a sharp wind is now blowing on the banks.
Investors and supervisors have filed numerous lawsuits to seek redress or punish misconduct.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has launched the largest wave of lawsuits.
He accuses 18 international big banks of putting two US state-owned real estate financiers, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, at a disadvantage in about $ 200 billion in mortgage business.
Deutsche Bank is also facing a lawsuit against FHFA, which involves more transactions totaling about $ 14.2 billion from 2005 to 2007.
The supervisory authority requires the Frankfurt Institute to be liable for &quot;substantial losses&quot;, without, however, stating the exact amount.
Deutsche Bank rejected the claims as unfounded and stated that it wanted to defend itself.
Warren Buffett joins IBM with $ 10 billion
Financial guru Buffett is investing heavily in IBM&#39;s IT enterprise.
He has bought more than $ 10 billion in shares since March.
Until now, a major American investor, Warren Buffett, has always stated that he will not invest in IT and computers, because the long-term development of companies is difficult to predict.
But now he has read IBM&#39;s business reports and changed his mind about investing in the industry.
He must have understood much earlier that IBM primarily offers services and acquires computer systems for the IT departments of other companies.
Warren Buffett&#39;s investment is considered a knighthood in the financial world.
As a result, IBM&#39;s parent rock may now be called &quot;Sir IBM&quot;.
Because Buffett told CNBC that he had bought $ 10.7 billion worth of IBM stock since March.
Its Investmentholding Berkshire Hathaway has become one of IBM&#39;s largest shareholders with a 5.5 percent stake.
Buffett said that even IBM didn&#39;t know anything about his engagement yet.
He praised the management, which even sought proper returns during the economic crisis.
&quot;You did a great job,&quot; Buffett said of the strategy.
IBM has long relied on lucrative IT services such as data center operations.
The more than 100-year-old pioneer of computers also offers software and consulting as well as powerful computers for companies.
To this day, Buffett has avoided technology companies.
He claims that he only invests in companies whose activities he also understands.
Instead, Buffett reached for the freight railroad, the lubricant manufacturer, or the machine builders.
Its Holding Berkshire Hathaway owns, in addition to about 80 of its own subsidiaries, shares in a number of large corporations such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, formerly Münchener Rück.
The 81-year-old took over the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway in the 1960s and used it to make one of the most valuable businesses in the world with wise investments.
Yet his way of life is modest.
It is therefore a cult figure for many investors around the world.
His almost infallible sense of making money earned him the nickname &quot;The Eagle of Omaha.
When Buffett&#39;s investment became known, IBM shares rose one percent before the stock market.
&quot;Big Blue,&quot; as IBM is called, has a total price of more than $ 220 billion and is considered, along with Apple and Microsoft, to be the world&#39;s most valuable technology companies.
But at Microsoft, so many Buffetts would not want to join.
Founder Bill Gates is said to be his close friend.
The threat is tangible
Following the revelation of the &quot;Zwickau Cells&quot;, the Turkish media doubt the German rule of law.
The newspaper even talks about a &quot;bloody ideology&quot; that is now reviving.
The murders of eight small entrepreneurs of Turkish origin and one Greek between 2000 and 2006 had a right-wing extremist background.
This report was reacted with fear and worry in Turkey and within the German-Turkish population in Germany.
For many German Turks, this returns a ghost that has long been considered dead: since the arson attacks in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, there has been no violence comparable to a right-wing extremist background.
There was never any doubt that there was xenophobia in Germany.
However, the discovered right-wing extremist network reveals a extent whose dimensions can no longer be seen.
&quot;Is the bloody ideology reviving?&quot; were the headlines in the online edition of the Turkish newspaper &quot;Haberturk&quot;.
The Sabah newspaper, on the other hand, points out that one of the perpetrators was supposed to be an undercover police agent in the constitution&#39;s protection department, and fears that the German authorities could also be involved in a right-wing radical swamp.
The Turkish municipality of Germany reacted prudently: She recalled the weekend with a silence demonstration in front of the Brandenburg Gate of the victims of racist violence.
Only two weeks ago, the Turkish Municipality in Berlin, together with German and Turkish politicians, commemorated the fiftieth anniversary of the German-Turkish recruitment agreement.
Life together was staged in cheerful colors - as a history of success.
The news of several Turkish media acts as a field here: &quot;Germany&#39;s Gift to the Fifties&quot; is the title of an article in the Turkish Internet platform &quot;Haber X&quot;, which reports on the background of the murderous series.
Also, the publication of the &quot;Hürriyet&quot; for Germany cannot be taken so as not to make this connection.
&quot;It&#39;s starting to stink,&quot; is the headline of Ahmet Külahci&#39;s column.
He emphasizes that people who paid taxes and made an important contribution to the reconstruction of Germany were murdered.
The procedure of the police and its late success in the search is most critically discussed in German-Turkish Internet forums.
The authors wonder why the German authorities did not think much earlier to search for suspects in right-wing extremist circles.
Thus, many are showing at least a rhetorical prompt to use drastic means: &quot;If work continues so superficially here, immigrants will be left with nothing but their own defense and armament.&quot;
&quot;That will be the best self-defense.&quot;
&quot;Internal peace in Germany depends very much on the quality of clarification and the adequacy of the punishment of the whole network,&quot; writes &quot;Selen&quot;.
The assassinations in Mölln and Solingen in the 1990s explain what it means if internal peace in Germany is threatened.
The photograph of the incinerator in Solingen is deeply engraved in the memory of the Germans and Turks.
Because no other event has shown more clearly to the Turks living here that there is a tangible threat and to the Germans that distrust and detachment can lead to right-wing violence.
However, the assassinations made a sense of reciprocity on the part of the Turks.
Do not repeat the mistakes of the past
At the time, the Turkish press criticized the failure of German politics after the assassinations: Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors in Mölln.
After the arson attack in Solingen, he sent a telegram of condolence to the Turkish president, but was represented at his mourning ceremony in Cologne by his foreign minister Klaus Kinkel - Kinkel then calculated in his speech what fees the local Turks paid.
Quite as if a person&#39;s value was measured by the amount of his taxes.
The current coverage of the Turkish media shows once again how deep the distrust of many German Turks in the local constitutional order is.
In addition to efforts to widely clarify and re-evaluate right-wing extreme terrorism in Germany, this time requires open words.
Scandalous bank at Lake Zurich
Europe&#39;s most adventurous bank is not based in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
UBS almost went bankrupt during the financial crisis and has been moving from one crisis to another ever since.
Now a German has to compare.
That&#39;s not what Axel Weber thought.
After his noisy departure from the head of the Federal Bank&#39;s management, it became known in July that he would take up an almost equally spectacular new job in 2013: President of the Board of Directors of the Swiss Grand Bank UBS - an unexpected and lucrative step in his career.
Axel Weber looked forward to the public, praising Switzerland for its beauty and UBS for its newly acquired solidity, and making friendly remarks to future colleagues.
&quot;Die UBS has made a turnaround.&quot;
&quot;I look forward to working with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel.&quot;
But it was already clear in September that everything would turn out completely differently.
One UBS dealer in London bypassed all the bank&#39;s security systems and wasted about 1.7 billion euros.
The head of the UBS board of directors, Oswald Grübel, a banker not only recognized in Switzerland, had to leave.
Since then, the president of the UBS board has also been scalded - and everyone is asking: When will Axel Weber finally arrive?
It has already become known that Weber is allowed to advise the bank from February 2012.
And he will take over the chairmanship of the board of directors already in May - not only in 2013, as the bank announced on Tuesday.
It will be hard for Axel Weber.
He is not a banker, but rather a professor of economics and an issuing banker, and he would certainly need time to work.
Suddenly, he then takes responsibility for the strategy of the bank, which once again proved that it deserves the title &quot;Bank of the biggest scandals in Europe&quot;.
Because UBS is huge - until recently it was the largest asset manager in the world - and it has been slipping from one scandal to another for years.
The proud Swiss bank does not seem to be spared anything.
It started during the financial crisis.
Until 2007, UBS enjoyed an excellent reputation.
The image of a secretive and solid, but also clever asset manager is combined with ambitious goals: She also wanted to mean something in investment banking.
On the one hand, UBS 2007, with $ 1.6 trillion, managed more money from wealthy clients than any other bank in the world.
On the other hand, as an investment bank, it has advanced into the league of the world&#39;s largest banks
That made an impression.
Hans Geiger, a former banker and later long-time professor of banking in Zurich, said: &quot;At that time, I always referred UBS to my students as a model for a good bank.&quot;
&quot;From today&#39;s point of view, one asks: How could I be so wrong?&quot;
He was very wrong.
In 2007, it was clear for the first time that something had gone wrong at UBS.
Surprisingly, the head of the board of directors, Peter Wuffli, resigned in the middle of the year and was previously considered a highly intelligent and also brilliant banker.
A few months later, he wondered why he had left.
The bank&#39;s investment division wasted Subprime-papers and had to write off billions.
To keep this going, UBS announced a capital increase of really 13 billion francs.
Instead, she did find investors, but those she would have recently turned her nose over: An opaque Asian state fund from Singapore and an Arab state fund that was so discreet that one didn&#39;t even know its name.
But that was only the first impact.
In April 2008, it developed worse.
The bank had to admit new billions in losses, and Marcel Ospel, the president of the board of directors, the second highest paid board of directors in Switzerland in 2006, resigned.
A disaster ensued in October 2008: UBS faced a collapse due to its misinvestment during the financial crisis and had to be rescued by the state.
Nationalbank bought troubled securities from UBS for tens of billions, the Swiss Confederation gave six billion francs on mandatory convertible bonds, for which it could become a co-owner of the bank.
The whole of Switzerland has been shaken - for noticing how dramatic it is for a small country to have such large banks on its territory.
After all, the balance sheet total of UBS 2007 was more than five times higher than the performance of the Swiss economy (see figure).
&quot;Once again, we could not save UBS,&quot; says banking expert Geiger.
The first catastrophe is followed by the second.
For several months now, UBS has capitulated in a tax dispute with America and has shown a willingness to release data from wealthy customers who, if possible with the help of banks, cut taxes.
In addition, it agreed to pay $ 780 million - as a refund of the illicit profits from these transactions, including a penalty surcharge.
In doing so, UBS admitted more or less openly that it helped reduce taxes.
At the same time, she lost something that had always been her capital in the competition for wealthy clients: a halo of discretion.
After this scandal, Swiss banking secrecy was no longer what it used to be.
This was followed by the resignation of the head of the board of directors and the president of the board of directors.
And the exodus of customers&#39; money.
Thus, within a few months, the bank lost its credibility in both central business areas: in investment banking due to bad speculation and in asset management to help with tax cuts.
And just as it calmed down a bit, just as UBS was thought to have recovered, here comes this unfortunate business anabasis: A single dealer wasted 1.7 billion euros before the bank noticed something was wrong.
And it&#39;s clear: risk management in investment banking probably still doesn&#39;t work.
&quot;In the case of Adoboli, it has probably been found that risk control has changed too little,&quot; says Martin Janssen, an economist and Finanz professor of finance at the Banking Institute of the University of Zurich.
The chief financial officer of a large German bank is also sure: &quot;The problem with UBS is that it does not manage risk control.&quot;
At the same time, it was precisely the idea of caution that Swiss bankers set out with a long time ago to become the guardians of the world&#39;s great assets: no excessive risks, but security for money - the Alpine Republic also collapsed again.
The safes of Swiss banks have become a symbol for unshakable reliability, like Lindt and Sprüngli for high-quality chocolate.
UBS&#39;s headquarters in Zurich is still in line with the cliché of a good Swiss private bank - it&#39;s just a little bigger.
The location is already classic.
The bank is headquartered in Zurich&#39;s Bahnhofstraße, which leads directly to Lake Zurich, which is framed by the snow-capped peaks of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are beautiful, the rental shops are among the tallest in Europe.
Jewelry stores like Tiffany&#39;s can be found here among Swiss traditional shops such as Sprüngli patisseries.
Swiss banks have been based here for centuries: from Nationalbank to the Palast der Credit Suisse to elite private banks such as Julius Bär.
The UBS reception hall is entered through a heavy revolving door.
Inside, the walls are lined with marble, in front of them are massive leather armchairs, next to the bank&#39;s logo, a large signpost to the &quot;safe&quot;.
UBS knows what the customer is looking for here: security.
However, the Swiss bank&#39;s idea was suppressed or betrayed by both Swiss big banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, as the head of a small Swiss private bank finds out.
He would rather not read his name in the newspapers, in the end he, like all Swiss bankers, also closes with both big banks.
UBS has probably grown too much, he finds out - especially in investment banking, where the Anglo-Saxons have also spread.
The Swiss probably have nothing more to say about it.
&quot;And if they did, they had long ago adapted to Anglo-Saxon manners.&quot;
Indeed, it was Anglo-Saxon investment banking that changed UBS, bringing it high profits at first and then disaster: No European financial institute lost as much money in the jungles around Subprime as Schweizer Großbank.
On October 15, 2008, the disaster was obvious.
&quot;On that Wednesday, the governing coalition of a small seven-million-strong country decided on the largest rescue operation in the history of its nation,&quot; writes author Lukas Hässig in his book &quot;Der UBS-Crash&quot;.
As many as 68 billion francs, or about 45 billion euros, have been approved by politicians to save the big bank from bankruptcy.
How could this have happened?
If you talk to Swiss bankers, you see the problem mainly in the size of UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three Swiss large banks merged into a large group.
A bank was formed that was already too big for small Switzerland at the time of the merger - and it continued to grow.
At the same time, it helped that the two different banking predecessors of UBS complemented each other: One rich but sleepy bank in Zurich with a focus on asset management and a poorer but more internationally involved one.
Suddenly, internationalized investment bankers came up with a lot of money with which to spin big roulette.
Two names are associated with this rise of UBS: Peter Wuffli, head of the UBS Group from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, then chairman of the board.
&quot;I always thought Wuffli and Ospel were the team of the future,&quot; says banking expert Hans Geiger.
&quot;Wuffli, the highly intelligent, humble one who knows a lot about models and statistics, and Ospel, the stomach-driven man who has worked his way up from banking science.&quot;
But Ospel allegedly relied on Wuffli in the end.
And Wuffli probably made a decisive mistake in the end: &quot;He probably thought his models were a reality,&quot; says Geiger.
&quot;That&#39;s a tragic case.&quot;
Tragic, perhaps.
It is clear: Pride preceded the fall.
UBS employees clearly remember the executive meetings at which Wuffli, the group&#39;s chief, repeated the same motto over and over again: knocking Goldman Sachs down from the throne.
The American bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
She featured &quot;League Tables,&quot; a queue that documents the success of the banks of the time.
In it, UBS tried to place it at the very top.
She had already taken a few steps.
In the foreign exchange and stocks trade, she participated in the game at the very top.
However, the business advisers who were commissioned point to one weakness: In international interest rate trading, in the words of &quot;Fixed Income&quot; bankers, there is probably a big gap behind the largest banks.
UBS probably has gaps in US mortgage products.
To close this gap, UBS decided on an adventure that almost cost her to exist.
Hungry for growth, both the bank itself and its hedging fund have invested in US Subprime investments.
It developed into a massive machine that repackaged securities into American mortgages and passed them on - but it also kept the risks itself.
Also when other banks had long been looking for a way out.
&quot;Back in the summer of 2007, when the real estate market was on fire, UBS bought there,&quot; says banking expert Geiger.
How great is the euphoria, so is the deep fall.
One manager after another had to leave when attempts to clean up were more difficult than previously thought.
The positions at UBS have become a catapult seat and they are still rocking.
Whoever runs the big bank now has an almost unmanageable job.
He must find a strategy for the bank, which all nearby business models have disappeared.
Banking expert Geiger already has an idea: Ending investment banking, concentrating on asset management, returning to Swiss roots.
The bank does not want to go that far yet.
But investment banking is set to decline sharply, so much is now clear.
Next Thursday, the new head of the bank, Sergio Ermotti, wants to present his future strategy to the world.
The 51-year-old Swiss Italian was actually seen only as a temporary solution, when the bank surprisingly broke up with its predecessor Grübel.
In the meantime, he has asserted himself: He has to run UBS business for a long time, the Zurich bank said on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to bring the investment bank back to normal in the mid-1990s.
3500 seats cut.
But that will not be enough.
UBS needs a vision.
Who is she?
How does he want to make money?
These are the questions that Axel Weber is already asking.
But so far he is only saying publicly that he will first find an apartment in Zurich with his mistress.
Next year.
Fear of a recession in Europe is weighing on the US stock market.
The looming recession in Europe has deprived US investors of the courage to start the week.
The change of government in Athens and Rome did not achieve the intended striking effect.
The subdued production of industry on the Continent suffocated in the beginning the hopes of stabilizing the debt crisis.
The general facilitation of the change of government in Rome and Athens could not be enforced
the euro fell against the dollar.
Last week, Italian and Greek glass were still considered half full, not half empty - but now problems have come to the fore again, said Mark Luschini of Janney Montgomery Scott.
Above all, the financial values were on the sales slips.
The Dow-Jones Standard Value Index fell 0.6 percent at 12,078 points to close trading.
During trading, the market barometer fluctuated between 12,027 and 12,170 points.
The broader S&amp;P-500-Index ended at 1,251 points, down one percent.
The Nasdaq Technology Exchange Index lost 0.8 percent and exited 2657 points.
In Frankfurt, Dax said goodbye with a drop of 1.2 percent at 5,985 counters.
Industry in the 17 countries using the euro has significantly reduced its output and prepared to end the boom.
Businesses produced two percent less in September than in the previous month, according to Eurostat.
This has skeptical US investors. &quot;We&#39;re not an island, we&#39;re an addict,&quot; said Steve Goldman of Goldman&#39;s management.
Europe will probably not recover from the recession so quickly, and there are other signs of bank weakness.
Investment legend Warren Buffett only confirmed this outlook: He said in an CNBC interview that it would probably not be clear yet whether Europe was strong enough to do everything to end the crisis.
Therefore, from his point of view, it is probably too early to invest in European government loans or banks.
Instead, Buffett abandoned the decades-old principle and entered the American technology industry.
His investment of more than ten billion dollars in IBM strengthened the share price of the traditional group and left it to be quoted almost one percent higher against the trend during trading.
The paper ended up almost unchanged at $ 187.35.
According to his own data, Buffett paid an average of $ 170 apiece and now holds 5.5 percent.
The share price of his investment company Berkshire Hathaway lost 1.3 percent.
Bank of America&#39;s shares fell 2.6 percent clearly stronger than the market.

At Nasdaq, with a turnover of 1.38 billion, 630 shares ended up, 1913 down and 82 unchanged.
Intelligent crows are spreading in cities
In many places, field ravens are considered &quot;problem birds&quot;: However, these highly intelligent animals can no longer be expelled from cities, experts say.
Some like them, others would like to get rid of them quite quickly: Crows have been part of the city&#39;s image for centuries, yet in some villages, the complaints of residents about dirt and noise caused by animals are accumulating.
At the same time, there is no means in sight against &quot;problem birds&quot;.
Field ravens can probably no longer be expelled from the cities, experts said at the first symposium about crows in Leer in East Frisia.
There, experts from all over the federal territory consulted on possible solutions.
They are looking for alternatives in cities
At the same time, conservationists also derived the problems of cities from the exodus of specially protected field ravens: The use of chemistry in agriculture is probably destroying traditional areas for life.
The chasing, growing development and felling of typical trees to nest birds make life difficult.
Crows are protected.
Large colonies with more than 600 nesting pairs are in Soest, Westphalia, in the northwest, among others, in Jever, Diepholz and Achim near Bremen and Leer, among others.
There, a 2005 controversial project of mass killing crows in a rural district provoked negative headlines.
Critics have called trapping animals in bird traps and killing sticks particularly brutal.
&quot;Normal expulsion, scare, does not bring anything,&quot; found out urban planner and landscaper Werner Klöver from Leer.
Removing nests by spraying water or felling trees often has undesirable consequences, said environmental expert Manfred Kaiser from Lahr in Baden-Württemberg.
&quot;The animals retreat, the large colonies split and divide into other places.&quot;
Scare is conceivable only as an exception in hospitals, retirement homes or schools.
&quot;We have to live with them, we won&#39;t get them away.&quot;
Without the surrounding area, the problem of cities cannot be solved, was the opinion of Mayor Wolfgang Kellner from Leer.
It is conceivable to combine animals from sensitive residential areas and attract them to settle elsewhere.
&quot;Information board instead of chainsaws&quot;, on the other hand, was promoted by psychologist and ethnologist Uta Maria Jürgens because of a completely different treatment of animals: &quot;One piece of face in the face can best end with confidence.&quot;
Ms. Jürgens co-founded the Ascherberg Educational Crow Trail in Schleswig-Holstein, on which information boards provide instruction on the life of a highly intelligent field raven.
The project is said to have been accepted by tourists in the meantime.
Ms. Jürgens also had her own opinion of the criticism of the noise caused by the birds: &quot;This is every volume of communication, they have a lot to say.&quot;
The intelligence and dexterity of the animals are legendary: Field ravens do not only use aids to achieve a treat, but even make their own tool.
Researchers at the University of Cambridge recently tested the behavior on four ravens of the birds&#39; intelligence.
In one experiment, the birds quickly learned that the stones must cause the structure to collapse in order to reach the pier larva.
Without much training, they knew the size and shape of the stone to cause the platform to collapse.
In the second attempt, the cunning crows then had to solve a more difficult problem.
In a vertical cylinder, the researchers placed a small container with the larva of the pier.
The birds could not reach their prey with their beak.
However, the researchers put pieces of wire there for them.
From them, all four animals formed a hook, with the help of which, like a fishing rod, she hunted a container by the handle.
Three of the four field ravens even succeeded in getting caught.
Cristiano Ronaldo shoots Portugal for the 2012 European Championships
The hopes of the Bosnians and Turks for the cup did not materialize.
Favorites Portugal, Croatia, the Czechia and Ireland take part in the 2012 European Championships.
Portugal, the Czechia, Croatia and Ireland won the last tickets for the 2012 European Championships in Poland and Ukraine in Play-off matches.
Led by the twice-successful superstar Cristiano Ronald (8th, 53rd), Portugal defeated Bosnia 6-1-2 (2: 1) and made it the fifth consecutive European Championship after 0-0 in the first match.
The Czechs only had a 1: 0 (0: 0) result in retaliation for the Play-offs with an outsider Montenegro, when the first match was already a clear thing.
Croatia also scored with 0: 0 against Turkey, Ireland achieved a relaxed 1: 1 (1: 0) against Estonia.
Nani (24th), Helder Postiga (72nd, 82nd) and Miguel Veloso (80th) scored more goals for Portugal.
Former Wolfsburg professional from the Federal League Zvjezdan Misimovic reduced the penalty (41) and captain Emir Spahic (65) twice for Bosnia.
Sena Lulic received a yellow-red card (54.).
Bosnia has already disappointed in the play-off matches for the 2010 World Cup in South Africa with Portugal.
At the Estadio da Luz in Lisbon, Portugal managed a tailor-made start.
Ronaldo was able to finish off the move - about 30 minutes into the net.
A good quarter of an hour later, Nani demonstrated his qualities in long-distance shooting and adjusted to 2: 0 with a shot from 25 meters.
The Bosnians, who did not act in the first half hour, had their first clear chance in goalkeeper Edin Dzek.
Former Wolfsburu from the English at the head of the table of the standing Manchester City club placed the ball with his head on the lower edge of the crossbar, but the ball did not cross the goal line (33rd).
Jiracek scores for the Czechia
In the end, the referee was Wolfgang Stark from Ergolding.
After the action against Helder Postig in the Bosnian penalty area, Stark decided for Schwalbe and gave the Portuguese a yellow card. (36.).
On the other hand, Stark executed a controversial penalty kick after the action of Fabio Coentra, which Misimovic confidently converted.
But after a break, the European Vice-Champion from 2004 clarified everything with four goals.
Petr Jiracek also finished the last doubts for the Czech Republic in the 81st minute.
With that, the 1976 European champion leaves for the fifth time in a row at the European Championships.
However, the team of coach Michal Bilek with the Bundesliga legionary Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomáš Pekhart (1. FC Nürnberg) was also lucky and had to overcome a terrible second in the initial phase.
Goalkeeper Petr Čech reflexively prevented Tomáš Sivok&#39;s (9th) possible goal from the last moment.
Montenegro had its greatest potential when the duo Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic were in action.
Damjanovic shot in the 40th minute from the turn from the border of the penalty area just around Čech&#39;s goal.
After the break, the crossbar had to save the place of the already knocked down goalkeeper of world-class Czechs, the striker FC Soul (50th) lowered again.
Shortly before the end, the goal finally clarified everything.
At that moment, Turkey missed the football miracle from Zagreb.
Four days after 0: 3 in Istanbul, the Turks in Zagreb did not exceed 0: 0.
While national coach Guus Hiddink almost certainly has to vacate his place on the bench of the third at the 2002 World Championships, the Croats can rejoice in their fourth participation in the final round of the European Championships.
In front of 31,000 spectators at Maksimir Stadium, the Turks should experience an almost fabulous start.
Selcuk Inan hits the ball on the volley with a shot for which the keeper, Kazim, has no answer.
After this terrible second, however, Croatia took over control.
Also after the interruption, the Croats did not get the goal.
In addition to Mario Mandzukice from VfL Wolfsburg, who released Ivan Perisic from Dortmund from the 62nd minute, legionnaires from the Federal League Danijel Pranjic (Bayern Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht Frankfurt) were also in action.
Trapattoni is going to the European Championships
In Dublin, the Irish celebrated their first participation in the 1988 European Championships in Germany.
Stephen Ward brought in the lead of Giovanni Trapattoni, who took the lead 4: 0 in the first match with a preliminary decision, in the 32nd minute to the lead.
Konstantin Vassiljev (57th) equalized for the guests.
Ireland set the pace from the start, but had to wait until the 23rd minute before Robbie Keane of the Los Angeles Galaxy had his first good chance.
Only at the last moment did the Estonian defense prevent a possible leading goal.
In the 32nd minute, however, it was quite far.
After a failed defense by the goalkeeper Pavel Londak, Ward was in place and pushed the ball across the line to 1: 0.

SAP wants to double the number of its employees in China.
Europe&#39;s largest software maker SAP is investing billions in China in the coming years and almost wants to double its number in the country.
It is said that around two billion dollars (approximately 1.5 billion euros) will flow by 2015, the Dax concern said on Tuesday.
&quot;We will create additional research and development facilities and employ the appropriate staff,&quot; said Deputy Chief Bill McDermott at the Beijing Customs Fair.
The staff is now to grow from the current 2,500 employees to 4,500.
The number of branches of the world&#39;s number one in the field of enterprise software will double from five to ten or eleven.
So far, SAP is present in Beijing, Shanghai, Guanzhou, Chengdu and Dalian.
About 4,000 of the world&#39;s more than 176,000 SAP customers are booming in the country.
Growth plans in China are also an important building block of the Dax Group&#39;s strategy for 2015.
SAP wants to increase turnover to 20 billion euros by 2015.
Last year, the Walldorfs earned about 12.5 billion euros.
Today, the software manufacturer, which employs 55,000 people worldwide, is doing as well as almost never before.
SAP has been active in China for 20 years.
&quot;Now we would like to expand our activities (...),&quot; said McDermott.
&quot;Our goal, with the support of extensive research, is to promote sustainable growth in China.&quot;
Massacre on a personal level
Peter Englund&#39;s emotionally powerful new book, Beauty and the Sorrow: An Intimate History of the First World War, begins with such a long list of emerging characters that it makes you dizzy.
One piece of advice on how to behave at the moment: Carefully tear out this page and bookmark it.
You will get to know all the people very well in Mr. Englund&#39;s novel, and this list will serve as a navigation - like a kind of beacon - in moments when, like the men and women in the story, you will feel confused and lost in different situations.
Mr. Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new Deputy at the Swedish Academy, which awards the Nobel Prize for Literature.
The book we are talking about here is very unusual - the author himself describes it, quite aptly, as an &quot;antihistorical work&quot;.
It contains several well-known names, important treaties and famous battles, on the contrary, it almost lacks ambassadors, energetic journalists and discussions about tactics and equipment.
It is not so much a book about what happened, the author explains, but rather a &quot;book about what it was like&quot;. It deals mainly with &quot;feelings, impressions, experiences and moods&quot;.
&quot;Beauty and Grief&quot; combines the war experiences of 20 more or less dozen men and women, on both sides of the barricade, from students and botanists to climbers, doctors, ambulance drivers and officials.
Some of these people become heroes.
Others become prisoners of war, lose limbs, go insane, or die.
Their lives flicker like the flames of candles lit in a church - new ones are added to the tangle of destinies, while others are extinguished.
Mr. Englund&#39;s book differs from classic historical novels.
It modifies the idea that the First World War was just about the terrible trench fighting on the Western Front.
&quot;Beauty and grief&quot; skillfully explores other places where war dramas took place: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
In this book, soldiers deal with the problem of bee nests falling on them, having to spend Christmas in the shade of pyramids, or struggling with the presence of tsetse flies.
It is a very touching reading almost from the beginning.
The war consumes people&#39;s lives like a natural disaster, like Hurricane Katrina smelling of gunpowder.
When gunfire starts in the distance and you are a woman at home with your children, will you run away or stay?
Who is actually approaching?
Almost no one understands what&#39;s going on, not even why the whole war was started.
&quot;The vacuum created by the lack of facts,&quot; Mr. Englund noted, &quot;was filled with conjecture, assumptions, hopes, fears, prejudices, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares, and rumors.&quot;
&quot;Beauty and Grief&quot; follows the stories of individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young sailor serving in the German fleet.
Their stories are mostly taken from biographies, letters and other already published materials.
The descriptions of their lives may sound scary and engaging, but thanks to the incorporation of small moments and details, they are absolutely lively and believable.
Many of them deal with suffering and coping with it.
In the story of a German student, the author says: &quot;Substitutes, substitutes everywhere.&quot;
&quot;Coffee substitute, imitation aluminum, imitation rubber, paper bandages, wooden buttons.&quot;
He goes even further and describes food substitutes in Germany.
He mentions &quot;meat made from pressed rice cooked in mutton (and supplemented with a false wood bone), tobacco from dried roots and dried potato peels, shoes with wooden soles&quot;.
It mentions that there were &quot;837 registered meat substitutes for sausages and 511 registered coffee substitutes&quot;.
Some stories are about honor and bravery.
One American finds inner impulses to savagery and brutality, and then declares about the war: &quot;In the end, you will understand that this is human nature. Not to sit in comfortable chairs with a cigarette and whiskey, an evening newspaper or a good book and pretend that your mask it represents civilization, and that there is no barbarian inside that starchy self. &quot;
On the contrary, the British soldier realizes that he will most likely die soon and no one will even notice, let alone mourn.
&quot;When one finally comes to terms with sacrificing oneself, one would at least expect it to happen in front of a grateful audience,&quot; he writes.
Instead, however, he feels like &quot;a convict he is secretly hanged.&quot;
Other remarks concern the departure of old Europe and the onset of new horrors.
&quot;The conflict has become more and more of an economic competition and a competitive struggle,&quot; writes Mr. Englund, &quot;a war between factories.&quot;
He captured what he calls &quot;a new kind of beast of the coming century: an eloquent and ideologically sworn mass murderer in a tailor-made dress who carries out his bloodshed without getting up from the table.&quot;
People behave completely unexpectedly, meanness alternates with heroism.
Mr. Englund also describes soldiers who deliberately tried to catch a venereal disease from prostitutes in order to avoid service at the front.
&quot;The most grotesque example of this behavior was the trade in gonococcal pus, which soldiers bought and rubbed their genitals in the hope that they would end up in hospital,&quot; he writes.
&quot;The most desperate people rubbed it in their eyes, which often blinded them for the rest of their lives.&quot;
In this Swedish translation by Peter Graves, Mr. Englund&#39;s prose is brisk but not flashy, which is a great match for his human subject.
In dozens of small outputs, he captures the way in which the war &quot;unleashed completely unmanageable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred.&quot;
People are beginning to wonder why their leaders are forcing them to fight.
The best books on World War I mostly worked with hints rather than a comprehensive narrative, such as &quot;World War I and Modern Memories&quot; by Paul Fussell or novels like &quot;Peace on the Western Front&quot; by Erich Maria Remarque.
Mr Englund prefers an unconventional approach.
His book has the most overwhelming ending, unparalleled in popular science literature.
However, I will not reveal it to you.
However, you will feel as if the author suddenly jumped out of the book, snatched the page from the list of heroes from your hand and set it on fire.
After a previous mistake, this time for a minute a precisely planned raid
Hundreds of police officers took part, some in helmets used in street riots.
The night from Monday to Tuesday was chosen because Zuccotti Park should be almost empty at that time.
No one but a few high-ranking officers knew about the operation. The others were first told that this was an exercise.
The event was led by Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly, whose presence emphasized the problems faced by the police department during the operation.
Cases from recent weeks, when, for example, pepper sprays were used against demonstrators, in breach of the rules of separation, and a wave of public sympathy spilled over to the squatters, were not to be repeated.
Therefore, a police operation aimed at clearing Zuccotti Park of protesters did not begin until after two weeks of careful planning and exercises.
Leaders were inspired by operations in other cities.
A massive crisis behavior exercise took place in the Randalls Island area, which was in preparation for the event at Zuccotti Park.
Leaders have stepped up so-called riot control training - counter-terrorism measures involving the rapid relocation of large numbers of police officers - with a focus on Lower Manhattan.
The last part of the training took place on Monday night, on the Manhattan side of the East River.
The orders to move to the park came literally &quot;at the last minute&quot; declared by someone to whom the event was originally explained only as an &quot;exercise&quot;.
&quot;I know a couple of police officers who have also been called to this event, and no one has told them that they are going to Zuccotti Park,&quot; said the person, who spoke only on condition that he remain anonymous.
&quot;Only the top members of the department knew about going to Zuccotti Park.&quot;
One of the reasons for secrecy was a lesson the city had once received.
On October 14, city officials planned to clean up the park, but then withdrew from the plan, because as soon as the protesters heard about it, hundreds of them flocked to the park before the operation began.
Tuesday&#39;s event was attended by police officers from various units, including intervention groups from around the area - dozens of police officers who are commonly used to strengthen neighborhoods with higher levels of crime.
Mr Kelly explained that a large number of people came and went to the park during the day, so one hour a night was the perfect time to start the event.
&quot;It was appropriate to do this at a time when there would be as few people in the park as possible,&quot; he said.
Before the troops left, they lined up on the border of Pike Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near Manhattan Bridge, emergency truck trucks with arc lamps and amps.
The lights and the recorded message roaring from the amplions frightened many protesters.
When members of the riot troops entered the park in their blue windbreakers, many protesters packed their things and left.
Police say they did not touch a single tent until 1:45 in the morning, giving the protesters time to pack.
Other teams of police officers were seen gathering at the edge of the park to break into it if any arrests were needed.
Reporters were forced to leave the park.
Police chief spokesman Paul J. Browne said it was for their safety.
However, many journalists believe that the police wanted to prevent them from seeing their troops in action, and that some police officers treated them rudely.
Mr. Browne claimed that television cars on Church Street running along the western boundary of the park could shoot without any problems.
Police advanced westward, tangled in a thick tangle of protesters&#39; personal belongings, including luggage and plastic bags full of clothes. Teams from the hygiene department set out after them, immediately raking in everything that was left in the park.
Some protesters who refused to move were dragged out of the park. Documentary images appeared on the Internet shortly afterwards.
The most ardent group of protesters took refuge near the kitchen in their camp, which lay near the center of the park.
Some created a roadblock and police initiated their methodological arrests.
About ten people in the center of the camp were strapped together.
And two people were tied to a tree, Mr. Kelly said.
Emergency service members were called to cut the locks.
There were no arrests in the park until 3:30 in the morning, Mr. Kelly said.
The whole operation was completed about 75 minutes later, the police said.
Mr Browne said about 142 people had been detained in the park.
Most of the arrests were for &quot;organizing riots and resisting arrests,&quot; he explained.
The highest ranking police officer at the scene was Joseph J. Esposito, commander of the police department, the highest ranked uniformed officer on the department.
Phil T. Pulaski, the detective&#39;s commander in the department, also personally participated in the operation.
Mr. Kelly was present, but &quot;did not participate in the management of the operation,&quot; Mr. Browne said.
A second group of officers waited along the east side of Broadway, between Liberty Street and Cedar Street, in case she needed to be called.
Barricades were erected on Cortlandt Street, a block north of the park, and on Pine Street, a block south of the park.
From these places, the police then developed a protective belt even further from Zuccotti Park.
At one point, police officers, many of whom were equipped with shields, were seen pushing people even further beyond the border.
There were about 28 people on the northern border.
The wildest events of the night took place south of the park.
At around five in the morning, a protester south of Pine Street was spotted jumping on the hood of a police car and several others bleeding from the tires of a police van.
At one point, a piece of plywood flew out of the crowd.
At the end of the operation, one police officer and one protester were hospitalized.
The auxiliary union will sue the city for dismissal
Trade unions representing hundreds of school assistants who lost their jobs last month plan to sue the city on Wednesday. He claims that the redundancies were not necessary and, moreover, discriminated against because of the disproportionate impact on the schools attended by poor students.
Judicial proceedings are probably the last option left to trade unions in District Council 37 in their efforts to overturn redundancy decisions.
On October 7, six hundred and seventy-two school assistants, parental coordinators, and other employees who were among the city&#39;s lowest-paid employees lost their jobs. Their dismissals were described by union leaders as retaliation by the city for failing to give it access to a platoon-managed health care fund last spring, with which the city wanted to close a hole in the budget.
City officials categorically denied the allegations.
At a city council meeting last month, Education Secretary Dennis M. Walcott said the redundancies were part of a budget approved in June.
One of the board members immediately countered by saying that the budget did not specifically mention the dismissal of auxiliary staff.
District Council officials 37 announced that they had already completed the necessary documents and warned the Department of Education that they would sue him. They will call a press conference on Wednesday to formally file a lawsuit in Manhattan&#39;s Supreme State Court.
The defendants in the trial will be Mr. Walcott and the Department of Education, while the plaintiffs will be eight fired workers, all of whom are African Americans or Hispanics, as well as most other assistants who have lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokeswoman for the city&#39;s legal department, said the city had not yet seen the lawsuit and would not comment on the allegations.
According to a complaint filed by the New York Times, unions focused on the number of redundancies in poor parts of the city in support of their allegations of unfair treatment. They are of the opinion that poor schools have lost more assistants because they have been denied sufficient funding for a long time.
They point out that while schools in Staten Island were not made redundant and only minimally in the Upper East Side, in Brooklyn, District 23 in Brownsville, 17 school assistants lost their jobs and in District 8 and 9 in the South Bronx, even 46 assistants were fired.
He points out that five out of eight assistants lost their jobs at Public School 36 in Harlem, even though it is a school where 68 percent of students live in poverty. The lawsuit says: &quot;This is not a neighborhood full of mobile parents who can raise funds to cover the budget deficit.&quot;
Public School 36&#39;s budget was reduced by 3.26 percent this year, and the school also lost money when the city changed the way bonus funds were calculated for each poor student enrolled.
Unions claim, among other things, that high school principals may have been confused by the way in which the document approving the dismissal of parental coordinators was written.
In the document, the word &quot;excess&quot; was used to describe the action, ie to cancel the position, although this word is much more often used to describe the transfer of a teacher from the school&#39;s payroll to a database of available staff whose salary is paid by the central authority.
&quot;Sixty-six parental coordinators have been fired,&quot; says the complaint, &quot;and not just moved to the database to the position of available staff.&quot;
The mission is over, Congress is ready to accept an agreement on the situation in Libya
Finally, Republicans and Democrats in Congress seem to agree on something about the uprising in Libya.
But before that could happen, the revolution had to succeed, the long-reigning dictator Muammar Gaddafi had to be captured and killed, and the participation of United States troops ended.
On Tuesday, the Senate&#39;s International Relations Commission will decide on a statement backed by President John Kerry (Mass.) Along with Senators John McCain (Ariz.) And Joseph I. Lieberman (Conn.) To congratulate the Libyans on their successful uprising. and thank American troops for &quot;bravery.&quot;
&quot;With this statement, we want to appreciate the courage of the people of Libya who have begun rebuilding their country,&quot; Kerry said.
&quot;Both sides of the political spectrum would like to express support for their democratic efforts.&quot;
These sentences may seem innocent, but no debate over Libya has been easy so far.
Over the summer, lawmakers on both sides have been constantly arguing with each other and with the White House over a series of statements approving or rejecting the United States&#39; military role in NATO&#39;s mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain passed a resolution authorizing the limited use of US forces in Libya.
The proposal was rejected in the Chamber due to differing opinions of both political parties, so it was never even voted on in the Senate.
However, on the same day that the proposal was rejected in the House, the chamber also rejected a measure that would stop the financing of US operations in Libya.
As a result, the US mission in Libya was literally in a legislative purge - Congress criticized President Obama&#39;s management of the mission, but his members were clearly not irritated enough to stop supporting him.
The hesitation of the congress was eventually preceded by other events.
The rebels conquered Tripoli in August, and Gaddafi was killed on October 20.
The NATO mission officially ended on October 31.
Now the Senate may be ready to act.
In a statement, the Commission on International Relations &quot;congratulates the people of Libya on their immense courage and admirable tenacity in their efforts to liberate their people&quot; and &quot;commends the men and women of the United States Armed Forces and their allies involved in the operation to protect the Libyan people&quot;. , for extraordinary bravery and professionalism. &quot;
The statement also &quot;confirms the national interest of the United States in a successful and irreversible transition to democracy in Libya.&quot;
Will the new proposal gain the full support of the Commission on International Relations, or will the legislators again be divided into two halves, as was the case when the June proposal was approved?
Senator Richard G. Lugar (Ind.), The Republican leader&#39;s main representative on the commission, opposed the latest version.
Lugar&#39;s spokesman said on Monday that he had not yet seen the final version of the new proposal.
This week, the House will vote on an amendment to the Constitution that would require a balanced budget, which should be the highest legislative priority for almost all Republicans and Democrats in Congress.
This measure, promoted by Bob Goodlatt (Va.), Will be the first amendment to the Constitution on a budget or other topic to be voted on by the entire House or Senate.
For the time being, despite considerable efforts, the other legislators have not yet managed to push their proposals to the vote itself.
Goodlatt&#39;s proposal is just one of 68 amendments to the constitution that were presented in Congress and touched on a wide range of topics.
Some of them were the same - the same proposal submitted to the House and the Senate - and others are only minor variations of others.
In the House alone, there are at least 15 versions of the balanced budget amendment and another handful that would like to &quot;regulate federal spending.&quot;
While some of the proposals are identical, their proponents - especially budding Republicans who want to improve their reputation - can boast of &quot;authorship.&quot;
The decree on the regulation of the budget, which was approved in August, required the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate to vote on the amendment concerning the balanced budget.
In March, 58 senators voted in favor of a non-binding statement in support of such an amendment.
In addition to the budget, several members want to discuss limiting the number of terms in which members of Congress can serve, while José E. Serrano (NY) wants to increase the number of terms that can be held as president.
Representative Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Ill.) Offered a number of amendments that would, among other things, guarantee the right to quality education and medical care.
An amendment banning same-sex marriage and an amendment banning the burning of the national flag remain a permanent proposal.
Some lawmakers also want to allow federal laws to be repealed if two-thirds of states oppose them.
Although members of Congress appear to be very active in proposing various amendments, they do not deviate significantly from the average compared to previous years.
In the 111th Congress they offered 77 amendments, while in the 100th Congress there were 66.
Their activity even pales in comparison with the early 1990s, when, according to statistics from the Senate Library, members offered more than 150 additions every two years.
However, they were not much more successful than current politicians.
The last amendment added - the 27th Amendment - was ratified in 1992, but was in fact proposed by Congress in 1789.
&quot;Beaten, but not defeated,&quot; Gifford said in her first televised interview since the shooting
Ten months after she was injured in the immediate vicinity by a shooter at a public meeting with voters in Tucson, Gabrielle Gifffords (Ariz.) Appeared on national television on Monday night, singing along with a tune from the Broadway show &quot;The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow.&quot; and said that more than a return to Congress, it was worth healing.
Giffords appeared on ABC News with Diane Sawyer on &quot;20/20&quot;. It was clear that sentence formation was still causing her problems, and she needed help walking.
The whole program documented her difficult convalescence, which was necessary due to a bullet wound that pierced her skull at the front, penetrated the left half of her brain, and came out of her head at the back.
Three months ago, she surprisingly returned to the House to triumphantly vote on the debt ceiling.
In her first television interview since the January shooting, in which six people were killed and another 13 were injured, Giffords smiled, laughed and sang - describing her recovery as &quot;difficult&quot;.
When Sawyer asked her how she felt, Giffords, 41, replied, &quot;Pretty good.&quot;
The interview with Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of an hour-long special of the &quot;20/20&quot; episode, which aired on the eve of the couple&#39;s new book, &quot;Gabby: A Story of Courage and Hope.&quot;
The special tracked Gifford&#39;s entire convalescence since the January 8 shooting.
The videos Kelly shot during the first weeks show Giffords in a hospital bed with a shaved head and a long scar across her forehead.
While her husband encourages her, she can&#39;t do more than lift one or two fingers at a time.
A few months later, Giffords is caught sitting in a wheelchair, and therapists teach her how to perform simple activities.
Nodding his head.
Pulling out the lips.
And then, her first word: &quot;Co.&quot;
Within a few days, Giffords uttered another word - &quot;toast&quot; when she demanded a change in her breakfast.
The videos broadcast by ABC show that music played a key role in Giffords&#39; recovery: the congresswoman sings along with a therapist on melodies for Cyndi Lauper&#39;s &quot;Girls Just Wanna Have Fun&quot; and Tom Petty&#39;s &quot;Free Fallin&quot;.
During the interview, Gifford, who devotes two hours a day to therapy, told Sawyer that she did not remember anything from the day the shooting took place.
Her husband said he did not read Gifford newspaper articles about the shooting until March 12, when she first asked him who the six who had been killed in the incident were.
The suspect in the shooting is Jared Lee Loughner, who is being held in a Missoury prison, where he is awaiting trial under the influence of violent drugs.
&quot;A lot of people died,&quot; Giffords told Sawyer.
&quot;Terrible, terrible, terrible.&quot;
Kelly told Sawyer that at one point his wife said during her convalescence, &quot;I lost.&quot;
&quot;So I immediately told her, &#39;Gabby, you didn&#39;t lose,&#39;&quot; Kelly described.
&quot;You just got a loader.
But you can do it, get together and come back even stronger than ever. &quot;
Military units meet with compassion rather than respect
The event was a gala evening on Wall Street that raised millions of dollars for New York war veterans without a roof over their heads.
Kid Rock sang the ballad about helplessness, frustration and loss.
Hundreds of soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines gathered around him.
The festively dressed crowd stood up and applauded enthusiastically.
&quot;Men and women serving in the military were considered heroes,&quot; said David Saltzman, who hosted the spring benefit.
The gala evening was also attended by the then chairman of the committee of chiefs of staff. In addition to him, Admiral Mike Mullen was on the scene, but he saw the role of troops somewhat differently.
&quot;They were all introduced as orphans,&quot; the officer wrote in an e-mail.
I&#39;m sure the organizers meant well.
I know I do.
But what I saw was not respect. It was a pity.
Such completely opposite impressions only illustrate the difficult relationship between the military and the often measured, sometimes celebrating American public.
The army is gratelessly embraced by praise for its victims.
But this praise costs something, say the soldiers.
The public is increasingly acting as if the individual in uniform is sorry.
&quot;We are not victims at all,&quot; said Brigadier General Sean B. MacFarland, who commanded troops in Iraq and will soon leave Afghanistan.
&quot;But it seems that the only way some can support us is to put us in the role of unhappy souls.&quot;
This topic is very sensitive for army commanders who do not want to look ungrateful or spoil relations with the public they serve.
They also realize that the anger that troops once returning from Vietnam had to face was much worse.
As a result, most words of remorse are uttered in silence and privacy among war veterans.
When the two sons of retired Colonel Mark Cancian returned from combat operations where they served as members of the Marines, their father warned them that people outside the army would look at their service from two angles.
From the point of view of some, they will feel respect and amazement, because they defeated the enemy insurgents and visited exotic places.
But others will be wondering if &quot;an evil, violent veteran is hiding beneath the surface,&quot; said Cancian, who took part in the fighting in Iraq and took his place in the Washington government when he returned.
He claimed that when he was looking for a job, some people who interviewed him discreetly indicated whether he could withstand the stress of working in Washington so soon after returning from fighting.
&quot;When you talk about your ministry, you have to reckon with negative reactions,&quot; Cancian instructed his sons.
The military&#39;s concern stems in part from American indifference to wars.
Success on the battlefield seldom reaps recognition in a country that has little awareness of its own military and finds little benefit in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
&quot;As a nation, we no longer value military heroism as it was common during World War II,&quot; said Lieutenant General David Barno, who commanded US troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, recognition from politicians and the public focuses mainly on the suffering of men in arms.
Soldiers are honored for the number of actions they suffered, the number of friends they lost, or the extent of their injuries.
The military is facing increasing pressure to take strong action against rape
This week, it will be decided whether to prosecute 28 women and men against the military over alleged inaction in the rape case.
If not, hundreds of other claimants are ready to sue.
Elizabeth Lyman&#39;s first-class soldier was 25 years old on the night she was allegedly raped by her fellow army and was in her 11th week of pregnancy.
It happened in October 2008 and she headed to the barracks at Miramar Air Force Base north of San Diego. After dinner with a friend, she came across her male colleague carrying a box of 12 beers.
He asked her if he could join her so they could drink a little in her room.
&quot;A warning light came on in my head,&quot; Lyman said.
But the native Texan completely ignored her objections.
I thought: No, he&#39;s 19.
&quot;She&#39;s from Texas,&quot; she said.
&quot;I wish I would listen to my instincts.&quot;
She claims that just a few minutes after they entered her room, a man walked over to her, threw her on the bed, and raped her.
This week, November 18, Lyman and 27 other current and former members of the military will wait for the verdict of a hearing that could have a historic impact. It will take place in Arlington, Virginia, to see whether the charges against former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will be brought to justice.
The allegations allege that Gates and Rumsfeld failed to combat the spread of rape in the military, which is contrary to the constitutional rights of soldiers.
The charge was filed in February by Washington lawyer Susan Burke, and the plaintiff had 17 members at the time. Over the following months, however, their numbers grew to 28-25 women and three men, all of whom claimed to have been raped or otherwise sexually assaulted by their counterparts in the military and that the military had failed to investigate, punish, and seek any justice.
Burke claims that she is after the top of the army commanders, because the problem begins with them.
&quot;The military is a directive system,&quot; he says.
&quot;Who are the people who are in a position to prevent efforts to take action against such acts? High Command.&quot;
Burke also claims that she has contacted at least 400 other survivors since February, many of whom could be part of further lawsuits filed in the future.
Her strategy: Rather than grouping all the charges in this case - stacking all the eggs in one basket, as she herself says - she will file lawsuits in several different cases, if necessary so that the pressure does not subside.
The team defending the Department of Defense is led by United States Attorney Neil MacBride, who, along with his colleagues, has filed a motion to dismiss the case.
The court documents obtained by Newsweek analyze in detail the defense strategy - basically, the point is that current or former soldiers cannot sue the military for injuries they have suffered as members of the armed forces.
Under a 1950 Supreme Court order called the Feres Doctrine, the federal government is not responsible for injuries sustained by soldiers in active service.
&quot;The alleged injuries concern the military service of the plaintiffs,&quot; the document said.
The Ministry of Defense declined to comment on the matter.
But things have changed since the 1950s.
Although women are still officially not allowed to serve in combat, it is just a matter of words: in modern wars it is difficult to find a clear front line.
In the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, teams of female soldiers played an increasingly important role, especially in communicating with civilian women in the war zone.
The result: between these wars, 150 female soldiers fell - two-thirds of them directly in battle.
It&#39;s time for modernization in the military, Burke explains.
She is not alone in her fight. In addition, three other lawyers are dealing with the case.
At Yale Law School, visitors to a veteran seminar on legal services are preparing a lawsuit against four major military academies for allegedly developing an atmosphere conducive to hatred of women.
Independently, a non-profit organization of American Vietnam veterans is gathering evidence for its lawsuit against the military. The lawsuit targets the diagnosis of a &quot;personality disorder&quot; allegedly found in rape victims to give the military an excuse to release them - according to activists such as Anu Bhagwati, a member of the Service Women&#39;s Action Network human rights activist group. common practice.
Already in December, her group filed a lawsuit against the state organization for dealing with veterans, alleging discriminatory practices in the processing of requests for assistance from persons who alleged that they had been sexually assaulted in the service.
Nine separate proposals were presented in Congress, presented by a group of senators and deputies from both political parties, and proposed a number of corrective measures.
According to the Office for the Prevention and Management of Sexual Violence of the Ministry of Defense, 3,158 sexual assaults were reported in 2010.
However, this type of attack remains unreported in most cases, and the Pentagon estimates that this figure is approximately 13.5 percent of the estimated 19,000 incidents that occurred that year.
The March report also discusses the level of prosecution of suspects: In 2010, 20 percent of cases reported in the military went to court - half of the civilian justice system.
The plaintiffs in the case of Deputy Burke describe the attacks only as the first of a series of traumas.
First-class soldier Lyman, for example, reported the alleged rape to the military police less than an hour after it was to take place.
During the night, she says, she was asked to repeat the details of her rape eleven times to various police members, doctors and commanders.
She underwent all the tests necessary to determine the rape, and the blood of the assailant was found in her bed - from a wound she had done on his arm.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman attended a court hearing during which she was asked questions about whether she was making love to her boyfriend on the day of the attack.
Six people were summoned to testify as witnesses in favor of the alleged perpetrator, who was eventually acquitted.
&quot;I remember the day the verdict was handed down,&quot; Lyman said.
&quot;I had the feeling that I would give birth right there - I ran out of the courtroom with a shout.&quot;
&quot;They put me in a psychiatric unit, and when I got out, I remember telling my commanding officer: It wasn&#39;t his trial. It was mine.&quot;
The Lymans ordered a military psychiatrist to visit, who eventually diagnosed her with a personality disorder, making her unfit for duty.
In January 2010, she was discharged from the army without honor and therefore without the right to retirement.
Whether the case of Lyman and the other plaintiffs moves to the next stage or not, it&#39;s a long-distance run, says John Turley, a law professor at George Washington University of Law.
However, he notes, &quot;From my point of view, they should be able to move on to the next stages of the negotiations.&quot;
Between them and the verdict, however, stands the doctrine mentioned, which has been criticized from the first moment it saw the light of day.
I myself am a lifelong critic of the Feres Doctrine doctrine.
The military is several decades behind because their responsibilities do not state the same level of motivation and deterrence.
He adds: &quot;Chances are hard against them ... but it&#39;s important for them to try.&quot;
Change will only happen when good people are willing to fight.
Unless a decision is made in their favor at the hearing, Burkeva, the plaintiffs&#39; lawyer, will gather hundreds of others ready to file a lawsuit and begin work on further cases on the subject.
&quot;We will not stop fighting the military on this issue, from where there will be no reform,&quot; he says.
Or until we die, whichever comes first.
The walls have eyes: How scientists study you on Facebook
Before Anders Behring Breivik became the new face of right-wing extremism in Europe, he was just another young man who presented his anti-immigrant views on the Internet.
On Monday, Braivik, who confessed to the murderous rage in July, which left 77 dead in Norway, attended his first public court hearing.
Although Breivik could act alone, he was certainly not lonely in cyberspace: he spent a lot of time at the computer preparing for the attack, chatting with some of the millions of nationalists supporting right-wing groups on social media sites.
Following this summer&#39;s tragedy, scientists want to know more about these people.
But how to find them?
Easy - just go to Facebook.
&quot;We realized that getting them isn&#39;t really that hard,&quot; said Jamie Bartlett, lead author of a recent British research team report on European digital populism.
The supply of personal information on Facebook is so extensive, Bartlett says, it was enough for researchers to simply use advertising on the site to determine the demographic group they were looking for with absolute precision - something marketers have been doing for years.
Bartlett&#39;s team across Europe found half a million fans of right-wing groups, then turned their attention to them and sent them ads. However, instead of inviting them to a newly formed group or offering them some diet products, they encouraged them to complete a questionnaire asking them about their level of education, their relationship to violence and their optimism about their own future.
Through Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues managed to get results from more than 10,000 fans of 14 different right-wing groups in 11 European countries - without having to leave the office at all.
&quot;It&#39;s a whole new way of doing research,&quot; notes Bartlett.
Some of the results are not so surprising: online supporters of right-wing groups are mostly young men, who are outraged by the growing rate of immigration.
But on the other hand, &quot;those who combine their online activism with offline activism are more sensible, democratic and less violent than those who remain constantly hidden behind a computer screen.&quot;
The work of the DEMOS team is just one example of how Facebook is becoming a new tool in the hands of scientists.
Research teams, health scientists and political researchers use this site to study everything from health issues to social trends hiding status updates, wall posts and &quot;Like&quot; buttons.
Facebook reports more than 800 million active users. Each of them provides, on average, three different data a day, making this social network literally an &quot;information supernova&quot; behind the development of many new researches. The number of academic theses with the word Facebook in the title has increased to almost 800% compared to five years ago.
For some scientists, the magic of Facebook is that it gives them the opportunity to study people without having to bother them somewhere on the street.
&quot;It used to be that when you wanted to conduct a survey among people from the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them.&quot;
&quot;You&#39;d have to get to the side, but they&#39;d never let you go,&quot; says Bartlett.
&quot;Facebook is breaking down all this - you&#39;re just going straight to them.&quot;
Others argue that the site can offer a way to identify and avoid a socio-health problem.
In a recent study by Dr. Megan Moren of the University of Wisconsin, the research team found that university students who discussed their drunken outcomes on Facebook were much more vulnerable to alcoholism than students who were silent on the subject.
Moren suggests that student peers monitor the site and offer to help a student who publishes too many drunken statuses.
&quot;The problem can&#39;t be solved if you can&#39;t diagnose it,&quot; Dimitri Christakis, co-author of Dr. Moren and director of the Center for Children&#39;s Health, Behavior and Development at the Children&#39;s Research Institute in Seattle, told the Washington Post.
&quot;We&#39;ve found a way to identify at-risk children we wouldn&#39;t otherwise have a chance to discover.&quot;
Facebook itself constantly probes the data of its users.
The information team of the website compiled statistics concerning the connection between the relationship statuses and the day of St. Valentine&#39;s Day, turnout in 2010 and the nation&#39;s satisfaction coefficient (mainly using the information they had access to - proponents of Internet freedom have long argued that the site should make its information treasure available to others for research).
But Facebook users know that the site is watching them, whether they like it or not - in exchange for the opportunity to play Scrabble with a friend who is thousands of miles away, you need to provide your personal information to the site.
But what if Facebook users become part of research they don&#39;t even know about?
Researchers have clearly defined rules on how to collect data offline. However, online data is accessible to everyone.
&quot;I don&#39;t think most users even thought that researchers could look at their profiles,&quot; said Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Lab, about a 2006 study he carried out using his students&#39; public Facebook walls.
&quot;As for them, they took it that the information was just between them and their friends.&quot;
Subsequently, the question of methodology is also considered.
Even with off-line research, there is no guarantee that the subject is completely honest.
There is no way to verify on Facebook how much of the information on the profile and the posts on the wall are true.
&quot;What you say on Facebook and what you do outside of Facebook are two completely different things,&quot; Selwyn explains.
That&#39;s why Selwin, who has spent years researching new technologies, thinks that the pencil and notebook remain the best possible tool to use in research.
&quot;When you go out into the real world and talk to real people, it&#39;s something you can&#39;t replace,&quot; he says.
&quot;Social research should be about society and social activities - and a hell of a lot of social activities are still taking place off-line.&quot;
&quot;Cold and Inhuman&quot;: Anders Behring Breivik attends his first public trial
Anders Behring Breivik, a man who confessed to plotting two attacks in which 77 people were killed in Norway this summer, described himself as a &quot;resistance fighter&quot; during his first public hearing in Oslo.
&quot;I am a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and among the Norwegian Knights Templar,&quot; he said in court, where 500 people had gathered.
&quot;I object to the court because your mandate has been given to you by organizations that support the ideology of hatred and because it supports multiculturalism.&quot;
&quot;I confess to my actions, but I do not admit any guilt for them.&quot;
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during the monologue because &quot;he did not want to give Breivik the opportunity to use the hearing as a podium from which to express his views.&quot;
For the same reason, he refused to allow Breivik, who had brought a prepared speech with him, to address the relatives of his victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered police to keep Breivik in custody for another 12 weeks, banned him from any contact with the media for 4 weeks, and said the authorities would have full control over all his visits and correspondence for eight weeks.
About 30 relatives of the victims and survivors attended the hearing.
Some came in the hope of being able to look Breivik in the eye, others to make sure he was kept locked.
They all took part in order to move the case to an early closure.
&quot;I thought he looked cold and inhuman,&quot; one of the survivors of the attack told the NRK commentator.
&quot;It wasn&#39;t pleasant, but I can say for myself that after seeing and hearing the suspect, I moved a little further mentally.&quot;
Breivik, in a dark suit and blue tie, remained calm and professional throughout the hearing. Upon arrival and departure to the building, the journalists and survivors present their eyes without any problems.
Despite Breivik&#39;s bizarre notion that he was part of a larger &quot;resistance&quot; movement, the judge said he was not insane and noted that there was no evidence that he had an accomplice.
For some, it may be comforting that the June 22 attacks seem to be the work of a single extremist and not a group of radicals.
However, this does not automatically reduce the grief and confusion that are still in the minds and hearts of the whole nation.
&quot;I wish she looked like a creature, but she doesn&#39;t,&quot; said a relative of one of the victims.
&quot;If so, everything would be much easier.&quot;
7 lessons from a lost interview with Steve Jobs in a movie heading to theaters this week
When Steve Jobs died on October 5, the views of people who compared him to Henry Ford began to emerge - and voted him the greatest modern inventor for his genius.
At Jobs&#39; recently rediscovered interview, which was dusted off for a special film heading to theaters this week, it will be a fact for all Apple fans that his creative mind perfectly understood the business processes and workflows behind its products.
He was an amazing designer, dreamer and self-proclaimed member of the hippie movement, but also a meticulous organizer and a man who tunes every detail - he believed that many entrepreneurs suffer from &quot;the idea that a really great idea is 90 percent of their work ... [ but] there is still a long way to go between a great idea and an excellent end product. &quot;
In 1995, Bob Cringely worked on the TV show Triumph of Computer Fools, which dealt with the dawn of personal computers. During the filming, a unique, more than an hour-long interview took place.
It had been ten years since Jobs had been forced to leave Apple, and he had his hands full working with his new computer company, NeXT, and was looking forward to the general public&#39;s acceptance of the Internet.
In the end, only a short portion of Cringely&#39;s entire interview was used in the TV show, and the original copies of the interviews were said to be lost in transit.
However, shortly after Jobs&#39; death, VHS copies were found in the director&#39;s garage.
This material, slightly edited, forms the basis of Steve Jobs&#39; 68-minute film: The Lost Interview, which is headed to select theaters this Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone who is notorious for his reluctance to provide longer conversations, Jobs is surprisingly enthusiastic here that he can talk about his technological philosophy and business strategies.
And he also proves to be a very thoughtful person.
Four times during the interview, there is a longer pause between the question and the answer - 10 to 15 seconds of thinking, when you can see how Jobs thinks the answer perfectly to be as concise and accurate as possible.
There are also moments when Jobs&#39;s perfectionism comes to the fore, when he looks impatient at Cringely&#39;s questions and pushes him to get to more important issues and topics more quickly.
The interview was filmed before the Pixar, iPod or iPhone era, and it has frighteningly prophetic ideas as Jobs assesses what other companies are doing well and badly, offering their own vision of the future in the field of computer technology.
It is one thing to read the posthumous evaluations of Jobs&#39; career, but there is something raw and inspiring about Jobs, whom we see here as an eager dreamer in the heyday of his genius.
He has his own vision of what they might and should look like.
It didn&#39;t take long, and after he expressed his thoughts, he also began to put them into practice.
A quick summary of seven scenes from The Lost Interview, which is definitely worth noting:
How he learned to run a business:
&quot;During my years of business, I&#39;ve always asked, &#39;Why are you doing this?&#39; And the answer has always been the same: Well, that&#39;s just the way it&#39;s done.&quot;
No one knows why he does what he does, he never thinks about business matters in depth.
That&#39;s what I found out.
Jobs goes on to describe his efforts to simplify accounting at Apple.
He was completely confused by the way costs were recorded - they often started with &quot;standard costs&quot;, he could only guess at the amount. At that moment, he decided to go his own way - he developed an automatic tool that guaranteed that they could determine business costs in a matter of seconds.
How he made the grate for the pope:
Jobs recalls the &quot;Blue Box&quot; he built with Steve Wozniak - a device that allowed people to effectively break into a telephone company and call anywhere in the world for free.
Much has been written about the device in the past, but Jobs&#39;s enthusiasm for describing the Blue Box as a tool of power is literally contagious.
He tells how he and Wozniak tested the device using a pay phone and were switched from one AT&amp;T network to another during the call, while using as many satellites as possible.
&quot;At least half a dozen times we&#39;ve gotten around the world like this, so when we shouted something into a toll-free phone, it came off a minute later from another phone at the door,&quot; laughs Jobs.
&quot;We were young and found that we could build a thing on our own that could manage infrastructure worth billions of dollars around the world.&quot;
The two of us made a little thing that could control a much bigger giant - it was an incredible experience and I don&#39;t think Apple would ever have come into being without it.
Jobs goes on to describe the joke he and Wozniak almost made to the end. Through the Blue Box, they called the Vatican in the middle of the night and asked if they could talk to the pope, pretending to be Henry Kissinger as best they could.
Gradually, senior members of the Catholic Church were called to talk to an American diplomat in the middle of the night, and it was not until the Pope himself woke up on the phone that the couple chuckled and hung up.
How he fell in love with technology (and telephoned Bill Hewlett):
When he was 12 looking for spare parts to build a frequency meter, he found Bill Hewlett&#39;s phone number in the phone book and called him.
Shortly after their 20-minute interview, Jobs already had a summer job at Hewlett-Packard.
&quot;I was incredibly influenced by it. It was the only company I knew at the time, and it shaped my view of what such a company really is and how it should treat its employees.&quot;
Jobs later became one of HP employees who visited the company&#39;s research labs in Palo Alto, where he saw &quot;the first desktop computer ever made.&quot;
It was as big as a suitcase, it had a CRT monitor and I immediately fell in love with it.
As a teenager, I went higher and higher at HP, hung around the computer, and started writing programs for it.
How innovation comes up:
In several places, Jobs talks during the interview about inventing new products on the fly.
Early in his career, when he set out to sell a few printed circuit boards, a customer asked him to put together an entire computer for him.
He had only 30 paid days at his disposal, during which he had to invent, assemble and deliver the finished equipment.
Later at Apple, he recalls the problems they faced in developing a computer mouse:
&quot;I remember arguing quite wildly ... yelling at me that it would take five years [to build a $ 300 mouse] until I stopped enjoying it, I went out and found a designer.&quot;
Ninety days later, we were able to produce a perfectly reliable mouse for $ 15.
How big companies run out of breath:
Long before leading the resurrection of Apple, Jobs foresaw that many industry leaders would falter in their vision and lose market share.
&quot;Let&#39;s say you work for IBM or Xerox, so you make better copiers or printers, so what&#39;s next?&quot;
You have a monopoly on the market, so the company can no longer be a more successful company.
At that point, sales and marketing are already in place, so companies are run by people who are in charge of this, while people in charge of their own products are out of the decision-making process.
The technological genius that led the company to its unshakable position is now being replaced by people who have no idea about good or bad products - skill and technical knowledge are essential.
That&#39;s exactly what happened at Xerox ...
Xerox could own literally the entire computer industry.
It could have been ten times bigger than it could have been Microsoft in the 1990s ...
Instead of winning, however, they lost to defeat.
How it takes innovation as a form of art:
&quot;There&#39;s still a long way to go between a great idea and a great end product ... and as that great idea develops, it changes and grows.&quot;
During that time, you will learn a lot about him.
You have to make a number of compromises - you simply don&#39;t force certain things on electrons, glass, robots or factories.
You have to keep 5,000 things in mind - different concepts - and put them together ...
In the end, it depends on taste - you try to think of the best things that mankind has ever created, and in a way you try to project them into what you do yourself.
Picasso said that good artists copy, but the best artists steal.
I was never ashamed to steal the best ideas.
Macintosh was so amazing and successful because the people who worked at it were outstanding musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians and, coincidentally, the best computer experts in the world.
Without computers and new technologies, they would be able to do amazing things in completely different industries.
Scalia and Thomas had dinner with opponents of the health care law while their case was being considered by a court
On the day the Supreme Court sat behind closed doors to discuss the politically controversial question of whether to accept an objection to President Obama&#39;s health care law, two of his judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, attended a law-sponsored gala dinner to be held by a law firm. take part in the proceedings before the court.
The incident took place last Thursday, when all nine judges met to discuss the motions.
One case discussed was a lawsuit filed by 26 states challenging a radical overhaul of health care approved last year by Congress - a law that mobilized conservative activists around the world.
The judges agreed to hear the lawsuit. However, a 5.5-hour meeting is expected in March, the outcome of which will further boost the presidential elections, which are scheduled for 2012 and will be in full swing at the time of the decision.
Paul Clement, who served as the United States Attorney General under George W. Bush, will most likely be a lawyer who will stand trial and seek a rejection of the law.
Clement&#39;s law firm, Bancroft PLLC, was one of nearly two dozen companies that helped sponsor the annual dinner of the Federalist Society, which has been advocating conservative legal principles for many years.
Another company that sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the trade associations questioning the law, the National Federation of Independent Business.
Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc., for which huge funds are at stake in the process.
Dinner was held at a Washington hotel a few hours after a court hearing on the case.
It was attended, among others, by Mitch McConnell, the Republican&#39;s highest representative in the Senate and a confirmed opponent of the Health Care Act.
And featuring guests? Scalia and Thomas.
This is nothing new: This pair of judges has been participating in the Federalist Society for years.
And it is certainly not something that would be contrary to the rules of ethics.
In fact, these judges are relieved of the duty to adhere to the principles of conduct to which lower federal judges are subject.
However, if this were not the case, their conduct would certainly fall under the C4 principle, which states that &quot;a judge may take part in events organized by related and other organizations for funding, but the judge must not be a speaker, guest of honor or be included in the program of the action. &quot;
Nevertheless, Scalia and Thomas&#39;s relationship with the two law firms involved in the case, as well as the companies with huge financial interest in the case, was ample enough to alert ethics activists in government.
&quot;This shocking violation of ethics and indifference to the code of conduct contradicts several judges&#39; claim that the Supreme Court follows the same rules that apply to all other federal judges,&quot; said Bob Edgar, president of Common Cause.
&quot;The judges drank and dined at the social benefits together with the lawyers who are waiting to hear their case in court.&quot;
Their presence and assistance in raising funds through this action is undermining all allegations of impartiality, which is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas showed little understanding of their critics and told them that they also easily combined their judicial responsibilities with the actions of groups such as the Federalist Society.
Thomas&#39;s wife Ginni is a high-ranking conservative activist.
Conservatives also argue that Judge Elena Kagan has the most ethical problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was working as a attorney general under President Obama&#39;s government when the first objections to the law arose.
Critics of Kagan are pushing her to refrain from participating in the case, claiming that she fought for the law as much as she could now to be impartial.
Kagan made no indication that she was about to resign.
Boeing has won a record $ 18 billion jet order
Emirates is ordering 50 two-seater Boeing 777 jets with the option to buy 20 more.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliners to Aman Air, collecting more than $ 1 billion.
When a company receives an order for 50 pieces of its products, there is usually no reason to celebrate.
However, if the company is aircraft manufacturer Boeing Co. and the price of these 50 aircraft together is a record $ 18 billion, that&#39;s something else.
Equally important news is where Boeing won the contract from: the Middle East, a growing gold mine for future aircraft orders.
According to a forecast released on Monday, the Chicago company estimates that airlines in the Middle East will need 2,520 aircraft worth $ 450 billion over the next 20 years.
Over the weekend, Boeing announced its largest order in history in terms of dollar value for commercial aircraft - 50 two-seater Boeing 777s.
The sensational order came from Emirates-based Emirates airlines.
Boeing said at the 2011 Dubai Air Show that airlines have the option to purchase another 20 aircraft, bringing the total value of the contract to $ 26 billion.
On Monday, Boeing announced that Oman Air had ordered six Boeing 787-8 aircraft, sometimes referred to as Dreamliners, which boast significantly better fuel economy and passenger facilities.
The total cost of these six aircraft exceeds 1 billion USD.
&quot;This is excellent news for Boeing as a whole,&quot; said Neal Dihora, an analyst for Morningstar.
&quot;The quality of these specific customers is very high.&quot;
Many airlines in the Middle East belong to the local oil-producing nations.
This means that not only do they have the money to pay for the planes, but the increase in the price of fuel - mostly damaging to airlines because it is one of its biggest costs - is not so decisive, because the country itself makes money on higher oil prices.
This is important because they are not as likely as other airlines to cancel or postpone aircraft orders due to rising fuel prices, Dihora said.
&quot;They have natural protection,&quot; he says.
The order from Emirates strengthens Boeaing&#39;s leading position in the wide-body aircraft market and puts Airbus SAS in a tight spot to try to undermine Boeing&#39;s dominance with its A350.
Boeing&#39;s victory comes four months after Airbus officials announced that the first flight of their largest A350, a direct competitor to the 777-300ER, will be delayed.
The move was because customers demanded more payload and range, so the manufacturer took the time to supply more engine power to the machine.
Boeing Co.&#39;s share price rose 1.5% to $ 67.94.
The Mexican president&#39;s sister appears to have been defeated in the Michoacan elections
Luisa Maria Calderon claims that her opponent, Faust Vallejon of the PRI, was helped by drug traffickers in the hunt for a governor&#39;s seat.
Felipe Calderon&#39;s sister seems to have lost in the violent state election for governor of Michoacan. On Monday, she subsequently stated that one of her opponents was helped to win by drug dealers.
Preliminary results attributed Faust Vallej&#39;s leadership in the Western state governor&#39;s election to the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI.
&quot;Intervention of members of organized crime in the whole electoral process and especially in yesterday&#39;s elections itself is alarming not only for Michoacán, but for our whole country,&quot; Luisa Maria Calderon said in an interview with the radio the day after Sunday&#39;s election.
&quot;They threatened our candidates, members of the opinion poll group ... They confiscated ballot boxes, built roadblocks ... and let people vote to order for the PRI.
The PRI ruled Mexico for seven decades until 2000, when it lost its presidency.
However, he plans to return to power soon, and winning the Michoacan election is an important step in that endeavor.
The PRI party hopes to win the presidential election in July as well.
Vallejo seems to have defeated Calderon, who led the day before the election, only very narrowly.
Calderon, a conservative candidate for her brother&#39;s National Action Party, or PAN, refused to recognize Vallejon as the winner.
Third was Silvano Aureolis, a candidate for the left-wing Democratic Revolution Party, or PRD that has so far controlled the governor&#39;s office. This is a very unfortunate loss for the quarrelsome and unfortunate party before the 2012 presidential election.
Aureoles also refused to recognize the preliminary results as valid.
Vallejo, a former mayor of the state capital named Morelia, rejects any relationship with drug traffickers and encourages other candidates to recognize the results.
Michoacán has long been dominated by drug cartels specializing in marijuana, heroin and methamphetamines.
It is the homeland of President Calderon, and it was in Michoacán in December 2006 that he began a military fight against traffickers.
However, the violence persisted.
The mayor of the PAN, a supporter of Luisa Marie Calderon, was assassinated just a week before the election, and many candidates resigned out of fear out of fear.
However whatever the results of the Michoacan elections may look like for the PRI party, winning the party will help gain a new impetus.
The expected PRI representative in the presidential election, Enrique Pena Nieto, of Washington, congratulated Vallej and said: &quot;I think this victory could be very encouraging for the coming year.&quot;
ADB calls on Asia to help save the Eurozone
The Asian Development Bank called on India and China to be prepared to help save the Eurozone from its severe debt crisis, otherwise there could be an overall downturn in the world economy, which would also have a negative impact on the growth of economies in Asia.
Rajat Nag, CEO of Manila-based ADB, said the world&#39;s two fastest-growing economies must &quot;do everything in their power&quot; to help the currency block recover rapidly through the International Monetary Fund or direct bilateral agreements. .
He warned that the Bric countries [Brazil, Russia, India, China] were watching all European troubles &quot;too calmly&quot; and said that Asian financial aid combined with European leadership and resources would help avert a long-term collapse of the global economy.
&quot;We&#39;re all in this together.&quot;
&quot;So anyone who could help Europe out of the crisis is good,&quot; he told the Financial Times during an interview at the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
&quot;Asia may be somewhat protected, but it&#39;s definitely not immune.&quot;
&quot;So if China and India can help, they definitely should.&quot;
The European Monetary Association has been severely tested for several months by a severe debt crisis.
In recent days, Italy&#39;s borrowing costs have risen dangerously and the Prime Ministers of Italy and Greece have resigned.
The growing debt crisis in Europe has raised fears that it could pull the global economy back into recession, and calls have begun for the emerging leading economies to unite to help the Eurozone find a solution.
Mr Nag predicted that all Asian support would be channeled through the IMF, but noted that bilateral assistance - such as the purchase of European Union Aid Fund bonds, institutions for European financial stability - would provide greater negotiating opportunities for Asian partners in European countries.
Anand Sharma, India&#39;s trade minister, said &quot;India will do what it can&quot; to help the eurozone, as its own economy is now suffering from declining exports and drying up foreign capital inflows.
&quot;No one wants the Eurozone to remain unstable and turbulent,&quot; he said.
&quot;We are facing a difficult task and we must maintain a high rate of growth.&quot;
&quot;It&#39;s not an alternative, it&#39;s a simple fact, because how else can we find employment for tens of millions of our young men and women.&quot;
Others argue that emerging economies, such as India, have nothing to help European economies when faced with their own serious economic problems.
Ashutosh Varshney, a professor at Brown University in the United States, said it would be politically very difficult to explain aid to Europe to India&#39;s 1.2 billion people, with 800 million of them living on $ 2 or less a day.
&quot;One day they might find out that the Greeks are retiring at the age of 50 and enjoying their holidays on the beaches, which would probably be difficult to explain to them,&quot; he said.
Lee Howell, CEO of the World Economic Forum, similarly questioned why Indian stocks should be used to maintain well-paid jobs for many Greek citizens in poorly managed and loss-making sectors such as rail.
Mr Nag emphasized that the eurozone crisis threatened a &quot;dangerous domino effect&quot;.
The bank&#39;s forecast that 7.5% economic growth will take place in Asia between 2011/2012 is now facing a &quot;downside risk&quot; due to the European threat.
He said vulnerable emerging markets must develop &quot;contingency plans&quot; to protect them from the downturn and significant outflow of capital from their economies.
Pentagon warning about possible defense cuts
Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta put himself under power in Congress on Monday, warning that looming automatic budget cuts could jeopardize national security and trigger a financial chain reaction starting at the Pentagon and continuing across the battlefield in Afghanistan to civilian assembly lines.
The Pentagon will have to spend a $ 450 billion budget cut over the next ten years, but now fears a $ 600 billion cut if Congress fails to reach a spending deal.
&quot;The effects of these cuts would be devastating for the entire resort,&quot; Panetta wrote in a letter to Senators John McCain, Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, South Carolina.
He said Congress&#39; s inability to reach an agreement on the budget and the resulting so - called seizure would cause a 23% flat rate decline and the cessation of many new projects.
&quot;Due to such a huge reduction, used in this reckless way, it will not be possible to carry out most of our construction or ship projects - you can&#39;t just buy three-quarters of a building or a ship.
&quot;We will also be forced to separate many of our civilian employees, and since the reduction is to take place so quickly, we will also almost certainly have to send civilians on forced leave to be able to meet the target requirements.&quot;
&quot;These changes can shake the faith of those who care about our army and seriously damage its preparedness.&quot;
Eventually, the cuts will affect combat units, Panetta said.
&quot;Although the accounts for financing possible war operations overseas will not be directly affected by this strike, the operations there will be negatively affected by major changes in other budgets,&quot; Panetta warned.
&quot;There will also be cuts in contract personnel, which will result in delays in the agreed contracts supporting the war efforts of our people.&quot;
&quot;The number of paid employees will be reduced, resulting in late payments to suppliers and consequent disruption of legal and political support.&quot;
Ten senators wrote back to Panett ten days ago, asking him for details about the possible impact on automatic cuts in the Department of Defense.
&quot;The consequences of a strike in the Department of Defense could cause a rapid degradation of the view of the United States as a world military power.&quot;
&quot;We are strictly opposed to this tough measure,&quot; the senators said in a joint statement on Monday afternoon when they published Panett&#39;s letter.
&quot;It&#39;s not a conclusion we can live with, and we definitely don&#39;t want to sign it.&quot;
&quot;The planned cuts are a threat to the national security of the United States, which we should not allow.&quot;
&quot;It remains to be seen whether Panett&#39;s letter and fresh warnings will increase pressure on Congress approving the budget and increase voices calling for the Pentagon to be left out of the list of deleted areas.
Panetta had become more and more open in discussions about possible cuts recently, although he himself had moved to his senior position at the Pentagon with years of experience approving budgets in Congress and the White House, so he knew he was embarking on a tough fight.
At a press conference held last week, the Minister of Defense gave a brief picture of what his ministry can expect - an army shell, inside which, however, the core will be missing.
&quot;It will be like a ship without sailors.&quot;
&quot;It will be like a brigade without ammunition.&quot;
&quot;It will be like an air force without trained pilots.&quot;
&quot;It will be like a paper tiger, like an army of barracks, buildings and bombs without enough trained soldiers to complete the mission,&quot; Panetta said at the beginning of a speech at the Pentagon.
&quot;It will be like a unit without morals, unprepared and unable to match a possible enemy.&quot;
&quot;As a result, he will welcome aggression ...&quot;
In an appendix to McCain and Graham, the Panetta specifies how the reduction will result in &quot;significant operational risks: late response to crises, conflicts and disasters; significant reductions in airborne and deployment capabilities worldwide; anticipated unacceptable risk in future combat operations.&quot;
Panetta also added that some of the largest defense projects could be completed, including those that are already being tested and those that are still in the early stages of planning.
The list included, for example, the F35 project, a planned new bomber, a new generation ballistic submarine, a new coastal battleship and a new ground combat vehicle, which the army and marines wanted to replace the Humvee.
Stopping further development and testing of the F35 would save $ 80 billion over the next ten years, but proponents say it is a necessary next step in improving the military needed to address potential threats from China and other rivals. .
How to recognize a lie
A cursory glance at recent headlines suggests how serious and ubiquitous lies and deceptions are in everyday life.
Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain is busy accusing him of sexually harassing several women - both sides claiming the other is lying.
Penn State University administrators have been accused of perjury when they tried to hide records that a retired football coach had sexually assaulted a boy.
Last week, French President Nicolas Sarkozy was caught telling US President Barrack Obama with a microphone open that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is a liar.
The lie was able to destroy entire careers and obscure the stability of many countries.
New York congressman and internet exhibitionist Anthony Weiner made a fool of himself when he published information that was immediately refuted by unquestionable evidence.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards has been accused of misusing funds from his campaign to try to conceal his extramarital affair.
And no one will ever forget the media circus that swept around Bill Clinton when he lied during his second term in office about his sexual affair with Monica Lewinsky.
Stories of cheating at school and university are all over the place.
There are cases where teachers themselves give their students test answers just to look good in their assessments.
Mentors who should teach the opposite send the message that lies and deception are acceptable.
How many scams do we encounter?
Studies show that you lie between 10 and 200 cases in a single day.
Suppose many of them are merciful lies.
Another study showed that strangers lied three times during the first ten minutes of the first meeting in their lives.
Determining lies, or &quot;recognizing lies&quot;, is a necessary skill that everyone should acquire, whether for personal or work reasons.
However, it is not a board game similar to, say, Sharada, where one shouts, &quot;I have you.&quot; Deception recognition is a serious branch of science working with scientific data collected over the last six decades at prestigious universities during detailed research projects, especially in the field of psychology and philosophy.
One of the results of the research is that most of the old myths about lies have been refuted.
Liars look into your eyes.
It&#39;s not like they stutter, stutter, blush or fidget.
However, do not deduce from the fact that it is somehow difficult to observe and reveal liars.
A trained lie identifier can reveal the truth from the sentence structure, small facial expressions, the way questions are formed and their timing.
I have spent several years gathering scientific knowledge from a large and evolving lie detection industry, and it is clear that deception detection is a modern skill that is easy to learn and can help you a lot in today&#39;s complex world - especially if your work responsibilities include hiring, interviewing, negotiating or leading people.
Good liars can read well in others, let them relax in vigilance, direct their emotions and intuitively realize how the other side accepts them.
We know from research that extroverts lie more often than introverts, that men tell more &quot;self-centered&quot; lies, while women tell more lies &quot;focused on others&quot; - mostly to protect someone&#39;s feelings - that married people lie less often to their partners than single people. (But the lies they tell are usually &quot;outrageous&quot;).
We also know that if you are perceived as a sinner, others feel less guilty when they lie to you.
How do you know someone is lying?
First, observe the subject&#39;s normal behavior.
This is called &quot;initial observation&quot;.
Thanks to him, he will have later findings to compare with.
Notice the posture of the subject, his laughter, the work with the voice.
You should know if someone is constantly tapping their feet so that you don&#39;t unjustifiably accuse them of lying just because they start tapping their feet in the middle of a meeting.
Then try to identify clusters of false verbal and nonverbal behavior.
But take it only as a warning signal, not as evidence of a lie.
People telling lies can stop moving their upper body as they try to remember their fictional story, they can point their toes to the door, lean to the exit, significantly change their posture, or show &quot;relief after the conversation&quot; - exaggerated relief and change positions when confession is difficult behind them.
Interviewers often give a false signal that the interview is over, just to see what the relief will look like after the interview.
Also perceive the language of the subject.
Famous is the story of how Scott Peterson once argued and used the past tense to claim that his murdered wife was alive, which launched a nationwide search for her body.
Deceiving individuals may also express themselves in a measured manner: &quot;I had no sexual relationship with that lady ... Miss Lewinsky&quot; or they repeat the difficult question.
The most common verbal signs are only very slight.
Someone can use a lot of &quot;mitigating language&quot; when answering a difficult question: &quot;Well ... to tell the truth ... from what I know ... to the best of my knowledge.&quot;
We do not know much about such an answer and it is often another warning signal.
There is no spell that can expose every lie, but it is possible to acquire skills that can be used to track down a lie.
With these skills, a person will have a better chance of not flying into a liar and a fraudster in his personal and professional life.
Controversial oil pipeline construction plan will be redirected following threat of postponement of US government approval
A few days after the Obama administration threatened to postpone approval of a planned oil pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico - pitting unions against it but reassuring environmentalists - the pipeline company announced its willingness to redirect the project so that it could be things in motion again.
TransCanada announced Monday night that it will move the planned pipeline route from the eco-sensitive Sandhills area of Nebraska, and is confident that the project will be approved anyway.
The company announced the decision at a press conference at the Nebraska government headquarters.
TransCanada&#39;s succession Alex Pourbax says the company believes the pipeline will eventually be approved, even though it will take a different route.
The announcement came after the State Department announced last week that it was postponing a decision to federally approve the project, from which it would not study possible alternative routes to avoid reaching the Sandhills area of Nebraska and the Ogallala aquifer, a vast underground water reservoir.
&quot;This is really a step forward,&quot; Republican representative Lee Terry of Nebraska told Fox News.
A new environmental assessment commissioned by the Foreign Ministry would probably postpone any decision until 2013, a year after next year&#39;s elections, but the authorities deny that politics would play a role in the decision.
In a written statement last week, Obama described the decision as a request from the State Department and expressed his support for it.
The 1,700-mile pipeline will connect Canada and the Gulf of Mexico.
700,000 barrels of oil flow daily from Alberta to refineries in Texas.
It will be necessary to cross 6 states in this way.
This project is completely hated by environmentalists, but it is loved by work crews who estimate that 20,000 new jobs will be created while working on the pipeline.
However, lawmakers in Nebraska opposed the plan and considered introducing laws that would force the company not to intervene in the Sand Hills region and the Ogallala aquifer, the main source of drinking water and irrigation.
An existing environmental impact study commissioned by the State Department found that the project would have only a minor negative environmental impact, but a source from the energy industry said the ministry inspector general had ordered a new review of the original process, focusing mainly on two questions.
One was whether a lobbyist hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who advised Hillary Clinton in 2008, was a conflict of interest in the program.
Next, whether the company hired for the original study was not chosen inappropriately because it had links to TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle is accused of vomiting with fear in her toddler
The New York family claims that the singer Patti LaBelle stormed into the lobby of their Manhattan house and frightened their daughter so that she vomited in fear.
The performance of the hit singer &quot;Lady Marmalade&quot; frightened 18-month-old Genevieve Monk so much that she suffered &quot;personality changes, sleep disorders&quot; and &quot;increased fear of strangers,&quot; her family claims in a lawsuit filed with the Manhattan Supreme Court.
On November 10 last year, stage technician Kevin Monk, his wife Roseanna, a kindergarten teacher, and Genevieve prepared for a family trip.
When Kevin Monk parked the car, Roseanna Monk went down with her luggage to the lobby of their house on Riverside Boulevard and took Genevieve with her.
Roseanna Monk said she stopped at the door for a moment and put the baby down for a moment.
&quot;Someone appeared behind my back and said, &#39;Do you know what your daughter is doing?&#39; I said &#39;yes&#39; and I left to pick her up.&quot;
LaBelle irritated the pregnant woman irritably.
&quot;She told me in an aggressive tone, &#39;You shouldn&#39;t put your daughter at the door,&#39;&quot; Roseanna Monk said.
&quot;I told her, &#39;I don&#39;t care what you think.&#39;&quot;
She got angry and started talking vulgarly - she shouted the vulgar expressions loudly ...
She had a bottle of water with her and she started splashing water at me.
He claims that Genevieve had a hysterical fit.
“I said to the woman,“ Look what you did to my daughter, ”said the baby&#39;s mother.
LaBelle lunged at her mother - who still had Genevieve in her arms - and had to be stopped by her entourage, who then dragged her into the waiting car, Roseanna Monk said.
The daughter, meanwhile, was screaming so hard she vomited, she added.
Later, the family sent a letter requesting an apology from LaBelle, but received no response.
LaBelle&#39;s lawyer and spokesperson are not responding to our phone calls to comment on the case.
The lawsuit seeks unspecified compensation, but the family&#39;s attorney, Sam Davis, said he took the case for free and that the family planned to donate all the money to a charity dedicated to children with cancer.
&quot;The purpose is to force Patti LaBelle to take responsibility for her actions,&quot; Davis said.
&quot;Such behavior is completely unacceptable, especially if it is directed against a school teacher holding an eighteen-month-old child.&quot;
The unfavorable climate slowed down the economy
During the first year of Mario López Valdez&#39;s government, unemployment and unreliability rose in Sinaloa, foreign investment fell and with it the economy
The year 2011 will go down in the economic history of Sinaloa. This is the first year of the government of Mario López Valdez, which calls itself the government of change. The government has had high expectations of economic progress, but due to unfavorable weather conditions at the beginning of the year, there has been no growth and even a decline in key indicators of economic development.
The low temperatures in February caused millions in losses in the area of agriculture, limited the possibilities of growth of the state economy, and are responsible for the reduction of economic activity by 3.6% in the first semester of this year. In the area of agriculture, there was a historical decrease of 31.16%, which disrupted the dynamics of other economic sectors.
According to the damage report issued by the Mexican Council for Sustainable Rural Development, the damage was recorded on 582,835 hectares of arable land, of which 78.03% was completely destroyed and the remaining 21.07% was partially damaged. The main crops destroyed include vegetables, corn and peas.
The decline in economic activity until November caused a constant rise in unemployment in the state. According to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography, the state&#39;s unemployment rate increased during the first three quarters. From January to March, 55,053 people in Sinaloa were unemployed, representing an unemployment rate of 4.53% of the economically active population. In the second quarter, unemployment rose to 5.28%, and between July and August, average unemployment continued to rise, reaching 6.19%, representing around 74,000 unemployed. Compared to the first quarter, the number of unemployed increased by 18,969 people.
Less liquidity
Unemployment during the year in the state of Sinaloa may be due to several factors. According to Gerard López Cervantes, director of the Faculty of Economics and Social Sciences of the UAS, the increase in unemployment can be explained indirectly, based on steps taken at the level of public policy.
&quot;We are witnessing rising unemployment, which is linked to various factors, including the loss of liquidity in the market due to resource constraints due to anti-money laundering legislation passed by Congress. For people who illegally seize dollars, it is not easy for them to earn them, invest them or use them for something, &quot;he emphasized.
Stop migration
López Cervantes said that the demographic factor also contributed to the rise in unemployment.
&quot;The number of people going abroad to work in the United States has fallen, both because of the difficulty of entering and then because, even if they go abroad, it is difficult for them to find work. So people stay and demand work from our state, and so unemployment is rising, &quot;he said.
Unreliability
The analysis of the labor market in Sinaloa is also deteriorating due to the growing unreliability that prevails in terms of working conditions. According to the National Institute for Statistics and Democracy, 60.38% of the employed population in the state works without paying benefits to the social security administration.
Other features of the labor market, such as low wages, add to unemployment and unreliability. In this administrative territory, the lowest salaries are from the whole country, according to the registers of the Mexican Institute of Social Security and the Secretariat of Labor and Social Planning.
The average monthly income of workers in the state of Sinaloa was 5,352 pesetas until September, well below the national average of 7,375 pesetas.
Shortening of foreign direct investment
Along with a decline in economic activity and an increase in unemployment, the most significant decline in foreign direct investment in the last 10 years was also recorded in 2011. According to the Treasury Department, foreign direct investment amounted to $ 630,697 between January and June, down 87.74% from $ 5,143,312 in the same period last year.
On the other hand, the Ministry of Economic Development of the state government reports investments of 17,280 million pesetas per year. These investments went mainly to service companies.
Debt
In connection with the economic downturn scenario, the state government asked the state congress in July to approve a loan of 3 billion pesos. It would be earmarked for investment in infrastructure projects in 18 urban areas to revitalize the economy. The local congress approved a loan of 2,600 million pesos. Until November, no debt gains were recorded in any sector of the state economy.
Reaction
According to representatives of the business sector, the first year of the government of Mario López Valdés pointed to a lack of government management skills.
Miguel Loredo López, President of the National Chamber of Transformation Industry, said that in 2011 there was a lack of harmonization of the will of individual sectors, including the state government itself.
&quot;The development of the Sinaloa economy has been really small this year. We need to work hard to regain the land we have lost this year. &quot;Hopefully next year will be much better,&quot; he said.
Slowness of the economy
Loredo López said that events such as frosts at the beginning of the year stopped the state economy and limited its development and growth.
&quot;Weak economic movement was caused by a number of events, including frosts. One of the main consequences was a slowdown in the economy, which did not recover quickly enough to restore dynamism to achieve acceptable levels of process, product and service movement. at the end of the year they were well below the expected forecasts, &quot;he said.
Redefining the mission
According to Teodor Salazar Uriarte, president of the Employers&#39; Confederation of the Mexican Republic in Sinaloa, the state needs to be pushed for more dynamic productive activities.
&quot;Generally speaking, we see that work is being done. We believe that a long-term plan needs to be drawn up to redefine the state&#39;s goals and economic direction, as it is important to mobilize all the material and human resources potential that Sinaloa has.&quot; he said.
The work ahead
President Coparmex stressed the importance of setting a vision for the future that would better guide the government&#39;s efforts.
&quot;In general, I would say that the government has tried to achieve good results in various areas, there has been some progress in the area of economic development, but it is important to create a long-term plan,&quot; he said.
He said the current administration had shown progress in conducting public policy.
&quot;There are elements that make it possible to say that the government is trying to be friendly. I can say that the work done is visible here and I think that the government is aware that there is also a lot of work ahead of us,&quot; he said.
Convicted of 8 kg of marijuana
Navolato was sentenced to five years in prison and 100 days in prison for possession of eight pounds of marijuana.
The General Prosecutor&#39;s Office of the Republic informed that the convicted dealer is Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval. He was convicted of the crime of endangering health, specifically for possession of marijuana for commercial purposes.
According to AP / SIN / CLN / 687/2010 / MI, Valenzuela Sandoval was detained by Mexican military forces on June 7, 2010 during a march on Cipriano Valdez Street, opposite Station 80 in El Castillo, Navolato.
The dealer drove in a white pick-up van. He had a black bag on the shelf in the car and a small backpack in the passenger seat. Soldiers found 8 kilograms of 23 grams of marijuana.
For these reasons, the detained man remained at the disposal of the Judges of the Second Department and the proceedings remain internal within the Center for the Implementation of the Legal Impact of Crimes.
He owes contributions to projects
Social projects that are part of programs such as Habitat, Saving Public Places and 3x1 for Migrants face the risk that they will not be completed or that they will be long overdue due to a lack of economic resources, said Miguel Ángel López Miranda.
The director of the city&#39;s social development said that if construction work has progressed so far, there is now a risk that the state government will not be able to secure the relevant supplies, which require more than 11 million pesos for the three programs.
He said the total investment in the three programs is almost 50 million pesos. The state accounts for 25%. Until now, only the Federation and the city have provided funding for the work, so it is possible that there will be delays in the implementation of projects.
&quot;They have to secure almost 12 million and although the year is coming to an end, we have not received anything at all. Even though we should have received a part in July,&quot; he said. &quot;In order not to waste time, we started the projects and continue very successfully, but we lack the money.&quot;
He said that last year, under the administration of Jesús Aguilar Padilla, the state had failed to deliver, and therefore at the beginning of the new period, the city had to apply for a loan to pay more than 7 million not given to them by the state.
&quot;The same thing happened to us in the previous six years, because the state did not have the economic capacity to participate and the programs went on. In order to get to the mentioned programs this year, we had to get funds to cover what it did not complete. state &quot;, he explained.
Despite the promise made by government officials to hand over these resources, he said that a request had been sent to Armand Villarreal, Secretary of Administration and Finance, to speed up the procedure and that the corresponding percentages would arrive as soon as possible.
&quot;They were supposed to give us 12 million and although the year is coming to an end, we haven&#39;t even received a peso yet.&quot;
The Court approves the &quot;end of analogue broadcasting&quot; in Mexico in 2015
Replacing analog signals with digital signals is one of the most important changes the world has experienced in recent years.
The Supreme State Court (SCJN) dismissed a constitutional lawsuit filed by the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies against a presidential decree seeking to hasten the so-called &quot;analog signal switch-off&quot; and implement it in 2015 instead of 2021. It found no eight votes were needed to invalidate it.
A minority of four ministers, including the president of the court, Juan Silva Meza, believed that President Felipe Calderón had not exceeded his powers when he issued a decree outlining the steps that will lead to the transition to terrestrial digital television.
As a result, the action filed by the Senate was dismissed because the qualified majority of eight votes required for the court to rule on the constitutionality or unconstitutionality of the said decree, which thus remains valid, was not obtained.
The draft judgment, drafted by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, presents the possibility of declaring the decree unconstitutional, because the regulation of all issues concerning radio and television is a matter which is reserved by law to the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cofetel). Thus, the principles of hierarchical subordination and the exception of the law are violated.
Only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero voted for the project.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies supported the constitutional dispute in an effort to fight the decree. Minister Sánchez Cordero accepted the requests and suspended the application of the decree and all the actions described in it, leading to the transition to digitization.
The ministerial meeting also decided to dismiss the action brought by the Chamber of Deputies without entering into a discussion on the proposal, which is also in charge of Minister Sánchez Cordero.
In his speech, the Prime Minister stated that he did not agree with the arguments of the proposal in the sense that the federal executive could not structure measures to prepare the public administration through general norms.
&quot;I don&#39;t think that even if it did, it would affect the autonomy of the regulator,&quot; he said, adding that public policy planning in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector was the responsibility of the federal executive, which has a constitutional mandate to determine the state&#39;s direction.
Replacing analog signals with digital ones is one of the biggest changes the world has experienced in recent years. It is related to better use of the radio spectrum, better signal quality and more channels.
He believes that postponing change would mean postponing the benefits of digitization, which requires decisions in the public interest. Digitization has not only a technical dimension, but &quot;also affects economic, social, political and national security issues&quot;.
He emphasized that these issues &quot;require the operation of the whole established system, in accordance with the principle of the economic direction of the state. It includes a whole range of competences which the Constitution entrusts to the hands of the state government.&quot;
He recalled that a number of countries around the world had already completed the transition to the digital system and did so through their governments, even though they had highly specialized technical bodies.
He said that it was not possible for the government, by issuing a dissenting decree, which to some extent interferes with the powers of Congress, to introduce into the area of administration compliance with laws prepared by the legislature.
In Michoacán they analyze the possibility of adding &quot;voice after voice&quot;
According to data published by PREP, the difference between first and second place in the governor&#39;s election is less than 27 percent. So far, the votes of 879 out of 6074 constituencies have not been counted.
The &quot;vote by vote&quot; count appeared in this year&#39;s Michoacán elections, where, according to the PREP, the difference between first and second place in the governor&#39;s election is less than 27 percent, not including 879 votes. a total of 6074 constituencies.
In this context, María de los Ángeles Llanderal Zaragoza, President of the General Council of the Michoacán Electoral Institute (IEM), recalled that a few days ago, on 9 November, the electoral authority had approved a series of measures to harmonize local standards with federal electoral reform.
As will be recalled, Michoacán did not officially uphold his political constitution or his State Electoral Code or the Electoral Justice Act. The State Congress approved the reforms shortly before the statutory deadline for their entry into force was due to expire during this term, and Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel failed to publish them within the time limit in the Official Gazette Act, citing any objections.
On November 9, the Supreme State Court (SCJN) resolved a constitutional dispute initiated by the local legislature and declared the head of state on constitutional reforms &quot;invalid and illegal&quot; because he had no right to &quot;approve or veto&quot; them.
When asked about the possibility of a &quot;vote by voice&quot; census, María de los Ángeles Llanderal replied that, thanks to the approval of the relevant measures by the IEM General Council, it would be possible for the local and local electoral authority to carry out both and partial censuses.
In this way, the partial counting of votes, one or more election packages, will be possible under the following conditions: the election results do not agree; there is no record of the counting of votes and the calculation in the appropriate box or it is not available to the President concerned; or if there have been errors and obvious violations of the election results.
In addition, an overall recalculation of votes in all ballot boxes will be possible if there are indications that the difference between the potential winner of the election and the candidate in second place is less than or equal to one percentage point; whenever an explicit request from a party and / or coalition representative nominating a second candidate appears at the beginning of the session.
It will also be possible to recalculate the votes if, after a proper count, the difference between the probable winner and the runner-up is found to be equal to or less than one percentage point and also whenever there is an explicit request from the political party whose candidate ended up in second place. In this case, the ballot packages for which the partial census was performed will be discarded.
It should be mentioned that in such a situation the elections are in Morelia, where according to PREP the difference between the first and second place is less than 0.16%, although 129 of the total 923 constituencies have not yet been added.

Some did not believe it because they said he even drove a truck, but he always went for his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Dávila Bacio remembers him as a very good man, &quot;as soon as he arrived in Saltillo, the whole family wanted to see him, as when he brought Martha Sahagún to Saltillo.&quot;
The young man even remembers that when he was seven years old, he went to Zapopán to graduate with his uncle, so he is convinced that he died doing what he loved most in life: flying a plane.
They said goodbye to him last

Three abandoned corpses were found on Cadereyta NL&#39;s farm
Hours before the discovery, military officials unveiled 11 people detained in the area for organized crime.
The bodies of three men murdered by gunfire in various parts of the body and head were found on an abandoned farm in the village of Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo León.
The find was made on a 1.5-kilometer road from Cadereyta to Santiago, at the level of the area known as El Castillo.
People who moved in these places noticed that the cottage with the beige-coffee fence had an open door from time to time.
When they looked inside, from a distance of about three meters, they noticed the corpses of three people, so they immediately alerted the authorities.
One of the people was wearing a yellow sports shirt and dark cotton pants and was not wearing shoes. Next to him, a man was also lying in a sports T-shirt with white stripes.
A few feet away was the body of another person dressed in a red T-shirt and blue cotton pants.
All three lay facing the ground.
According to data obtained at the sites, all three people were probably murdered elsewhere because no bullets were found.
Messages addressed by one organized crime group to another were found on the cottage fence, as well as a number of bullet marks, both on the building and on the door.
They detained 11 suspects in Cadereyta
The Secretary of the National Defense introduced 11 people, including juveniles, who were members of a criminal group that operated mainly in the Cadereyta area and which is associated with kidnappings, murders, persecution and illegal burials.
According to published information, during the first attempt on November 11 in the colony of Los Alveros, 8 people were detained and one detainee was released.
Three properties and a mobile phone were secured. They confirmed that they were members of a criminal group called &quot;Los Zetas&quot;.
Another raid took place on November 12 at 6 o&#39;clock. Military personnel were on patrol in the Rancho Viejo area of Cadereyta when they noticed a car without a license plate and two people in it.
After stopping the car, they inspected and discovered one rifle, a cartridge case and 18 rounds.
Then, on the basis of these statements, one of the accomplices in the La Frauda area was detained on November 13 at around 2 p.m. When he saw the soldiers, he tried to run.
They were accused of illegal burials in General Terán, China and Cadereyta.

Appointed Prime Minister Mario Monti will meet with the Italian president tomorrow to introduce him to a new government facing a crisis that is holding the country above the abyss of economic disaster.
Tomorrow&#39;s Prime Minister Mario Monti will meet with the Italian president tomorrow to introduce him to a new government that will face a crisis that is holding the country above the abyss of economic disaster and has put the entire eurozone in danger.
The Presidential Palace has issued a report announcing that Monti, appointed on Sunday, will meet with President Giorgio Napolitano on Wednesday to confirm that he can form a government.
He is expected to introduce a government composed mostly of technocrats, although it is not yet clear when the new government will take power.
Monti said he would present to the president the results of his talks with political parties in an effort to form a government.
&quot;I want to confirm that I have absolute confidence in our country&#39;s ability to overcome this difficult phase,&quot; the former European Commissioner told reporters.
Monti did not explicitly say that he would be able to form a government, but the tone of his comments indicated that obstacles had been overcome.
&quot;The framework is now well marked,&quot; he added.
Monti completed the process of forming a government in less than three days, a much shorter time than usual. Meanwhile, Italy is trying to fight the political and financial crisis, which has brought debt levels to unsustainable levels.
The new administration, led by former European Commissioner Monti, must approve the tough austerity package demanded by European leaders. Only in this way will it be possible to restore Italy&#39;s undermined credibility.
There is a lot of pressure on Monti to hurry. Due to market instability, interest rates on Italian BTP bonds with a ten-year maturity exceeded 7 percent, a level where Greece and Ireland had to ask for a bailout.
Emma Marcegaglia, chairwoman of the Italian employers&#39; organization Confindustria, told reporters after a meeting with Monti: &quot;We said we would be very supportive of this government.&quot;
We believe that this government is the last chance for Italy to get out of this burning situation.
Monti&#39;s hopes for success have greatly increased thanks to the support of PDL Silvio Berlusconi, who was forced to resign on Saturday by the crisis.
&quot;We believe that Professor Monti&#39;s efforts are destined for good results,&quot; Angelina Alfano, secretary of the center-right party, told reporters.
The support of the PDL, Italy&#39;s largest party, is significant because, to date, many of its members have opposed the government with a technocratic majority formed by Monti.
Parliamentary support
The new Monti government must have strong parliamentary support to push for unpopular austerity reforms.
Any obstacle or delay in the effort could trigger a new and devastating attack on the financial markets.
The Italian Association of Foreign Banks has joined in the pressure to warn that Monti&#39;s failure could spell disaster.
Monti opened talks on Monday with political parties, trade unions and business groups, youth and women&#39;s organizations.
The round of negotiations will end on Tuesday night.
Monti was appointed President Napolitano on Sunday, who allowed a very rapid move in response to the crisis.
After a brief decline from the end of last week, when it was already clear that Berlusconi would resign, interest rates on Italian bonds returned to a critical level, responding to uncertainty as to whether the new prime minister would succeed.
Saving Italy, whose public debt is 1.8 trillion euros, would be beyond the scope of the eurozone&#39;s current financial reserves.
Monti said his government should stay in power until the next elections, which are scheduled for 2013, despite general forecasts that politicians will give him time only to carry out reforms and then call early elections. .
Monti said he would like to incorporate policies into his cabinet, but the big parties insist that the government must be made up of experts only to get Italy out of the difficulties the country has gotten due to financial pressure.
Political sources said that mutual mistrust and disagreement between the parties complicate the attempt to integrate political figures into the government.
The Spaniards take part in international matches more often than the Costa Rican
Of the 22 Spanish footballers, ten will cross the limit of 50 international matches.
On the Costa Rican side, only one of the 22 called-in players reached the number of 50 matches.
A huge contrast on the Costa Rican side, if we compare the 22 players from both countries, who met today in a friendly match at 15:05 at the National Stadium in San José.
While the world and European champions, number one in the FIFA monthly rating, have a wide range of Class A inter-selection matches to their credit, Costa Rica has only defender Michael Uman, who is the only one to have played 50 international matches.
He reached this number last Friday during the match against Panama (0-2) at the Rommel Fernández stadium.
Spanish footballers, who play in the All-Star Game and in the powerful clubs of the English Premier League, have maintained intense activity throughout the year at league championships and home cups and high-level matches in European cups such as the Champions League.
To the previous one, we must also add the experience of the Spanish national team in complicated elimination matches for the European and World Championships.
Costa Rican players, on the other hand, have very limited opportunities for foreign matches in the region. For example, there is Concacaf, which is considered the lowest level within FIFA.
We see that the largest number of foreign matches from the Spanish national team is held by goalkeeper Íker Casillas, who last Saturday before England (loss 0-1 in London) caught up with former goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarreta with 126 international matches.
Casillas will play against Costa Rica today and will set a new record for Spain - 127 international matches.
Xavi Hernández, a key player in Barcelona, has 106 matches.
Casillas and Xavi were even officially announced by UEFA last week, along with other Spanish players who have a hundred matches to their credit. Among them, the already mentioned Zubizarreta with 126 and Schalke&#39;s middle forward, Raúl González, with 102.
Carles Puyol also approached the hundred with 97 matches.
Followed by Xabi Alonso with 91; Fernando Torres s 90; David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81; Andrés Iniesta s 62; Cesc Fábregas s 61; and David Silva with 53.
On the Costa Rican side and close to Michael Uman, the left wing of Júnior Díaz moves with 48 matches and the goalkeeper Bryan Ruiz with 45.
Furthermore, only 5 exceeded the limit of 30 matches: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
The smallest number of matches.
With less than 30 matches in Spain, there are Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Álvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
On the national side with less than 30 matches stands Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest did not exceed 20.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba two, in Costa Rica Víctor Bolívar has only one and Ólman Vargas and Edder Nelson are still waiting for their first match.
Spain&#39;s top scorer is David Villa with 50 goals, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
On the Costa Rican side, Bryan Ruiz has the most hits, nine, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
The quintet included the country in its tour to celebrate twenty years of existence
&quot;Traveling to Costa Rica is a dream come true&quot;
In an exclusive interview with Viva, bassist Jeff Ament of Pearl Jam said the band is ready to offer one of the best gigs at the National Stadium next Sunday.
We have been waiting for more than 20 years, but the group itself assures them that the opportunity to play in Costa Rica is a dream come true.
That&#39;s what bassist and founding member Jeff Ament said, who spoke exclusively with Viva last week from Brazil.
The group is touring the South American continent as part of a tour to celebrate its 20th anniversary and will be at a unique stop in Central America on Sunday the 20th.
This day will perform at 7:30 pm at the National Stadium, along with the angelic band The X and national musicians from Las Robertas.
This is an example from an interview, the full transcript of which can be found on the La Nación website on the Internet.
This is a dream come true for your Costa Rican fans. Pearl Jam will play in Costa Rica. Do you realize what your fans are experiencing?
The trip to Costa Rica is also our dream come true.
This is hardly the second time in South and Central America and the experience so far has been great.
I&#39;ve only been to Costa Rica once, on vacation. It is a beautiful country and I believe that we will be able to stay here for a few days.
So we are very happy to bring you our music.
I ask because they literally adore the group here, the fans are experiencing these days of preparations very intensely.
What do you say to your most rock fans?
Thank you for standing with us for so many years.
It took us almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica. Thank you for waiting so long and we are sorry that it took us so long.
Some people already talk about the concert as the biggest show of the year.
Does it put more pressure on you?
Some of the biggest shows we&#39;ve done in the last 21 years have been in a few weeks.
We put on some great shows in Sao Paulo and we hope to get in shape for the concert in Costa Rica.
In fact, we are really looking forward to that concert.
We love this country, we like to surf, we like the jungle. Costa Rica is the best country in the world for both activities.
How did you get to know Costa Rica and its waves suitable for surfing?
We have a lot of surfers and I have a good friend who lives in Tamarindo. The waves here are incredible.
My friends go surfing in Costa Rica or Nicaragua or Mexico. These are the best places to surf. And so we learned about Costa Rica, through people who love surfing.
Looking at your tour, you&#39;ve prepared a great show with many songs.
What did you plan for your presentation in Costa Rica?
Since we&#39;ve never played here, we have no restrictions on what we can&#39;t do.
We will try to present the best possible show with various songs. We will try to play a few songs from each album and introduce our fans to a good and diverse repertoire.
You never repeat the repertoire.
Why?
I think it&#39;s partly because we have nine albums and we can play more than 120 songs and everyone likes different songs, so it&#39;s hard to choose what songs we&#39;re going to play every night.
When we have two or three songs in our repertoire that we haven&#39;t played in a long time, we focus on them and we are also surprised, because we remember why we liked them so much and that we may have forgotten about it.
So the show is more interesting for us, and that&#39;s why I think it&#39;s more interesting for people as well.
With this tour you are celebrating 20 years of artistic career.
Looking back, is it hard to believe everything you&#39;ve accomplished?
Yes, for sure.
First of all, I don&#39;t think any of us could have imagined that we would be in one big rock band and that we would stay in it for more than 20 years. That sounds like a dream.
We realize how much we have been given and we are impressed that we can continue to play together.
We love each other and we like to make music.
We are lucky to be able to look at the places we have always longed for.
We couldn&#39;t have done better.
What did it mean for you to have been an important part of the origins of the grunge genre?
It has always been an honor for us to be part of this group, in which the greats themselves are represented.
People from Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains are our friends.
Surprisingly, when a movement arises from a group of friends, it doesn&#39;t happen very often.
From time to time, a group is formed in a city, but it is much less common for five to ten groups to emerge from one city at a time.
We are proud of it and we are honored to be part of the Seattle group.
Sometimes we still play with some.
Last year we were at the festival with Alice in Chains and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden on tour. We are fortunate to be all our friends, and we are honored to be part of this movement that originated in Seattle.
It is also very unusual for a group like yours to stay together and still have the same members after all these years.
Yes, the four of us have been together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, which in itself is much longer than the usual duration of the group.
I think, firstly, we are all lucky to be still in this world, and secondly, the fact that we are constantly interested in each other plays a role.
We are all close friends and thanks to that we managed to open musical paths that leave everyone enough freedom to experiment.
We trust each other, we respect each other&#39;s music and I don&#39;t think it could be better.
Your relationship to the word glory has not been easy. However, thanks to your success, you can do what you like.
How do you find balance?
As we grew, it gradually became easier to find balance.
We try not to tour too much, because it&#39;s very easy to fall into this trap of crowds and people who love our music.
When you realize that people came for the music, you remember that you have to respect the music and what you gave it. You must not be carried away by being a famous rock star. Neither of us ever really cared about this.
How do you remember the next project Mother Love Bone?
I think we wrote great songs and in the beginning it was something spectacular.
We existed as a band for three years and never released an album until Andy (Andrew Woods) died.
It was very frustrating because it took so long. Most importantly, we are still friends with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore), who started in a band with us. When I listen to a song or look at photos, I remember Andy was incredible, laughing at him. It has always been a joy to work with him, to laugh, to talk about music or football and much more.
He was an incredible person and we miss him so much.
The national band Las Robertas will be commissioned to launch a show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know their work, especially Eddie Vedder, and that is why you chose them as a frontman?
Yes, the production sent us videos with a few suggestions, and we liked this group the most. That&#39;s why we&#39;re curious what Las Robertas has to offer live and they have to be a lot of fun.
Why do you always change the words Yellow Ledbetter live?
That&#39;s a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), so I don&#39;t know.
He sings it and I think he adds the first thing that comes to mind.
Who influences you as a bassist?
A lot of people.
Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, CJ Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski are the first to attack me ...
There are so many that I could talk all night about bassists I like.
How did Pearl Jam keep grunge, even though it&#39;s no longer in vogue?
I think we&#39;ve all always felt slightly separated from the word grunge.
When grunge is said, I imagine the groups I mentioned as Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and everyone else that were formed at the same time. And if the music is still valid today, it&#39;s great, because it&#39;s music worth listening to and bands like Mudhoney play better music today than ever before.
In the beginning, your music was slightly gloomy and now it is more positive.
What is behind this change?
This is interesting because I feel like there are a few songs in the new album that are lighter, but there are also songs like The End or Juste Breathe that are considered very gloomy, although they may sound positive.
For both of them, when Ed played them for me, I cried, and the songs are deeply dark.
I think when you grow up and have some trauma in your life, you lose someone from your family or a friend, these things start to affect your art and music, and these two songs are just what they mean to me.
I also think you can be a happy person and still make gloomy music.
Peru:
Fujimori was re-hospitalized for medical tests
Former President Alberto Fujimori was hospitalized in a public hospital on Tuesday to be tested for muscle loss in his lower limbs, his doctor said.
Fujimori, 72, who is serving a 25-year prison sentence for human rights abuses committed by his government (1990-2000), suffers from several illnesses, including language cancer, for which he has been operated on four times and is now under control by doctors.
MP Alejandro Aguinaga, his personal physician, told Canal N that Fujimori would be tested at the National Institute of Neoplastic Diseases in three days to find out why he was in pain and why he was losing strength in his lower limbs.
Aguinaga said that in his opinion, Fujimori could receive pardon for humanitarian reasons, but the former president himself does not want pardon because he feels innocent.
He was operated on four times for tongue cancer, lost 18 kilograms, and other ailments such as severe erosive gastritis, pancreatic cyst, kidney stones, high blood pressure, and circulatory problems in his legs added to the problems.
Fujimori has been serving a sentence since September 2007 at the National Directorate of Special Police Operations.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the death of 25 people killed by a murderous squadron of troops operating illegally in the first years of his reign.
Mujica on a visit to Mexico to strengthen political ties
An official delegation led by Uruguayan President José Mujica, accompanied by several ministers and businessmen, will begin a visit to Mexico on Tuesday. Its aim is to achieve the expansion of trade between the two nations and to touch on the political issues of the region.
Mujica will meet his Mexican counterpart, Felipe Calderón, on Wednesday. This is the most important meeting of an extensive visit full of meetings with politicians, business and representatives of the Uruguayan community living in Mexico. The program was published by the Uruguayan presidential office.
The meeting of the two presidents in Guadalajara will serve to exchange information on political issues between the two countries, &quot;the Uruguayan presidential office said on its website.
According to local media, Mujica will try to get Calderón to support Uruguay in the dispute with France, when French President Nicolas Sarkozy included the South American country on the list of tax havens at the G20 meeting in the French city of Cannes.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened to exclude countries that continued to remain tax havens from the international community. This statement provoked a negative opinion from Uruguay and consultation with the ambassador to that European country.
Mexico has chaired the G20 since November. The G20 is a group made up of the world&#39;s most powerful developing and developed countries. It has had an information exchange agreement with the Latin American country since January this year to prevent double taxation.
In recent years, the Uruguayan government has sought to flesh out fiscal exchange agreements in order to move away from the Organization for Economic Co - operation and Development (OECD) &quot;blacklist&quot;, which includes countries that have not implemented all required international standards for tax co - operation.
From a trade point of view, Mexico and Uruguay have concluded a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) since 2004, which has strengthened trade in goods between the two countries.
Bearded plumber runs in 3D thanks to &quot;Super Mario 3D Land&quot;
Super Mario has been struggling for more than 25 years to save Princess Peach from the clutches of the villain Bowser, but has never appeared in 3D: in &quot;Super Mario 3D Land&quot; he will fight for the love of a girl with stereoscopic technology.
The title, which comes to all stores around the world this month, has been designed from the ground up to take advantage of all the features of the Nintendo 3DS portable console, which allows you to play 3D games without having to wear glasses.
&quot;Mario is a character who has to say how stereoscopy without glasses should work,&quot; said Omar Álvarez, a Nintendo press spokesman in Spain, during a video game presentation in Madrid.
Álvarez said that &quot;Super Mario 3D Land&quot; is &quot;the first Nintendo video game created especially for this medium&quot;, because until now successful films like &quot;Star Fox 64 3D&quot; or &quot;Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D&quot; were adaptations of existing titles .
A Nintendo spokesman said that in addition to being 3D, &quot;Super Mario 3D Land&quot; is an &quot;affordable&quot; video game that allows you to enjoy a fast and smooth game.
Álvarez confirmed that &quot;Super Mario 3D Land&quot; contains two games in one: the first part is &quot;simple&quot;, whose task is to attract less skilled users.
Once you overcome this level, you can embark on the &quot;second round&quot; of levels of the game, which are more challenging this time.
In addition, users can choose real-time between &quot;aggressive D&quot; or one that only affects the depth of action. But it will be necessary to play in 3D in order to overcome various challenges and &quot;not succumb to optical illusions&quot;.
This new arrival of Super Maria in 3D also assumes the return of the character to the portable console, which has not happened since 2005.
In this video game, Nintendo plays the notes of those who watch the saga and repeats the successful formula from previous episodes. It means that the bearded man&#39;s plumber will have to go through dangerous mined platforms to free Princess Peach.
Although the player will find news in movements, in the area, in disguises and also among enemies, &quot;playful&quot; Luigi will also appear.
Colom approved the extradition of Portilla to the United States
President Álvaro Colom announced on Tuesday that he had taken action over the extradition of former President Alfonso Portillo, who is to be held accountable in the United States for a $ 70 million laundering plot.
Thus ends the process of having Guatemala respond to a request from a northern country requesting the extradition of Portillo to try.
At a press conference, Colom confirmed that his decision was in line with the independence of the judiciary and the executive, bearing in mind that the criminal court had already ordered extradition.
He assured him that he had not &quot;interfered&quot; in court decisions during his term of office and allowed all the extraditions that came to his desk.
In addition to Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroquín will be charged with murder and grievous bodily harm and Edgar Estrada Morales and Víctor Estrada Paredes, both for drug trafficking.
Colom&#39;s move is a step of execution after all judicial and constitutional instances have been exhausted to prosecute the former president, who ruled from 2000 to 2004.
In accordance with the rulings of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court (CC), Portillo will be extradited once his legal situation in Guatemala has been resolved and respect for human rights has been guaranteed.
Portillo was found not guilty of embezzling 120 million at the Department of Defense during his presidency. This process was preceded by extradition, but the Public Ministry appealed, bringing the case back into play.
Trinija helped 6,000 young people in danger
The organization was created to help uneducated children not to find themselves on the margins of society.
The balance of the first 25 years of Trinijov&#39;s social support organization is very important: 6,000 young people at risk of social exclusion have been helped. The organization has been helping them overcome difficult situations for 25 years.
To this must be added the long hundred jobs that have been obtained for this social group.
Yesterday&#39;s anniversary also served to present the balance sheet as part of a ceremony that took place in the former production facilities of the Fabra i Coats factory and was attended by more than 300 people.
Trinijove was set up in the Trinitat Vella district in 1986 to help young people with low education, without a job, who are addicted to drugs or in a situation where they could fall into social exclusion.
Yesterday&#39;s meeting in Sant Andreu was attended by a large number of representatives of organizations and institutions that have worked with the association for the past 25 years.
The diverse political representation, at the time of the elections, showed the unified nature of the work carried out by the Trinians.
Along with the President of the Generalitat, Arthur Maso, and his predecessor, Jordi Pujol, the ceremony was attended by former Socialist Education Adviser Ernest Maragall and former Deputy Mayor and current Eco-Socialist Councilor Ricard Goma.
The current Social Welfare and Family Counselor, Josep Lluís Cleries, and Jaume Lanaspa, General Manager of Social Work at La Caixa, also visited the Fabra and Coats Great Hall.
Mas said that Trini&#39;s was created at a very difficult time and that there are also a number of obstacles today, but added that the work the association has brought to date is &quot;a good foundation.&quot;
The president cited Trinijov as an example of how it is possible to fight against adverse circumstances and how to give courage to people in difficult situations.
&quot;The crisis is nothing new for this organization and for the work it does,&quot; he said.
The occupied house, where gigantic parties were held, was evicted
The intruders appropriated 11 of the 13 apartments in the building in Balmes, 51
The 12 occupiers left the house at noon yesterday without resisting
All indications are that the nightmare experienced by neighbors at 51 on Balmes Street is finally over.
Twelve people yesterday at noon voluntarily left the building, which they inhabited illegally and where they organized gigantic parties that woke up the neighbors. They left the building by court order and without the need for police intervention.
At the end of the operation, the lock on the door was replaced to prevent the situation from recurring.
&quot;From now on, the entrance will be guarded,&quot; the administrator said.
The occupiers, who occupied 11 of the 13 apartments in the building - the rest are inhabited - took away all the electrical and partly water equipment, painted the walls and left behind garbage of all kinds, especially cans of alcoholic beverages.
Huge parties took place in the first three apartments, lasting up to two days and waking up the other tenants.
Next to the building is a disco, Balmes 51, which was also damaged.
Its owner, Maria Pantinat, explained to Europa Press that sales had fallen by 80% while the building was occupied.
The owner of the disco points out that the occupiers of the building put unfair competition on her because they sold drinks for 3 euros, while the disco costs 10.
In addition, the owner of the entertainment company had to respond to neighbors&#39; lawsuits over noise. However, the problems were not caused by the visitors of the disco, but by the inhabitants of the occupied house and especially those who took part in the parties organized here, the frequency and intensity of which increased in recent weeks, according to the angry inhabitants of the area.
The owner of the disco explained that the problems were so great that they even agreed with the owner of the building and have been forgiving her rent for nine months.
City police have also confirmed that they have received more complaints from neighbors about the situation in recent weeks.
Last week, Alberto Fernández Díaz, chairman of the PP People&#39;s Party&#39;s city group, demanded that &quot;the building be evicted immediately, ending the problems of civic coexistence suffered by neighbors and the destruction of the area.&quot;
The chairman of the People&#39;s Party explained that only one floor had been occupied before the summer, but in recent months the occupiers had reached all floors of the building and almost all the flats, and one of them had even been stolen.
In this regard, he added, &quot;there is a need to end impunity and be consistent when it comes to acts of civil liability that have taken place in the building&quot;.
Yesterday, city police also evacuated the Nou Barris building.
At 3:30 p.m., police arrived at Building 35 on Mont-ral Street after being called by neighbors who saw four people entering the building.
All four were immediately detained.
Park or mountains?
The architects met on the occasion of announcing a procedure that brings with it more than a controversy over fees
The city tender for 16 gates reopens the debate on the role of Collserola Park in Barcelona.
In the mid-1980s, at the height of the now defunct Corporación Metropolitana de Barcelona (CMB), the municipality printed several pamphlets in support of Collserola Park.
The leaflet defined the mountain as a large park in metropolitan Barcelona.
What&#39;s more, it was supplemented by a numerical comparison with New York&#39;s Central Park.
After the demise of CMB in 1987, the park returned to the minds of many as the upper limit of Barcelona. The Catalan metropolis is one of the few that does not orient itself on the north-south axis, but up (mountain) - down (sea).
The qualification of Collserola as a nature park goes in this direction.
The reference was no longer Central Park, but Yellowstone with wild boar instead of the Yogi bear.
Such was the position until September, when the town hall announced a mega competition consisting of 16 auditions for the same number of entrance gates to Collserola.
Of course, the gate favors the idea of the park.
Either this or someone is trying to place the gate on the field.
So the only question is: Collserola, a park or a mountain?
During the competition, both from a purely organizational point of view and on the basis of a reflection on the city, this question becomes a central theme of all Barcelona architects.
It is already a topic as blunt as when two members of this old caste chosen to meet in an elevator shake hands.
And it was this act that provoked one of the rare coincidences between what the three Barcelona architects and the prominent university professors think.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: the competition is justified.
According to Roldán, after the Gulf Party question began, &quot;the&quot; mountain side &quot;also needs to be discussed, so Ildefons Cerd&#39;s speech on green apples was not completed.
&quot;We have to start from the principle that the largest park in Barcelona is the beach.
Among other things, its great availability.
Collserola is more complex, &quot;said the architect, for whom the name&quot; gate to Collserola &quot;carries a&quot; lexicological trap &quot;: we must not imagine them&quot; as entrances to the park, but rather as the delimitation of zones where it is possible to operate. &quot;
Modol, like Roldán and Bayona with experience in the world of urbanism, describes the proposal as an &quot;intellectual challenge&quot; offering &quot;some danger&quot;.
The danger of the &quot;uncertainty posed by the public space project today&quot; after the experience of the 1980s, which had &quot;its swan singing&quot; in the Forum area.
The first concern is the very delimitation of the boundaries where it should be built.
&quot;Defining something means taking another step,&quot; that is, basically taking it a step further.
&quot;New urban and planning tools need to be kept in mind, because the current ones (with reference to the General Metropolitan Plan (PGM)) can cause a real disaster.&quot;
If we focus on the question in more detail, Modol believes that the valley slope of Collserola can be &quot;considered a park&quot;, but the Barcelona part cannot, for purely topographical reasons.
Modol also recalled that there was already work done by the Patronate de Collserola, which &quot;must not end up in the dump&quot;, although he welcomes the fact that the town hall offers its board to intervene in the project from the &quot;first moment&quot;.
Moreover, he understands that the proximity of the mountain and the city is a kind of culvert that allows architects to engage in debate, but &quot;doubts&quot; that it should be this technical profile that will lead multidisciplinary teams (&quot;it&#39;s all about skill&quot;, adds) to be created: &quot;Architects should only be tools&quot;.
Bayona suggests that the answer to the question that gave the game its name is complicated because the tender lacks a global vision of Collserola: &quot;16 tenders have been launched, covering all the mountain-sea axis, but there is no longitudinal study. which would look at the area and understand it as a whole &quot;.
This means that at least he, he applied to all 16 tenders.
Otherwise, the project of one gate may come across the concept and definition of the architect of the neighboring gate.
In his view, City Hall should ensure that the zone immediately above Ronda de Dalt should provide a full-length equipment zone to ensure a smooth transition between the city and the greenery.
Casino forgave Jonas Larrazabal for release
After 72 days in prison, Cadino Red&#39;s lawyer pardoned the mayor&#39;s brother of Monterrey in a trial in which he was prosecuted for alleged blackmail.
Manuel Jonás Larrazábal has spent 72 days in prison and will now be released after being pardoned by a legal representative of Casino Red before the Second Criminal Court in the district, which was hearing a blackmail case in which the mayor of Monterrey&#39;s brother was indicted.
Following the assassination of Casino Royale, Casino Red owner Sergio Gil García released a series of photos and videos in which Manuel Jonás was to demand payment of an economic quota to allow Monterrey City Hall to allow an illegal operation in a bookmaker.
Following a public indictment, the State Prosecutor&#39;s Office initiated criminal proceedings against the mayor&#39;s brother. On September 2, he was detained and imprisoned for 30 days.
He was then transferred to Prison 1, located in the Barrio Antiguo in the state capital, after spending 4 hours in front of Public Ministry Agent No. 3 for property crimes.
He remained in this position for the next 49 days after the second arrest warrant was issued and a Public Ministry agent refuted the possibility of complicity or organized crime.
On October 19, he was taken to a criminal court in Cadereyta on suspicion of extortion of the owners of Casino Red in the amount of one and a half million pesos. However, he remained only a few hours in moderately supervised prison because he was threatened with death.
Leaders allowed him to remain in the city cells in San Nicolás de los Garza during the trial.
On October 25, he was presented with an arrest warrant issued by Jorge Yánez, secretary of the Second Criminal Court, who said that after almost two months of investigation, enough evidence had been gathered to prove Jonas&#39;s guilt. Evidence includes, for example, the payment of 1.5 million pesos to casino representatives in exchange for a promise that the operation will be allowed.
This Monday, Casina Red&#39;s legal representative, Víctor Aldo García Gómez, appeared to Judge José Luis Pecin and asked for mercy for the mayor&#39;s brother. As a result, he will soon be able to return to freedom.
During the legal proceedings, a representative of the Public Ministry assigned to this court, Ramiro Arias, asked Garcia Gómez whether the damages had been repaired and which of the partners had decided to grant pardon. However, the lawyer made it clear that the name would remain secret.
On the basis of the official file 197/2011, a legal pardon is granted to Jonás Larrazábal. No complaint will be possible in the proceedings against him. It is also not possible to claim damages or punishment.
After hearing the lawyer around 15:50, the court ordered the immediate release of Larrazábal Breton.
The court&#39;s secretary, Jorge Yanéz, appeared in San Nicolás de los Garza prison to inform Jonás that he had been pardoned and that his case had been placed in the archives.
He also informed him that the judge had issued an immediate order for his release.
Secretary Dionisio Pérez Jácome presented details of the plane crash that killed the governor&#39;s secretary, Francisco Blake, and seven others.
The Secretariat for Communications and Transport (SCT) said the results of the investigation into the accident in which Government Secretary Francisco Blake Mora and seven others showed that the helicopter had hit the ground directly with full force without the pilot having a chance to try a forced landing.
At a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jácome, Secretary for Communications and Transport, said that before the plane took off, the pilot stated that the climatic conditions of the flights allow.
&quot;The parts that appear indicate that the unit came into contact with the terrain several times, the wings tangled in tree branches 25 meters from where the unit lost its fuselage.&quot;
He also informed that the unit was designed for 19 people, so it met all the requirements for the transport of personnel.
In addition, he stated that, following an impact investigation, no components had been found on the ground.
&quot;The search revealed that parts of the aircraft were not located elsewhere, so the aircraft hit the mainland as a whole.
&quot;The helicopter was designed for 19 people, met all requirements for passenger transport.
The terrain shows a slope with a slope of seven to thirty degrees.
The secretary assured that the most important thing now is to get results as quickly as possible. However, the investigation can take several months or up to a year.
Gilberto López Meyer, director general of airports and ancillary services, said that at the time of the crash, the helicopter of the Presidential General Staff was moving at cruise speed and that the accident occurred on soft ascending terrain.
&quot;This information supports the hypothesis that it was a normal overflight operation at the time of the accident,&quot; he said.
At a press conference, SCT representative Pérez Jácome listed six basic points of the investigation:
Visual flight:
In accordance with aviation standards, the flight was carried out according to the rules of visual flight, which means that the crew must see the terrain during the flight.
Meteorological conditions:
Reports in the AICM indicate adequate conditions at takeoff, accordingly the aircraft is advancing towards the border, between the DF and the State of Mexico were visible layers of clouds at low altitudes.
Selected routes:
It is likely that due to clouds, the crew was looking for a lower area and greater visibility up to the Cuernavaca valley.
Impact location.
The coordinates of the impact and the last record of the helicopter from the radar coincide, it is probable that there was no loss of control or disruption of the flight trajectory before the impact.
Dispersion of aircraft debris in a limited area:
The information we currently have allows us to assume that the impact occurred on a straight trajectory and from the side.
The scattering pattern of the remnants of the aircraft indicates that the helicopter was intact at the time of the impact on the mainland.
There was no fire or explosion.
No evidence of an explosion or fire was recorded at the scene of the accident.
The latest results of the investigation show that there may have been several contacts with the mainland.
During the field work, the remains of the aircraft were found at an altitude of up to 9200 feet above sea level, the terrain slopes, the height of the slope goes from seven to 30 degrees.
The photos show shots that probably disintegrated along the route.
The information provides elements that appear to indicate that the helicopter may have come into contact with the ground in several places.
After a careful search in the vicinity of the accident, no remains of the helicopter were found in an area larger than the demarcation area, which reinforces the assumption that the crash occurred when the helicopter was still intact.
The Mexican Institute of Health Insurance has launched research into the gene that causes obesity
The Health Insurance Institute is conducting research to discover the gene responsible for childhood and adolescent obesity. The research is carried out with the support of experts from the IPN Institute
The Mexican Institute of Health Insurance (IMSS) has announced that it is conducting research to detect a gene that causes obesity in children and young people. Research entitled &quot;Genetics of obesity in children and adolescents&quot; will provide results on overweight.
In a report, Miguel Cruz López, head of the Biochemistry Research Medical Unit at the Specialized Hospital of the 21st Century National Medical Center, explained that a multidisciplinary team of doctors, nurses, nutritionists and social workers had been set up.
This team relies on the support of postgraduate specialists and students from the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) and the Research and Advanced Studies Center (Cinvestav) of the National Polytechnic Institute (IPN).
The general public, whether or not authorized, may also be involved in the research. People can come to the participating IMSS sports centers in Valle de México, where tests will be performed on minors every room from 8 am.
He emphasized that the research began at the Cuauhtémoc Sports Center (Mexican State) and, since 8 October, has also been carried out at the Nezahualcóyolt Sports Center (Eastern Mexican State).
Once data from 500 to 600 children are obtained, the study will continue at the Independencia Sports Center (south of the Federal District) and finally at the Morelos Sports Center (north of the Federal Center).
He explained that the aim of this research is to determine the components and importance of genetics in the development of obesity, and to track down risk factors in Mexican children and young people, thus preventing the development of chronic degenerative diseases.
On the occasion of International Diabetes Day, which is being celebrated on 14 November, he recalled that the aim was to collect data from 3,000 children and young people between the ages of six and 14, with parental consent and supervision, for the application of specific nutrition questionnaires.
The questionnaire will also ask about physical activity and a family history of hereditary diseases in order to avoid risk factors that could cause diseases such as diabetes or kidney failure.
He specified that every Saturday, all participants take anthropometric measurements (weight, height, waist circumference), measure blood pressure, determine glucose, triglyceride, cholesterol, insulin levels and examine genes (trying to identify the genes involved in the formation childhood obesity).
Cruz López said the research reflects health careers&#39; concerns about the alarming increase in children&#39;s weight.
&#39;Health surveys conducted between 1999 and 2006 showed that in just six years, only boys had an 77% increase in obesity and a 47% increase in girls. There has also been a dramatic increase in overweight, said an IMSS expert.
He said that one of the reasons for looking for indicators is the assumption that the country&#39;s population differs from other populations in its genetic history.
He reported that the average Mexican has 65% Native American-American genetic equipment, 30% European, and 5% African. This is reflected in the genes that are responsible for developing diabetes and overweight.
He explained that in general, the genetics of obesity is commonly explained as the inability to burn the excess energy we consume (calories) and which is stored in the form of fats.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit of the participants was that they received an overall assessment of the children &#39;s condition, to see if they were known to be overweight or obese.
He stated that even the presence of dark wrinkles (acantosis) on the neck and forearms indicates the likelihood that the individual will suffer from metabolic problems and pre-sugar conditions.
The information is still confidential, doctors pass it on to parents in writing and explain to them all the measurements and lifestyle changes they have to make in order for their children to avoid the disease.
Cruz López explained that there are three main components that cause overweight, obesity and other chronic diseases: a sedentary lifestyle involving a lack of daily physical activity, sitting in front of the TV all day and using vehicles instead of walking short distances.
Being overweight is also caused by a high caloric intake, i.e. higher consumption of sugary drinks, carbohydrates (tamales, bread, pizza, burgers, etc.) high in fat and protein and the genetic burden that is the subject of this research.
There will be no potholes in UNAM asphalt
Rafael Herrera, a scientist from the Faculty of Chemistry at UNAM, creates modified asphalts with polymers to create a mixture that has better functionality, regardless of climatic conditions and temperature
If the paving was properly cared for, there would be no need to repair almost 200,000 potholes after each rainy season in the Valle de México metropolitan area, said Rafael Herrera Najera, a scientist at the Faculty of Chemistry (FQ) at UNAM, who added that if construction and maintenance asphalt paving was adequate, there would be a significant reduction in potholes, or it would even be possible to remove them completely.
In his lecture, The Technological Cause of Pits, delivered at the International Year of Chemistry, he announced that the laboratory under his leadership was developing modified asphalts with polymers, which should produce a mixture having similar characteristics to asphalt but greater mechanical resistance, both at low , so at high temperatures.
Herrera Najera believes that this type of modified asphalt could be used in places with extremely warm climates, such as in some cities in the north of the country. This would improve functionality and reduce the creation of potholes.
He explained that asphalt, the heaviest part of oil, is a grouping of hydrocarbon molecules, high molecular weight molecules called asphaltenes, and other low molecular weight molecules called maltens. Together, they give the asphalt a typical viscoelastic character.
The viscoelastic nature of asphalt is that at high temperatures, around 180 degrees, it behaves like a liquid, at 120 degrees it has a high viscosity and at 50 degrees it is almost solid, while at low temperatures the asphalt tends to break, he added.
This means that the resistance of asphalt in the streets is not uniform, but changes during the day according to meteorological conditions and temperature, warned an expert in chemical engineering.
A scientist from the Faculty of Chemistry observed that most of the streets in Ciudad de México are covered with flexible paving, which consists of six layers of materials, the last three of which are mixed with asphalt.
Between the uppermost layers is an asphalt liner, formed by small stones embedded in asphalt and then compressed.
He emphasized that every stone that forms the liner is filled with asphalt.
When passing cars or creating pressure, it is possible for the forces in the pavement to be well distributed.
If it were modified asphalt, it would decompose even better, according to the chemical engineer.
He added that the last layer, called the mantle, was placed on the asphalt insert, formed by fine stones, ie sand also embedded in the asphalt.
Due to the fact that this layer will come into contact with the rims of vehicles, it must have a greater mechanical force than the asphalt insert and must ensure the friction of the road.
Due to the fact that it will be exposed to a large load as part of the paving, the casing must be of sufficient thickness and care must be taken of the material from which it is made.
Climate, especially humidity and temperature changes, are also very important factors to keep in mind. In particular, water has a great influence on the functionality of the asphalt insert.
As soon as the terrain is moist, the water spreads inwards and it is difficult for it to get out, this causes all layers of paving to soften and thus create potholes.
He explained that during the formation of potholes, the film of the casing is destroyed first, and only then is the asphalt liner damaged. However, the damage does not occur at the same time, but it is a gradual process that should be stopped at the first signs using appropriate maintenance programs.
As a member of the National System of Scientists, he also explained that the load on vehicles is another important factor in creating potholes, and therefore the thickness of each individual layer of paving must match the load on vehicles and ensure that this load is not exceeded. This is the only way we can prevent frequent potholes.
Rafael Herrera pointed out that we still have a lot of work to do when it comes to asphalt and research is just beginning. It is worth mentioning, for example, asphalt emulsions, which are already available on the market in other countries and allow you to easily repair potholes without having to use high temperatures.
What did the candidate from Valle miss to become the new Miss Colombia?
Analyzes of the factors that contributed to Melina Ramírez Serna&#39;s failure to win the Miss Colombia crown.
Valle thus wins the 14th title of the first multi-miss.
Valle del Cauca again failed to reach the crown of Miss Colombia.
Melina Ramírez Serna had to be content to find herself on the podium, winning a silver crown and a sash, which made her the new first multi-miss of Colombia.
Based on the results of yesterday&#39;s final in Cartagena, in which Miss Atlántico won and took the scepter, the department won the 14th title of the first multi-miss. Melina thus joined the crowds of women from the Valle del Cauca, who came within reach of the winning crown, but were eventually announced the first vice-miss. These include Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Mónica Evers (1989), María Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008).
A question that many ask themselves. What was missing?
The result is the defeat of a great favorite, who in all previous rounds showed that she has the intention of becoming the new Miss Colombia, and it is not for nothing that she became the Queen of the Police and the most beautiful face of Joile de Volgue. These titles were achieved, for example, by Taliana Vargas or Natalia Navarro, who subsequently won the title of Miss Colombia.
One of the key factors that decided that the jury decided to name it only the First Vice-Miss is the fact that it did not convince with its answer to the question: &quot;Which book did you like the most and why?&quot; By Martín Murillo Gómez from the literary editorial office Leamos.
The candidate answered the question:
&quot;I read a lot. I believe very much in the role of literature, I think it&#39;s one of the forms of cultivation. The book that influenced me the most as a child was&quot; The Little Prince, &quot;a very deep book.
I currently read &quot;Crime and Punishment&quot;. It is a book that is part of a worldwide literature that we should all know. And today I have with me a book by Irene Nemirovski, a Russian author. This is a wonderful book called &quot;El ardor de la sangre&quot;.
She did not like this answer, partly because of the term &quot;cultivating&quot; and secondly because the candidate did not explain what the individual books mentioned to her.
After the ceremony, Melina declared that she was calm and happy with the result: &quot;The world is wise, what is to happen will happen.
And you people read if you can. The Little Prince is a wonderful book. &quot;
One of the other hypotheses is that Valle destroyed the favorite position.
A Bogot journalist indicated that the fact that the candidate was from the beginning the most popular, most celebrated and the one who won all previous awards (Gastronomic Challenge Oster, public title for best artistic dress and Queen Mother), aroused the envy of other candidates, stressed the queen, who then she burned on stage.
This was evident during the first presentation of the swimsuit at Hilton Beach and during the two shows before the final coronation.
Although she shone on both, it was clear that she lacked the strength and enthusiasm shown by the representatives of Magdalena and Atlántico.
Ariel Osorio, a journalist at the &quot;At Home&quot; program on the RCN Canal, believes that Melinda&#39;s first title in the first place is confirmed by the fact that the candidate who wins the most titles during the competition does not end up with the Queen&#39;s Crown.
In addition, Valle has been rather unfriendly to the media in recent days, and that has not paid off.
Another hypothesis is that Valle failed to convince the jury of its interest in social work, which is the basis of the National Beauty Contest.
Just on the sidelines, two days before the election, international jury member Lucy Doughty said she was looking for a woman who would be aware of her country&#39;s social needs.
&quot;In the Miss Colombia competition, beauty alone is not enough, you need to see more than just physical beauty. You need to focus on social feeling. It is important that candidates are involved in such projects before entering the competition.&quot; she explained.
There is also speculation that candidate Valle lost points due to the shortcomings of her background and the fibrosis that was evident on her buttocks. However, this is completely at odds with the verdict of the jury, which chose her to miss &quot;natural beauty&quot; for the healthiest body, proper nutrition and responsible physical activity.
Jorge Hernán Orozco, who prepares the queens, admits that Melina did not have the best body, that there were better girls, &quot;but problems with fibrosis on the ass, which in my opinion was not very noticeable, took her points until the last day&quot;.
Meanwhile, journalist Guido Hoyos of Cromos magazine believes that the native of Valle made a mistake when she underwent several surgical procedures.
&quot;The surgeries are fine, but they did not work out in Valle.
The body was never her strong point, and here she took her toll. &quot;
Due to this award, which was first given by the National Assembly of Beauty, after the parade in a swimsuit, a harsh prediction was made, which came true. It was claimed that this was the satisfaction Raymund had given Melina so that he would not have to give her the highest crown in the end.
True or not, it is certain that Melina began the year of her reign today, not as a queen but as a princess, from a position that gives her the opportunity to represent Colombia in various international competitions, where she will be named the National Competition itself.
However, she will go down in history as one of the queens who, despite the captivating success in Cartagena, did not reach the highest crown.
Such was the work of the resident of Cali, who identified the corpse of Alfons Can
A fingerprint expert from Cali went down in history as the man who confirmed the death of &quot;Alfonso Cana&quot;.
The work of these officials is crucial.
On November 4 last year, a fingerprint expert from the CTI in Cali went down in history as a man who confirmed the identity of Farc&#39;s top leader: &quot;Alfonso Cana,&quot; by comparing fingerprints.
Of the seven fingerprint experts working for CTI this week, it was Eliazar González, a man from Puerto Tejad who has been working in forensic research for 21 years.
At the beginning of his career, González worked at the town hall in Chocó, where he often had to wade through the forest for more than five days to get to a place where there were corpses that had to be identified.
In 2000, he moved to the capital Valle and, after completing the relevant courses, began to specialize in fingerprints. This science deals with the study of skin friction, ie the palms of the hands and feet.
In the week of the operation against Alfonso Can, Eliazar was told to take his clothes with him for at least three days.
Something big was expected.
On Friday night, he set out for Cauca in a helicopter from Palmira.
He knew he would have to identify two corpses, and he suspected that one of them was the man who ran the oldest guerrilla in the world. Therefore, they asked him to take a card with fingerprints of Guillermo Leon Sáenz (his real name).
However, when he arrived with the investigation team at the site of the corpse, he did not recognize him because of his physical appearance. He looked completely different than in the media.
He had no beard, dressed as a villager in the area, without glasses, much slimmer.
But prints don&#39;t lie.
Along with the galton&#39;s magnifying glass, ink, and transporter and light, Eliazar began comparing the corpse&#39;s dactyl records with the card readings.
His eye did not disappoint: it was &quot;Alfonso Cano&quot;.
That same night, a man from Puerto Tejado was instructed to confirm to the Minister of Defense, Juan Carlos Pinzón, whether he was really the supreme commander of Farc.
Searching for tracks
For the dactyloscope from Sijín de Cali, the recognition given to Eliazaro González by President Juan Manuel Santos at a press conference of the operational service against &quot;Cana&quot; is very important.
A lot of people don&#39;t know our job.
Fingerprinting is an exact science, without the possibility of error, that can play a key role in crime decisions.
In addition to identifying corpses, these people assist in the research of crimes such as theft or murder and confirm the identity of the persons caught.
When they catch them, a lot of delinquents present fake documents or have no papers at all.
We take their fingerprints and look them in the database.
The investigator said that in case of injury, he had to remove a piece of the house wall in the house, because at this point the thief was leaning to pull out a safe full of jewelry and money.
The walls are difficult because they are not intended for fingerprints, but in this case we were able to obtain a full handprint and identify the perpetrator who was involved in several thefts, &quot;he recalled.
Fingerprints can also confirm or disprove suspicions in the event of murder.
They recently found a dead man with bottles of alcohol around them.
The investigation revealed that one of the family members could be responsible for the murder, and the bottle print actually confirmed this.
Although it cannot be confirmed that he was really a murderer, it is clear that he appeared on the scene of the crime.
A CTI fingerprint expert explained that fingerprints are &quot;wiped off with chemical or physical reactive substances&quot;.
When they appear, a transplant or tape is used to remove them.
Then the fingerprints are sent to Asif, which is the database of delinquents, or to the Registry.
&quot;The problem is that there are still many Colombians today whose data are not recorded anywhere,&quot; said a CTI expert.
He explained that not everything is as it appears in the CSI television program.
Like everything that glitters, there is no gold, not everything you touch leaves traces.
However, if it can be used, an appropriate comparison must be made.
&quot;Outrage&quot; protests in New York
Hundreds of protesters crowded in Zuccotti Square, where they wanted to camp.
Many of them waited for the order to clear the area and moved to a nearby park.
Members of the Occupy Wall Street movement provoked New York officials on Tuesday as they tried to get back to Manhattan Square, from where they were taken out in the morning, by court order. Then they tried to take another New York park.
Hundreds of protesters crowded in Zuccotti Square, where they wanted to get thanks to a court order allowing the &quot;indignant&quot; to return to the camp. The second part of the movement responded to the evacuation by occupying a park in the north of the city, where further detentions took place.
&quot;If the court does not allow us to return to the square, we will settle elsewhere and continue the legal battle to return to Zuccotti, both through rallies and peaceful demonstrations,&quot; said one spokesman for the &quot;Occupy Wall Street&quot; movement, Mark Bray.
Bray said the &quot;outraged&quot; response to the eviction camp had been ordered by New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg himself to court, where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order banning the eviction and allowing protesters to continue to determine.
In addition, the &quot;outrage&quot; seized another park located at the intersection of downtown Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, near the entrance to the Holland Tunnel, which connects New York and New Jersey, and the parish site at Trinity Church.
They managed to take the place for at least an hour, but then the police came and detained some demonstrators. Bray did not know the exact number, but said he saw that some journalists had handcuffed them.
The organization assures that several hundred people have settled on the site. A delegation of religious leaders also came to express their support and also tried to negotiate with the police.
Meanwhile, Zuccotti Square, a privately owned square, remains closed. A court hearing is expected, which should take place on Tuesday, during which the legality of the morning evacuation should be analyzed.
Some of the relocated protesters even handed out and handed out copies of court orders and even gave them to security guards, causing &quot;some small clashes,&quot; said Bray, who condemned the fact that some police officers had beaten the protesters.
The court order prohibits authorities from evicting members of the Ocupa Wall Street movement or applying &quot;laws that were published after the occupation began, or forbidding protesters from accessing the park with shops or other places they used to.&quot;
Mayor Bloomberg told the press that due to this court order, the city suspended the reopening of the public space and warned the protesters that local laws do not allow them to return tents and sleeping bags.
The city&#39;s top official personally opposed the morning eviction of Zuccotti Square, an operation in which 200 people were detained and approached because the protesters &quot;broke the law.&quot;
Bloomberg explained that he ordered the evacuation of the square because it became &quot;a place where people did not go to protest, but to break the law and in some cases harm others&quot; because &quot;some shops received threatening letters&quot; and &quot;neighbors feared for their quality of life.&quot;
&quot;The morning evacuation was appalling and shows that Bloomberg is trying to maintain financial interests at the expense of the American working people,&quot; a movement spokesman added, accusing the mayor of &quot;not respecting freedom of expression.&quot;
Representatives of the Ocupa Wall Street movement also said that they plan to organize &quot;big events&quot; on Thursday in cooperation with community and trade unions to commemorate the two months that protests last. They started on September 17th.
Pamela Anderson will introduce the Virgin Mary in a special Christmas TV show
Along with Michael Bublé and other prominent Canadians, he will appear on the television program &quot;It&#39;s a Russell Peters Christmas&quot; on December 1.
Canadian Pamela Anderson was Tim Allen&#39;s assistant in &quot;Home Improvement,&quot; a lifeguard in &quot;Baywatch,&quot; a bunny in &quot;Playboy,&quot; the wife of rock musician Tommy Lee, and now the actress and model will be the Virgin Mary in a special Canadian television show.
Private television station CTV announced today that Anderson, along with sentimental song singer Michael Bublé and other prominent Canadians, will appear on &quot;It&#39;s a Russell Peters Christmas&quot; on December 1 and will embody the Virgin Mary.
CTV today showed footage from a television program in which Anderson, also known from Internet domestic pornographic films, appears with her ex-husband, the &quot;Mötley Crüe&quot; engine, Tommy Lee, as the Virgin Mary holding a doll representing Jesus in a manger.
Peters, a well-known Canadian comedian of Native American descent who recently worked as a presenter on Charlie Sheen&#39;s &quot;My Violent Torpedo of Truth&quot; tour, appears as Josef.
In addition to Anderson and Peters, Canadian singer Bublé, who married Argentine model Luisana Lopilato in Buenos Aires at the end of March, will appear in a special Christmas CTV broadcast and is close to controversy.
Recently, Bublé called the American Kim Kardashian a &quot;fox&quot; at one of her concerts in New York.
Japan is returning to life after a devastating earthquake
GDP is growing by 1.5% due to household consumption, ending the downturn that began in March
Since March last year, Japan&#39;s economy has been paralyzed, and is now recovering from a devastating earthquake that escalated into a nuclear crisis, the worst catastrophe the country has faced since World War II.
The Tokyo government&#39;s first estimates put the material loss at $ 300,000 million, a wound that is healing well despite the difficult global situation.
After three quarters of falls, the value of GDP reached a position between July and September that it was possible to turn the page definitively: GDP grew by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and by 6% per year.
In addition, the results for the second quarter - for the Japanese tax year starting in March 2012 - assume the highest growth rate compared to January to March 2010.
The recovery can be partly explained by the purchase of machinery needed to rebuild areas destroyed by the earthquake and subsequent tsunami.
Enterprises increased their investments by 1.1%, while expenditures will fall by 0.9% compared to January to March. This is the first decline after six months of continuous growth.
However, the real awakening of the Japanese economy is based solely on the impetus that forces us to use the crisis to emerge from it or to rebuild infrastructures. The point is to take advantage of scarcity to start from scratch.
Japan has woken up. Mainly due to the development of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of Japan&#39;s GDP.
This variable increased by 1%, due to an increase in expenditure on vehicles, travel and leisure activities.
The stigma of the yen
Flows came into the hands of the internal market as the yen - the Japanese currency - became one of the &quot;rescue values&quot; for investors fleeing the eurozone debt crisis and worrying US forecasts. It is a privilege, but it is also a great burden for export companies.
With a stronger currency, products abroad are more expensive, which is negative for a country whose economy is determined by the financial health of large technology groups.
For example, Toyota or Sony attributed their weak results in July to September to the yen.
While markets continue to besiege the EU&#39;s peripheral countries, Yoshihiko Noda&#39;s government is cautious.
&quot;We need to be aware of the risks that remain, such as the destruction of some foreign economies, the impact of the floods in Thailand and the rapid increase in the yen,&quot; State Secretary for Economic Policy Motohisa Furukawa said yesterday.
And indeed, the prospects are not encouraging.
The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) clarified that most member states showed clear signs of economic slowdown in September.
The indicator, which predicts inflexibility in the world economy, has shown that the economies of the major powers are slowing down.
It fell by four tenths to 100.4 points compared to 100.8 in August.
The eurozone has even fallen below the average of 100. It has reached 99.13 points.
Athens is once again spreading uncertainty
Papadimos says austerity measures will be approved, but conservatives will not sign any written commitment
With rapid and risky marginal guarantees and the uncertainty that has recurred, Greece is becoming increasingly entangled in the labyrinth that is leading out of the great debt crisis in Europe.
The assumption that the &quot;agreement&quot; of the new Greek transitional government is based on the demands of Brussels rather than the true convictions of the political forces is beginning to be confirmed.
While the new prime minister, Lukas Papadimos, admitted yesterday that there was no alternative to structural reforms and that the 100-day period he was given in his appointment was likely to be short for their implementation, Antonis Samaras, chairman of the Conservative New Democracy party, said the new austerity measures in no way will he support and reiterated his demand for a new election on the expected date of 19 February.
&quot;The main task of this government is to implement the decision of the summit on October 26,&quot; Papadimos said yesterday during a parliamentary debate, which will culminate tomorrow with a vote of confidence in the government.
A package of 24 programs to support employment, a reform of the Disciplinary Code for Officials and new measures against tax evasion will be among the first initiatives.
However, Samaras&#39;s message does not clear up any doubts about his position: &quot;We have committed ourselves to helping the caretaker government, but we have not committed ourselves to anything else.&quot;
The Conservative chairman went a little far in addressing the EU and the IMF. These organizations are to unblock the 8 billion that Athens urgently needs. At the same time, however, he stated that he would not support and sign any commitment regarding the implementation of austerity measures.
The European Commission, outraged by the impact of Papandreou&#39;s referendum games, stressed yesterday that its demands are insurmountable: it will not unblock any aid unless the new government and leaders sign a &quot;written commitment without ambiguity and as soon as possible&quot;.
Economic Affairs spokesman Amadeu Altafaj explained that Troika inspectors would return to Athens &quot;very soon&quot; and negotiate with the new government on &quot;what he needs to pay for the sixth installment&quot; of $ 8 billion. But the final date does not exist.
The Greek spinning mill still has a while to knit.
Queen Sofia: &quot;There are tools for progress and hope&quot;
The Queen highlights Spain&#39;s privileged position in relation to this type of finance
Spain &quot;has achieved a significant global position in terms of microfinance&quot;.
Queen Sofia recalled yesterday that the country has become the planet&#39;s second donor in the last two decades for this instrument of cooperation, the essence of which is &quot;that it is an instrument of social progress, justice and hope for a better future for all mankind. it is a tool based on trust in man &quot;.
Yesterday, the Queen launched the 5th Global Microcredit Summit in Valladolid, convinced that &quot;there is no doubt&quot; that this type of operation is &quot;absolutely necessary&quot; to achieve the Millennium Development Goals set by the UN by 2015. &quot; targets to halve the number of people living on less than one dollar a day, the amount that sets the poverty line &quot;.
Spain &quot;will continue to work&quot; and expand the network of volunteers &quot;in all corners of the planet and is taking this task responsibly&quot;, stressed Queen Sofia, who hopes that the initiatives and contributions of the Summit, which will last until Thursday, &quot;ensure better capacity and opportunities for the poorest and especially for women &quot;, to whom these loans are intended primarily.
&quot;We have already achieved a lot&quot; and &quot;many challenges are still ahead&quot;.
The microcredit summit is intended not only to be a discussion forum, but also a platform to support &quot;basic goals&quot;.
Her Majesty explained that the goal is for 175 million poor families to have access to these financial services by the end of 2015 and for 100 million families to rise above the poverty line they currently live in.
The concept of microloans spread to Spain and other countries around the world after &quot;the pioneer of the idea, Muhammad Yunus, embarked on this journey,&quot; the queen said, adding that it was &quot;an act of justice and necessary recognition.&quot;
She described the father of this instrument as &quot;an admirable idealist who set out on a journey to fight poverty.&quot; She became acquainted with his work 15 years ago when she went to Bangladesh to learn about his lending policy on the spot.
This experience was followed by others. The first global summit in Washington and other meetings such as in Côte d&#39;Ivoire in 1999, in Canada in 2006. &quot;In all these meetings, I was able to note the constant development,&quot; explained the Queen, who earned the title of &quot;Head of Family&quot; yesterday thanks to her support for the project. &quot;given to her in Valladolid by the&quot; movement of the poor. &quot;
Queen Sofia concluded her speech by inviting participants to engage in discussions and solutions to continue the fight against poverty.
&quot;Ethical imperative&quot;
The Minister of Foreign Affairs, Trinidad Jiménez, said that solidarity &quot;is an ethical imperative&quot; that must be followed by all democracies.
In this sense, she said that it would be a mistake to link cooperation with developing countries only to the period of prosperity, because this cooperation is a &quot;permanent obligation&quot;.
Jimenez believes that microloans are a &quot;serious and honest policy to eradicate poverty,&quot; and now more than ever before the governments of developed countries must work in accordance with the criteria of solidarity and not allow solidarity to fall victim to cuts.
For Spain, microloans are one of the main lines of development cooperation.
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, welcomed the success of the concept of trusting people to whom everyone else is closing the door. The mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, welcomed participants to a city that &quot;opens its doors to a spirit of solidarity that is contagious.&quot;
The CDU proposes to elect a European president on the basis of universal suffrage
The first day of the Congress of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) took place in Leipzig on Monday, November 14, without any serious problems for the Chancellor and Chairwoman of the Christian Democratic Party, Angela Merkel.
The question of the future of Europe was not originally on the agenda, but it did not happen until the autumn, especially to satisfy party members who consider the government&#39;s policy towards the Greeks today and perhaps tomorrow towards the Italians to be lax.
The proposal concerning the President of the European Commission submitted by the management was adopted almost unanimously.
Only nine out of 1001 delegates were against and 10 abstentions abstained.
A standing ovation for a few minutes at the end of Angela Merkel&#39;s speech and then, a few hours later, Wolfgang Schäubl, the very pro-European finance minister, left no room for doubt.
The main idea of the Chancellor and the proposal can be summed up in the slogan: the response to the crisis is &quot;not less Europe, but more Europe&quot;.
Not just because Europe means peace, but because &quot;nine million jobs depend directly on the euro&quot;.
According to the Chancellor of Europe, &quot;the time has come for change&quot;.
This could be reflected in changes to the Lisbon Treaty to strengthen the European Union&#39;s control over the budgetary policies of euro area member states, but it could also result in the election of the President of the European Commission under universal suffrage &quot;in order to give Europe one face&quot;.
In any case, that is one of the ideas of the proposal adopted by Congress, which is clearly inspired by Wolfgang Schäuble.
It is certainly unlikely that all 27 countries will quickly agree on this revolutionary step: the United Kingdom opposes it, and CDU leaders think that Nicolas Sarkozy will take the same position.
But the direction is set.
Likewise, the delegates rejected by a large majority the proposal to evaluate the weight of each country on the board of directors of the European Central Bank depending on the weight of its economy, which will obviously result in a strengthening of Germany&#39;s weight.
Driven by concern to calm the climate within her party, the Chancellor made several references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl. But it did not try to get Congress to talk about &quot;small&quot; European states or states in difficulty willing to criticize arrogant Germany.
Although the proposal on Europe devotes one paragraph to the importance of &quot;Franco-German friendship&quot;, Angela Merkel did not quote France.
Only indirectly.
When she reminded her that a bloody battle was taking place near Leipzig just two hundred years ago.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleonic army.
What is incapacity fraud?
Following the support, the UMP and the government are launching an offensive against incapacity for work.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be in Bordeaux on Tuesday 15 December to visit the Social Welfare Office, where he will address a recurring theme since 2007 on combating social fraud and redistributing solidarity.
Accompanied by this offensive, which is based on the will to make savings in a context of increased austerity, but is no less clear from the point of view of the right-wing presidential campaign, the right-wing majority wants to focus on incapacity for work.
First, due to budget savings, the government intends to force private sector employees on the fourth day of incapacity for work before they start receiving sickness benefits.
Clearly, without the company&#39;s consent, an employee who falls ill would lose four days&#39; pay, at least 15% of their monthly income.
A measure that risks causing a lot of bad blood, but which, according to Les Echos, could bring in 280 million euros.
And also a measure that would be accompanied by another measure of symbolic scope: to give civil servants one day of unpaid incapacity for work (so far they have no incapacity compared to three days in the private sector).
While these issues are under discussion, the right-wing majority is also launching the issue of fraud, this time focusing on incidents related to incapacity for work.
&quot;The inspections will be much more extensive, and moreover: if you are caught, you will return,&quot; Xavier Bertrand said in an interview with RTL on Sunday, November 13.
As in other cases, the effects of the notification seem somewhat disproportionate given the truth about incapacity for work.
In fact, these have been the subject of constant monitoring since 2002 and of the political onslaught that have borne fruit.
The French are no more ill than anywhere else in Europe.
Let&#39;s stop at a few official numbers first.
According to the Caisse nationale d&#39;assurance maladie (CNAM), more than 237 million euros of daily allowances were paid in 2006.
According to the French Institute for Health Research and Documentation, daily reimbursements in 2008, with € 11.3 billion, accounted for 5% of health expenditure.
Of this amount, 46% related to maternity allowances and accidents at work and 54% related to incapacity for work, ie € 6.2 billion.
So only 2.5% of healthcare costs.
According to a study by Alma Consulting, the French had an average of 14.5 days of incapacity for work in 2010, compared with 17.8 days in 2009.
On average, there are some discrepancies: another survey published in 2007 on the Monster.com job site showed that 75% of the 40,000 French employees surveyed said they had not taken any day off.
Another study, this time conducted by health insurance institutions, specifies that in 2010, 37.8% of incapacity for work was shorter than 8 days, 22% from 8 to 14 days, 15% from 15 days to 1 month, 15% from 1 to three months and 11% lasted longer.
When compared to their European neighbors, French workers are no more prone to incapacity for work than elsewhere.
One long study carried out in 2010 by two CNRS (National Research Center) researchers showed that between 1994 and 2001, the total absence (for health reasons or not) fluctuated between 10% and 11.8% in France against 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the UK and 18% in the Netherlands.
Incapacity cheating is only a very small part of undeclared work.
When it comes to fraud, these are only small scale.
The strengthening of legislation since 2002 has meant that there are systematic checks on incapacity for work for more than 45 days.
In 2008, the CNAM found that in 1.5 million inspections, 13.8% of the 285,000 performed due to short-term incapacity were &quot;unjustified or too long&quot;, ie 37,050 cases.
In the case of systematically checked incapacitations of more than 45 days, 11% of &quot;non - adapted or unjustified&quot; cases were counted at 1.2 million controls, ie 132,000.
Thus, a total of 169,000 &quot;unjustified&quot; cases for several million employees who were unable to work.
A number that represents much less than a number expressing work in black.
According to UMP MEP Dominique Tian, author of the June report on the issue, this figure would be € 9 billion to € 15 billion missing per year, ie more than the total daily allowance and thus infinitely more than the latter.
Papademos: Greece will have to implement a new rescue plan
Greece will need a new rescue program to rebuild its economy.
On Monday, December 14, Prime Minister Lucas Papademos delivered these words before the parliament, adding that the hundred days given to his unity government would not be enough to fulfill this task.
&quot;In order to get our economy back on its feet, we need the support of our European partners and a new rescue budget plan,&quot; the prime minister said as he made his first public speech on Wednesday at the start of a debate on a vote of confidence in parliament.
The implementation of the decisions taken at the eurozone summit on October 27 will be the &quot;main task&quot; of the new government, as our country&#39;s participation in the eurozone is at stake, he added.
As a result, Mr Papademos assumed that the country &#39;s public deficit would be &quot;around 9%&quot; of gross domestic product from now until the end of the year, after being 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
The right rejects new austerity measures
Right-wing leader Antonis Samaras expressed his support on Monday for measures already approved to try to escape the debt crisis, but warned that his party is not committing to any additional austerity measures.
&quot;We will not raise our hand for any new measures,&quot; Samaras emphasized at a meeting with deputies for his New Democracy party.
We have agreed on targets for reducing deficits and debt and combating waste, but we are opposed to any policy that would hinder economic recovery.
Mr Olli Rehn, European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, who warned that the IMF and the EU would not unblock the necessary € 8 billion loan without a written guarantee from all parties to support the envisaged measures, Antonis Samaras replied that his word was enough and that he would not sign anything under external pressure. .
Euthanasia and assisted suicide need to be legalized, says a panel of experts
According to a report by the Royal Canadian Society, Canadians are being denied death.
On palliative care, the commission urges governments, health care institutions and doctors to work together to ensure the best palliative care, including in cancer cases.
Canadian society lives by the idea of denying death.
Only 9% of Canadians actually accept the opportunity to talk to a doctor about the conditions in which they want to die and make decisions to that effect.
This is one of the conclusions of an extensive report by the Royal Society of Canada, which included six experts working in various fields, including ethics, law and medicine.
The commission recommends that the government change criminal law to allow for assisted suicide and euthanasia if this choice appears necessary for a patient considered competent to make such a decision.
At the beginning, experts cite a recent survey by the independent agency Economist Intelligence Unit, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries on the planet.
Although Canada ranks 10th, the study notes that &quot;the medicalization of death in Canada has given rise to a culture in which people are afraid to talk about death.&quot;
Medicalization yes or no, 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, experts with a mandate from the Royal Canadian Society tell us.
And despite the desire to die at home, which most Canadians have, 68.6% of them die in hospital.
This average is valid for the whole of Canada, while in the province of Quebec, this number is the highest with 86% of people who died in hospital.
On the delicate issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the authors of the report come to conclusions that run counter to the position of the federal government, which has already said that it does not want to change the criminal law on euthanasia and assisted suicide.
According to experts, who have also inspected all countries where these approaches are legalized or not considered a criminal case, there is no evidence that this criminalization causes any abuse in application, ie in the practice of euthanasia or assisted suicide against indecent or dissenting persons.
On the contrary, Mr Jocelyn Downie, co-author of the report, confirmed yesterday at a teleconference more than the numerous cases of these outbursts in countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are not legalized.
&quot;Euthanasia is also being carried out in Canada, where it is clearly illegal.&quot;
&quot;Assisted suicide is also committed in Canada, where it is clearly illegal,&quot; explains Jocelyn Downie.
Canadians are in favor of euthanasia
Recall that, according to a survey conducted by the Angus Reid Forum in 2010, 85% of Canadians have already spoken out in favor of euthanasia because they believe it will allow end-of-life people to alleviate their suffering.
And 66% believe that legalizing euthanasia will not mean sending a message that the lives of the elderly or handicapped are of less value.
Regarding those who practice assisted suicide, 41% of respondents believe that they should not be prosecuted.
The situation is less clear when it comes to maintaining or interrupting patient care, say the report&#39;s authors.
They also suggest in their list of recommendations that it be stated in criminal law that withdrawal from treatment for which there is a legally confirmed refusal is not a criminal offense.
The Commission of Experts also requires that medical practitioners be trained to respect end-of-life refusals without fear of prosecution.
On palliative care, the commission urges governments, health care institutions and doctors to work together to ensure the best palliative care, including in cancer cases.
Finally, in the case of palliative or final sedation, already widely used in Canadian medical facilities, the Commission calls for it to be considered euthanasia when it is no longer used to reduce physical pain and to be subject to the same procedures.
Reservations of other experts
Some medical law experts have already expressed reservations about the conclusions of a report by experts from the Royal Society of Canada.
Mr. Pierre Deschamps, a specialist in medical law, described the position of experts-signatories to the report as &quot;extreme&quot;, among other things because it does not limit the practice of euthanasia to patients in the final stages.
&quot;This opens the door to a situation where anyone who is tired of life and who is over 18 could ask to help them commit suicide,&quot; said Pierre Deschamps, who studied the summary of the report yesterday.
Mr Deschamps also emphasizes that it seems as if the authors of the report put the autonomy of the person above all the other values that make up the social fabric of society.
Because &quot;in society, he says, there are warning signs and restrictions.&quot;
Medical law specialist Margaret Somerville also expressed &quot;strong objections to the conclusions of the report, which she described as a&quot; manifesto for euthanasia. &quot;
Margaret Somerville, who is herself a member of the Royal Canadian Society, is particularly skeptical about the report&#39;s data on the absence of wrongdoing in some countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legalized, ie the Netherlands and the US state of Oregon.
The Jordanian king calls on President Assad to resign
Damascus speaks of &quot;conspiracy&quot;
Syria is increasingly isolated
Bashar al-Assad&#39;s supporters demonstrated before the Foreign Ministry yesterday.
Yesterday, diplomatic pressure on President Bashar al-Assad, who with the support of Russia resists them and intensified about a &quot;conspiracy&quot; against his country, intensified.
Two days after the suspension of Syria&#39;s membership of the League of Arab States, the European Union intensified its sanctions against Damascus, while Turkey and Jordan, Syria&#39;s neighboring countries, took a position in favor of President Assad&#39;s departure.
Yesterday, King Abdallah II of Jordan was the first ruler of an Arab state to call on President Bashar al-Assad to &quot;hand over power&quot; in Syria, where about forty civilians and members of the regime&#39;s military forces were killed.
&quot;If Bashar had the interests of his country at heart, he would have to resign, but he would also have to create the conditions necessary for a new phase of Syrian political life,&quot; the Jordanian king of Syria&#39;s neighbor said in an interview with the BBC.
For his part, the head of Turkish diplomacy, Ahmet Davutoglu, regretted that the efforts made by Turkey to mediate under the Syrian regime since the beginning of the year had not been crowned with success.
&quot;Those who do not live in peace with their people in the Middle East and cannot satisfy them will leave,&quot; he said, alluding to neighboring Syria, against which Turkey is pursuing an increasingly tougher line.
The United States rejoiced in &quot;strengthening the consensus against Assad and the dishonesty of the Syrian regime&quot; following the decisions of the League of Arab States and the European Union.
&quot;The international community, the United States, the European Union, the League of Arab States, countries like Turkey are taking an increasingly harsh tone,&quot; against the repression in Syria, said Mark Toner, a spokesman for the State Department.
As reported by the Syrian Human Rights Observatory, 16 civilians and 19 members of the pro-regime forces died in the city of Deraa in southern Syria during this time.
According to the NGO, two other civilians were killed in &quot;shootings and heavy machine gun fire in Jobar&quot; in the Homs area.
However, at a press conference, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Mouallem estimated that the country had &quot;set out on a journey out of the crisis&quot;.
After all, he also reacted vividly to the decision of the League of Arab States to suspend Damascus membership, which he said was a &quot;dangerous step&quot;.
Syria &quot;will not bow down,&quot; he added, assuring that &quot;conspiracies against Syria will fail.&quot;
Following its decision to suspend Syria&#39;s membership, the League of Arab States is currently considering a &quot;civil protection mechanism&quot; and plans to send 500 human rights defenders, journalists and military observers to the country.
French Foreign Minister Alain Juppé is also in favor of sending UN observers to help protect civilians from repression by a &quot;paranoid&quot; regime.
A new special meeting of the League is being convened in Rabat tomorrow to deliver an opinion on a plan to resolve the crisis decided on 2 December, which envisaged in particular the withdrawal of armies from strife-stricken cities and the release of imprisoned protesters.
Yesterday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov considered the decision of the League of Arab States &quot;wrong&quot;, while China urged Syria to adopt a plan to resolve the crisis, while avoiding support for possible sanctions against Damascus.
Italy
Monti demands time and sacrifice from the Italians
The next head of the Italian government, Mario Monti, asked the markets for some time so that he could form his team and start implementing a program that would include &quot;victims&quot; in order to regain the credibility lost in the last months of the Berlusconi government.
The former European Commissioner discussed with political parties yesterday before meeting with trade unionists and employers today.
He should form a relatively slender cabinet composed of non-parliamentary technocrats.
&quot;Monti talked about an important agenda with many victims,&quot; said Francesco Nucara, a member of one of the many parliamentary groups taking part in the talks, after meeting with the Prime Minister-designate.
House Speaker Gianfranco Fini expects Mario Monti to ask Parliament for a vote of confidence by Friday to make sure the new government has sufficient support.
The consultation will end with Mario Monti introducing a small team of twelve ministers to President Giorgio Napolitano.
Mario Monti commented on the nervousness in the financial markets yesterday and asked them for time.
In &quot;democracy, there are precise deadlines&quot; for the preparation of the government and its program, he stressed, adding that he is &quot;sure that the markets will be patient and understand&quot;.
His appointment as president was initially welcomed by the markets, but concerns reappeared following the unexpected decline in industrial production in the eurozone in September.
The appointed prime minister should form a team, mainly including technocrats, although he emphasized that he would like to include &quot;politicians&quot;.
He expressed the belief that the new government would last until 2013, ie until the date of the next elections.
According to the Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies Gianfranco Fini, the new government will receive the confidence of the parliament by Friday.
After taking office, Mario Monti promised to act with extreme urgency and with the aim of making Italy &quot;a strong link&quot; to Europe again.
A spokesman for European Commissioner Olli Rehn emphasized that &quot;even with the new government, our diagnosis of the Italian economy will not change&quot;.
The European Union is convinced that, despite the austerity plans adopted in recent months, Rome will not achieve its goal of a balanced budget in 2013, and is calling for new tough measures.
The head of the Confindustria business association, Emma Marcegagli, who will meet Monti on Tuesday, focused on the need to revive the economy &quot;because a country that does not grow can not meet deficit parameters.&quot;
Recognized for his expertise and independence, Mario Monti, a former European Commissioner (1994-2004), a &quot;professor&quot; symbolizing, according to the authors of the editorial, a &quot;call to seriousness&quot; and &quot;another Italy&quot;, represents an &quot;epoch-making&quot; for Italy after 17 years of &quot;Berlusconism&quot;. .
The big unknown will be the life of his team.
President Napolitano would like to avoid early elections, as Italy has to place 200 billion euros in government bonds by April 2012.
A Soviet scientist helped Iran&#39;s nuclear program
Soviet scientist Vyacheslav Danilenko has helped Iran develop a detonator for a nuclear weapon, a US nuclear atomic NGO said on Tuesday.
The Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS) relies on a recent report by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and other documents leaked from the UN agency to identify the scientist.
Last week, the IAEA expressed its &quot;serious concern&quot; about the &quot;possible military dimension&quot; of Iran&#39;s nuclear program.
According to the ISIS Institute, which draws heavily on IAEA documents, V. Danilenko (born 1934) should have worked for three decades since the 1960s at the Soviet military research center in Chelyabinsk (Ural), where he was to manufacture synthetic diamonds by the explosion method.
In 1989 or 1991, he had to leave the center to establish a &quot;nano-diamond&quot; company in Kiev.
The economic difficulties of his company should have led him to contact the Iranian embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
Before returning to Russia, he was to work from 1996 to 2002 on the Iranian program.
In its latest report, the IAEA recalls &quot;clear indications that the development of the detonation system by Iran&quot; was &quot;based&quot; on the work of a foreign specialist who not only knew the method well but who - as one Member State informed the Agency - worked for much of its life. working career in this technology under the military nuclear program of the country of origin &quot;.
Anti-Muslim crimes and crimes rose by 50%
According to FBI statistics released on Monday, the number of crimes and offenses against Muslims increased by almost 50% between 2009 and 2010, while at the same time other racial and religious violence decreased slightly or increased little.
According to these figures, the total number of violence against Muslims increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, a 49% increase from a 13% increase in violence against Catholics, a 4% decrease in offenses against Jews and an overall increase of 14% for anti-religious crimes and offenses.
The total number of &quot;hate crimes&quot; rose very slightly to 6,628 cases, of which 47.3% were motivated by racial differences and 20% by religious differences, according to the FBI.
&quot;After the 2009 decline, it is unsettling to see these crimes and offenses rise again,&quot; Human Rights First said, adding that &quot;the rise in anti-Muslim violence is particularly significant,&quot; the organization said in a statement.
&quot;Human Rights First has long emphasized that violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crime, must be considered a serious violation of human rights,&quot; said Paul Legendre, one of the organization&#39;s leaders.
&quot;The US government can and must do more to tackle these riots,&quot; he added, estimating that this could be done by improving police reports of &quot;hate crimes.&quot;
The &quot;hate crime&quot; in U.S. federal law is a legacy of the era of the struggle for civil rights.
This legal order was adopted after the death of Martin Luther King to punish violence related to race, color, religion, origin and now sexual orientation.
Twitter is changing and more like Facebook
The Twitter microblogging site introduced design changes on Monday to allow its users to observe the activity of followers, which is somewhat similar to its Facebook services.
The new &quot;activity&quot; and &quot;name&quot; menus allow you to better and directly know the activity of others who follow you or people whose tweets you follow.
This lets you know if they allow you to track posts, whether they sign in to new accounts, whether they have favorite posts, etc.
The new face of Twitter was tested &quot;in August on a small percentage of users&quot; before it was spread across the network on Monday, Twitter spokeswoman Carolyn Penner told AFP.
Twitter, which was known for its low instinctive operation, with somewhat incomprehensible terms (RT for re-spreading someone else&#39;s post, followfriday for recommending follow-up to another user) making the initiative good, to be a public plus large with a maniement more comparable to the network of large public networks Facebook and Google+.
On the network, users immediately differently assess the significance of this innovation in their &quot;tweets&quot;.
&quot;It&#39;s useless, it takes up a lot of space and it&#39;s too similar to Facebook,&quot; writes @ jemb123.
&quot;The Activity feature will help me better follow some elements of my Twitter,&quot; sent @dannykronstrom.
Austria
the inclusion of the golden rule on a balanced budget in the constitution
The government of a large coalition of Social Democrats and Christian Democrats in power in Austria decided on Tuesday to include the &quot;golden rule&quot; of fiscal policy in the constitution in order to reduce the public deficit and thus avoid a possible downgrade of Austria&#39;s rating agencies (AAA).
It was Social Democrat Chancellor Werner Faymann himself who announced the decision at the end of a ministerial meeting in a situation where Austria&#39;s public debt, at 74.6%, was well above the 60% criterion set by the Maastricht Treaty but much lower than that of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
&quot;If Austria&#39;s solvency were reduced by just a single degree from AAA to AA +, we would have to pay three billion euros more in interest each year,&quot; argued the vice-chancellor and foreign minister, Christian Democrat Michael Spindelegger.
Austria follows a request from the eurozone summit held in Brussels on 26 October 2011, where the heads of state and government urged that by the end of 2012 a reduction in the public deficit and the achievement of a balance of public accounts be enshrined in a constitution or law of the same value.
The instrument adopted by the Austrian government is close to the &quot;German model&quot;, Germany was the first European country to adopt such a &quot;rule&quot;.
By 2017, the public structural deficit will have to fall by 0.75% of gross domestic product (GDP) each year, and from 2017 onwards, the federal state&#39;s public structural deficit will not be allowed to exceed 0.35% of GDP each year, while the Länder as well as municipalities they will have to show a balanced budget.
The aim is to bring the public debt below the 60% criterion set by the Maastricht Treaty by 2020/21.
Strong only
Noda threatens new intervention in foreign exchange markets
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that Japanese institutions would have to intervene again in the foreign exchange markets if he were to continue strengthening.
&quot;We will intervene, as we did last, if we find excessive volatility,&quot; in the yen exchange rate, Yod Noda explained to the senate.
On Tuesday, it only rose again to historical values, which forced the Japanese authorities to intervene on October 31.
That day, Tokyo sold yen for dollars to reduce the value of the Japanese currency, which had only recently broken the record against the dollar in place since 1945.
But only since then has it risen regularly supported by purchases by investors, who see it as a &quot;safe haven&quot; in uncertain times of global economic slowdown and the European debt crisis.
The dollar fell below 77 yen again on Tuesday and the euro fell below the symbolic bar of 105 yen to close to the levels that triggered the latest intervention.
Before the financial crisis in 2008-2009, the dollar was worth around 120 yen and the euro more than 160 yen.
This outbreak of the Japanese currency is detrimental to island exports, as it increases the price of Made in Japan products and reduces the value of revenues earned by Japanese companies from abroad when converting them into the domestic currency.
&quot;Japan is recovering&quot; from the devastation caused by the March earthquake and tsunami that devastated the Tohoku region in the northeast of the country, stressed Y. Noda, who fears that this increase in the yen will not kill the fragile recovery in the egg.
The world&#39;s third economic power resumed growth in the third quarter (1.5% from the previous quarter), for the first time in one year thanks to a survey of growth in exports and consumption of households affected by the disaster.
But the prime minister concluded that the high value of the yen did not reflect Japan&#39;s &quot;national economy.&quot;
Japan&#39;s Finance Minister Jun Azumi called on the Central Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a two-day meeting of its political and monetary council on Tuesday, to take all possible measures to weaken the yen.
But Hirohide Yamaguchi, the institution&#39;s vice-governor, pointed out that the BoJ had previously taken &quot;appropriate measures&quot; indicating that no additional currency weakness could be expected on Wednesday.
At its last meeting at the end of October, the Securities and Exchange Institute increased its purchases of treasury bills by 5,000 billion yen (47 billion euros) and raised to 55,000 billion yen (519 billion euros) the ceiling it spends on purchases of various securities to flood with liquidity.
Eurozone:
rates are rising, stock markets are failing
The risk of a debt crisis is still undermining European indicators.
Despite the appointment of new heads of government in Greece and Italy and better growth numbers in France and Germany, the rates of weakened countries continue to rise.
European stock markets, still concerned about the stability of the eurozone, are falling into negative expectations today on Tuesday, November 15.
In Paris at 10 o&#39;clock the CAC 40 index loses 1.4% to 3,064 points.
The Dax index is losing 0.4% in Frankfurt and 0.1% in London.
&quot;With new tensions over troubled euro area borrowing rates, stock markets around the world continue to make only a share of recent gains.&quot;
&quot;Nervous investors are only too aware of the risk of infection,&quot; explains Terry Pratt, a broker at IG Markets, quoted by Reuters.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange closed with a 0.7% decline due to market participants&#39; concerns about Europe&#39;s ability to deal with the debt crisis.
&quot;Japan, like the rest of the world, has its eyes on Europe and the shift will only continue in a narrow corridor of variation until investors have evidence that the situation is stable,&quot; estimates Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This resumption of uncertainty about the future of the eurozone is damaging the currency itself, which continues to decline on Tuesday.
The euro is at its lowest level since a month and a half ago.
At 10 a.m., the European currency was worth $ 1.3570, down 0.4%.
According to the brokers, the currency receded after the CDU party of Chancellor Angela Merkel at its congress on Monday adopted a proposal envisaging the possibility of leaving the eurozone for countries that find themselves in difficulty without having to leave the European Union.
Italian and Spanish rates far below 6%
Interest rates on loans in Italy and Spain remain very worrying.
This Tuesday, the yield on Italian ten-year bonds is 6.85% and the yield on Spanish ten-year bonds is 6.2%.
These tensions over interest rates in southern European countries, but also in France, continue to heighten market participants&#39; concerns.
The head of the future Italian government, Mario Monti, strongly demanded time in the markets to be able to rectify the situation in Italy, which was threatened by poisoning caused by the amount of its debt.
New Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos has confirmed that implementing the decisions taken at the eurozone summit on October 27 will be his government&#39;s &quot;main task&quot;.
Spain is once again on the deliberate line of markets when elections to the Chamber of Deputies are held in the country on Sunday.
The spread between German and Spanish ten-year bonds has reached a new all-time high.
In anticipation of figures announcing the growth of the euro area
Statistics show that France recorded economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter, driven mainly by household consumption, ie slightly better than expected growth of 0.3%.
However, the French National Institute for Statistics and Economic Studies, INSEE, revised downwards its second-quarter figures to a decline of 0.1% of GDP instead of stagnation.
And in truth, this is the fourth quarter that worries economists the most.
For its part, Germany recorded growth of 0.5% during the same period.
The first estimates for the entire eurozone are expected at 11 o&#39;clock, while the European Commission has just warned of the risk of a new recession.
Energy policy:
facts must prevail over dogmas
If there is a topic that cannot be grasped on the basis of short-term balance sheets or under emotion, then it is energy policy.
The availability and price of electricity have a direct impact on the purchasing power and competitiveness of companies.
It is natural for the election meeting to be an opportunity to think about such contributions and the place of nuclear energy.
The debate will only be successful if all the economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options are examined.
The French must base their position on objective facts and rational data.
So far, there are 7 billion human beings on the planet, but demographic change will lead to a doubling of electricity demand between 2050, unless we want to deprive a large part of the world&#39;s population of important parts of life.
At the same time, the shortage of fossil resources will need to be addressed in order to continue to generate electricity, without forgetting the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in order to combat climate change, a topic that is currently disappearing from environmental debates.
The accident in Fukushima does not affect any of these parameters.
And that is why Germany remains alone in its decision to reject nuclear energy.
However, this is not the case in Belgium, which makes its decision subject to the need to find another source capable of replacing itself, or Switzerland, which considers it appropriate to build only the latest generation power plants.
By contrast, the United Kingdom, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil, to cite at least some countries, are continuing their determination with their projects.
After Fukushima, the United States decided to expand its fleet by one unit by resuming construction of a power plant suspended after the Three Mile Island accident.
If the German model based on renewable energies is ever presented as an example, reality contradicts it.
The choice of Berlin will be reflected in higher electricity prices, increased energy dependence on gas imported especially from Russia, a sharp increase in CO2 emissions caused by the construction of power plants for natural gas and coal.
We will feel all these unpleasant effects within a few months.
The case of Denmark deserves to be considered.
The European champion in wind farms, from which it consumes 30% of its electricity, is also one of the largest consumers of coal and gas due to wind irregularities, which means that CO2 emissions and Danish electricity prices are 65% or 65% higher. 50% than the European average.
On the contrary, thanks to the invariability of our energy policy, our neighbors will pay an electricity bill 40% higher than what French households pay.
While in a globalized economy, energy costs are a key factor in competitiveness and a guarantee of keeping industry on national territory, French companies enjoy the benefits of the cheapest electricity in Europe.
For this reason, any significant reduction in the share of nuclear energy would lead to a sharp rise in the price of electricity, which would make illusory beautiful statements about the re-industrialization of our country and the defense of purchasing power.
The price that the vast majority of French people refuse to pay, just as they do not oppose this energy in principle, as opinion polls show.
Let us recall that our country&#39;s energy policy has made it possible to build a sector with 125,000 direct jobs and 410,000 consecutive jobs.
The heavily exporting industry is attracting a large number of small and medium-sized specialized enterprises to international markets, creating jobs that cannot be transferred abroad.
If France decided to abandon nuclear power, it would sacrifice a large number of these small and medium-sized enterprises and lose the EUR 6 billion a year that the country receives for exporting nuclear equipment and services.
Which plant owner would order a nuclear reactor designed to operate for 60 years while its producer was scheduled to go bankrupt?
In solving the energy equation, it must be admitted that there is no magical source for energy production, and even that there is no devilish one.
The development of low-carbon installations, nuclear installations and installations using renewable energy sources carried out by the French industrial group AREVA testifies to the complementarity of energy sources.
In the case of nuclear energy, it is an absolute necessity to maintain the highest level of safety.
In France, we have the National Office for Nuclear Safety, which carries out uncompromising and transparent supervision of existing nuclear power plants as well as the construction of a new power plant in Flamanville.
Our teams, whose professionalism is recognized, have the idea of safety in their blood.
In fifty years, the nuclear industry has experienced three serious accidents.
The only one in Three Mile Island took place in normal operating conditions and was left without human casualties and environmental consequences.
In Chernobyl, the drama was caused by reactor concepts and inexcusable human error.
In the case of Fukushima, some seem to forget that the accident was the result of two natural disasters of unprecedented scale, which killed tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will learn from this accident in the same way as it did in the previous two.
The fruit of this step and the cooperation between the French and German nuclear safety authorities, operators and designers is that the EPR-type reactor is a concept capable of withstanding such phenomena.
While all those wishing to build a nuclear power plant consider it, halting its construction in Flamanville would be an excellent gift to AREVA&#39;s and EDF&#39;s competitors and paving the way for them to seize a leading position in nuclear development.
It is necessary and legitimate to seek the best energy solution for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let emotions, dogmas and machinations dominate the debate so crucial to our country&#39;s economic, social and financial situation.
Is immigration a burden or a chance for the economy?
The immigration policy pursued by Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized from various angles - the overcrowding of the police, the courts and the administration subject to the policy of numbers, the compatibility of this policy with the status of &quot;human rights country&quot; that France boasts.
Recently, it has been the administrative harassment of foreign students that has become topical when the Minister of the Interior (see Libération of 23 May) declared that France &quot;does not need foreign talents, masons and waitresses&quot;.
But so far it has seldom been analyzed from an economic point of view.
It must be said that there is a fairly broad consensus between the left and the right in this area.
Right in 1976, Jacques Chirac said &quot;900000 unemployed should not be a problem in a country with 2 million immigrant workers&quot; and on the left Michel Rocard when he said in 1990 that France &quot;cannot accept all the world&#39;s misery &quot;.
The only difference is the degree of generosity
In 2005, fears of an invasion of hordes of Polish plumbers on French territory were shared on the right and left.
In both camps, immigrants are seen as a burden on the economy and French society.
The only difference is the degree of generosity we dare to give immigrants.
In his program, François Hollande confines himself to banality, stating that joint development will make it possible to solve our &quot;migration problem&quot;.
This idea of immigration as a burden and a problem may be valid in elections, but it is very expensive economically.
As economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron point out in their recently published work Synthesizing the Latest Knowledge of Immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pages): There is a wide range of specialists consensus on the positive impact of migratory movements on economic growth, wages and employment in the host countries.
Restricting immigration is crippling growth and damaging employment.
Concerns about the impact of migrants are based on the idea that these people can replace French workers, especially the less skilled, and are putting downward pressure on their wages.
But experience shows that, in fact, immigrants are much more complementary than substitutes for French workers by working in sectors with a shortage of workers.
Low-skilled immigrants in sectors that do not attract French workers, and those most skilled in dynamic sectors where education is not enough to offer jobs.
Positive effect on wages
Just as a surgeon will have difficulty working in a country where there is a shortage of anesthesiologists, these additions between French and migrants are causing the arrival of immigrants to have a positive effect on the wages and employment of French workers.
Giovanni Peri thus calculated that a 1% increase in migratory movements would lead to a long-term increase in real wages of between 0.6% and 0.9%.
At the same time, it does not take into account the fact that the diversity brought by immigrants contributes to the creation of ideas and economic growth (a high proportion of naturalized immigrants among American Nobel laureates; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were immigrants).
Migrants are also net contributors of social systems in European countries, averaging 1% of the total budget.
For example, the World Labor Organization estimates that in Germany, one immigrant arriving at the age of 30 will make a net contribution (income minus expenditure) of EUR 150000 to public budgets in his or her lifetime.
At the beginning of his term, Nicolas Sarkozy expressed a desire to go &quot;with bared teeth&quot; for the missing growth percentage.
The mentioned teeth used to deter immigrants had the opposite effect.
Europe has invented democracy, it remains to think about European democracy
Democracy is a rare and also very fragile commodity.
The European continent should remember this, after all, although it was invented in Athens two thousand years ago, it was experienced during the XX century. century tragedy of world wars, totalitarian regimes, the Holocaust, the gulags, but also Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal and the colonels in Greece.
Some people may have believed that in order for democracy to definitively triumph over its enemies, it would be enough to make an election and conduct it in the most direct way possible.
However, it has been known since Napoleon that it was about ease of thought.
Universal suffrage, although a necessary condition for democracy, is not a sufficient condition and can become an &quot;instrument of oppression,&quot; as Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot once said.
No, democracy requires much more: public space, public spirit, values, the organization of separation and power control, education, the Enlightenment, social and economic solidarity, justice.
The crisis in Europe that we are experiencing is an economic crisis, but it has been the same since the beginning of the crisis of politics and democracy.
Admitting the error of the Greek referendum of the yes-no type will have the value of a double revelation in this regard: the revelation of the need for a great return of political power, but also the revelation of a worrying feeling of its impossibility, its unsuitability.
This ambivalence must be considered in order to be overcome.
The truth is that the front lines of democratic struggle have shifted today, and that many Republican fighters are no longer shooting in the right direction.
We cannot gain anything if we demand a series of national referendums organized as necessary and disorganized.
Blankly exposed to the European absolutist monarch or a leap with bound feet into the void of nationalist depth: what choice for the citizen!
No, we do not want guillotine knives, but a common, full, peaceful and continuous exercise of choice and democracy, this time at European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal - nor would we know where to stop - because the crisis is in Europe.
It is the whole of Europe, bowing before the dictates of markets and credit rating agencies, which suffers from its incompetence and its lack of solidarity.
It is the whole of Europe that is humiliated on the international stage.
We are worried about the transfer of sovereignty to Europe - but it is the whole of Europe that is slowly losing its sovereignty and with it each of its nations.
There is an urgent need to return the management of the European project of democratic sovereignty.
Because only together will Europeans be able to reduce the burden of their debts, get rid of market governance and prepare for the future by investing.
The exit from the crisis will presuppose decisions at European level that cannot be taken without full democratic legitimacy, otherwise it would lead us to disaster.
After a long struggle against this proposal of the Socialists and Jacques Delors, everyone today is urgently demanding a European economic government.
Be it.
But to think so without stronger political and democratic integration, and experienced as such by citizens, would be a new folly and a new impasse.
We must take on a new stage in European construction.
In order to create a republic in France, it was necessary to &quot;be&quot; republicans.
A revolution in the interests could not be enough.
This lesson continues to apply.
We need to build a Europe that is more economically integrated.
This can only be done by building a Europe of more political democratic and genuine European democratic sovereignty.
Let us become Europeans to build Europe.
&quot;Contactless&quot; smart cards are spreading
The world chip card fair will open on Tuesday in Villepinte near Paris in an optimistic atmosphere.
According to the Eurosmart cabinet, 2011 should end with an increase in world sales of cards with a microprocessor (bank cards, phones with a SIM card) by 11% to more than 6 billion units.
The most important is the segment of contactless technology, which allows you to pay in public transport or process purchases by simply bringing the card closer to the reader.
This year, 460 million smart cards should be sold worldwide, compared to 320 million sold a year earlier!
Their share is expected to increase in 2012 (expected 580 million units) and reach approximately 10% of the total chip card market (6.925 million cards).
After being in the tow of APEC countries for a long time, Europe is gaining ground in contactless payment.
Approximately 26 million Visa bank cards are already equipped with this feature and 75,000 payment terminals accept them.
In France, the beginnings are more modest: 400,000 contactless Visa cards have been issued.
But big retail chains work for two.
This year, Carrefour issued 2.5 million contactless Pass MasterCard cards.
In order to shift to a higher gear, it is now necessary for banks to equip their clients with them.
&quot;Two large French companies have committed to systematically distributing contactless bank cards to their clients in the future,&quot; said Gérard Nébouy, CEO of Visa Europe France.
Banks are testing mobile payments
But this is only the first stage towards the means of payment of the future: the mobile phone.
Today, only a small number of devices are equipped with the NFC (Near Field Communication) technology required to perform transactions.
&quot;They&#39;re late.&quot;
&quot;But their real expansion should take place next year.&quot;
&quot;For 2012, we estimate their worldwide sales at 80 to 120 million units,&quot; explains Marc Bertin, President of Eurosmart.
But banks are already preparing ahead.
Yesterday, Crédit agricole announced the launch of a test conducted in the city of Caen, which will run from December to June next year.
The iPhone&#39;s approximately 200 clients and associates will be equipped with a case that allows contactless payments.
BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And Société générale also announced yesterday that it is preparing to introduce an offer allowing its clients to pay by mobile phone contactlessly.
The terrorist front extends from the Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is worried about ties between al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
The long-standing suspicions that alliances exist with the al-Qaeda terrorist group in the Islamic Maghreb (AQMI) and the Nigerian Boko Haram sect are confirmed.
On Sunday, Abdelkader Messahel, Algeria&#39;s deputy foreign minister, even admitted that Algiers had &quot;gained confidence&quot; about it from now on.
&quot;The way the two organizations operate and the intelligence reports show that there is a lot of cooperation between them,&quot; he explained without further elaboration.
Paris seems to have similar analyzes.
An investigation into the kidnapping of two Frenchmen in Niger in January 2010 could help illuminate the bridges.
After being abducted by AQMI members from a restaurant in Niamey, Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory were to be killed the next day at the same time as several of their captors in an operation carried out by French special forces.
French and Nigerian investigators were to find several chip phones belonging to terrorists in the rubble after the intervention.
Terrorist axis
The analysis of the calls made leads to several people in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), investigators are particularly interested in two numbers: one leads to a Nigerian who has long resided in Maiduguri, a city in northern Nigeria that is the cradle of Boko Haram, and the other to a man who is said to be close to AQMI and sect.
&quot;It&#39;s progress, but we certainly need to wait for more convincing evidence before we talk about operational cooperation between AQMI and Boko Haram.&quot;
&quot;But it&#39;s possible.&quot;
&quot;We have known for years that the sect enjoys external financial and intellectual support and is becoming more and more active,&quot; said Nigerian investigator Kunle Amuwo.
In recent months, this &quot;support&quot; has become increasingly apparent in the development and manifestations of Boko Haram or its operational procedures, which now involve human casualties or increasingly complex explosive devices of the same design as those used by AQMI.
The international community, led by Washington, has since put pressure on Nigeria to take into account the problems raised by Boko Haram.
In fact, the Nigerian authorities have long considered the group to be a community of enlightened mystics of little interest.
Fast success
The Boko Haram sect was founded in 2002 in Maiduguri around the mosque, school and fundamentalist Mohammed Yusuf. Boko Haram, which means &quot;Western education is a sin&quot; in Haoussa, approves the establishment of an Islamic emirate in the Muslim north of Nigeria.
In this poor region, such a connection is a quick success.
The sect is politicized and demands strict adherence to Islamic Sharia law, while its supporters begin the fight against the central government.
These people focus first on churches, bars and offices.
In 2009, Boko Haram supporters became extremely active and multiplied their attacks on police stations.
The government&#39;s response is still the same as usual.
The army surrounds the city and the result is 800 dead.
The founder of the sect, Mohammed Yusuf, is caught and killed in prison.
Since then, the group has radicalized and left its operations in the north.
At Christmas 2010, Jos will carry out an assassination in the city of Jos, killing 80 people and then another in the capital, Abuja.
In June, it is again in Abuja, where Boko Haram attacks police headquarters in his first suicide attack.
And in August, the local UN office will be the first international target.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa, which should lead from Mauritania via Nigeria to Somalia, is now a concern for all security specialists.
Now that al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb has surrounded Mali and the Iger and Al-Shabab Somalis are operating in Kenya, Boko Haram is emerging as a new danger to the continent.
In an interview with Goodluck President Jonathan Alain Juppé last week in Nigeria, he said that France was on standby and ready to &quot;pass on all information&quot;.
The world according to presidential candidates
On issues related to China, Iran, or aid to Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, and Rick Perry compete for simplification and ignorance.
Can America, weakened by the crisis, govern the world with simple or even simplistic ideas?
When listening to presidential candidates, voters might think so.
For several days now, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and others have been repeating loud statements and brief instructions on foreign policy, which has traditionally been a strong point for Republicans.
Often unsubstantiated slogans about China, Iran or aid to Israel converge.
Mitt Romney, the top-ranked candidate in the Republican &quot;Grand Old Party&quot; race, threatened to call the Chinese before the World Trade Organization and accuse them of &quot;manipulating their currency,&quot; a major theme in America fueled by the migration of entire parts of its industry to Asia.
All the worse if this must involve starting a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, Obama&#39;s former ambassador to China and the only candidate with a sophisticated vision of foreign policy, almost stuck in an attitude that &quot;smoothed out&quot; emotions.
He called for a hard but constructive dialogue with Beijing (the current position of President Obama).
But Huntsman, who ranks last in the election estimates, remains inaudible.
To the image of President Reagan
Romney has also promised military strikes on Iran if sanctions fail to halt its nuclear program.
&quot;If I am elected, I will imprison Iran,&quot; he said in fanfare.
&quot;If Obama is re-elected, they will have a bomb.&quot;
He also promised to increase military aid to Israel, accusing Obama of disappointing in his duties to the partner.
Entrepreneur Herman Cain, the second best-placed candidate, shows embarrassing ignorance of the documents.
He recently called for a stark stance against the Chinese military threat, as Beijing &quot;tries to develop nuclear capabilities&quot; - evidently unaware of the fact that China has owned a nuclear weapon since 1964!
Texas Gov. Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants strikes against Iran, says he is ready to send a US military to Mexico to fight drug cartels.
The use of torture against alleged terrorists banned by Obama in 2009 is also recommended by Cain, Perry and other candidate, Michele Bachmann.
They are all far apart from Republican candidate John McCain in 2008, a heavyweight in foreign policy.
Opponents of the current president say Reagan also had simple ideas and still won the Cold War.
They recall that Obama himself was an amateur and that he added water to his wine in the fight against terrorism.
They emphasize the failure of his naive dialogue with Iran, the hasty departure of the &quot;boys&quot; from Iraq, his excuses regarding Libya and thus attribute to him the label of a weak
But the attack is not easy.
The population views President Obama&#39;s national security policy, which Ben Laden has removed, rather positively.
He does not trust Iraq for military interventions that lead to entanglement.
And with arguments that America needs to be rebuilt economically in order to resuscitate its leadership, Obama is knocking to the right place.
Nord Stream, a new Russian gas port of entry into Europe
The long-distance Nord Stream gas pipeline, which connects Eastern Europe directly to Russia and runs along the bottom of the Baltic Sea, has become operational.
It has to supply gas equivalent to the equivalent of 30 million households.
Gazprom, a Russian gas giant, wanted to celebrate the event properly.
More than 500 guests, including 4 heads of state and government, attended the inauguration of Nord Stream last Tuesday, a new pipeline that will connect Russia and Germany directly under the sea.
Symbolically, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fillon and his Dutch counterpart Mark Rutte turned the control wheel together to control the entry of Russian gas into the Western European network.
With this new pipeline, 27.5 billion additional cubic meters of Russian gas will flow into Western Europe each year through the first 1,224 km pipeline connecting the St. Petersburg region with the federal state of Mecklemberg-Pomerania.
The second pipeline, which must be completed at the end of 2012, will make it possible to supply a total of 55 billion cubic meters of gas, a quantity equal to all French consumption.
And the possibility of building a third pipeline on the same route is already mentioned.
For Gazprom, the timely completion of this huge construction is a victory.
Poland and the Baltic countries strongly protested against the project.
In fact, Nord Stream will make it possible to supply gas directly to Germany without being routed through the country by a third country (Poland or Ukraine).
At the same time, the two countries are losing some of their power: the possibility of pushing Russia on threats to foreclose Western European markets is becoming more difficult for them.
Warsaw put it most strongly when it did not hesitate to compare Nord Stream to the &quot;new German-Soviet pact&quot;, referring to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin during the occupation of Poland in 1939.
It means saying that this is a politically sensitive subject.
By supporting this Russian project, Western Europe gained greater security of its purchases in it.
But it is at the cost of weakening Europe&#39;s energy, as the project has created cracks between Europeans from the East and the West.
Barely 5 years ago, Russia succeeded in asserting its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and rich, gas-consuming Western nations whose deposits were coming to an end.
&quot;This pipeline is part of our partnership with Russia, a new artery that connects us organically,&quot; François Fillon confirmed at the grand opening of the pipeline, demonstrating the point at which large gas contracts are both political and economic.
All this explains the wide smiles of Gazprom leaders present in large numbers in Lubmin, the gas supply point.
The construction of this gas pipeline is also an important technical act.
The submarine pipeline is made of steel with a concrete sheath to protect it from the anchors of seagoing vessels.
It rests on the bottom of the sea at an average depth of 200 m.
During its construction, it was necessary to avoid minefields dating from World War II.
&quot;For security reasons, almost a hundred of them had to be removed or destroyed,&quot; said Jens Müller, a spokesman for Nord Stream.
Measures to protect fauna and flora also needed to be stepped up.
The pipe itself is a long metal snake weighing like 242 Eiffel Tower, which is not interrupted anywhere along its length by valves or maintenance stations.
One control platform was to be built near Sweden, but the project leaders rejected it when the Swedes were reluctant to see a Russian state-owned company settling permanently off their coast.
&quot;In the event of a fault, we will stop the gas flow in less than 1 minute,&quot; says Jens Müller.
In the event of a leak, the gas contained in the pipeline will escape into the air.
But this case is considered unlikely by the builder, because the welds were designed so that the leak occurs once every 100,000 years.
The condition of the pipeline from the outside is checked by an underwater robot towed by a ship, while the inside of the pipeline is checked by a device that circulates inside.
This cigar-shaped device with a diameter of 1 meter is introduced into the inside of the pipe and is pushed by gas.
At the finish line after a full three days of travel at a speed of 3 m / s, it will provide accurate information about possible deformations of metal parts.
The long-distance pipeline was designed to operate for fifty years without the need for the slightest repair.
Gas circulation is simply ensured by pressure.
The value of this pressure is 200 bar at the start and 100 bar at the finish.
Five companies joined forces to implement this project.
Gazprom remains the leader, holding a 51% stake.
It was joined by the German companies E.ON and BASF (15.5% each), as well as the Dutch company Gasunie and the French group GDF Suez (9% each).
The five companies set up a joint venture called Nord Stream to build and operate the pipeline.
The company is headquartered in Zoug, Switzerland, where taxation is extremely advantageous.
Gazprom subsequently leased the company all its gas transmission capacity for five years under a renewable contract.
&quot;Gazprom will benefit from the total capacity, whatever the amount of gas actually transported,&quot; says Jens Müller.
Financing of the construction of the gas pipeline was provided by 30% by shareholders and 70% by bank loans.
The total cost of the work should reach 7.4 billion euros for both pipelines.
For the GDF Suez Group, the investment costs rose to 240 million.
But minority shareholders are confident that their costs will be recouped, as only Gazprom takes the risk.
The pipeline emerges from the Baltic Sea in Lubmin on a sandy shore with pine forests.
The 4.5 meter high valves form the gas outlet gate.
The sensors measure the pressure, temperature and other characteristics of the incoming gas before it is transported to the German gas pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, the terminal has been receiving one million cubic meters of Russian gas every hour.
When full capacity is reached, it will be 3 million per hour and in 2012 6 million.
Moleskine - Branded notebook
The Italian company Moleskine, which was founded fifty years ago, wants to provide the joy of writing again.
It brings the scent of adventure, hours spent writing by candlelight.
The Moleskine notebook is easily recognizable by its black rectangular plates and its faded white sheets, which seem to be old.
After all, the Moleskine notebook, as we know it today, was born in 1997.
At that time, the Italian company Modo Modo, based in Milan, decided to launch a new design but distinguished notebook.
Maria Sebregondi, then a consultant working for the company, is in charge of launching the new product.
The notebook is inspired by the old production technique &quot;moleskin&quot; (imitation leather), which is used, for example, to modify the surface of benches.
This type of notebook was much appreciated by writers and travelers.
&quot;Moleskine returned to popularity an old and forgotten object that was an icon of avant-garde artists until the 20th century,&quot; says Maria Sebregondi, who has since become the brand&#39;s leader at Modo Modo.
Success is here.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26%, settling at 12.7 million units last year.
The situation is far from covert production from the first years, when only 3,000 notebooks were made.
Moleskine crosses the Italian border and is exported to 70 countries from France to the United States.
It is difficult to compile an artificial portrait of the buyer, because the notebook attracts the businessman as much as the student or professional.
The image of the Moleskine notebook includes that its owners are cosmopolitan, cultured and open-minded people.
The small Italian company, which initially had 12 employees, now has almost a hundred of them and since 2008 has two offices, one in Milan and the other in New York.
He sends his notebooks to bookstores and, through the FNAC chain of stores, to small boutiques in city centers, where he has been able to assert his identity.
&quot;We followed the spirit of the time and this need for new writing, despite the rapid development of e-mails,&quot; explains Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural signature accompanies the development of the Moleskine notebook: the brand recently opened an exhibition &quot;Zacházka&quot;, where architects or artists exhibit their notebooks.
In August, on the occasion of the Locarno Film Festival, she also introduced new notebooks resembling a leopard.
Moleskine benefits from its success and this cultural aura and diversifies its products: bags, diaries, pencils, notebook cases ... The brand is expanding to a wide range of media.
Success that aroused envy: in the autumn of 2006, Modo Modo was bought by the investment funds SG Capital Europe, today Syntegra Capital, writing a new page in the history of Moleskine.
Why is the share of unemployed handicapped workers so high?
Around 19% of handicapped people are looking for work.
The 15th Week for the Employment of the Handicapped opens today.
Despite the voluntaristic public policy introduced in 2005, the percentage of unemployed disabled people is twice as high as the average, ie 19% compared to 9% for the entire population.
Is it depressing?
&quot;No, underlines Éric Blanchet, CEO of Adapt, which organizes a Week for the Employment of the Handicapped.&quot;
&quot;The progress made in 15 years is remarkable.&quot;
&quot;At that time, the percentage of unemployed was not twice, but three times higher.&quot;
&quot;However, much remains to be done.&quot;
It must be said that numerous obstacles remain for unemployed disabled people before they start work.
These are the elderly: 37% are over 50 (17% on average).
They have low qualifications: 80% do not have a high school diploma and only 10,000 are 2.3 million university students.
Finally, long-term unemployment is widespread: 53% of the disabled, compared with 38% on average.
In short, these are criteria that make returning to work particularly difficult and which are the &quot;core of the problem&quot;, according to Christian Grapin, CEO of Tremplin, which was set up in 1992 to help businesses recruit disabled workers.
So much for objective brakes.
There are unspoken, ways of thinking that are certainly evolving, but too slow.
A study conducted in April by the IMS-Entreprendre pour la Cité found that the interviewed managers had a &quot;low level of knowledge about disabled people&quot; with an &quot;exaggerated idea of wheelchair users and mental or mental deficiencies&quot;.
As a result, private companies with more than 20 employees are still far from reaching the target of employing 6% of disabled workers set out in the 1987 Act.
The latest known figures, which come from 2008, indicate a situation of 2.6%.
&quot;We are now around 3%,&quot; said Pierre Blanc, CEO of Agefiph, which is responsible for collecting fees from companies that do not comply with the law.
This is evidenced by the number of &quot;fined&quot; companies, as well as the amounts paid, which fell between 2007 and 2011 from 59,000 offending companies to 46,000 (from 606 to 480 million euros).
&quot;The 2005 law, which increased contributions, put strong pressure on businesses,&quot; explains Pierre Blanc.
&quot;But this improvement also demonstrates true awareness, especially in large companies.&quot;
According to the Ministry of Labor, only 59% of companies with 20 to 49 employees employ handicapped workers, compared to 82% of companies with 100 to 199 employees.
Gambling: &quot;How lucky&quot;
Before the French national team (Bleus) challenged on Tuesday evening (20:45), Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens did not hide the pleasure that this friendly match will bring them.
We will not go so far as to write that there was an association between them, but the picture is symbolic.
Sitting side by side in the stands of the Stade de France, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard reconciled in a nutshell.
Five months after his angry gesture from his striker in the match against Turkey, the Belgian coach said only words of praise to his player.
&quot;I am very pleased with Eden and his progress, even with the fact that he loves his country.&quot;
&quot;I want to move forward,&quot; assures French player Lille.
As for the difference between his performances in club matches and national team matches, &quot;it is one and the same, he apologizes.&quot;
&quot;I&#39;ve been in Lille all year, which is not the case with Belgium.&quot;
&quot;I need to clean my brand.&quot;
Gambling, investigated against Romania on Thursday night for this match against France, comes to the stadium in Saint-Denis to finally &quot;shine&quot;.
The notion of &quot;joy&quot; cannot be neglected.
Play against Bleus, which he encouraged from the age of 7 and in their winning campaigns in 1998 and 2000.
&quot;I&#39;ve always been a fan,&quot; he says.
This necessarily contributes even more to the &quot;special&quot; nature of this encounter.
All the more so, because opposite &quot;are Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami)&quot;, he recalls.
&quot;We cruised immediately.&quot;
&quot;Being able to play against them is just a pleasure!&quot;
Leekens kindly recalled &quot;pride.&quot;
&quot;Pride&quot; to win the &quot;match - holiday&quot;.
&quot;Pride&quot; also to state in the quality of &quot;neighbors&quot; that France, just over a year after the trauma in the South African city of Knysna, &quot;again became a team of a very high standard&quot;.
&quot;Laurent Blanc has done a tremendous amount of work,&quot; he breathed.
Although Belgium will be absent from the next European Championships, the technical footballer would like to see himself in the plane with the French in 2014 ... Brazil.
&quot;Our little Belgians will become big,&quot; he said.
&quot;We&#39;re building something right now, the players are ambitious, they&#39;re healthy.&quot;
&quot;You will realize that for future matches.&quot; Including France.
Portugal very confident
Portuguese coach Paulo Bento opens with great optimism the play-off against Bosnia Bosnia (22:00) this Wednesday in Lisbon.
Both teams lacked realism on the way there.
&quot;At the end of those 90 minutes, we will be a happy team and, above all, a happy country.&quot;
Paulo Bento is already seen in Poland and Ukraine.
There is no shadow of a doubt for him. The Portuguese national football team, which has been at the helm since 2010, qualifies for Euro 2012.
Portugal is actually 90 minutes away from happiness.
One match remains to be played and one opponent - Bosnia.
Given Friday&#39;s result (0-0) in the hell of Bosnian Zenica, it seems clear that nothing has been won.
Portugal certainly had more than an hour&#39;s advantage, but was unable to score such a rare goal that would relieve it.
&quot;It&#39;s a good result, but it involves risk because we didn&#39;t score goals outside.&quot;
But at home at their amazing Stade de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced that they will advance in front of an audience that should create a boiling cauldron there, even though the match definitely seems &quot;very balanced&quot;, says the optimist, but a keen Bento.
&quot;We expect a very balanced match, but we are absolutely convinced that we can have the upper hand,&quot; said the 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
&quot;We still have a 50% chance of being at Euro 2012&quot;, he still relativized Carlos Queiroz&#39;s successor.
Friday&#39;s tie in Bosnia forces the Portuguese to score and win.
A tie may be enough for Bosnians, who also need to score a goal.
&quot;It&#39;s a good result, but it involves a risk because we didn&#39;t score a goal outside,&quot; regrets Bento.
&quot;We will play against a team that has great technical qualities and that has players with great individual qualities,&quot; he added.
As in Zenica, the Portuguese will be interested in putting maximum pressure on the Bosnian team from the start so that &quot;they do not give them time to think.&quot;
Good idea, provided he proves realistic this time.
