Barack Obama to receive Nobel Peace Prize as America's fourth president
US President Barack Obama will arrive in Oslo, Norway, for 26 hours to take the Nobel Peace Prize as the fourth US president in history.
He will receive a diploma, a medal and a check for $1.4 million for, among other things, for exceptional efforts to strengthen world diplomacy and cooperation between nations.
The White House chief of the White House will arrive in the Norwegian capital in the morning with his wife, Michelle, and he will be busy.
He will first visit the Nobel Institute, where he will meet for the first time with five members of the committee selected from 172 people and 33 organisations in October.
The presidential couple then have a scheduled meeting with King Harald V of Norway and Queen Sonja.
The afternoon's visit will culminate in a ceremony at which Obama will receive the prestigious award.
He will win him as the fourth American president, but only the third to win the award directly in office.
The White House has already announced that Obama will talk about the Afghan war when accepting the award.
The president does not want to avoid this subject because he realizes that he is taking the award as the president currently at war in two countries.
He increased his efforts a few days ago by sending more troops to Afghanistan, which none of his critics will remember to highlight.
At the ceremony, Obama will also receive a gold medal, a diploma and a cheque for ten million Swedish kroner (about 24 million Czech crowns).
He intends to give those to charitable causes, but he has not yet decided on a particular charity.
The packed program will then be taken by the president and its chides to the banquet, where, in addition to the King of Norway and the Queen, there will also be a prime minister and another 250 invited guests.
From the beginning, Obama was more restrained to the price.
He said, for example, that he felt that he did not fully deserved it.
He also reiterated several times that it was not just a prize for him, but for all those who seek the same values as him.
Immediately after the announcement, he said they would be "chanted to take action" for him.
Conservationist accused of extortion
Litoměřice police have charged the chairman of the civic association Society of Conservation of Conservation of Litoměřice with blackmail.
In several cases in the past year, he has appealed to some building proceedings, demanding money from investors for his benefit to withdraw the appeal, said Litoměřická police spokeswoman Alena Romová.
The chairman of the Litoměřice Society of Conservation of Nature is Lubomír Studnička.
He is now in custody and faces up to three years in prison.
The sorting containers of Brno don't smell very good
In Prague, ordinary people can sort their drinks packaging, in the South Moravian villages you will find sorting containers at every turn.
And in Brno?
There, to set up a few minutes before you find the appropriate bins.
I don't want to say that waste would not be arranged in Brno at all.
But it seems to me that we are the second largest city in the Republic, the councillors are insufficiently interested in this problem.
Brno is in the jungle league of waste sorting not only by the fact that as citizens we can still throw only paper, glass and plastics into the sorting containers, but especially the number of bins for such waste.
Have you ever tried to throw a PET bottle in a collection basket in the center?
It's a complete trick, it just takes time and steady nerves.
The only place I have arrived at so far is in Moravský náměstí opposite Potrefené Huse.
Don't let Mr. Onderka and my colleagues get angry with me, but I don't find it a hell of a lot.
Not to mention that in other parts, there is no honey sorting of waste.
Many of my friends would rather not sort the garbage.
Out of laziness.
They're far from the bins.
I don't blame them.
I volunteered myself after the party to throw away a few glass and plastic bottles.
But I didn't see any colorful garbage cans on Kounicova Street in the foreseeable future.
Luckily, on the way to the sine, I came across the right place.
But the garbage from it was overflowing.
After all, this is still the centre of Brno, which is perhaps the most representative of the city, is it?!
But ecology and some aesthetics probably don't care much for the Brno socialists.
They would rather buy the city's extra-league hockey extra league, which will disgrace us all over the country than buy a few extra containers and offer sorting of other ingredients for cleaner Brno.
I am glad that I was able to confirm my supposition with official statistics after a few moments of browsing online.
According to data from EKO-KOM, Brno is really the worst in the whole South Moravian Region.
"Paroubk's" budget took money for pensions and sick pay
After the left added to farmers or officials in the government despite the government's view, there need not be money for pensions, sick pay, or building savings.
But also on interest on the national debt or international lawsuits.
It will add problems to those who will govern in the second half of next year, says Finance Minister Eduard Janota.
When the Social Democrats and the Communists advocated the increase for some groups, they relied on sensitive spending, pensions or sick pay to the government to borrow afterwards. "It's just postponing problems for the future, laying mines," says Janota.
The money borrowed is increasingly paid for interest and it has to come back at some point.
There's not much to choose to take the state.
If they do not lower welfare or the cost of running the state, they must raise their taxes.
To all the left has now added: firefighters, teachers, farmers.
And later, their children.
People don't have to worry about pensions or sick pay, from whose account 1.8 billion have disappeared, they get them.
But at the cost of the state becoming more indebted – next year, this will not be missing only 163 billion in the till, but more.
Despite Minister Janota's efforts, the debt will grow faster and faster, along with the cost of interest.
The state will need the money to pay it, and it will no longer be enough to increase VAT slightly or reduce the parent's one, as the government did in its anti-idepress and social package.
To move money in favor of several groups of voters, there will also be five billion for the completion of highways and railways next year.
These are mainly already tendered and set-up sections that will not be reproposed and possibly cheaper.
Preserve the most, which is also not for free.
It means a delay or halt to 30 large structures, the drawing of European money is also at risk, warns the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport Karel Hanzelka.
The CSSD has proposed to solve the loss of money in Solomon, with a touch of CEZ's dividends, which the state mostly owns, and from them to pour in the transport fund.
The problem is that the amount of the dividend is never certain, and it is certainly not a butt-free source.
Last year it came to the budget of 18 billion from CEZ.
Every year, dividends pay for the liquidation of environmental damage, the pension account is added or served as a provision for the forthcoming pension reform.
In addition, this trick, according to EU rules, increases the actual budget deficit to 5.7 percent of GDP.
However, the carnival of the movements do not end there.
Nearly three billion were cut in the budget for various compensation to the victims of communism and the crimes, or the spending on litigation, even for building savings.
Whether the state can do without this money is uncertain.
It's a lottery.
If we lose any international litigation, we'll have to pay for it anyway, Janota says.
The minister will then have to save money inside the resort or, in the worst case, reach the government's budget reserve.
One hundred million are also missing from the already run-up $2 billion project of the State Treasury to allow online to watch what each authorities are spending.
The first stage will start in January.
If the finance minister did not find the money elsewhere, the project would have to be halted, there will be sanctions, warns Janota.
Your next smartphone will handle two operating systems
In the future, Americans are counting on a mobile phone on which the user will switch between different operating systems at the touch of a single button.
The unveiled plans are promising.
Just press one key and from Windows Mobile you will be transported to Android in seconds.
This is precisely the possibility that is aimed at the American company VMware, which focuses mainly on the development of virtualization software for computers.
We will allow you to run two user profiles on your mobile at the same time.
You can switch between them, you can split them into home and work.
Both will work at one and the same time, Srinivas Krishnamurti of VMware suggested in an interview with Computerworld magazine.
Presented in November last year and was first performed a few days ago.
It will be on the market in 2012.
Virtualization of smartphones is no fiction.
VMware has already successfully demonstrated to journalists a test sample of a smartphone with two operating systems.
It was a modified Nokia N800 with a 128 MB RAM memory, on which the Windows Mobile and Android systems were running alongside each other.
The development of new technology for mobile phones is in full swing.
Now, VMware is working with European and US operators to test smartphone virtualization, and the devices should reach customers during 2012.
Lack of snow in the mountains plagues hoteliers
The bare slopes are not only worried about the Krkonoše toilers.
The lack of snow discourages people from ordering ski stays in hotels and guesthouses.
That is why, in the Giant Mountains, you can still get free rooms for all the winter dates, including Christmas and New Year's Eve.
Attendance on our site is a great one.
People are going through offers, looking for prices, but so far they are afraid to order in a binding manner.
And if they're calling to us, they're immediately asking if we think this Christmas will be in the snow or on the mud," said the operator of the information portal Spindl.Info Martin Jandura.
Those who want a New Year's Eve stay in Spindleruv Mlyn exactly to their liking should not hesitate to order.
Those who prefer to save money and the quality of accommodation comes second with them, they can still try to wait a few days.
Spindleruv hoteliers have so far offered mostly weekly stays on New Year's Eve.
I think they'll try to turn them in for a while, but then they, too, will give up and go for a shorter time.
And then the rooms will dwindle quickly," Jandura estimated.
Free beds on all winter dates are still offered by the Ingtours travel agency.
What we're most interested in is the Christmas week, which is not sold out yet.
Still half of the seats in our offer remain free.
That's why we've already prepared some cheaper last-minute Christmas stays," said Ingtoursu director Petr Schiefert.
New Year's Eve in the Giant Mountains can still be offered by the Vrchlabí travel agency, but there are fewer vacancies.
The first fortnight in February also goes well, with the remaining winter dates sold on average.
This year, interest in winter stays has a negative impact on the fact that there is still no snow in the Giant Mountains.
People are waiting to see if he'll think.
No one wants to spend the end of the year in the mountains without snow.
If the slopes are snowy during the week, Christmas will also be sold out," Schiefert says.
On the contrary, it is a little better than last year to occupy the rooms of the Horizont Hotel in Pec pod Snezka pod Snezkou.
We're about five percent better.
On New Year's Eve and Christmas, we have the last few places.
There is great interest in the Polish holidays in January and February is also selling well," said Karel Rada, director of the best kilcký hotel.
Eighty percent of New Year's Eve stays are booked by the Omnia Hotel at the central parking lot in Janske Lázně.
On the contrary, half of the beds available in the latest Janskolázeň hotel stay at Christmas.
We were pleasantly surprised by January this year, which we are already booked at this point about sixty per cent.
February is a little weaker so far, but as soon as the snow comes, interest in stays in the Giant Mountains will definitely rise even further, said the director of the Omnia Hotel, Erik Sporysch.
On a larger snowfall, however, the Krkonoše hoteliers have to let go of their appetite.
It is due to cool down on Thursday, if there are any precipitation, it should be snowy in the mountains.
But then the warming is to come again, Jiří Jakubský informed the Hradec workplace of the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute.
USA: Repeat is the mother of wisdom
It is almost comical as to the schoolboy's strivel with which Barack Obama, the president with the reputation of the smartest, is echoing in the Afghan question the strategy of his predecessor, whom he thought was the stupidest.
When he finally dentised up his wistfully awaited Afghan doctrine, it turned out that he had coped it over a copycat from Bush's Iraq script three years ago.
Not only does he use phrase "as in Iraq" phrase several times in the text itself, but he did not even hesitate to use the name of the Bush Declaration of January 2007 as the title of his own declaration: "The new Way Forward."
Three years ago, he himself criticized Bush's idea of sending fresh military reinforcements to Iraq, plagued by the civil war, as "irresponsible and in the after-end of a catastrophic decision."
But the ensuing months have shown that Bush's strategy, based on the recommendations of field commanders, was the only one possible and highly successful enough that there is no talk of Iraq at all in the news reports today.
Bush's reputation was unfulwable, but objectively left his successor a much more grateful initial situation than could be expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama hopes that the miracle will be repeated.
He was again asked to increase the military contingent by field commanders, in particular the commander-in-chief of the Afghan operation, General Stanley McCristal, who even harshly criticized the reluctant White House shooters, despite subordinating custom.
He asked for 40,000 men to break the situation for the better.
The president hesitated for three months, but he didn't get any better, so at least he cheated the general out of 10,000 troops.
He was able to wre up the promise of another 5,000 from Europe, although he had originally counted on at least 10.
The most problematic thing about Obama's entire strategy seems to be his intention to start withdrawing troops from Afghanistan in as early as 18 months and end the process within three years. The entire Obama doctrine raises more questions than it provides answers.
Many doubt that the half-hearted increase will bear the same fruit as the advance in Iraq.
Despite the fratricidal wars of recent years, Iraqi society is relatively well organized, its leaders honors the bargain.
The situation of the Afghan situation is characterised by the opposite symptom - no one can be relied upon and no agreements are respected.
Under these conditions, Afghan security forces are being prepared to change the master in every day, depending on how it suits them.
Political institutions, even if formally founded, will remain only a Potemkin village, for which patriarchal tribal relations will continue to be rampant.
The balancing of the interests of different ethnic groups is unusually complex, given the messiness of circumstances that are further complicated by Pakistani and Iranian influences.
Even building a "accessible state," which is a minimalist goal of the operation, doesn't seem very real.
The time horizon of Obama's strategy is puzzled by his voluntarism.
In the last eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only worsened and is now on the verge of an explosion.
Believing that soldiers sent to the turmoil of war for the purpose of "early return home" will cause a miracle done here, only a truly romantic soul, a reality-unscunched can be done.
Politically, setting the date for troop withdrawal is a sheer irresponsible, as the Taliban will see it as an indirect admission of American defeat.
The latest NATO summit showed that Europeans' willingness to participate in combat operations in Afghanistan is hasty.
European politicians do not know, nor do they want to explain to their voters how the security of Germany or Italy is linked to the war in the Hindukuš podhude.
Another factor capable of intervening radically in the situation is the development of events around Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and the intensified sanctions will not affect the Iranians, the question arises from the United States to be drawn to the question of not attempting to solve the problem by military force.
It will be answered at a time when, according to Obama, America will proceed with the victorious withdrawal from Afghanistan.
However, any such solution will also mark a dramatic turnaround in the Afghan situation.
The only patch for Barack Obama is that there are three years left in the presidential election, and therefore there is still enough time to come up with another strategy if this proves to be a total flop.
Goldman Sachs' managers no longer get cash rewards
Senior executives at US Bank Goldman Sachs will not receive cash rewards this year.
This was announced by the company, which is responding to harsh criticism of its wage practices.
Instead of money, the group of 30 leading executives will receive shares that can be sold in five years at the earliest.
In addition, shares can be taken away from managers if they take excessive risks.
Goldman Sachs is thus at the forepall for efforts to combine rewards on Wall Street with long-term performance, according to Reuters.
I think Wall Street is well aware of the broader direction it needs to take, said former investment banker at JPMorgan Douglas Elliott.
The problem is the details, he added.
Goldman Sachs came under criticism after setting aside nearly $17 billion (nearly $300 billion) in rewards for the first three quarters of this year.
The total remuneration in the company for this year, according to Reuters, is likely to exceed $20 billion despite the measure announced today.
High rewards in the banking sector have become a hot political issue in a number of countries with the coming of the financial crisis.
Britain announced on Wednesday that it intends to pay bankers' bonuses in excess of £25,000 (roughly $712,000) to a one-off tax on a fiftieth tax.
Similar steps are being prepared by France.
This year, women won the Nobel Prize in all fields except physics
The record-breaking five women today in Stockholm took over this year's Nobel Prize in professional categories and for literature from the hands of King Carl XVI of Sweden.
Alongside the four female scientists, they included the German Romanian-born German writer Herta Müller.
The Nobel Prize in Medicine went to two American biologists Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, along with their compatriot Jack Szostak for research in chromosomes.
The Chemistry Prize went to the Israelis Ada Jonath, along with the Americans Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz, for clarifying the structure and functions of the ribosomes.
The last laureate was the Nobel Prize in Economics, which was won by American Elinor Ostrom and her compatriot Oliver Williamson for analyses of economic governance.
The only professional category to do without a holder this year was physics.
This award was won today by scientists Charles Kao for the research in the field of fiber optics, and George Smith and Willard Boyle for the invention of the CCD chip, which is the basis for all digital cameras, fax machines or astronomical telescopes.
Each recipient received a degree, a Nobel Medal and a certificate of financial reward.
This for each category amounts to ten million Swedish kronor (roughly $25 million).
If there are more honorees in each of them, they share the reward between them.
The most traditionally anticipated Nobel Peace Prize was received earlier this afternoon in Oslo, Norway, by US President Barack Obama.
In his speech, he acknowledged the controversy of his awards, as he is only at the beginning of his career and, moreover, heads a country that wads two wars - in Iraq and Afghanistan.
But he added in the defense of his policy policy that wars are in some situation necessary to fight for peace, even if the price for it is high.
Minister Janota is considering resigning. Klaus invited him to the Castle
President Václav Klaus will receive Finance Minister Eduardo Janota on Friday morning, considering remaining in the government because he disagrees with the state budget's form for next year's state budget as approved by the Chamber of Deputies on Wednesday.
It is anticipated that the budget, and perhaps Janot's stay in the cabinet, will be the themes of their Friday meeting.
Klaus is also critical of the budget.
According to him, he has an excessive deficit, which further exacerbates the public finance crisis.
The meeting was reported by the president's spokesman Radim Ochvat.
Janota wants to discuss his continued tenure with Prime Minister Jan Fischer on Monday.
Under the Budget Act, which will now be given to Klaus for signing, the Czech Republic should run a deficit of 163 billion crowns.
But the House on Wednesday approved the left's proposals to move money, raising money for the salaries of civil servants, to run social services, and direct payments to farmers.
The government blabed the Social Democrats' proposals for covingly to increase the budget deficit.
A sharp domestic political dispute arose between the left on one and the government, Klaus and the right, on the other, over the other, which is beginning to mark a question mark over the further action of Fischer's clerical cabinet, which was agreed to form in the spring by the ODS, the ČSSD and the Green Party.
Critics argue that the budget as adopted by the House is essentially destroying the package of austerity measures that Fischer's government pushed through in the fall, which it believes is to halt the nation's debt.
Klaus, who may or may not sign the state budget bill, said at today's discussion breakfast with businessmen that politicians have for a long time neglected the "serious problem" of the "unsustainable deficit" of public finances.
Today, he says, he no longer has a good solution.
Only a strong government could bring improvements, and could also rely on a broader consensus among political parties, the president says.
ODS President Mirek Topolánek said the budget was frightening and the government should consider continuing to exist.
ODS Vice-President Petr Nečas told the Czech Press Agency that the concept of a clerical cabinet with the support of the ČSSD, ODS and the Greens clearly no longer works.
In response, Prime Minister Fischer called such words "strong statements."
The head of the ČSSD, Jiří Paroubek, responded to Topolánek by saying that the deficit of the budget, which the former Topolánek government prepared for this year, and which will exceed 200 billion crowns, is frightening.
Already on Wednesday, the ČSSD called the approval of the state budget for next year a success.
Satisfied were also the people.
Mandela was played by Morgan Freeman in Clint Eastwood's new novelty
South Africans claim that the new Hollywood film Invictus: Undefeated denims a lot about the country, about its fights and victories, despite some critics, that the lead roles are played by American actors.
The story tells of sports, racial conditions, and Nelson Mandela.
The relentless fighter against the racist apartheid regime in South Africa and its first black president, Nelson Mandela, is represented in his life story by Oscar-winning American actor Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said the 91-year-old Mandela had asked him if he could portray him in Eastwood's film.
Another important role in it is played by Matt Damon.
I told him, 'If I play you, I'll have to have access to you.
The 72-year-old actor, who won the award for his role in Eastwood's boxing drama, the Million Dollar Baby boxing award, has already portrayed, for example, the leader of the slavery-reliebish movement, which eventually became a slave, a fictional US president and even a god in Divine Evan, but rarely someone who still lives and is as important to many people as Mandela.
The former South African statesman was 27 years in prison for his active work for ending apartheid in South Africa.
He was released in 1990 and then became president of the country for four years.
In 1993, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
Invictus is a Latin word for the undefeated and is the title of a poem by the English author William Ernest Henley, published in 1875.
The challenge was to speak like him
The film is a true story about how Nelson Mandela joined forces with the captain of the South African rugby team, Francois Pienaar, to help unite the country. President-elect Mandela knows that his nation remains racially and economically divided after apartheid.
He believes he can bring his people together through sport, so he decides to unify the players of the rugby, who are among the outsiders on a global scale.
The South African team will eventually advance to the 1995 World Cup.
Freeman worked for several years to get Mandela's story on screen.
I had no other goal but to play this role in bringing it as close to reality as possible, Freeman said.
The biggest challenge, of course, was for me to speak like him.
The actor said that if he and the world politician were from the same area, he would have tried to meet Mandela, dine with him, be backstage before his speech.
The most important thing was that he wanted to shake Mandela's hand.
I found that when I squeezed your hand, I take your energy, it's transmitted, and I felt like I knew how you felt, he said.
It's important for me to try to be a different person.
Matt Damon is portrayed in the film by François Pienaar, captain of the national rugby team, which was dominated by white players.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for a role in the hard world of rugby.
The big surprise for him in the end was when he first met Pienaar at his house.
I remember the bell ringing, he opened the door for me, and the first thing I told François Piaesar in my life was, 'I look much bigger in the film'.
Despite the distinct differences in the actors' characters compared to their actual drafts under Eastwood, Invictus received: Undefeated positive reviews, and there is also talk of Oscar's ambitions.
The film critic of the Daily Variety, Todd McCarthy, summarized his review in the words: "It was a very good story, a very well-made film."
In film reviews on rottentomatoes.com, Invictus received 76 percent of positive reviews.
The secret of the glow over Norway spraveled: Russians test the racket
Above Norway, it was possible to observe a special light effect of unknown origin.
The Russian Defense Ministry only admitted yesterday that it had tested an intercontinental ballistic missile near the Norwegian border.
But the launch was unsuccessful again, and the missile referred to as the "Bulava" which was originally intended to be the pride of the Russian army is slowly becoming the black moth of Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
His repeated presence in the missile's tests did not have the appropriate effect on the test flight's success.
Bulava didn't usually take off at all or was damaged in the air.
In the Russian newspaper, "The Battle" is already referred to as a "rocket that doesn't fly."
The rocket that doesn't fly but shines
This in the ranking for the 13th attempt was at first normal.
It was not until the end of the flight that the apparatus was again damaged.
Apparently, the engine exploded in the third stage of the rocket.
This time, "The Battle" took off from the atomic submarine Dmitry Donsky, which was sailing under the White Sea.
This type of rocket allows the launch to be fired from a vessel that is both in motion and submerged.
It is therefore likely that the mysterious light over Norway caused by an unspecified flying object was indeed a broken "Bulava."
Indeed, the Norwegians had no doubt from the first moment that it was a Russian missile.
The generals are defending themselves this time, arguing that it is not possible to speak unequivocally about failure.
The first two stages of the rocket lasted and the accident affected the third.
In previous cases, the engines broke down in the first stage.
Although there was not a single test start without error, the Defense Ministry leadership considers only six of the thirteen to be unsuccessful.
The nearly 50% success rate therefore fills the generals with optimism, and so he still maintains that "Bulava" will fly without problems one day and that it will even carry up to ten hypersonic nuclear blocks with a maximum total weight of 1.15 tonnes.
The legendary Fetisov signed a one-year contract at CSKA Moscow at the age of 5
The legendary defender Vyacheslav Fetisov will be back in a professional hockey game at the age of 51.
The former world champion, Olympic champion and Stanley Cup champion will help out in the emergency of his CSKA Moscow team and will appear to be in the KHL's draw against St. Petersburg in Friday's KHL match.
Fetisov, who ended his career at the age of 40 in 1998, is currently the president of CSKA.
After Dennis Kuljash got injured, we badly need another defender.
Fetisov coaches regularly and has agreed to help the team.
We just need to finish some formal formalities, the AP quoted the coach of Moscow club Sergei Neminchov as saying.
It is not yet clear whether the famous hockey player's comeback will only cover one game.
I think Fetisov is one of those who can boost the spirit of the other players, said Nemchinov.
Fetisov will thus become the oldest Russian professional hockey player if he returns to the ice, according to AP.
In the NHL, he played the entire season for Hartford's legendary forward Gordie Howe in the NHL, scoring 15 goals and 26 assists.
The oldest of the famous five Fetisov, Kasatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov is one of the best and most successful hockey players in history.
He won two Olympic gold medals, seven World Cup titles, and triumphed at the Canada Cup and the Junior World Championships.
In the second part of his career, he also collected successes in the NHL, where he lifted the Stanley Cup twice in a Detroit uniform.
He has been a member of the Hockey Hall of Fame since 2001.
Hyundai complied with the union. It will take down all overtime
The management of the Nošovice automaker Hyundai has agreed with the unions to cancel all overtime.
It was because of the aft often ordered overtime that the unions declared a strike emergency on Monday.
Hyundai spokesman Petr Vaněk confirmed this.
However, the management wants to agree with the union at one more Saturday shift this year.
We cannot resign our production plan, that is essential, so voluntary overtime was proposed on Saturday 19 December with two shifts, said Vaněk.
Seven.cz reported that the company of employees who work Saturday's shift offered a bonus of CZK 400.
This will be given to people in retrospect even for a working Saturday, November 28.
According to Vanek, the company decided to change the way employees were motivated for the proposed overtime.
Either they have a overtime supplement paid for or they can choose a compensatory leave on December 28th and thus extend their Christmas holidays a day, Vanek said.
In addition, all Saturday shift employees will receive a paid fare and lunch.
Given that overtime was the most pro-urgent and pressing point in terms of comments and complaints from trade unionists, as well as protesting staff who spontaneously halted production last week, so management decided yesterday afternoon to cancel all overtime for the month of December with immediate effect, Vaněk said.
Until last week, the automaker's employees were forced to work two more hours of overtime virtually every day after the eight-hour shift.
After signing the agreement, the unions call off the strike alert
The next meeting between the management of the car and the trade unionists is scheduled to take place on Friday morning.
The head of the union, Petr Kuchař, said on Wednesday that if they agree to meet the requirements and sign a joint document, they are ready to cancel the strike alert.
The situation at the automaker escalated last week on Wednesday, when some 400 employees spontaneously went on strike overtime.
They also protested against poor pay conditions and alleged bullying.
Management said that overtime workers had to do overtime to meet the requirements for the supply of cars.
In their strike alert on Monday, the union also demanded that no sanctions be sanctioned by the staff who cut production off production last Wednesday.
In the area of overtime, the unions are asking the company to a minimum of overtime work.
In addition, they want to pay a reward of CZK 5,000 for it this year.
Nošovická automaker Hyundai now employs 2,000 people.
Serial production was launched by the company last November.
By this September, it had produced some 80,000 cars, with its current production capacity of 200,000 cars per year.
Czech discovery: a substance that works on 'toucobitry' HIV viruses
A team of Czech and German scientists is testing new compounds that can slow down the spread of the HIV virus in the organism.
The main advantage of the improved substance is that it also works for the viruses that have already obtained immunity against the drugs.
This fact outweighs in some cases that the compound does not feel as strong on the common variant of the virus as some of the drugs already available.
AIDS disease cannot yet be cured.
However, patients can be significantly prolonged by a mixture of drugs that prevent the multiplication of the HIV virus in the body.
However, their use is accompanied by a number of side effects.
In addition, the incomplete suppression of the virus's propagation results in the development of so-called resistant viruses, against which the drugs are no longer inactive.
The work of experts from the three institutes of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, from the University of Technology in Prague and from the University of Heidelberg opens the way to deal with the resistance of the virus.
They demonstrated that substances called metocarboran act on the protein responsible for the HIV virus to multiply.
Metalocarboran are boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt compounds.
These compounds block the spread of the virus differently than all the drugs used today, and therefore can overcome the problem of resistance.
In their work, scientists come up with new 'encaped' compounds prepared based on the knowledge of the molecular mechanism of their binding to viral protein.
Metalocarborans have a unique three-dimensional structure: two multi-dimensional cages made up of boron atoms, hydrogen and carbon are connected by a metal atom, in this case cobalt.
A treacherous and resistant virus
HIV protease is a protein for the HIV virus that is essential for the life cycle of the virus.
Without HIV protease caused by the fission of the HIV virus, there would not have developed mature infectious viral particles.
When we stop HIV protease, we will also stop the spread of the virus in the patient's body, the scientists explain in a press release issued by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic.
In a paper published in the scientific journal Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, scientists describe a series of compounds in which two pairs of cages (see table) are linked by a short organic chain, which is further systematically amended.
A little weaker but more reliable
The effect of this series of HIVprotea protease agents was tested in a test tube and against its resistant (resistant) variants obtained from HIV-infected patients.
The effect of metalocarborates on the normal enzyme variant is not as powerful as for clinically used drugs, but it does not lose its effect for resistant options against which the drugs used are often ineffective.
The unique mechanism of action and also their other properties such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of further chemical treatment thus make metocarborates interesting compounds for further research towards the design of effective HIV drugs, Rinner Pavlína Řezáčová, head of the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry and the Institute of Molecular Genetics of the Academy of Sciences.
Arguing over the budget. ODS has set in on Fischer, he's fighting back
The head of the ODS, Mirek Topolánek, called the approved budget for next year "scary" and the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should consider continuing to exist.
The ODS's comments the Prime Minister called strong statements.
He says he's time for analysis.
ODS deputy chairman Petr Nečas said that the concept of a clerical cabinet with the support of the ČSSD, ODS and the Green Party clearly no longer works.
According to Nečas, the Prime Minister must decide whether he intends to rely in the House on a minority to be in the battle with the growing deficit or to remain in office with the help of the parliamentary left.
The ODS and social democracy's approach to the issue of public deficits is diametrically opposed, Nečas pointed out.
The House adopted the 2010 budget on Wednesday, but with left-wing amendments worth more than 12 billion crowns.
The House increased the money for salaries of civil servants, the operation of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government's criticism of the Social Democrat proposals was that they cover the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic should manage a deficit of 163 billion crowns.
The ODS left the chamber before the vote, upending the government's wish that even the amended budget is a less bad option than a budget makeshift.
Disappointment and futility
Finance Minister Eduard Janota spoke of disappointment and frustration, with Prime Minister Jan Fischer saying that the government will evaluate the current situation.
Nečas is convinced that if Janota were to threaten to seriously threaten to leave office if amendments were adopted, the situation might have looked different.
According to Czech Television, Janota made an appointment for the prime minister after the government on Monday.
He hinted at considering staying in office again.
This is due to his disappointment with the budget negotiations.
If Fischer is in favour of further fighting the budget deficit, according to Nečas, the GOP nominees, which pushed through the budget changes, are not in the government.
The Prime Minister should also make it clear that he will resign if the House passes further laws to raise the deficit, such as those relating to sickness, pensions, or an amendment to the Public Servants Act.
Topolánek: ODS nominees not in their theatroopers's culpit
It is a matter for Prime Minister Fischer and the whole government.
The ODS nominees did nothing wrong, Topolánek stressed in a US text message.
He recalled that in several ministries there were people in the deputy positions who voted against the budget.
Nečas emphasized that if Fischer decides to resign to the principle of combating the government deficit, "it is perfectly logical and fair that it will lean on the left-wing majority that is currently in the House."
But then, he said, he could not count on the support and tolerance of the Civic Democrats.
I have not thought about it, and when it is up to date, I will address it, Defence Minister Martin Barták, who was nominated to the government by the Civic Democrats, told reporters in the House.
Prime Minister Fischer flew to Brussels for a European Council meeting in the afternoon.
At the request of the ODS prime minister retreated
Nečas also stressed that the ODS would probably vote against the amended budget in the House on Wednesday if the prime minister did not explicitly ask the members of the Civic Democrats to allow the adoption of the budget.
We do not feel like orphans, we are not young children, he then responded to the question of whether the ODS was burdened by the absence of the party's president in parliament and the Czech Republic in the political negotiations on the budget.
I didn't notice my voice missing.
Even as I resigned, I knew that in the months to come it would be primarily about the Bolshevisation of the House and the destruction of all the positive things, Topolánek himself responded.
Under the new ČD order, fewer trains will travel for almost the same fare
Czech Railways will cancel or restrict some of the less busy fast trains and locals from 13 December, while other connections will be strengthened.
The overall transport scale will be reduced by two percent from the date of the new timetable compared to today.
Most fares, including basic and customer fares, will not change.
For example, the residents of Ostrava will get more possibilities of connection to the capital, the railways will add one pendolino set to this line.
The speedster, on the other hand, will stop going to Bratislava.
Fewer fast trains will also take off on the line Praha - Písek - České Budějovice, and the direct connections Prague - Letohrad will be substantially reduced.
Of the regions, the railways plan the biggest reduction in transport in the Hradec Králové Region, by a total of eight percent, the increase can be enjoyed by Prague and the surrounding area.
Two night trains on the Prague - Tábor - České Budějovice route and the operation of several fast trains on the line Praha - Písek - České Budějovice are also being aboliced to some days a week.
The biggest changes include the introduction of a new direct line from Milovice to Prague, today Milovické must transfer in Lysá nad Labem.
It is the fifteenth line of the Esko suburban system, its opening is possible thanks to the completion of the electrification of the line from Lysá nad Labem to Milovice.
Long-distance services to the capital will end at the destination station Prague Main Station.
ČD will introduce more SC Pendolino connections between Prague and Ostrava and trains to Šumperk/Jeseneník will run at two-hour intervals.
Pendolin to Bratislava will no longer be taken by passengers from 13 December.
This year's regional rail bill: $200 million more
The speeders are ordered and paid for by the Ministry of Transport, in total to pay the so-called provable losses, the railways will give four billion crowns next year, as it did this year. The locomotors are ordered by the regions, in total they will pay eight billion crowns for them next year, with the state contributing less than three billion to the regions.
This year, regional trains are 200 million more expensive.
The runways have a newly concluded 10-year contract for locals and fast trains, so far the contract has always been for one year.
The runts praise the system, which is why they did not seem to have reached a price increase for the vast majority of tickets.
Changes will only be made for one-day ČD Net network tickets and cheap eLiška internet tickets.
For passengers without a customer card, the price of ČD Net will increase from CZK 450 to CZK 600.
The price of eLiška will be newly set from the distance travelled, so far it has been uniform for the journey between any regional towns and amounted to 160 crowns.
Philippine militants still detain over 50 people, Children set to be freed
Armed militants kidnapped 75 people in the south of the Philippines today, including several primary school pupils and their teachers.
This was reported by AFP, which initially reported only 65 abductees.
All 17 detained children were released after eight hours, including one teacher.
The abduction took place in the province of Agusan del Sur.
Approximately 19 gunmen are said to be using the hostage as a living shield as fleeing the police.
Local negotiators are now trying to agree to issue the remaining hostages.
According to AFP, the militants belong to the New People's Army (NPA), which is the armed arm of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to the AP, police initially chased the kidnapper for the violence that required settling scores between the local family's clans.
In the south of the Philippines in the province of Maguindanao, martial law has been declared due to the recent massacre, in which 57 people were killed.
Among the victims of the November 23 November massacre related to the election of the Governing Office were 30 journalists.
On suspicion of involvement in the massacre, the governor of this southern Philippine province and his father, Andal Ampatuan, the patriarch of the influential Ampatuan family, were arrested.
The island of Mindanao is also active in Muslim separatists.
But they resumed peace talks with the Philippine government on Tuesday.
The story of South Africa concerns everyone, says Morgan Freeman, aka Mandela
In the coming days, a new Hollywood film by Clint Eastwood Invictus (official Czech is Invictus: The Undevred) is coming to the US cinema, capturing part of the life story of former South African President Nelson Mandela.
The role of the world-famous anti-apartheid fighter was played by Morgan Freeman, whom he said he chose Mandela for his portrayal years ago.
The men's side role as the legendary South African rugby champion Francois Pienaar was played by Matt Damon.
With the release of the film, they arise from the acclaim of critics and the public
Nelson Mandela
Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela was born on 18 July 1918 in the Mvez, South Africa.
He received the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought in 1988, and in 1993 he and de Klerk won the Nobel Peace Prize.
He was president of South Africa from 1994 to 1999.
high expectations, as they come to the public at a time when preparations for the World Cup are both at the height of their preparations for the World Cup in South Africa, the media is being shaken by the worrying news of rising racial hatred and discrimination against the population by the black ruling majority.
According to the AP news agency, the response to the new film in South Africa has been mostly positive for the time being, despite numerous reservations about the cast of the lead roles by the "profile" Hollywood stars.
Morgan Freeman, however, is proud of the new film, he says.
I've been dreaming about the role for years and preparing well for it.
I have also met Nelson Mandela in person many times to - as they say - draw his energy, he said in an interview after the film's premiere in Los Angeles.
I think it's a good thing to remind the film of Mandela's personality and message.
It is the story of South Africa, but it concerns every person, he added.
In the national team jersey rugby
The film, based on a book by British writer John Carin, with the loosely translated title In the role of the Enemy: Nelson Mandela and the play that gave rise to the nation, portraying a South African human rights champion during his first presidential term.
So, during the film, Morgan Freeman tries to coalesce two racial groups and, for years, mutually defined groups of the population, and as in 1995 Nelson Mandela, he enters the acting role in South Africa's national rugby jersey at the World Cup, which was won by South Africa.
For entering the lawn in a jersey that is seen in South Africa almost as something sacred, Mandela received a large ovation from a predominantly white audience fourteen years ago and earned the recognition of the white population.
The Socceroague Championship may be able to bring people back into a nation, said rugby player Chester Williams, who was the only "black" in the national team in 1995.
Whether the tense situation in South Africa will improve remains to be seen.
But White South Africans are skeptical of how rugby fan Christopher Dawson, who fled to Britain from the country, revealed in a recent interview with the LN.
The championship will begin on June 11, 2010.
The transformer burns in Lounsk for tens of millions of crowns
The fire engulfed the transformer of the company Čeps in the substation at the village of Výškov on Lounsk.
The fire is hitting six units in the fire, according to the spokesman for the Ústí Regional Fire Department, Lukáš Marvan.
Originally, firefighters wanted to let the transformer burn out, but later reconsider the view and the fire extinguished with a mixture of water, foam and special forward materials.
The cause was a technical fault, an internal short-circuit transformer.
No one was injured, the crash, according to company spokeswoman Pavla Mandátová, does not threaten the safe operation of the transmission system.
The damage is estimated at several tens of millions of crowns, it will only be quantified to be accurately after the fire is over.
The destroyed transformer will need to be replaced by a new one, according to Mandate.
Nothing like this has happened in the ten years of the company's ten years of operation, defects of this type are rare, she added.
According to a spokesperson for ČEZ for North Bohemia, Soni Holinger Hendrychová, the operation of households, authorities, and companies were not affected by the fire at the transformer station.
A.s. Čeps operates in the Czech Republic as the exclusive operator of the transmission system, the 400 kV and 220 kV power lines.
It retained, restores and develops 39 substations with 67 transformers converters from the transmission to the grid and the 4339-kilometre line route.
Jančura to file criminal charges for defamation against three ČSSD governors
Student Agency owner Radim Jančura will file a criminal complaint today for defamation against three social-democratic governors.
This was to Michal Hašek from the South Moravian Region, Radko Martínek from the Pardubice Region and the Governor of the Olomouc Region, Martin Tesařík.
Jančura made the announcement in Twenty Minutes to Radiožurnál.
The lawsuit is linked to the firm's efforts to operate regional train services in some regions.
However, all regions eventually signed long-term contracts with Czech Railways.
All three generals are attacking us and talking about choosing raisins, yet we have only made an offer for what they wanted.
He says we are more expensive than Czech Railways, which is not true, because we know the prices of Czech Railways that were closed last week.
So we have no choice but to defend ourselves.
It is for defamation against Student Agency, he told Radiožurnálu Jančura.
At the same time, he said he had evidence from all the regions that they had not taken their steps in accordance with European law.
It is therefore preparing the initiative for the European Commission.
Hasek sees the filing of the criminal complaint as a further continuation of Mr. Jančura's media show, which serves as an unpaid advertisement for his companies and his own.
I am, of course, prepared to defend the good name of my region and mine, and to do the same, I will also challenge the other generals.
I assume that even on this occasion it will become clear that it is Mr Jančura who is manipulating the public and using false and false arguments in the matter of regional rail transport, Hasek said.
Jančura announced last week that he would invest several million crowns in advertising to the attention of the regions about the disadvantageous move.
He told Radiožurnálu that he would suspend the campaign after Christmas and continue it after the New Year.
He specified that the campaign would be conducted against corruption as such.
The campaign was launched by Jančura after the regions agreed to operate regional railway connections with Czech Railways and did not tender for the order of around CZK 150 billion.
According to Jančura, such conduct is against the law and contrary to the opinion of the European Court of Justice.
Due to the criticism of train transport in the regions, Jančura was already threatened by a ČSSD MP.
The only threat was that if we didn't stop, we could lose the bus licence.
He introduced himself as a ČSSD MP, I know which gentleman he is, I will not say his name, he told Radiožurnál Jančura today.
Pneumococcus vaccination will be free and optional
Vaccination against pneumococci will be demolished from January by the established customs.
It is to be the first for families to be free and optional at the same time.
But there are already voices that mandatory vaccination would be more effective.
Preparations for the introduction of free pneumococcal vaccination are at its peak.
The drug institute already sets the maximum prices for vaccines paid by health insurance companies.
The experts are also clear about the vaccination process.
New vaccination
Free vaccines for August children
From January, children born on August 2 last year and later can be vaccinated against pneumococci free of charge against pneumococci last year.
The condition is that they have not yet received a single dose of vaccination.
Those who started vaccinating last year or earlier must also pay for another booing.
The first dose of vaccination must be given between the age of the child and the child.
Last year already last year a quarter of families voluntarily vaccinated their children against pneumococci.
Parents paid CZK 1,600 for one or more benefit.
When vaccinating the youngest children, four doses are needed.
Overall, experts estimate that health insurance companies spend between CZK 300,000 and CZK 450,000 per year on vaccination benefits.
But it will save on the treatment that children would need without vaccination.
So far the state has given roughly 500,000 a year for all the child's across-the-board vaccinations.
The parseed vaccination was introduced by the so-called Janot package.
Pneumococcus causes inflammation of the middle ear, but also severe infections including meningitis and blood poisoning.
We will have as many as 28 children under 10 die from pneumococcal infections in hospitals in a year, according to a survey.
In addition to the Czech Republic, they introduced paid-raci vaccination of children against pneumococci in about 40 countries.
Will vaccination be mandatory?
At the same time, however, there are suggestions that this vaccination might be mandatory in the future.
It is to be paid for by insurance companies and optional from January.
The mandatory vaccination was better, for example, suggested the head of the civic association Nahlas, Rudolf Kalovský.
His association has long promoted pneumococcal vaccines.
The experts at the international conference that our association participated were not entirely satisfied with the fact that we have voluntary vaccinations.
It's not exactly ideal.
On the other hand, we are pleased that at least this has been passed.
I think that's the way we have to take now, Kalovský said.
But the health ministry does not want to change the vaccination process against pneumococcus.
We are not considering this at the moment, said his spokesman Vlastimil Sršeň.
Voluntary vaccination has its drawbacks, doctors say
The chairwoman of the Professional Society of Practical Children's Physicians, Hana Cabrnoch, acknowledges that she has her disadvantages in voluntary vaccination.
If all children were vaccinated, a reduction in the number of booing could be considered "In a situation where this vaccine costs such a large amount, we quite understand the political decision that the vaccination was started as voluntary," says Cabrnochová.
Experts expect to have their infants vaccinated against pneumococci from next year by more than 80 percent of new parents.
Vaccination against pneumococcus is also groundbreaking in that it is the first blanket vaccination of children to be covered by health insurance companies, not by the state.
Insurance companies should spend money on prevention, saving on further treatment, explains Cabrnoch.
Doctors will have to buy the fabrics themselves
But this is linked to the concerns of pediatricians' general practitioners, which relate to the purchase of vaccines.
According to the original intention, the vaccines were to be purchased by insurance companies, and doctors would receive them in the same way that the state gives them substances for other vaccinations.
But some MPs feared that insurance companies might "get out of health insurance."
Doctors will therefore have to buy the substances and wait for the insurance companies to reimburse them.
According to estimates, individual practitioners in children will invest 40,000 a month in vaccines, a significant sum.
It won't be easy at all, says Cabrnoch.
Son of American artist 'stolen at museum'
The son of renowned American creator to the fantasy, Frank Frazetta, has been charged with attempting to rob the $20 million (£12 million) paintings from his father's museum.
Police in Pennsylvania said Alfonso Frank Frazetta was caught loading 90 images into his vehicle and trailer.
The appoiner and the second man were used a backhoe to break into the museum in the Poconco Mountains region.
Mr. Frazetta senior, aged 81, became famous for creating the characters of Barbara Conan and Tarzan.
At the time of this, the artist was in Florida, as reported by the Associated Press.
AP quoted an unnamed police official as saying that Mr. Frazetta Jr. could have been motivated to act by prolonged family disputes.
In front of the police, Mr Frazetta's younger owled statement, the age of 52, that he had done so at his father's behest, "to get to the museum in any possible way and move the paintings to the hedge areas," as the agency reported.
Mr Frazetta Sr. denied granting any such permission, as the Agency said.
Labour resists the planned tax increase
Minitors advocated an increase in taxes and spending cuts announced in the budget's preliminary budget report against criticism from the opposition, entrepreneurs and trade unions.
As Alistair Darling put it, the Torys have "prompted" the possibility of showing that he was serious about postponing the decision to reduce the deficit until after the election.
The chancellor, too, came under fire because of the disability of low- and middle-income workers.
According to his proposal, this is mainly an increase of 0.5% in social insurance and a 1% adjustment of public payments from 2011 on account.
Uncreanity about social insurance
The union protested that low-income workers had been punished for a recession that was not to be caused and warned in advance of "problems."
Social insurance is increasing - an increase of around £3 trillion a year - outraged by the community of entrepreneurs who said it was an employment tax while focusing on the restoration of the economy.
This increase, limited to those incomes of more than £2000 per year, will affect around 10 million workers.
KEY POWN PBR
Social insurance to increase by an additional 0.5% from April 2011
The economic situation will deteriorate more than expected, by 4.75% this year
New taxation of 50% of bankers bonuses
Increation of firms' 1% tax for depreciation at small firms
Tax reduction for electric cars and wind farms
Increase in pension assessment by 2.5
According to the state administration's estimate, some of the £30,000 revenue will be reduced by £90 a year, and some of the £400 income will be reduced by £190, while some of the £100,000 revenues will be increased by £10.00.
Ministers announced that their target of halving the deficit by 2013 meant "sharpe decision-making" but insisted that 60% of the special taxes should account for 5% of the highest-income earners.
Treasury Secretary Stephen Timms denied that the proposed increase in taxes and spending curtax was a "drick in the ocean" compared to what would have to be done.
"These are big numbers. This will allow us to cut the deficit in half, which is an absolutely basic requirement for the next four years," he told the BBC.
Mr Timms said that he believed that the economy should grow at the turn of the year.
But the making of a forecast for future economic growth - which will affect the volume of the necessary loans and how quickly the deficit will be reduced - must be taken into account after the chancellor has been forced to revise the earlier sums.
In the opinion, he said the downturn of the economy this year was 4.75% - far worse than the 3.5% decline, predicted in April - because the loans were 3 trillion higher than previously estimated.
A missed opportunity'
The Conservatives, who launched a new promotional campaign on Thursday, warning of Labour's "rill-leaders' hijigat, have called the planned £789 trillion loan intolerable over the next six years.
Ministers failed to submit a credible plan, as could be covered, added, "cynically" postponed this decision until after the election - which must take place by June 2010.
"They did not add anything of significance to be feasible," said Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond. "They had a chance to do it, but they wasted it."
"All the important announcements will be made after the election if we win them "
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Labour insists that schools, hospitals and the police will be protected from future cuts, as opposed to Tory proposals, who would like to reduce the deficit more quickly and to a greater extent.
But the Liberal Democrats argue that the money raised by raising taxes and cutting spending should be used to boost spending next year and not to reduce the deficit, arguing that the plans are "bued up on the sand."
The BBC's political commentator Nick Robinson said of the timing of the message - for example, the above-mentioned inflation will increase and there will be an inability to pay benefits in the next April - that this could lead to the chancellor's accusations against the election campaign if the money was difficult to recover a year later.
But Labour insists insist on providing special assistance if people need it very much and the situation is revised in September 2010.
Suspic suspicious budget'
Although ministers did not disclose the details of the post-2011 spending, the economists said it was clear that a reduction in public spending would only be the start of medium-term restraint.
The respected Institute of Budget Studies reported that the chancellor's figures indicated substantial cuts in many areas, potentially in the budom, involving transport, higher education and defence.
"It's really painful so far," said its director, Robert Chote.
"All the important statements will come after the election if we win them," Roger Bootle, an economic adviser to the Deloitte's account reviros, added.
"That was the report of a suspicious preliminary budget, the market is being implemented."
FBI conducts investigation at 'American prisons in Pakiste'
The FBI is conducting an investigation at a prison in Pakistan for five Americans suspected of being linked to extremists.
The men were imprisoned for the attack on a house in Sargoda in eastern Sanjab province, as reported to the BBC by the US Embassy in Pakistan.
The FBI said this was an investigation into the same men who were pronounced missing in their last month at their residence in the U.S. state of Virginia.
The U.S. State Department said it was also about getting information about these men.
Three of them are reported to be originally from Pakistan, one of whom has Egyptian ancestry and the others come from Yemen.
"If they were American citizens, we would be very interested in the conditions under what conditions they were detained and the circumstances in which they stayed there," spokesman Ian Kelly said.
FBI spokeswoman Katherine Schweit said the agency had been briefed on the imprisonment and had been in contact with the families of the missing students.
"We are cooperating with the Pakistani authorities to determine their identity and the nature of their actions here and whether they are indeed missing students," she said.
The Pakistani embassy in Washgington said the men were arrested in a house belonging to the uncle of one of them.
It said that the house had always been the focus of local police and that charges had not yet been filed against the arrested men.
Secretary of State Hillry Clinton declined to comment on the arrest, Reuters news agency reported, but said the United States must "co-work much more narrowly with Afghanistan and Pakistan in uncovering the infrastructure of terrorism that is being christened in recruiting and training of people."
The disappearance of these five students from their home in Virginia was announced by their families at the end of November.
Rejection of the amnesty for the Iranian abused.
The human rights situation in Iran is as bad as in the last 20 years, as reported in the Amnesty International expedition report.
The report details the "dwelling of torture" in the pre- and after the disputed presidential election in June.
One of the men said he was beaten and burned with cigarettes, another said he was threatened with rape.
Iran has denied the above criticism of this report on respect for human rights.
Officials have described this criticism as politically motivated.
Thousands of people were imprisoned in Iran and dozens were killed after the disputed election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, leading to the biggest street dismantling since the Islamic Revolution in 1979.
Dozens of them were remanded in custody, and the prosecutors sentenced the last five to death.
The BBC's correspondent in Tehran, John Leyne, who is now in London, said that earlier in the protests of Supreme Leader, Ayatolah Ali Khran, declared the tacitry of some methods of torture and banned their implementation at the Karizak Correctional Facility.
But since then, almost no criticism of the legal power has been tolerated, as our correspondent said.
An frightly confession'
Amnesty International cited a report by a 26-year-old computer science student, Ibrahim Methari, who said he had been charged for "working with the Facebook network" and protesting the election results.
"I was often beaten in the face," he said in a statement.
"They burned me with cigarettes under my eyes, on my neck, in my head... they threatened me with execution and humiliated me."
After five days, he signed a false confession and was released and left in the street, still bleeding and half-conscious, Amnesty said.
In August, defeated presidential candidate Mehdi Charroubi was detained after the election after the protests and was tortured to death in prison and the others were raped.
Iranian senior civil servants denied the allegations of rape, but admitted that the torture had taken place.
Amnesty also listed the case of a former prisoner, who said he had been held in a container with 75 other people for more than eight weeks at the Kahrizak prison.
Amnesty acknowledged that the Iranian parliament and the judiciary had set up committees to investigate the post-election riots and the government's responses, but said the mandates and powers of the institutions had been unclear and the findings of the parliamentary committees of the mrebyles were published.
The group said that at least 90 people have been detained in the last three weeks to prevent further demonstrations.
A ski slope was created in the city park
More than 100 tonnes of artificial snow were used to turn the monument into a skiing track in Bristol into a downhill track for the race.
The downhill track for the park race attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowborders to compete for the financial prizes.
At the top of the downhill track in Brandon Hill, the short ski jump was a 100-meter-long downhill track.
Fourth-year medical student John Hickman said it was a wonderful view from the top of the downhill track, but that it was really dismal.
It was a wonderful sight to the blinking lights of the city below.
There were some of the best skiers and snowborders from all over the country - some of them real talent," he added.
The awards were awarded for the best pieces - or manoeuvres on the downhill track.
After Thursday night's race, the snow was left to melt.
Still them and us
Can a Muslim be a Frenchman?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
At a time when Swiss voters were calling for a ban on the construction of minarets and there are generally spreading alarmist about the alleged Islamization of Europe, John Bowen, the American academic wrote and informed, wondering whether Muslims could integrate - and whether they were integrating - into one of the continent's most open secular societies.
Some of the readers, after reading this book, became admirers of the author's latest work, "Why the French don't like head-sharfs" (2006), this elegant and discussed study on the contentious issues that have been distributing and employing the country for 15 years, and the effects of which are still felt today.
Mr Bowen's latest book has a broader and much more ambitious take.
As a good anthropologist, he wants to know not only what the politicians and the media said about Islam in France, but what really happened at the bottom.
He spent months in mosques, schools and institutes, which now take care of 5 ÷ 6 million French Muslims, which Mr. Bowen calls "Islamic spaces."
He is a good listener, reproducing debates between teachers and students about the issues that are most concerned about.
Should a Muslim enter into a marriage marriage at a mosque or a town hall (or both places)?
Should a young Muslim be taught about the development and rights of gays?
Can a Muslim woman marry a man who is not a Muslim?
Does Muslim have the right to use a petit-oriented banking system if he wants to get a mortgage?
These seemingly worldly contentious issues are being discussed and which are part of everyday life rather than the political dramas that employ the media.
The author identifies a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, among others of well-known people, including Tariko Ramadan, Arab, a Muslim researcher and an academic born in Switzerland.
This new generation is attempting to open up a debate on how to be a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society at the same time.
They have no arguments for all their customs.
Conservatives are distrustful of the true ideation of French or European Islam.
The philosophers and activists interviewed by Mr. Bowen are inclined to the housec with the prad that this is a counterpart to Selafi—a supporters of the purist Sunni Islam, affiliated with Saudi Arabia— this group is small, but influencing European Muslims.
Mr Bowen believes that Muslim values and French secularism are compatible.
But adapting requires compromises on both sides.
He wonders how far French politicians (and the intellectual elite, who so doggedly advocate the lay public) are, in fact, to the idea of pluralism.
He believes that Muslims are probably less experienced in matters of faith than Catholics, Protestants, and Jews, who also had to make historical compromises with secular Republicanism.
Rather than developing pragmatism, he found "the reel of the screasting of the screasts."
Can a Muslim be a Frenchman? After reading this book, someone may be incendis of saying "Yes, but not now."
The most mosent-of-the-cable outlook in the world
The Arctic is changing more dramatically than the other life-sets of the planet.
The bordering ice melt at alarming speed, which affects the animals and their survival as nowhere else.
The interest of oil, gas and fishing companies must be focused on new natural water sources, together with diplomats, lawyers and writers in their wake.
In "On the Tin Ice," Richard Ellis, a writer and illustrator, recounts the natural history of the North icon, the polar bear.
Well acquainted with the complicated history and whaling practices describes the long tradition of polar explorers who tried to seize the white bear.
Admiral Nelson's meeting with a daring 14-year-old lifeguard who fought only with the colle with a musket's colle with a musket is really a myth, but everything else is true.
The young bears who swam for the bodies of their just-slain mothers were captured and sent to the zoo and circuses.
At the beginning of the 20th century, 75 polar bears performed at the same time in a circus tent.
Even today, the zoo enclosure typically have an area a million times smaller than the area available to adult wilderness. The climate is rarely suitable: the resident polar bear in Singapore has made green turned out algae growing within the hollowesh hairs of its work.

Mr. Ellis draws on the works of other writers and historians, and often returns to the threat to the survival of the species's survival.
Although hunting is banned in Norway, America and Russia, the killing continues in Greenland and Canada, where helicopters and Indiana are fished from helicopters and Indiana skiing, all armed with powerful attack-based wards to blast their prey.
The ironic thing is that it takes place in the water to the north of these two hunting nations, and that the ice will eventually be the biggest.
In his new book, "After Ice" Alun, former editor of New Scientist, offers the clear and dismal responsibility of science for the Arctic and an engaging glimpse of how the future can change it.
Not all of this is answered by scientists.
Even meteorologists and oceanographers do not have an adequate response to the speed of the changes.
It's for lack of exams.
Fridtjof's research trips to Nansen at the end of the 19th and early 20th centuries first indicated the movement of floating ice.
Submarines in the Cold War then mapped the shifting ups of the pre-turning as they were float.
Satellite exploration and extensive probe fields in floating glaciers are a useful addition to, but many are still being held thanks to the intrepid individuals camping in the winter.
Mr. Anderson peers into the extraordinarily fragile world of the catchment system in the interior of the Arctic ice, made by the leakage of salt water that stings out as it freeze.

In a few months...that's to be us'
6,000 Marines laid wreaths on graves in Arlington
Petty Officer De'Angello Robinson, 19, traveled on a seven-hour bus to lay a simple wreath on the soldier's grave, had never met the underdog.
For him and the other Marines who made the trip from the Johnson camp in Jacksonville, North Carolina to the Arlington National Cemetery to garnish the graves, that was the day in which they paid tribute to the men and women who once wore the same footwear.
In a few months of boarding, it could be us, Robinson said of the fallen soldiers.
If this happens to us, I would like someone to do the same for me in order to show me respect as I am attempting to do so.
He was one of more than 6,000 volunteers who gathered that Saturday morning to lay wreaths in the veteran cemetery in several departments of the commemorative ceremony in Arlington.
In 1992, Morrill Worcester, the owner of the Worcester burial company in Harrington, Maine, began this tradition when he and several others decided to decorate several hundred graves at a commemorative ceremony in Arlington.
It is now an 18-year-old tradition of the 18-year-old tradition of Mr NMorill and his wife, Karen, making this trip every year and stopping in different cities along the way to honour the memory of military personnel and victims of terrorism.
The Worcesters are not looking for profit in this, the wreaths across America, which they also lay in other states.
That year, volunteers laid more than 16,000 wreaths at Arlington Cemetery, on Pentagon, on the graves at the Fayetteville National Cemetery in Arkansas, in Battery Park in New York City, and at the memorable site of flight number 93 United Airlines in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second year running, the Walmart Foundation has dedicated more than $1,500,000 to buy and transport wreaths.
Charleen Hunt, 70 years old, from Westminster, said she made the trip to Arlington in honor of her husband, the deceased member of the armed forces.
Since her husband is not buried in Arlington, Mrs Hunt said it was her journey to return what makes the victim.
It's a small way for citizens to support our troops, she said.
It's kind of like a visit to a family's grave.
Clapped in the coats of warm cloth, the volunteers walked through the cemetery on the surrounding lawns and hills.
The volunteers headed for the older graves of World War I and the World War II and the Vietnam War, because these are not visited as often as newer graves
The mood was positive when the children played and held hands together as they carried the young pine to the greyed tombstones.
Each circular wreath was deep green with a small red arc of the upper part.
Near§, in Unit 60, where most of the veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are buried, there was indeed silence.
The affiliated services organizations donated to 1,000 wreaths to decorate the department, but the gloomy mood of the currently ongoing wars filled the area.
Some wept sincerely, others prayed, and families and friends held each other in the cold air.
Some read the names, engraved in the stones, while others bent down to inspect the little black and white name tags, pushed into the wet mud where the tombstones had not yet been placed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of the many mothers who wiped tears from her eyes outside her son's grave.
She drove eight hours from Zanesfield, Ohio, to visit the final resting place of Sergeant Tanks, Sergeant of Tank Artillery David Shane Spicer, who died in the battle in July.
No one should ever forget why we're free. . .my son paid for it, she said.
"Even though I've been away for a long time, I want to be the one to remember him."
US government contractor imprisoned by Cuban government officials
The Cuban government has imprisoned a U.S. government contractor who imported mobile phones and laptops into the country, as reported by State Department officials on Saturday.
The contractor, which has not yet been identified, worked for the company Development Alternatives Inc. based in Bethesda.
The company is working on projects for the US Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
Consular officials, along with the American special-interest in Havana, sought access to the detainee who was imprisoned on December 5.
Certain allegations have not been made public, but under Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or foreigner can be imprisoned for almost anything that is described as "dangerous."
All so-called counter-revolutionary activities, including mild protests and critical essays, are poised to risk imprisonment.
Anti-government graffiti and speech are considered to be serious offences.
In Cuba, there is a young blogging community, led by popular commentator Yoani Sánchez, who often writes about how she and her husband are being watched and harassed by government agents.
Ms Sánchez has repeatedly applied for permission to leave the country in order to receive the prizes, but was denied the permit.
Detention of an American supplier may be the result of rising tensions between the Communist Castro's brother, ruling in Cuba, and the Obama administration, which was watched as a "restraint tactic" in improving relations with the island.
They were first reported on the imprisonment of the New York Times on Friday night.
The new American policy has stressed that if the Cuban government takes concrete steps, such as the release of political prisoners and creates more space for the opposition, the United States will take reciprocal action.
Cell phone phones and laptops are allowed in Cuba, though they are new and sought-after commodities in a country where the average wage for a public servant is $15 a month.
The Cuban government has granted ordinary citizens the right to buy mobile phones this year; these are used mostly by text-mailing the mother, because a 15-minute phone call would cost more than one day's wages.
The use of the island's internet is extremely limited.
It is available in expensive hotels and for their foreign visitors and on some government connections, such as universities.
Cubans, who often want to sign up, have to announce their names to the government.
Access to many websites is forbidden.
Detention of an American in Cuba is rare.
Most of the handful of U.S. citizens in a prison in Cuba are behind bars for stressed crimes such as drug smuggling, Gloria Berben, the U.S. Section for Interests in Havana.
Mrs Berben said she could not provide more information about the prison.
The in-releceptment and detention were clearly amoral.
Such activities that would be legal in any other open society - say, free mobile phones - are a criminal offence in Cuba, said Miguel Vivanco, director of the U.S. Human Rights Group Program, which recently published an unfavorable report on freedoms in Cuba, called "New Castro, the same Cuba," as a reference to the installation of Raulo Castro as the country's leader and a replacement for the austeens older brother Fidel.
Vivanco said the defendants were often arrested, tried and imprisoned in one day.
He said that all solutions would be more political, and that the Cuban government often provokes a negative reaction in the United States, just as the two countries are moving towards a more extensive dialogue.
Pakistan's civil servants are uncovering a conspiracy to send men to Afghanistan.
Pakistani authorities on Saturday uncovered the alleged leader of a conspiracy regarding the deployment of five men from northern Virginia to Afghanistan to kill members of U.S. troops there, saying they hoped the case might help to uncover an extensive network of terrorist recruiting online recruited and seeking out radicalized young men.
Investigators said they were searching for a grey rebel figure, known as Saifullah, who invited these men to Pakistan after first discovering them when one of these men posted a comment approving of the terric attacks by a YouTube online video player.
Saifillah took the lead on these men, as soon as they came to Pakistan, he tried to help them reach the remote region of Pakistan in the zone of the indigenous tribes of Pakistan, which is home to al-Qaida and its terrorist training camps.
But a Pakistani intelligence official who reported the case said Saturday that Saifull had been unsuccessful in convicting al-Qaida commanders and that the men were not part of the CIA's infiltration attempt to infiltrate the terrorist network.
As a result, they were dropped for several days into the eastern district of Sarghoda, far from the menacing mountains in the northwest that had become a refuge for the terrorists.
They were considered a strike force.
Why they were dropped, said the official, who spoke of maintaining anonymity due to the sensitivity of the case.
The official said the men were not intimidated and were still trying to get approval to gain access to the al-Qaida camps when they were arrested for exercising the Pakistani law.
The case of this five - who remained in Pakistan and was questioned by the FBI - emphasises the critical role of recruits in identifying potential terrorists, and perhaps, more importantly, to determine who is trustworthy.
Since the attacks on September 11, 2001, the US intelligence service has assigned the top priority to attempts to place human resources in al-Qaida.
The organization's recruiters act as guards, eliminating those who are not serious enough in their commitment to holy war and those who might be the Sic-catchers.
American false recruits have been subjected to a special examination in al-Qaida, analysts said.
But they were also considered extremely interesting in the group because, given their potential approach to American objectives and their promotional value.
But Evan Kohlmann, an older analyst at the NEFA Foundation based in the US, said that terrorist groups have also become considerably more cautious in recent years, allowing the kohu to accede to them because US intelligence agencies have recruited experts in their recruitment methods.
If we are trying to break into these groups, is there no better way than to follow their recruitment model, which has been so tracked? said Mr Kohlmann.
This model is one of those that is much more based on the web.
Tens of thousands protested in Copenhagen, demanding climate 'action'
Tens of thousands of protesters marched through the streets this Saturday, demanding stronger climate action from negotiators at the Bella City Convention Center.
The protesters reported the number of many hundreds of thousands of participants in the event, but police are scolding that the number was closer to 25,000.
The event was relatively quiet, and a handful of masked activists laid several small charges near a group of government buildings in the center of the city.
The day a minor incident occurred in climate talks sponsored by the UN, thousands of activists passed through the city, carrying banners with English inscriptions "This is not Planet B" (i.e. secondary) and one in Spanish who proclaimed "Zema says 'encry'."
The protest was attended by several celebrities, including Danish model and photographer Helena Christensen, who said she had traveled to her mother's birthplace in Peru and provided me with information about the country's dashing state, which is involved in the impact of climate change that is still happening.
This is a partial reason why we have decided to join this great march -- to go through the world and appeal to the world's leaders to present a fair, ambitious, and binding agreement, she said.
It is not an easy task, but it must be done, it cannot be avoided all the time.
Police prevented the protesters from approaching the Bella Center and said they had detained 19 people, in the first place because they had either wearing masks or carrying pocket knives.
These activities are prohibited under Danish law during the demonstrations.
According to one of the uninvolved viewers, who does not wish to be identified because he is involved in climate horns, activists camouflaged as athletes and in black suits have laid several charges in the report of Copenhagen's main channel, located near several ministries.
They agitated at the buildings, he said, opening with flares, but followed by "several major explosions."
Inside the convention center, people gathered around the TV screens to watch the march through the afternoon.
But the protest probably did not penetrate the consciousness of key officials, such as Su Weie, China's chief climate negotiator.
When asked if the demonstration nevertheless had a constructive impact on international negotiations, he replied in English "Actually, that is something that I was not aware of" (it is really something I am not aware of).
Then he went on to Chinese and said "Because the scene is extensive, I can't hear what's going on out there."
He watched to see if the march had been painful or helpful depending on everyone's prospects.
You can see the focus of the general public and various sectors and the subject of climate change, he said.
In other words: "It can also be said that this is a violation of the actions or the freedom of others.
Test data revealed constant persistent racial differences
Last week's federal certificate of maths knowledge achieved was a welcome element of the Columbia County's good education reports.
Although the precinct lags far behind the country's high-performance systems, the certificate has shown greater progress for fourth and eighth-grade students in the last two years than in cities including Atlanta, Chicago, and New York City.
But what remains hidden behind the latest numbers of the National Attestation Centre for Advancing in the Schooling Are the persistent differences in the knowledge made between African-Americans and white students, both locally and nationally.
The average result of the fourth-grade white Columbia district pupils in the past two years increased from 267 to 270 points (from a possible 500), but for their African-American peers there was only three growth, from 209 to 212.
Indeed, the difference in knowledge achieved increased from 53 to 57 points between 2007 and 2009.
Progress for the eighth-grade African-Americans remains essentially even, with a move by a statistically insignificant one point from 245 to 245.
The average result for white pupils was not included in the test results as the sample size was not large enough.
The picture over the horizon of six years is not exactly encouraging.
The difference between the fourth-grade white and black pupils in 2003, when the first NAEP in the precinct was carried out, was 60 points in the scale (262 to 202).
Although the result achieved in children from the two-chroupes improved during this period, the difference was barely close to 58.
Some of the district's education advocates have commented in the last week that the results, hailed by secretary Michelle A. Rhee and Mayor Adrian M. Fenty (D), had been more widely stimulated in white students where the results were already high.
That would suggest that we have increased the total support for those at the higher end of the scale, which is problematic and worrying, said Jeff Smith, managing director of D.C. Voice, a non-profit group advocating the eachs of graduation.
I will not be joming up and down for a dispersion of two or three points, said committee member D.C. Kwame R. Brown (D-At Large), who has a daughter in the fourth grade of Eaton Primary School.
Often criticising the Rhee administration style, Ms Brown said that reporting on the test results means secondary education in the city is in a state of desperation and requires attention.
It's obvious you always want to see the pros, and I respect that.
But what is the awe-in-the-morit that we paid almost no time and energy that was needed to devote to our secondary education.
Mrs Rhee said the district's attempt was to continue looking for better ways, targeting the needs of low-fear students.
Thus, for example, some teachers are trained in the use of the new curriculum, the Wilson Reading System, aimed at upper-class students in primary schools and high school students who have failed to master the basics of reading previously lagging significantly behind their peers in their round-level careers.
The daily mathematics and curriculum of the sixth grade mathematics teaching, highlighting the games and experience of real life, which reached the precinct under former director Clifford Janeyi, can be credited to the progress of the NAEP, which was reported last week.
And I think we should just continue to work and make the best possible interventions for those students who remain below the level of the classroom, said Mrs Rhee.
Others said the NAEP results clarified the question of whether Mrs Rhee could continue to swapped the overall performance of the system and still provide additional money and funds for low-performance schools, which is necessary to reduce the difference.
It is a certain outspoken dilemma of Mrs. Michell Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, a teaching professor at the University of California, Berkeley, where he studies the results of the city's tests.
The conventional correction procedure is to focus the means and administrative reforms on the schools, located in the worst parts of the Columbia district.
Thus, the focus can bring political repercussions that are directed against an important agenda.
But the rebuke also belongs to other city directors who try to maintain the central pro-way between the whites and the black.
We need to focus on building a system of big schools.
We must make the affinity of our schools so that all families, no matter where they live, can be relied upon to be given excellent public training to their children.
Mr. Janey, now the headmaster of schools in Newark, said in an interview earlier this week that the basic element of reducing the difference between the results achieved is the extension of the traditional public school year, currently 180 days in the precinct, to take place the legitimacy of the schools.
You must get up to 200 days to push through the changes, said Mr. Janey, who signed a contract with his teacher association last year for a school year of 185 days, which he considers a "sign" to seek a bigger increase next year.
Make higher education part of a better future
The on-clauses entered Gettysburg College with a loud hinged.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12, got out and rested for a moment on white columns, brick facades and emerald green lawns.
Graciel's parents made a hard-line graduate from college in El Salvador.
So far, Graciela herself, who was born in Silver Spring and lived in Riverdale, never entered the grounds of the college.
Now she and other eighth grade pupils in the group were exploring Gettysburg, where tuition was $38,690 a year, their position being more enthusiastic potential students than fearful visitors.
Yes! That's it! exclaimed Graciela, who would like to study medicine when the guide offered them to enter the knowledge building.
Wow, really? she said thoughtfully when they were told by the low-student professor's ratio to the students.
The Pennsylvania College was one of seven they visited on their three-day tour and were now completely intrigued by the future news: The question is not whether you enter the college.
The question is from where.
However, this is a bearing issue with regard to the high number of children born in the US of Spanish immigrant children who are excluded from universities or become pregnant as minors, but there are hundreds of thousands of those who receive a college education and thus enter the middle class.
In fact, a fifth of this "dupe generation" of the Spanish college pupils - the remarkable results achieved indicate that many of their immigrant parents, mostly Mexicans and Central American residents, reached the United States without finishing college.
Their story of success is important, researchers say, as this underlines their point of the way forward for the generation that played a marginal role in the country's workforce.
Those who have achieved a university degree say they had a natural leaning of the school and innate with the congenital push-up and the pursuit of success.
Many also had parents who set high goals for their children and looked for ways to replace the ignorance of American education.
But school programs also play an extraordinary role in helping Graciele and the millions of children who would like to take the college - especially if these efforts persisted over in time.
Considering that I come from low-income groups whose parents do not have the experience and ability to help them orly to be able to do so in the system, any simple intervention at each individual point will not be solved, says Patricia Gándara, a researcher at the University of California, Davis, where she studied students from the Latin American field.
We need to think about providing these children with a preschool-age traitor network in every way to get into college.
The federal program that funded the Graciela tour on the tracks is a useful example.
Known as the GEAR UP (inquitate), it provides more than $300 million a year for local school systems to launch the college preparatory programmes that start with students from low-income groups in high schools and continue until these students end up college.
Since 1999, the program has served more than 10 million students, more than% of whom entered the colleges, according to US Department of Education.
Iraqi oil Ministry reached agreement with 10 foreign oil companies
Regardless of concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi government has succeeded in getting major oil companies to redevelop their infrehectural infrastructure during the two auctions that took place on Saturday.
Ten agreements were concluded by the Iraqi Oil Industry Ministry with foreign oil companies, suggesting that Chinese, Russian and European oil companies are prepared to play a major role in rebuilding the Iraqi oil industry, crippled by decades of war and sanctions.
American companies left with a shareholding to just two of the 10 auctioned fields.
Seven U.S. companies paid for participating in the second auction, which began on Friday.
Only one made the lost offer.
Two U.S. companies reached agreements for a field auctioned in June.
The hinged participation of the US oil giants in the open Iraqi oil industry has surprised analysts.
Iraq has finally opened the door after six years of war, and instead of American companies, you have Asian and Europeans on the road in the first place, said Ruba Husari, editor of the Iraq Oil Forum, online news.
That will be long before something else is for sale in Iraq.
Concerns about security, highlighted by massive coordinated bombings on Tuesday and political instability, as well as the withdrawal of the US military, are likely to discourage American companies from doing much more intensive business in Iraq, which has demonstrably the third largest raw material reserves, say analysts.
American firms have been at a disadvantage in some cases, especially Chinese and other government-controlled energy firms, with noticeably lower operating costs and are more prone to taking risks because they are not accountable to shareholders.
Exxon Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only U.S. companies to enter into agreements with the department.
Leading American companies, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which maintained close contacts with the Iraqi Oil Industry Ministry and offered technical assistance in the past years, left empty-handed.
Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were top shareholders in two of the contracts awarded at the end of this week.
The state-owned Chinese National Petroleum Corp. participated in the offerings for more contracts than all other companies and left with large stakes in contracts for the two main fields.
We all know that China is striving to become a major economic, as well as a technological force, said the spokesman for the Ministry of Petroleum Industry, Assam Jihad.
We believe that Chinese society will be comparable to the competition and honour its commitments to Iraq.
Companies that were preliminarily selected for bids, which were then compared by the Ministry according to the price per barrel and the Ministry is willing to pay to strengthen the output above the current levels in each field.
The top-fangd al-Qaida planner was apparently killed in Pakistan.
The impact of a U.S. missile at the border between Pakistan and Afghanistan this week appears to have been killed by al-Qaida's top-of-the-range planner, as reported Friday by U.S. counterterrorism officials.
As confirmed, this could be the second fatal attack on one of the highest terrorist leaders.
Saleh al-Somali was one of two Arabs who were killed when several rockets hit their car in a quarter of a car near the city of Miran Śáh in Sevverní Vaziristan province, according to U.S. sources and pact officials in the area.
Local authorities have swung the missiles that the missiles were fired from the unmanned aircraft operated by the CIA in the IUU zone of the illegal indigenous tribes.
These were directed at a white car that was heading towards the Afghan border when it was hit, the official, along with the Pakistani cicilitary intelligence agency on the phone from Miran Shah, said.
The official said the local militants had come to the point and quickly confiscate what was left of the "totally destroyed bodies."
Local authorities were unable to verify the identities of the victims, but two US counterterrorism officials cited an unspecified witness who said that Somali had been dead.
Somali was cited as a high-ranking planner for al-Qaida military operations, who directed the operations of terrorist groups outside the Afghanistan and Pakististan regions.
He was involved in the hooting around the world, said a senior official who did not wish to be named, who stated the sensitive nature of the US airstrikes in the territory of Pakistan.
If he held such a central position, he was probably involved in attacks against the United States and Europe.
He received instructions from the senior leadership of Al-Qaeda and on the basis of them planned possible terrorist attacks.
Another US official said that Somali had advanced rapidly in the al-Qaida hierarchy and was well linked to other extremist groups in the region.
He may not have been a well-known person to some Americans, but that he did not humiliate himself in any way to pose before us and our allies, another official said.
When his death was confirmed, Somali should be the second high-ranking leader of al-Qaida or the Taliban who should be killed from September when Najmudin Jalolov, leader of the militant faction in the indigenous tribs' zone and three other top pomeative leaders, were killed in a similar attack.
The pace of attacks launched by the CIA with drones has been reduced since the summer from an average of approximately six operations per month to two, according to Long War's records, a website managed by a nonprofit group.
The reduction may have a reason in the improved tactics of terrorist groups that have taken steps to reduce their vulnerability by also ruthlessly killing those suspected of being informers, the page said.
The summit delegate of the United Nations in Kabul resigned.
The top delegate of the United Nations in Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said on Friday that he would like to resign from his post in March, ending a tumultuous term that was marred by accusations of widespread corruption in the election of a president in Afghanistan, supported by the UN.
Eide's departure is happening because the Obama administration has decided to send an additional 1,300 U.S. troops to Afghanistan.
The UN delegate said it supported the increase, but expressed concern that the US timetable for a reduction in order to begin in 18 months should be a call for other NATO governments to withdraw its forces.
We need to accelerate the building of the Afghan security forces and send the right signal to the Afghans that they should have confidence in the international community, Eide said in a telephone interview from Kabul.
The commitment made must be a long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also pushed the United States and other military forces to increase the number of international civilian staff to help with the political transformation of Afghanistan.
The increase on the side of the armed forces must be copied on the part of the civilians, he said.
Eide said he would not resign, but that he was simply fulfilling the promise he made to his family in March 2008 that he would spend only two years in Kabul.
He said he wanted to report to the UN.
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has now said he would need time to find a replacement.
As I said, it's time to look for the heir, Eide said.
When I came here, there was a two-month-on-month vacuum between the departure of my predecessor and my arrival.
According to UN officials Ban began seeking a replacement.
Officials said the decision was made between Staffan di Mistura, who is of Swedish-Italian origin and previously led the UN mission in Baghdad, and Jean-Maria Guéhenn, the Frenchman who had previously conducted the UN peacekeeping operation.
Eide's position in Afghanistan was tested after his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, who was indicted in September by President Hamid Karzai, who won the provincial presidential election for masking the presence of massive electoral machinations.
Eide denied these allegations, but said that the accusations made Galgraith -- who had been released -- "certainly damaged the mission because there was a high degree of scepticism with regard to international intervention" in the election.
Eide said he had proposed a meeting with the top citizen representative to coordinate lightening efforts at the US Force leadership in Afghanistan.
He also urged the UN leadership to allow his successor to hire more staff from the United States and other Western countries to lend them for the Afghan mission, so he said he wanted to strengthen their confidence that their money was used properly.
Eide expressed disappointment at the limitations of his efforts in Afghanistan and said that the cumbersome UN regulations on hiring undermine its ability to harness.
The UN rules are that I have only had the opportunity to recruit one person since May, he said.
This is a disaster and I cannot go on.
Gates: Iran faces further sanctions
Defense Minister Robert M. Gates said Friday that the world's powers will soon impose "further significant sanctions" on Iran because of a lack of engagement in talks on his nuclear ambitions.
Gates, who spoke to a group of about 300 U.S. troops in northern Iraq during a week-long trip to the areas where the war is being fought in Afghanistan and Iraq, downplayed the prospect of armed action against the Islamic Republic.
This is not a good choice for Iran, he said in response to the soldier's inquiry into the likely development."
One of the things that depends on me is whether I have learned anything from Iraq in the last six years, [that] is the inherent unpredictability in the war.
The Obama administration is deciding on a package of sanctions that could hit Iran's military and political elite, but Gates has signalled that some of these sanctions could also affect ordinary Iraniakers.
He said that a "package of incentives and inhibitions" would require "to get the Iranian government to actually feel less safe with nuclear weapons" because "its residents will suffer extraordinarily" sanctions.
In an opinion on Friday issued by White House spokesman Robert Gibbs, the administration has involved European leaders in a warning that Iran will bear serious consequences unless it brings its nuclear program into full compliance with the United Nations Nuclear Safety Committee and its Supervisory Authority, the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Iran insists that it wants to develop its expertise only for peaceful purposes.
In talks in Geneva on 1 October, he hinted that he wanted to return to talks on the curtailment of his nuclear program and agreed to provide a substantial portion of his uranium-enriched stockpile in exchange for urgently needed fuel for the reactor to conduct medical research.
The administration has pushed for such an agreement as a way of establishing trust between the two parties and to give it time for negotiations.
But since then, it seems, Iran is stepping down from the interim agreements - partly because the expert says, because the Iraqi leadership is divided into views on whether to engage with the United States.
Frankly, as regards Iran's stubbornness towards the international community in the case of some of the proposals it actually agreed to at the beginning of October, I think it brought in the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese, together on a path that is not about the terminology of additional sanctions against the Iranians, Gates said.
President Obama set a deadline for Iran on December 31 to respond to the proposals before returning to the search for other elections, including surveillance, as Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton once called "degrading sanctions."
In an opinion issued in New York, the Iranian mission to the United Nations condemned on Thursday what it called "unfounded and unsubstantiated accusations" to some members of the Security Committee on Iran's nuclear activities, stating that it wanted to continue talks with the United States and the five other world powers "in order to reach a proportionate long-term solution.
Gates, who returned to Washington last Friday, met with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki in the morning before flying to the Kurdistan region, oil-rich, to meet with troops in Kirkuk and Kurdish officials in Irbil.
High tensions remain between the Kurds and the Iraqi Arab majority, mainly because of borders, ownership rights and income distribution.
The Gtes urged both sides to reduce the potentials for the conflicts to prevent US plans from limiting the number of US troops from 115,000 to 10,000 by the end of August.
Gates also sought to dampen Kurdish concern about the lingering depression. The U.S. official posts were quoted by Gates when he told Massouda Barzai, the president of the Kurdistan regional government: "We want to protect your security, prosperity and autonomy in a united Iraq.
We don't want to leave you."
In an ageing China, a change of course
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters reading that "Mother of the Earth is too exhausted to support more children" and "One extra child means one extra grave."
Then they were given a lesson that when the official government posts in Shanghai, alarmed by the low birth rate and ageing population in their city, they suddenly changed course this summer and began to encourage young couples, their response was immediate and determined: Never.
We have always devoted all of our time and energy to just one child.
We didn't leave anything for others, says Wang, 31, the human resources administrator who has an 8-month-old son.
China's more than 30-year-old policy of having only one child has been introduced, creating two generations of only notorious-chubby and pampered children, the affected "little emperors," the country's population crisis is threatened by the country.
The average birth rate dropped to 1.8 children per pair compared to six before the vpolitika came into effect, according to UN figures.
The breakdown of the population, where the population at the age of 60 and above is predicted to grow boorily from 16.7 percent of the population in 2020 to 31.1 percent in 2050. This is far above the overall average of around 20 percent.
The imbalance is of larger, wealthy coastal cities with a higher education population, such as Shanghai.
Last year, people aged 60 and above accounted for nearly 22 percent of Shanghai-registered residents, while the birth rate was less than one child per pair.
Xie Lingli, director of the Shanghai Municipal Commission on Population and Family Planning, said many couples must have children to "help the proportions of an ageing population and a reduction in the manpower's numbers in the future."
He says it's about "to be old, that doesn't mean being rich -- like in developed countries like Japan or Sweden."
Gradual soothing
As it was put into the country's constitution in 1978, China's one-child policy is probably the most controversial mandate to date, established under the Communist Party.
The pair that violated the policy, faced immense fines -- up to three times their annual salary in some areas -- and discrimination at work.
China's official posts championed policies that helped the country prevent critical drawdown of natural resources, while human rights advocates were condemned to promote policy.
In rural areas, some officials forced pregnant women to undergo abortion at the second child.
Moreover, many couples had to undergo sexist selective abortion, leading to an unnaturally high proportion of men to women.
In the past years, population officials have been gradually more lenient in their opinion on the one-child policy.
As a rule, in 2004, they allowed a oedema of exemptions - including city dwellers, members of national minorities, and cases where a man and a woman were children's onlysis -- and in 2007 they relaxed the diction of their hardline-for-line slogans.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the University of Beijing's Population Research Institute, said central government officials had previously debated more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children if one of the partners was an only child.
In June, Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to incite more births.
Almost overnight, the posters, urging the parents to have only one child, were replaced by copies of the regulation, detailing how it would be justified to have a second child and how to apply for a permit.
The city administration sent officials to plan families and volunteers to meet couples in their houses and to dine the leaflets under the door.
They also promised to provide emotional and financial advice for those who chose to have more than one child.
The response was cold, family planning officials said.
A pricning response
Even though officials in a rural city around Shanghai have seen an increase in interest among couples who would like to have a second child after the campaign launch, most of the city's districts did not report changes.
The city's Huinan district with a population of 115,000, for example, still registered four to five cases per month.
Disappointed officials in Shanghai said that despite the campaign, the number of the city born in 2010 is still expected to be only around 165,000 - slightly higher than in 2009, but lower than in 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the family planning committee at the Shanghai Quarter-Fola, said that financial considerations were probably the main reason why people did not want to have more children.
They want to provide the best for the first child, he said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said she would like to have two children and have been legally allowed to do so.
But like many Chinese, who have only inadequate health and life insurance provided by the government.
Without a docile interception network, the choice could be irresponsible.
People in the west are judging the one-child policy wrongly as a contentious legal issue, says Yang, a civil engineer whose wife is in a union with her first child at the seventh month of pregnancy.
Yes, we were deprived of the chance to have more than one child.
But the problem is not just about politics.
It's about the money.
Other couples cite psychological reasons for hesitation.
Wang, the human resources administrator, says that only one child wants, because she was also an only child: "We were the focus of our families' attention and we were all cared for.
We were not used to provide care and we didn't really want to take care of others.
Chen Zijian, 42, who put it in the translator's in-golden company, made it much more open.
For two-chairsian parents who have lowered the birth rate, he said, to be successful is to be selfish.
Today's 20 and 30-year-olds, growing up, view parents as part of the first days of the Chinese experiment with capitalism and they don't want this kind of living for themselves, he says.
It is one child who places enormous demands on the time of the parents, he says.
A mother must sacrifice at least two years of her social life.
Then there are the contentious issues of the propro-fare -- "You have to rebuild your apartment" -- and the strategy -- "You must have a resume ready at a time when the child is 9 months for a good preschool.
Most of his friends want to settle for one child, says Che, but not with two.
We are the first generation with higher living standards, he says.
We do not want to bring too many sacrifices.
The UN Group outlined a plan to reduce emissions.
The United Nations-sponsored climate conference -- characterized by far-relived unruly attitudes and reclamations -- reiterated Friday on the release of a document that proposes an ambitious reduction in the amount of greenhouse gas in the next 40 years with industrialized nations bearing most of the burden at the earliest deadline.
The text, which can provide a basis for a final political agreement on the regulation of greenhouse gases, highlights the remaining obstacles as well as illuminating the way forward.
But you could see important progress in the negotiations that took place at the wrong time with the world's more than 100 world leaders who come to Copenhagen next week.
Created by the UN working group on an ad hoc basis, this text subtly states how much money rich countries should provide to the poor to deal with global warming in the short and long term.
And it provides an entire range of choices for key issues, including how to develop and manage incoming economies so that they can limit their carbon output and what the upper limit should be to increase global temperature, which policy officials will still be able to tolerate.
This adds a great deal of flexibility to the process, says John Coequyt, chief executive of the Washington club Sierra.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who proposed a six-page document, described the condensation from the 180 pages of the text from the meeting to focus on what a top official on the UN climate issues, Yvo de Boer, described as a "great picture."
It outlines a possible agreement in which industrial nations could jointly limit their emissions to 25 to 45 percent by the year compared to 1990 levels, while major developing countries could reduce their emissions to between 15 and 30 percent during this period.
Together, the country would reduce emissions by 2050 to between 50 and 95 percent.
The European Union discussed urgently on Friday the promise to provide $3.6 trillion over the next three years to help poorer countries accept climate change adaptation -- from managing floods and droughts to avoiding deforestation.
But he still gave Friday the same kind of verbal fireworks that prevailed in last week's interviews.
US Special Ambassador for Climate Affairs Todd Stern rejected the speech, calling for a binding reduction in greenhouse gas emissions for industrialised countries compared to volunteering among the major emerging economies, unless they were funded by the developed world.
The shift signaled that the Obama administration had established a tougher line against China by Bush administration officials just two years ago.
The United States will not agree to a treaty without the transfer of major developing countries and implementing the actions, Stern said, also complaining that the text was not sufficient to secure the restrictions and should be vetted by external observers.
Stern made this comment an hour after Chinese Deputy Secretary of State He Yafei told the US chief climate negotiator that either the lack of "common sense" or "extremely irresponsibility" had led earlier in the week to say that the United States would not help China financially to deal with global warming.
With the economic path of the world's major powers at stake, the wrangling has erupted both within the developing world and between the industrial world and emerging economies.
The current struggle is mostly about preserving individual economies rather than preserving the planet, between China and the United States, to meet their respective commitments, while the poorer nations point out that the world's two dozen of the most influential countries ignore the scientific imperative of implementing more forceful actions.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate to Costa Rica, said it was not surprising that the major powers were fighting to see who should bear the cost of curbing greenhouse gases, while vulnerable countries have become much more aggressive in finding the way to prevent the big issuers from taking responsibility in their actions.
It is clearly a game about the new economic hegemony being developed, said Ulate, which also serves as a regional advisor on regional climate change in Mexico and Central America for international conservation.
Some of the countries most vulnerable to climate change have indicated that they would like to continue to enforce a legally binding agreement in Copenhagen, but most of the main participants said that the best outcome of the talks would be a political agreement.
The alliance of small island states, which has 43 members, created a 24-page draft agreement last Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, who has conducted international climate negotiations for the European Commission, said that the promotion by small island nations "to have summoned the political tumbling out of the entire field-hit process" partly because they are now united and demanding actions from growing economies such as China and India.
The hearing raised new urgency as soon as the delegates focused on the fact that they had to resolve most of the remaining issues of contention before the heads of government competed for the agreement.
High-ranking officials, such as India's Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh and China's Deputy Minister, with the aircraft, took the halls of the Bella Center to the closed doors of the meeting and the new conferences so they could set out the demands that would be assessed next week.
The sheer scale of the rally - with 13,000 people moving from and to the convention center on a daily basis, guitarists playing campaigners staged at night an ironic spectacle of countries they thought had been sent to, and there was a hand-to-hand hand-hand bear on a paper rather than an electronic post -- controlled by a challenge.
The intensity is only a superstructure: almost all key ministers were present in Copenhagen and earlier on Wednesday 60 heads of state.
We have come into high categories, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, said the Deputy Minister for Global Policy at International Conservation.
Heavyweights are coming.
Britain's first train with a speed of 140 miles per hour redefined feelings this Monday
at 5:13 a.m. on Monday morning, the whistle cut through the darkness to mark the departure of the train, which revolutionised the transport in Britain.
The country's first high-speed passenger train will reach speeds of 140 miles per hour and pass from Ashford, Kent, to London's St Pancras, covering a distance of 58 miles in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, the Secretary of the Transportation Minister, then joined Mrs Kelly Holmes and boarded the first high-speed passenger train outside of the LLndýn.
It hopes that the new service will possibly link Britain to an international network of fast, reliable trains and connect the great agglomerations of Midland, the north and the Scottish with London.
The upright standing water should be reduced by traffic times in passenger transport and on business trips, and the transition from airplanes and cars to the rail could reduce carbon emissions and eliminate congestion on the roads.
In theory, the three major political parties were given a win-ring for this vision.
But the tens of pounds required to build a new national rail network, the inevitable fight for projects and concerns about environmental disruption have now hampered the construction of British high-speed lines.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company created in January to provide a feasible study to the government, forwarded its report to Lord Adonis on December 30, as the Times reported.
It provided a detailed map of the routes of the next planned high-speed network stage.
London's new route to West Midland was designed to reach five metres in urban areas and neighbourhoods, where it could be problematic to reach the life centre.
In the open countryside, the final route was scheduled to reach the 25 m.
HS2 also envisages setting out three options for a large-scale high-speed network heading north.
Lord Adonis will answer in the spring.
The preferred choice is the confination of the shape of the letter Y, with one high-speed line to the western Midland.
The line should be shared near Birmingham with one branch, passing from Pennines to Manchester and Scotland and the other, leading to the northeast to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle over Tyne.
One track should lead to Scotland.
"It looks like the most powerful choice has taken place," he said, and the railway expert said.
As soon as it's done, the journey times between London and Edinburgh will be reduced to two hours and 40 minutes.
The first stage, which will not be open before 2025, could allow passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes compared to more than one o'clock in the present.
The proposals should allow trains to run at 2250 miles per hour, making the UK network the fastest in Europe.
The initial line is already proposed to hijack trains of 400 m , which would be able to carry 1100 people.
Up to 18 trains could operate every hour on the London-Bermingham line.
It means that the London Terminal would be able to serve up to 20,000 passengers per hour if needed.
In view of the capital constraints, it is assumed that the existing station would be expanded to include a high-speed network.
Experts from the rail industry claim that only San Pancras International or Euston offer such potential.
Lord Adonis will announce whether or not he means to implement this scheme, but extensive public consultations and planning procedures mean that the ketch will not make the final decision before the general election.
Even if it moves the wheels, the net should be built in parts.
Train should first be put into service not on high-speed lines, but already existing lines north of Birmingham, and keeping journey times between London and Scotland over three hours.
This is seen as the decisive point of contact to ensure the transition from aircraft to trains, a landmark for the revolution on the railway.
Taxpayers have paid a £75,000 mortgage on the Tory Orangery
Alan Duncan, the holder of the Tory's front-seat seat in the House of Commons, was paid by the taxpayers thousands of pounds of the cost of the Orangery he had built at his home in the constituency.
The party's spokesman for the prison, which was demoted by David Cameron for complaining that MPs lived "in rationing," increased his mortgage to £5,75,000 to build an oak-paneed expansion in his second home in Rutland.
He was allowed to charge a special interest, a total of hundreds of pounds per month to the taxpayer.
The municipal authorities approved the claims in time and so he was not questioned by the Siescor Thomas Legg who inspected the member expenses. Last night, Mr. Duncan made his demands "mightily to be cleaner or easier."
Mr. Duncan, one of the richest members of parliament, owns two two-storey houses in the village in his Rutland and Melton constituencies.
The houses are worth approximately £1 million.
There is a kitchen, a living room and a dining room on the ground floor, but the IRS has agreed that Mr. Duncan needs more space.
Last year he added a conservatory to the house, which is labeled "orange" in the plans.
Neighbors describe it as "gadgets for fun and treat."
Mr Duncan was not asked to provide any explanation for the increased loan during the last check by the Municipal Standards and Privorizons Committee in the last mortgage settlement.
The committee told him last month that it had broken the rules, after reviewing his expenses.
In 2004, Mr Duncan changed the pupil security to a mortgage of £271406 of his estate in London to a house in his constituency, which he bought in 1991, a year before he became a member of the House of Commons.
Documents released this week showed that Mr Duncan claimed around £1,400 a month in the interest of the mortgage until March last year.
In April, his demands increased to more than £1,800 per month.
Mr Duncan's RBS mortgage interest could not have been changed at this time, suggesting that it was all for the financing of the £75,000 loan.
The standard RBS mortgage repayment variable declined from 7.94 percent to 4 percent in March of this year in December 2007, which it did.
The latest document by the municipal authorities shows that Mr Duncan continued to claim £1,250 a month in May this year.
Mr. Duncan left his job as the shadowman of the House in September after a secret informodine filmed it and said that MPs must survive "admotry" after the spending scandal.
"In principle, it's nationalized, you have to be rationed and treated like a s**t."
He said, "I've spent the money for my garden and my claim and a small fraction on what was needed.
And I could claim the whole damn share, but I won't."
The MP, a millionaire from his former career as an oil trader, was first asked to explain his extradition in May when it became apparent that he had claimed thousands of pounds for his garden, before the IRS was approved, that it "may be considered excessive."
One activist dug a pit in the shape of a pound emblem in Mr. Duncan's lawn in protest after it was revealed that he had claimed £4,000 for three years.
When he was asked last night about the mortgage increase, Mr. Duncan said, "It was because of the capital increase, which was approved by both the IRS and subsequently by Legg."
He added: "This is not a contentious issue of hiding and zigzagging or breaking the rules or something else.
It's an absolutely straight downline line, by the rules, justified and that's all.
This would not be a way of being cleaner or simpler in many other ways.
Come and see the cottage on the brighton coast with the Advent calendar.
Coastal cottages in Brighton found a new meaning of life in the interactive advental calendarial months.
Beyond, an alternative church group that inspires ducal activities with creativity, 24 owners have called on the owners to decorate their cottages for each day in December, and to use the Christmas rounds as the theme of this decoration.
The event began on 1 December, when it allowed visitors to see the last cottage from 5:30 p.m. to 6:30 p.m. every day, and with a biscuit's sandwich and mulled wine, provided free of charge.
The selected carols included I Saw Three Ships, O Come, O Come, Emmanuel and The First Noël, when the cottage featured the work of Janetty Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50, an assistant in television marketing at Hove, is a priest without a scholarship to the Diocese of Chicster and head of Beyon.
He said: "We want to make religion much more important for the people of post-Christian society.
"Why are we, as a church, expected to come to an ancient building in an alien? I have a feeling that the church should come to the people and serve in a wake-east way.
"The advent calendar in the cottages originated as a conversation with some friends during dinner.
Brighton is such a fantastically creative and vibrant place, and we've tried to try and present it to the spiritual path."
Strong mobilisation in Copenhagen and the world against climate change.
Tens of thousands of people took to the streets on Saturday demanding a strong and binding agreement to combat global warming, which should be adopted at a conference in Copenhagen, demonstrated worldwide and in Copenhagen, where hundreds of people were arrested by police on the occasion.
At least 30,000 people, according to police sources and 100,000, according to organizers, rallied in cold weather in the Danish capital on the occasion of the United Nations climate conference to adopt an agreement to come into force on 1 January 2013, according to the organisers.
Connie Hedegaard, the Danish president of the climate climate conference, said that the growing global mobilization, the clear evidence of which is the current rallies, has contributed to the "political tax" of any failure in Copenhagen being too high.
According to an AFP journalist, incidents occurred in the Danish capital shortly after the parade began, with a group of about 300 or so protesters dressed in black starting to unraveled the windows with cobblestones and hammers.
The Rire police immediately intervened emphatically.
In total, police announced the arrest of between 600 and 700 people and clarified that they were mainly members of the "Blacks Blocks," ultra-aradical separate groups that had already been manifested in April at the NATO summit in Strasbourg in eastern France.
The Climate Justice Action (CJA) coalition, one of the organizers of the event, condemned the conditions under which hundreds of radicals were arrested "without the difference" and stressed that about a hundred of them were in handcuffs and sitting in the streets on Saturday night ", despite the extreme winter.
After leaving Parliament, the procession calmly made its way to the Bella Center, where the negotiations were taking place.
The demonstrators stopped about 500 metres from the building without trying to penetrate.
A podium was built for the speakers, before which a cleric candlelit meeting took place with the participation of the former South African Archbishop of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu.
Most of the protesters arrived by bus and train from major European cities, and in addition to the Africans, there were a large number of participants from Asia, including several Chinese and Koreans.
Nearly 3,000 people, dressed mostly in blue cape, formed their first rallies in the morning in Copenhagen at the call of the Friends of the Earth group, which wanted to create "blue waves" as a "fair climate."
Today we are taking to the streets to demand a green debt settlement in favour of the south, explained Lidy Nacpil, the Philippine fighter at the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We can't say to each other anymore: it's time for that, Benin singer Angelique Kidjo said.
In Africa, rivers and water flows are drying up, we can walk in them today and that was never possible before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, which was born in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the movement to fight for another world approached environmental organizations.
French MEP Jose Bová, one of the figures in the fight for another world, said he had come to Copenhagen to "connect climate and social justice." "At the moment, there is no difference between the fight against global warming and the fight for another world ".
The first rallies began in the Asia-Pacific region, which find many islands particularly sensitive to climate warming.
In Australia, organizers say, about 50,000 people took to the streets.
Several hundred people marched in Manila, mostly students, wearing red clothing and with scarves evicating the importance of solar energy.
In Hong Kong, Jakarta, but also in Canada, several hundred demonstrators took to the streets, demanding strong action against climate change.
In France, hundreds of people took part in the "350"-organised protests, mainly in Paris, Marseille (south), Lille (north), Bordeaux (west) and Lyon (East).
In Geneva, several dozen people gathered.
Separatist Abkhazia has elected its president, Georgia condemns it as a "farce"
Abkhazia elected its president on Saturday, about a year after Moscow recognized this pro-Russian separatist territory as independent of Georgia, Tbilisi, on the other hand, declares the move a "farce."
About 131,000 people were invited to participate in this first election after the Russian-Russia war in August 2008 for control of South Ossetia, another former Georgian territory recognized by Russia.
The polls closed at 17 hours of GMT.
According to officials from the Abchaz election commission, the turnout was 58% a few hours before the polling stations closed.
The first preliminary results should be announced at night from Saturday to Sunday.
All five candidates, including incumbent President Sergei Bagapsh, categorically reject the idea of a merger with Georgia that condemned the election.
These elections are a farce.
On the other hand, Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili "did in Abkhazia's downright fallen into Russian domed," said his spokeswoman, Manana Manjgaladze.
Apart from Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela have recognized the independence of the territory of 216,000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world considers it to be part of Georgia, which was illegally occupied by Russian troops.
After separating from Georgia, after the conflict in 1992-1993, which killed several thousand people, Abkhazia is trying to show through the elections that she is ready to return to international politics.
This process is one of the stages of our new life, a new era for our independent state, Kvarchiya Svetlanová, a 54-year-old historian who also admitted to voting for President Bagapsh, told AFP.
She was one of those who came to the polling station at the school in the capital, Sukhumi, to a beautiful white building with a few palm trees at the entrance.
The question of Russian domin effect is the main issue of the presidential election in this region on the shores of the Black Sea, which can boast beautiful nature.
Across this small country of 216,000 people, huge billboards are being placed with Bagapsh alongside Russian President Dmitry Medvedev and Russian Prime MinisterVladimir Putin.
In Gaul, in the west of the country, Russian officials who came to oversee the successful conduct of the elections received a warm welcome from the district mayor of Beslan Arsba.
"We, the Abkhaz, were grateful "sall at a small ceremony, referring to Moscow's support and, in particular, its decision to recognize Abkhazia's independence.
I hope that your country will soon be recognised by the United Nations, said Alexei Ostrovsky, a member of the Russian Parliament, and toasted with a glass of vodka.
The opposition, which was represented in the election by former vice-president Raule Khadzhimba and two traders Zaus Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, criticized the contracts concluded last year with Moscow, such as a treaty that allows Russia to control the Abkhazia railway network for a period of 10 years.
Fifth candidate, Vitali Bganba says he supports neither the current government nor the opposition.
To win the election, an absolute majority of 50% plus one vote is required.
If none of the candidates achieves this result, the decisive contest must take place within two weeks.
Climate: World rally, events in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of people took to the streets on Saturday, demanding a strong and binding agreement to combat global warming, which should be adopted at a conference in Copenhagen, demonstrated worldwide and in Copenhagen, where around 700 people were arrested by police on the occasion.
At least 30,000 people, according to police sources and a hundred thousand, according to the organizers, rallied in the afternoon in the cold weather in the Danish capital, which hosts delegates from 193 countries until December 18, on an agreement that could enter into force on 1 January 2013.
After leaving Parliament, the procession calmly made its way to the Bella Center, where the negotiations were taking place.
The demonstrators stopped about 500 metres from the building without trying to penetrate.
A podium was built for the speakers, before which a cleric candlelit meeting took place with the participation of the former South African Archbishop of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu.
According to an AFP journalist, the incidents occurred shortly after the parade left, when a group of several hundred protesters, dressed in black and armed with brick and hammers, began to set up the windows.
Riots police immediately surrounded them and intervened without waiting, several manifestants hitting the ground.
In total, police announced the arrest of 600 to 700 people, clarifying that they were mainly members of the "Blacks Blocks," ultra-radical separate groups that had already been manifested in April at the NATO summit in Strasbourg in eastern France.
Late in the afternoon, one police officer on the jaw was injured by a cobblestone and four cars were set on fire near the squat near the incidents, which resulted in the detention of about 20 people, according to police sources.
We are focused on extremist groups, police spokesman Henrik Yakobsen warned, while police helicopters flew up again.
Most of the protesters who arrived by bus or train from major German cities, London, Amsterdam and Milan were of European origin.
But there were also a lot of Asians, including several Chinese and Koreans or Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, dressed mostly in blue cape, formed their first rally in Copenhagen in the morning at the call of the Friends of the Earth group to create "blue waves" as a "fair climate."
Today we are taking to the streets to demand a green debt settlement in favour of the south, explained Lidy Nacpil, the Philippine fighter at the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.

French MEP Jose Bová, one of the figures in the fight for another world, said he had come to Copenhagen to "connect climate and social justice." "At the moment, there is no difference between the fight against global warming and the fight for another world ".
Oxfam has called in several well-known figures, such as Danish model Helena Christensen or former UN Refugee Commissioner Mary Robinson, to speak to the crowd.
The first rallies began in the Asia-Pacific region, which find many islands particularly sensitive to climate warming.
In Australia, organizers say, about 50,000 people took to the streets.
In Manile, several hundred people rallied in front of the City Hall of the Philippines' capital, mostly students in red clothing and scarves evading the importance of solar energy.
In Hong Kong and Jakarta, several hundred demonstrators also met with a demand for strong action against climate change.
In France, hundreds of people took part in the "350"-organised protests, mainly in Paris, Marseille (south), Lille (north), Bordeaux (west) and Lyon (East).
In Geneva, several dozen people gathered.
Geography and history items will be strengthened as part of the reform of the general grammar school, Chatel said.
Education Minister Luc Chatel said during an interview with the JDD journal on Sunday that the subjects of history and geography will be "strengthened" as part of the general grammar school reform, even though their teaching will no longer be compulsory in the final year of the grammar school with a focus on exact sciences.
Now all second-year students will have four hours a week and there will be the same programme from the general culture for everyone, Chatel confirmed.
According to the minister, "it is necessary to end with hypocrisy" because, according to him, the S specialization is no longer focused on exact sciences" but "basically the best students are there."
The EC and L specializations cannot be for the kind of sub-specialisations, he continues, stressing: "I have not heard many historians and intellectuals who would have made it difficult for themselves to learn geography and history in their final year of vocational grammar schools."
A survey by the Ifop agency, published on Saturday by the Humanité newspaper, showed that seven French people out of ten (69%) do not agree with the government's project to abolish compulsory history and geography in the senior year specialization S, which is why many intellectuals and teachers have criticised the abolition, both the left and some members of the right.
The minister, on the other hand, added that "it is not an account" to abolish the philosophy in the program of specialization with the graduation year.
At the same time, Luc Khatel defended the reform in the education of teachers, while 16 organisations (students and unions) called for participation in Tuesday's mobilization against this project, which they believe will sacrifice the pedagogical education of future grammar school professors.
As part of his Master's degree 2 (M2), he will undergo an entrance exam focused on their field at the start of the year and another test for their ability to teach at the end of the year, the minister explained.
They will take part in professional internships during the second year of their Master's degree and will perform as a professor-task in front of the pupils for the first year.
If you add up all the traineeships that will be offered to you before the admissions process, you will get more experience with the pupils, almost 300 hours, he continued.
The minister also announced that he would propose a "personal right to education," which does not yet exist in national education.
He reaffirmed the project to cancel the school map by 2012.
At the elite École normale supérieure University, experts have 15 minutes to convince about the climate.
Fifteen minutes to present the targets of the Copenhagen Summit: this is a challenge announced on Saturday morning by Jean Jouzel, vice-president of the Intergovernmental Group of Climate Experts for Climate Development (GIEC) at the instigation of Ecole normale supérieure on Ulm Street.
As one AFP journalist reported, Nobel Peace Prize laureate Jean Jouzel opened the first of the "Ernest" conferences, a one-day seminar of 15 minutes of experts to be filmed and open to the public.
We wanted to do something to attract people and on the basis of which they would be more inclined to learn more, explained on the occasion of the conference 22-year-old Edouard Hannezo, one of the organizers of this seminar, which was named after the fish from the local pool, which was so named by the students.
A score of or so don't-seeking experts from the various scientific disciplines will be selected and the selection is based on their charisma.
Climate warming "we can talk for hours, but we can also summarize the basic targets in a few minutes" said AFP Jean Jouzel, who spoke in front of fifty listeners without pre-arranged comments, using only graphs.
It is part of our scientific work, he stressed with the hope that the audience will recognize that "the Codaňka conference relies on a very serious scientific foundations."
Videos filmed at these lectures will be placed on the school's website from 15 December.
The next "Ernest" seminar is scheduled for February, and more will follow with regularity every two months.
Delays in payments: angry prison guards, planned measures
The union of prison guards announced a "general mobilisation" on Friday, as they are demanding that they be reimbursed for premiums and overtime by the Christmas holidays, the reimbursement of which was postponed until January for financial reasons.
The Prison FO (2nd unions of the guards) has asked staff who will not be on duty to attend a demonstration on Tuesday morning in front of the prison facilities and to "cram" to draw attention to the "steal of their wages."
The CGT for the Prison Guards (the sector's 3rd unions) called for them to "requalise rallies in individual prisons and start a major mobilisation" with the fact that it is "sharvest and inability" to be paid for "over-time and for work at night, on Sundays and holidays" worked in October.
The first union of the guards, the Federal Union of Prison Supervisors (Ufap/Unsa), "calls for the overall mobilization (...) in order to show discontent and indignation."
The Administrative Directorate and the Ministry of Justice explain that the number of overtime increased a lot in 2009 and not all were included in the financial budget, but assure that the amounts due will be paid in January.
The chancellery said at the end of the day that Michèle Alliot-Mari had sent a memo to the prison guards' union assuring them that the payment would be made next month.
I know of the efforts that prison staff are making to ensure the functioning and modernisation of our prison system, the minister writes in her memo.
I have ordered the Administrative Directorate of Prisons to take immediate measures to prevent the situation from being incurred by the poor assessment of the number of overtime in the future, Minister Alliot-Mari added.
The December wage will therefore be low, with the exception of the managers receiving the famous bonuses for performing functions and meeting the targets, says Ufap/Unsa, and for those "it will always find room in the budget."
It is simply a scandal, the interregional FO union in Marseille was outrageous, and announced its decision to boycott "all meetings and summonses" until further notice.
Workers will not come to work on Sundays or holidays, if the supplements for these days of October are not reimbursed in December, as well as overtime, FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne.
At a time when we are being given more and more work and more tasks without giving us more staff available to us, it is sad to allow the lowest-ranking staff to pay for it, says the CGT-Ren supervitants in Bordeaux.
According to the unions, the situation is not the same in all regions, some of them are better off than others.
However, in any case, the funds of the jer few, the Secretary-General of Ufap, Jean-François Forget, noted.
Obama says he's giving "better gifts" at Christmas than the ones he receives
US President Barack Obama, who is preparing for his first Christmas with his family at the White House, confided to Oprah Winfrey's "goddess" of Oprah Winfrey's screen that he has a simple rule as far as gifts: "I give better gifts than the ones I'm getting."
The president and his wife, Michelle, spoke in a special edition of the show, which will air on ABC on Sunday night about how they are about to spend the Christmas holidays and the end of the year in their new and prestigious residence.
Even Bo, the family's little four-legged companion gets his nave.
Santa Claus also likes Boa, said Michelle Obama, noting that the dog will also receive a gift "of course" of the dog, according to the gloat from the show's pre-trotheing broadcast.
And Michelle Obama also objected to her husband's claim on the quality of the gifts she receives: "No way, I gave you a great gift last year," teasing the president.
Well, of course, that's true, the president was forced to agree, but immediately afterwards he pointed his finger with humor to the pearl necklace of the first lady: "Who gave you this?".
In this one-hour, very relaxed show with the famous presenter, who worked hard to support Barack Obama in his presidential campaign, Mr. and Mrs. Obama also discussed their favorite gifts they received as children.
Barack Obama introduced a 10-degree gearbox, but also a basketball league given to him for Christmas by his Kenyan father, whom he met only rarely.
I remember seeing my father, who came to see us for Christmas and give me the basketball ball, the president told me.
It wasn't until a long time after that I realized that he had actually given me the ball.
The first lady, for her part, remembered the dollhouse.
I didn't know how to organize it all in the house, so I set up all the furniture along the wall instead of placing it around the fireplace, but I loved the little dollhouse, reminisced Michelle Obama.
Johnny HallyDeded again, RTL says he's in artificial sleep
Johnny Hally Deduled in Los Angeles due to "injor" after a major surgery he underwent in France, but the situation is, according to his closest, "under-check," while RTL reported that the singer was in artificial sleep to prevent pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rocker was re-opened on the night of Wednesday to Thursday at the Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles after U.S. doctors noted the "injuring from the operation" of the sprawling disc he had undergone in Paris on November 26, his press office told Paris, noting that these lesions required a "goal operation."
However, the singer's press office tried to reassure the public and said the situation was "under-control" and at the same time announced that a new medical communiqué would be issued within 48 hours at the latest.
According to RTL, which is the lead partner of the singer's last tour, Johnny Hallyday was put into artificial sleep to avoid "bole and complications."
In 48 hours, when the patient opens the eyes, we'll be a little more confident, RTL adds.
The press office, when asked by AFP, did not confirm or comment on this information.
RTL also states that according to "some sources" no practice was placed after the first operation in Paris.
The rocker was operated on at the Parc Monceau International Clinic due to a sprained disc.
The surgery, which had been scheduled a few days in advance, was performed by neurosurgeon Stephan Delajoux, well known by a doctor in artistic circles.
But the doctor was not available on Thursday to comment on RTL's information.
After the surgery, singer Johnny Hallyday was hospitalized Monday at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles for an infection that occurred after the hit.
Singer Eddy Mitchell, a close friend of Johnny Hallyday, said on RTL radio on Thursday that his friend was going through a "bad time" but added that he was "not worried about the rocker" because he was a big "fighter."
He called me just before he left for Los Angeles, but I told him he was doing stupid things to do it because spending 12 hours on a plane after such an operation was no joke, Eddy Mitchell said.
On Wednesday night, the singer's producer, Jean-Claude Camus, was reassuring the situation, who said that Johnny Hallyday would "react well to antibiotics" and that the infection had been "stopped."
Mr Camus also said that he had met Laeticia, the singer's wife, and that he had noticed no particular concern.
The singer's health problems have only been multiplied since July, when he was hospitalized for nine days after he fell on his yacht.
Two months later, to everyone's surprise, it was revealed that Johnny Hallyday had been operated on to a "small small-greb tumor" and then a weak infection.
At the end of September, the singer returned to his long "Tower-66" tour, which is presented as his fouings.
But since then, every medical problem of his has been highly watched and commented. Fans and journalists have noticed that the singer has difficulty moving on stage.
In mid-November, his team had to debunk again a report on the new hospitalization.
Euro-2009/small pool: premiere of Bousquet in his favourite discipline
Frenchman Frédérick Bousquet, a three-time medalist at the 2009 World Championships in a Grand Pool, won the European Championships 2009 in a small swimming pool on Thursday in a discipline he particularly likes: the 50m freestyle.
The first day of the Championships, at which overalls are last allowed, only three world records were set, although many more were expected.
One of them was beaten by Hungarian competitor Evelyn Verrasztová in the 200m semi-figner and the two remaining men's relay by Russia in the 4x50 m semi-figner.
A great grief for Bousquet, who was in the fashion for the world record at the 50m freelent in the freelent-out pool ($204,99).
In one of the two royal swimming disciplines, the 50m freestyle, the 28-year-old Frenchman won with a final time of 20.53 seconds in the final, at which the premiere was started by ten swimmers instead of the normal eight.
Bousquet defeated Croatian Duje Draganja (20.70) and Russian Sergei Fesikov (20.4), but failed to break the world record (20.30), as he had anticipated.
We can always dream of something better, but I said that if the world record is in my reach, I will try.
Like Bousquet, almost all swimmers wore jumpsuits made of polyurethane, which would be banned from 1 January.
The jumpsuit has helped to 238 world records since February 2008, and their era is ending in Istanbul, which was the first to be hosted at the same competition in 1999.
The use of the jumpsuit did not help the German Paul Biedermann, the two-time world champion in the big pool in the summer in Rome, who had the world record at his fingertips.
The young swimmer failed to break the record he holds in the 400 metres freestyle (3:32.77), but still won with the second fastest time of his career (3:34.55), over Russian racer Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and Dane Fason Glaesner (3:36.82)
I didn't give it my all.
I knew I wouldn't beat the world record this time, but I managed to defend my title and I did my job.
Lobintsev will be a serious contender for the future, Biedermann explained.
USA: Zola's Romanesque sarcophagus record auctioned for $1.5 million
A record of a Romanesque sarcophagus that belonged to none other than the French writer Emil Zola was auctioned for US$1.5 million on Thursday, which is significantly more than estimated, said art dealer Sotheby ́s.
The price of this two-metre-long and 63 cm high front plate, dating from the third century A.D., was estimated at between $150,000 and $250,000.
Mramor "representing the four Dionýs scene in an elaborate architectural décor, surrounded by satyras and bakchants is a rare piece, similar pieces of similar pieces in the world are very few, perhaps four or five," Florent Heintz, Vice-President of the Ancient Roman and Egyptian Art of Ancient Roman and Egyptian Art at Sotheby's, told AFP on Tuesday.
The work was sold among a hundred others.
The sale is still ongoing, but it is the object to which it was perhaps the most bidded, Sotheby's spokesman, Dan Abernethy, told AFP.
The fact that Emile Zola acquired this marble was detected a few days ago.
The record was in Rome for almost 300 years in Rome in the famous collection of the Borgia family, and then gradually appeared with the French actress Cecile Sorel, who decorated with her in a baththot at her private hotel in Paris and with Paul Reynaud, the Minister of the Third Republic of France and briefly the President of the Council before the rise to power of Marshal Petain.
There she remained shaded for about fifty years.
Florent Heintz discovered while searching the Louvre Museum's database that the record was part of the "appearances of Emil Zola" opened since 1903, a year after the death of the author "these Raquin" and the frescoes "Rougon-Macquart."
Interrupted attempt to leave President Zelay to Mexico from Honduras.
Mexico decided on Thursday that the conditions for the transport of ousted President Honduras, Manuel Zelay, to whom the rebels refused to provide a safe exit guarantee, would not be met.
After a phone conversation I had with President Zelaya last night, all indications are that there is no way to make this transfer, Mexican Minister of Foreign Affairs, Patricia Espinosa, said.
The Mexican government plane that arrived in El Salvador for President Zelaya on Wednesday flew back to President Zelaya, a source in the Directorate-General for Migration said.
The Putsch's government wanted to force President Zelaya to "demisi" and to apply for political asylum abroad, only to give him the chance to safely leave.
But the ousted president rejected those demands because he wanted to go to Mexico as the exile head of state.
The Putsch's Government "deny another failure when it wanted me to resign my post (...), they wanted me to resign," Zelaya told Globo Radio on Thursday, in which he often commented on the political crisis that has been in this Central American country for five months.
I can stay here for ten years, I have my guitar here, added the ousted president, hidden at the Brazilian Embassy in Tegucigalpa for two and a half months and played a few chords.
The Mexican Embassy has asked us to provide a safe transfer guarantee, but unfortunately we cannot accept it because it does not include an asylum application, the Interior Minister of the Putsch government, Oscar Raul Matute, said on Wednesday to HRN's Honduran radio.
I will not seek asylum from any country, said Manuel Zelaya in an interview with the Telesur station, which is based in Caracas.
If I ever leave Honduras, I will leave as president of the Honduro people, he stressed.
The rumors of Zelaya's departure were mobilized on Wednesday by supporters of the ousted president who came to gather around the embassy of Brazil, where the military stepped up protection.
The Brazilian Foreign Minister, Celso Amorim, has criticised the position of the putschist government.
They are showing their marginal stance on international standards, he added.
Zelaya, who became close to the socialist Venezuelan president Hugo Chávez, was overthrown on June 28, the day he organized a public consultation in preparation for his re-election against the recommendation of the Supreme Court, the military and Congress.
He unexpectedly returned from exile in Costa Rica on September 21 and found refuge at the Brazilian Embassy.
If he comes out of here, he will be arrested and answerable for the crime of the "hille-murn" he is charged with, the putsch government says.
The Pučistic President Roberto Micheletti managed to organize the presidential election to replace President Zelay on November 29.
In the controversial election, recognized by the United States but convicted by Latin American countries like Venezuela, Argentina or Brazil, Porfirio Lobo won.
Three days later, Congress voted against President Zelay's return to power until the end of his mandate on January 27.
Wall Street rises, US trade balance encouraged to optimism
The New York Stock Exchange ended in an increase on Thursday, and the US trade balance results at a rise in both the United States and its partners: Dow Jones gained 0.67% and the Nasdaq 0.33%.
According to the final deadline, the Dow Jones Industrial Average improved from 68.78 points to 10.405.83 and Nasdaq, with technological dominance from 7.13 points to 2190.06 points.
The Standard & Poor 500 index improved 0.58% (6.40 points) to 1102.35 points.
We have good news coming from different parts of the economy, commented Lindsey Piegz of FTN Financial.
But we can't take it too seriously, she added, because the market is concentrated on "super that's half full of glass."
For Peter Cardillo of Avalon Partners, investors are mainly focused on US trade balance numbers "which show that activity is improving in the fourth quarter."
The U.S. trade deficit fell by 7.6% in October from September to $32.9 billion.
Analysts, on the other hand, had expected an increase in the deficit.
There have been an increase in both imports and exports.
The big news is the growing volume of trade, especially the export of goods, which reflects the growth of the economies of the United States' main trading partners, said Christopher Cornell of the research firm Economy.com.
However, unemployment rose in the United States last week against all expectations, and the number of jobseekers reached 474,000.
But in the past four weeks, the average number of new jobseekers has fallen "to the lowest this year," said Scott Marcouiller of Wells Fargo Advisors.
The securities market has also fallen.
The proceeds of the state treasures with a view to 10 years increased to 3.482%, up from 3.423% on Tuesday night, and the return to 30.
Cuba : hundreds of regime supporters booed "Ladies in White"
Several hundred supporters of the Cuban regime booed the wives of political prisoners on Thursday, who met in Havana on the occasion of World Human Rights Day and prevented another rally, for which dozens of dissidents were arrested.
About forty "Dam in white," wives or close political prisoners, were prented directly on the street by supporters of the regime of Raul Castro's regime on their march towards the center of the capital, demanding the release of political prisoners, the journalist reported.
Ade with the Yankees!, "Jubs," "The Street belongs to the revolutionaries!", "Long live Fidel and Raul!" the regime's supporters of dissidents chanted the uproar.
Dissidents were eventually escorted by plainclothes officers who arrived to "secure security."
The day before that, there was a similar rally against "Dadammies in White" in Havana, but there were no injuries or arrests.
But in Havana's Vedado district, about ten plainclothes police officers were detained as well as planning to rally on Thursday on the occasion of World Human Rights Day, AFP journalist reported.
According to this journalist, police loaded dissidents who were powered by supporters of the government regime into civilian vehicles using force.
The arrest of dissidents in similar conditions takes only a few hours from the rule.
The holders of the Sakharov European Parliament Award for 2005, "Ladies in White" organized an unauthorised march for "fishing all, according to dissent, about 200 political prisoners," said one of their leaders, Laura Pollan, whose husband, Héctor Maceda, is serving a 20-year prison sentence.
Mr. Maceda is one of a group of 75 Cuban dissidents arrested in March 2003, 53 of whom remain behind bars.
Cuban authorities consider opponents to be "mercenaries" or "agents" paid for by their arch-enemy, the United States.
A miracle done, Cuban television reported on Thursday's rally of the governing regime's anti-reforsion of the "pursuit of the revolution."
Cuba, with the Communist Party at the head and the one-party government's policies, is regularly accused by European or American NGOs of disregarding human rights and freedoms, including freedom of speech.
The madman killed an 80-year-old man with a knife and injured 5 people in Clichy-la-Garenne.
A madman armed with two knives killed an 80-year-old man and injured five other people in the town of Clichy-la-Garenne (Hauts-de-Seine) at the time of the peak on Thursday afternoon.
According to the preliminary results of the investigation, the assailant, at the age of 28 allegedly assaulted an 80-year-old man in or before a pharmacy with two knives and for unknown reasons, 85 on the Boulevard Jean-Jaures, such is the version of the police and witnesses.
The badly injured old man, born in 1929, died of his injuries in hospital, according to the police syndicate Alliance.
In this pharmacy or in front of her, the attacker attacked the pregnant woman and her partner.
The husband, aged in his 30s, began to defend himself and was injured.
The first two seriously injured victims were admitted to the same hospital in which an 80-year-old man died.
The life of the second injured man is in danger, according to police sources, the vital organs were apparently hit.
The pregnant woman then collapsed and was taken to the hospital "in shock," a police source said.
The armed man, who appeared to be under the influence of alcohol or drugs, as a police source said, then fled to the street, still on the boulevard Jean Jaurès.
He injured two more people, apparently by accident: a 30-year-old and a 40-year-old man, the other man seriously.
How all this happened is not entirely clear, as it all took place in the evening.
He was armed with two butcher knives, which he carried across with a cross behind him, the head of the Alliance syndicate at Hauts-de-Seine, Arnaud Pressé, said at the scene.
Several passers-by, including young people, attempted to stop and disarm the lunatics, according to testimony from AFP.
I saw a guy in a 30-year-old green jacket.
The three young men were trying to catch him.
They failed to do so because he was quite strong, commented Alberto, a waiter from a nearby bar.
He was pleddled by a crowd, including a city police officer who had broken his wrist in the process, he added.
Still at Boulevard Jean-Jaures, at the level of 61, two city police officers, including their commander, attempted to apprehend an armed man while being wounded by fists, a police source said.
The incident occurred in one of the main streets in the Clichy-la-Garenne, where many shops are located.
Passers-by came to tell me there was a wounded person outside.
I went out and saw a 70-year-old man on the ground, put him in a safe place, and noticed a big blow to my stomach, Frederic Allione, a 30-year-old pharmacist, told AFP.
Five minutes later, a second person in his 30s, who was also stabbed with a knife, came in.
A man who did not have his identity documents on him was eventually arrested by the state police.
The public prosecutor in Nanterre referred the matter to the Hauts-de-Seine Regional Police Department (SDPJ 92).
The suspect attacker was taken to the hospital on Thursday night.
He's in custody awaiting questioning.
A police source did not rule out his placement in a psychiatric hospital.
Another police source said it was needed to handle six officers to handle him at the police station in Clichy, where he was taken.
He was "completely out of his side" like "all lunatics of this type, whose strength in action increases tenfold ".
US: Polanski's lawyer again asks for prosecution to end
Polish-French director Roman Polanski's lawyer reapplaimed in Los Angeles (California, West of the United States) on Thursday to halt the prosecution against his client, who is currently in his Swiss residence because of a moral affair that took place 30 years ago.
Chad Hummel, the director's attorney for the film "The Pianist," criticized before the three judges of the appeals court of the second district in California, serious errors that occurred at the trial at the time of the events of 1977.
I demand the prosecution now and immediately, said the lawyer, Hummel, adding that of the conduct of the judge who was then deciding the case, Laurence Rittenbanda "went a chill in the back."
According to him, the judge (who had already died in between) had allegedly dealt with the prosecutor before the verdict, who told him that Roman Polanski deserved to go to prison – a serious offence against the rule of law.
The information about this interview appeared in the "Roman Polanski: desired and wanted" (Roman Polanski, sought and desirable), from the mouth of the public prosecutor himself, David Wells.
But Mr. Wells finally declared at the end of September that he had "fed" the author of the documentary.
If the court refuses to halt the criminal proceedings, lawyer Hummel will demand a trial to be held in which he will be able to produce evidence of his claim.
The prosecutor reiterated what had already been said at the first state, that there would be no serious study of the request to discontinue the prosecution until Roman Polanski came to trial.
The 76-year-old director fled the United States in 1978, before the court handed down his sentence in the "illegal sexual intercourse" case with the teenage girl at the age of 13.
He has never re-entered in the United States since.
A representative of the Los Angeles prosecutor, Phyllis Asayam, said Roman Polanski "shorthd's to attend the trial."
In this case do we want to say not only to Roman Polaski, but also to other defendants that it is possible to escape? asks Mrs Asayam.
He is of the opinion that the director "requests the court's kindness while despising his authority."
One of the three judges who now have 90 days to take a decision has also stressed that "that there are other alternatives to escape."
The lawyer, Hummel, was not alone in asking for the prosecution of Roman Polanski to be discontinued.
The victim's attorney, Samantha Geimer, also again asked for the prosecution to be completed.
She recalled that her client would no longer bear the eternal harassment every time the Polanski case surfaced and added: 'No one in this room can say that the trial was fair'.
Thirty-two years, that's enough."
Roman Polanski arrested on 26th in Switzerland on US orders
After more than two months behind bars, he was placed under house arrest in his cottage in Gstaad, where he is awaiting possible banishment.
Wall Street ends without the direction, being hampered by the rising dollar
The New York Stock Exchange ended without the boo on Friday, with the market in the throes of indicators that are better than expected in the US and a rising dollar price: Dow Jones gained +0.63%, but the Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
According to the final deadline, the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced from 65.67 points to 10.471.50 points and Nasdaq, with technological dominance leaving 0.55 points and finishing at 2.190.31.
The Standard & Poor's 500 index has risen from 0.37% (4.06 points) to 1.106.41.
Frankly, the market is very calm, said Mace Blicksilver of Marblehead Asset Management.
It remains in a narrow margin, the volume of trade has decreased very much and I think it will remain so until the end of the year.
This trend was also confirmed by the publication of economic indicators that are better than expected and which "help to improve the mood in the market in terms of stability of the economic recovery," summarised the Charles Schwab analyse.
In the US, retail sales grew by 1.3% for the second consecutive month and far more than expected in November.
According to a preliminary estimate by the University of Michigan index, US consumer confidence also returned, rising strongly in December to 73.4 against 67.4 in the previous month.
However, the indices were hinder the new dollar price increase against the euro, which is the highest in two months, which "puses downward-sensitive sectors to the economic situation," said Owen Fitzpatrick of Deutsche Bank.
Technology stocks are losing ground.
The securities market has fallen.
The yield on the treasures with a 10-year perspective rose to 3.540% as opposed to 3.482% on Wednesday night, and with a view to 30 years, increased to 4.497%, up from 4.492% a day earlier.
The Miss World choice in South Africa again.
After traveling monthly across South Africa with 112 Miss World candidates on Saturday, she is planning to cross the target mark to reach her dream: to be voted the most beautiful woman in the world in front of a billion television viewers.
This great beauty celebration was held in the vicinity of Johannesburg for the second year running and, for the time being, five candidates have won the semi-finals.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran Acosta of Mexico, Mariatu Kargboo of Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino of Gilbratar and Yanbing Mabing of Canada were chosen by Miss Sport or Miss Top Model during their African sojourn.
It was a true whirl of events.
It was amazing to visit beautiful cities like Port Elizabeth,Durban or Cape Town.
I've seen a lot of things and I have so many experiences!, confided Miss Sierry Leone.
The competition, which is held in South Africa for the ninth time, will be broadcast live from Midrandu, in the north of Johannesburg, from 5 p.m. (fourer) at 5 p.m.
I couldn't dream a more beautiful country in which to put a crown on.
It was a fascinating experience.
I'm happy I could have experienced it twice, confided Miss World World by Ksenia Sukhin, in the hot south-shot.
For the young Russia, her second stay in South Africa was carried in the spirit of numerous meetings with other candidates and the new discovery of the country and its "rashina that is taking the breath away."
After a month of performances, rehearsals, meetings with the press and safari, the Miss pageant is now focused on the competition itself.
Indian Pooja Chopra hopes to go in the steps of Priyan Chopra, elected in 2000, who is also participating in the election by Aishwarye Rai, the winner of 1994, who both became Bollywood's stars.
Being crowned as the most beautiful woman in the world is every woman's dream, but it's not just about appearance.
We are the ambassador of our countries and I want to come home with the crown, says Miss Indie with a wide smile.
According to the organizers, the 59th edition will be carried in the spirit of music and dance.
The candidates will be presented in traditional costumes and, of course, in swimsuits.
The show will be presented by Chinese TV presenter Angela Chow, the former Queen of Beauties of South Africa Michelle McLean and the chairman of the Miss World Committee, Steve Douglas.
South Africa has shown that it can welcome the world with a warm-up that is difficult to cope, said Julia Morley, the president of the Miss World competition.
As last year, the candidates took part in safari, visited the famous town of Soweto, this time by bicycle, and tasted the local cuisine.
An extraordinary event was a meeting with South African President Jacob Zuma, who shook their hands.
Unusual to the president, Miss Sierry Leone noted.
Undoubtedly the most beautiful memory will be the draw in Cape Town (in the southwest of the country) for the World Cup, which will be held in June 2010, which helped the country to support the event a bit more.
I could meet people I never dreamed of.
I will definitely return to the World Cup in 2010, says Miss Italy with enthusiasm, Alice Taticchi.
According to David's son, reports of Hallyday's condition are "very positive."
The news of Johnny Hallyday's condition is "very positive," as his son David assured us on his arrival at Los Angeles airport on Friday to visit his father, who has been hospitalized for days.
The news is very positive.
It is very strong and everything is going very well, said David Hallyday on his way out of the plane, arriving from Paris a short while after 1 p.m. local time (21pm world time)
The singer's son, who appeared calmly, said he would make the "aswilky" appearance at the Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles, to which Johnny Hallyday was admitted on Monday to an in-surgery infection created after an operation for the sprained inter-breach sphee he underwent in Paris on November 26.
According to a press release, the singer's night in Los Angeles was "leaned into artificial sleep" for the sake of comfort to prevent pain and facilitate treatment.
Johnny Hallyday was already put into artificial sleep by the doctors at Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles. The hospitalization was hospitalised due to an infection after an operation for an operation sprained by an intervertebral disc conducted on November 26 in Paris.
Due to the serious damage caused by this intervention, the singer had to be operated on again during the night of Wednesday to Thursday.
According to an AFP photographer's information, his wife, Laetiticius, attended a school performance of the French Lyceum in Los Angeles on Friday morning, attended by their daughter Jade.
The head of the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery and Traumatology at the Hospital la Pitié-Salpêtrière, Yves Catoné, reported that he was flying to the singer in Los Angeles on Monday.
The producer heavily accused Stéphan Delajoux, a neurosurgeon who operated on the singer on November 26 at the Clinique internationale duc Monceau in Paris.
We were told it was a massacre.
Surgeons from Los Angeles said they were outraged, M. Camus said.
I've heard about the possibility of a future trial, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus believes that Johnny Hallyday"dled too quickly to Los Angeles with the permission of his Parisian surgeon'.
I spoke to the doctor in the telephone myself, who assured me that this trip was no problem, which surprised me greatly, as I myself had already suffered from the win of the intervertebral disc twice, he added.
He had said on the RTL radio station a moment earlier that the singer had apparently left after a Paris operation without a drain, without a drain."
Dr Stéphane Delajoux is well known in art circles.
He operated on the actress Maria Trintignant in Vilnius a few days before her death at the Neuilly-sur-Seine clinic he was at the time.
In 2007, he also operated on actress Charlotte Gainsbourg in the removal of a hematoma, resulting from a cerebral hemorrhage.
But he is also a dulpatician with a dark reputation, convicted several times in cases of medical malpractice, for tax evasion and fraud.
The medical association's attorney for the medical chamber, Olivier Metzner, called him a "no-scorcheon without scruples" who is "regularly" summoned to the medical chamber, and which cannot be "far recommended."
After several days of silence, Dr Stéphane Delajoux commented on the matter through his lawyer, David Koubbi.
He announced that the procedure had "absolutely good progression" and the post-operative examinations were "normal."
The operation was not of a hemorrhagic nature, so the introduction of the choral deed was not necessary," he added.
The singer's health problems have been mounting since this summer, and in any case, his next tour seems to remain with a question mark.
It is clear that the resumption date of the planned tour on January 8 (in Amiens) appears too close, Camus said.
UDF increases the tone and calls on the Nouveau Centre to take no further advantage.
UDF, controlled by MoDFrançoise Bayroua, responded to an attempt by the president of the Nouveau Centre, Hervy Morin, to take advantage of the former Giscarda party's acronym, saying he must not use the acronym in any media under threat of prosecution.
Hervé Morin publicly announced his intention to appropriate the abbreviation of the UDF, saying that François Bayrou did not deserve to bear her heritage after he extended his hand to the left.
The Defence Minister, whose party is a partner of the UMP, planned to confirm the strategy on Saturday before the Nouveau Centre (NC) National Council.
His move received support from the Hervé de Charettt (former za-UMP now for NC), who is credited with owning the UDF brand because he first registered it at the National Institute of Industrial Property (l'Institut national de la propriété industrileelle) in 2004.
But on Friday evening, the UDF-led committee of François Bayrou's friends who have no intention of being expropriated, withdrew from its silence and made a formal request to both the minister and the MP to stop using the abbreviation and to hand back the ownership of the trademark, under threat of prosecution.
In recent days, you have increased the worrying statements that you would propose to your political movement +-receive to take the acronym of UDF, writes the Consortium of 19 of the 24 committee members, such as the MoDem's François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez, or Senator Jean Arthuis of the Alliance centriste.
At the same time, you considered it appropriate to place the name+Nouveau centre+ on your promotional material and on the welcoming website of your movement, with the slogan +UDF today+, the letter's signatories also note.
As you know, you have no right to use this abbreviation, explains the UDF Committee, which is asking for the NC"movement to remove all references to the name UDF from all promotional material including (its) websites."
At the same time, he asks Hervé de Charette to "take the ownership of the trade mark to the legitimate owners."
If you do not do so, we will go to the courts to respect the law and the legitimate rights of the members of the UDF, the signatories point out.
In their letter, they state that the UDF "is a full-fledged political movement in 1978 "and recall that Mr. Morin and his friends "elected" leaving in 2007 " to create a competitive movement, as others did in 2002 to establish the UMP.
The Nouveau centre movement therefore has no right, according to them, to use the acronym UDF (Union pour la démocratie française).
At the same time, they recall that the last congress of the UDF voted in 2007 to join the MoDem for three years and to create a committee in charge of defending the "moral and material interests" of the association founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As for Hervé de Charette, the committee continues "when he registered the trade mark," he was "albeamed UDF for three years" but UMP.
He scandalically and fraudulently used the non-existent acronyma registrations to do so on his own account.
This indiscretality is beginning to be transformed into a criminal offence, they claim, and then comment with irony on the NC strategy: "It seems to us that both in politics and in everyday life it is more valuable to create a name for yourself than to withdraw from anonymity by the fraudulent acceptance of a name to which we do not have the right."
Liliane Bettencourt's case: François-Marie Banier will be tried for misuse of a state of weakness.
The Nanterre court decided on Friday to try the artist François-Marie Banier and pass a verdict on whether he had used the status of weakness of the 80-year-old billionaire to deprive her of part of her fortune, which is blamed on her daughter, Liliane Bettencourt.
The photographer (62 years), known for his photographs of the famous, will be on trial on 15 and 16 April 2010 for misuse of the state of weakness, a criminal offence for which a maximum sentence of 3 years and a fine of €375,000.
This decision confirms that there will indeed be a trial in a case that can be described as a family saga of one of the richest families in France in which the mother and daughter are attacked and the fight for the management of the cosmetic empire L'Oréal.
However, the 15th Criminal Court also ordered a medical examination of 87-year-old Liliana Bettencourt, which should be carried out by a college of three doctors.
The heiress and the main shareholder of L'Oréal has always refused to undergo such an examination, certainly not under the terms offered by the Nanterre prosecutor's office during the investigation.
Doctors who will be elected on Friday should draw up a report by 10 March 2010 while giving comments on whether Liliana Bettencourt could have been in a state of weakness and in which period.
I think he's going to go through with it.
I will speak to her about the matter, said Bettencourt's lawyer, Georges Kiejman, the lawyer, after the hearing.
As for the lawyer, François Bettencourt-Meyers, Olivier Metzner, welcomed the court's decision.
It's an excellent message(...). Expertise will show that he has been manipulated by this old lady who needs protection (M. Banier), he confirmed.
It is two years since Liliana Bettencourt's only daughter opened criminal proceedings against François-Marie Banier, a photographer and an all-artist who she accuses of using her mother's long-term situation to receive a gift of €1bn in cheques, life insurance contracts or paintings by the masters.
Liliane Bettencourt, on the other hand, has always denied being manipulated by a photographer whom she considers a long-term friend.
While the court had to assess the legitimacy of the lawsuit filed by Mrs. Bettencourt-Meyers, the attorneys' courtroom's courtesy at times changed into the family hour of the truth.
Liliana Bettencourt's lawyer, he submitted three letters to his client (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) by his notary, in which she expressed her distrust of her husband, Françoisa Bettencourt-Meyers.
In a 2003 letter, Liliane Bettencourt adds, according to the attorney,: "You could explain to my daughter that I wrote to Banier once or twice a day for fifteen years.
I've never been able to speak to Françoise since she got married."
The Crown Prosecutor's Office in Nanterre reunited that the complainant's actions were not justified, all the more so because the guardianship judge had these days rejected her request to open legal proceedings for her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "is fully able to attend the court, is not under protection or custody.
No one else will act for her," confirmed the prosecutor's office, Marie-Christine Daubigney.
The court eventually decided to comment on Ms Bettencourt-Meyers's legitimacy at the time of the start of the trial.
A management revolution or the end of economic intelligence?
If nothing changes in the management of the big French companies, our fight for the development of economic intelligence has been pointless...
For more than a decade, it has been reminiscent of the behaviour of large companies' management towards employees towards consumers before the marketing revolution: it is about associates identifying with the "values" destined from the mountain, as was the case before, when the consumer had to be forced into the products that emerged from the ideas of the heads of the factory technicians.
By becoming a center of business companies, the customer has compared the marketing revolution's strategy of conquering the market in the right direction...though authoritarian efforts to impose products, different from customer preferences, are returned on a regular basis!
Passive access for employees can lead to deadly demoralisation.
Suicides in France Telecom, PSA or Renault are only a visible part of a much more widespread general phenomenon that encroaches on predominantly managerial cadres.
This demobilisation adversely affects the development of all the intellectual functions of society, including R&D, and, more importantly, economic intelligence.
And indeed, EI "requires from all stakeholders (...) the active approach and the ability to anticipate" and requires employees commitments that are completely at odds with the incomes of authoritarian management.
We are therefore calling for a managerial revolution, which would aim to put workers at the centre of interest as well as the client.
The relative usefulness of internal opinion polls.
Internal opinion polls - as a questionnaire submitted to Orange's employees - will contribute to the revolution in managerial procedures?
Unfortunately, I'm afraid not.
Mainly because I have already convinced myself that in the face of a new situation, the structure will return to the first thing after various digressions to... what they have always done!
Furthermore, because authoritarianism, as one of the pathologies of power, is increased in proportion to the seriousness of its own failures.
Finally, because most of the managers have a simplified view of human behavior.
Because they are graduates of colleges for engineers, they have a mechanical interpretation of psychology.
For the sake of thought convenience, they adopt an old behaviorist theory, now revived by "neuroves" from the US and widely disseminated without much knowledge of the scientific institutes and the media.
With the fact that it is possible to move the "pachs" (sic) involvement of managers, a recent Ipsos survey showed on the Figaro.fr website, which only confirms the managers in their position of mechanical management, unsuitable for today's world.
Identify and measure the mobility factors.
On the contrary, the managerial revolution necessary for the proper functioning of modern businesses presupposes the adoption of a final vision of human behavior.
It is to include a basic observation in all intentions and management practices: For employees, commitments to the business will only be possible if they appear to be a clear means of achieving their dreams, ambitions and projects.
Currently, this concept of employee motivation is only covered by studies Motively functional analysis.
These studies have shown to assess their businesses on the basis of a predetermined doxy that will enable them to assess, through an image that tells the enterprise, what it offers them to realise their life's goals.
By identifying and measuring these mobility factors, executives can control, anticipate and anticipate their "social performance" and bring their human resource management "on the right path" to the right way.
In doing so, it creates a breeding ground for the development of solid and effective economic intelligence.
Speech from Oslo: "just war" Obama has earned praise from the right.
The American right on Friday welcomed a speech Barack Obama gave the day before in Oslo, satisfied that the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize winner was defending the concept of a "fair war" against the enemies of the United States.
The Conservatives, who at first mocked the award for Obama on October 9, applauded the presidential speech, including Sarah Palin, the former vice-president's nominees for the 2008 election.
I liked what he said, Palin, the muse of the right-wing Republican wing, told USA Today, adding that she herself had expressed herself on the subject of the "sometimes necessary" of the war in her memoirs, which are just coming out.
Of course, war is the last thing the Americans would like to do, but it is necessary.
All terrorists need to be apprehended there, he believes.
President Obama, who inherited two wars in Afghanistan and Iraq from his predecessor, George W. Bush, justified sending forces in Oslo on Thursday and used a speech to clarify his decision to send an additional 30,000 troops to Afghanistan nine days before that.
Another of Obama's opponents, Newt Gingrich, assessed that the president had done a "very good job" in Oslo.
I think the speech was really very good, congratulated by the former Speaker of the House of Representatives, who particularly appreciated the President's mention of the 'existence of evil in the world'.
In a way, I found this speech entirely historic, Gingrich said during the interview on Radio "The Takeaway."
The former MP, whom some consider to be a possible Republican candidate in the 2012 presidential election, was delighted to see the "left-wing president" be reminded of the members of the Nobel Prize committee," that they themselves would not be free to present the Peace Prize award if the use of forces did not exist."
According to Michael Gerson, the former author of the speeches, George W. Bush, now the Washington Post editor, Obama has given "a very American speech."
Not only did he introduce himself as a "salt-creature" as he always did, but he "calling like the US president" and reminded the Europeans " that they live in a safe bubble that they have not created themselves, and that they are not doing too much to preserve," Gerson assessed.
Among the few right-handed discontent are the Bush-era hawk, former UN ambassador John Bolton, who called the speech "united, pompous and without inspiration," as he reported on the National Review Online website.
To the left of the president, Democratic representative Dennis Kucinich, for example, is appalled at the sight of Barack Obama justifying the use of forces.
"When we wrap the war in the cover of justice, we can easily justify the massacre of innocent people," he warned.
However, the mid-left press holds a laudatory position against the president.
Although the Los Angeles Times continues to find the award of the Peace Prize to be premature to be to Obama, it has assessed his output as an "over-performance" even for the speaker known for his talent.
The Oslo speech should serve as a guide to international decisions in conflict resolution, in the fight against poverty and oppression," the California daily says ferving.
Obama "created the speech to what it needed to be," the New York Times reviewed, and called the speech "shalled and instructive."
Road carriers: three marathons to a deal to save the supply of supplies for Christmas.
After three marathons, the union of the road hauliers and the TLF, the only employers' organisation left until the end, came to an agreement on Friday evening to end, which ended the call for a strike and a threat that hung over the supply of supplies for Christmas.
At the signing of the agreement on Friday, the State Secretary for Transport, Dominique Bussereau, expressed his "radity" after several negotiations that began on Wednesday morning.
After the second night of the discussion, the negotiators split early Friday morning with the hope that the text of the agreement would be signed as quickly as possible at the end of the morning.
This is despite the fact that three employers' organisations (FNTR, Unostra, OTRE) have resigned from the negotiations.
But it took another more than six hours of meeting, which began at 11 o'clock to all agree and sign the agreement at 6 p.m.
This conflict would "wend to hurt businesses greatly" and "we would be in danger of disrupting the holidays at the end of the year," Bussereau said.
The text contains a 4% wage increase for the lowest salaries (for local and regional road transport) and 2.9% for the highest salaries (international transport).
The hourly wage for the lowest salaries is increased from €8.72 to €9.06.
It's not much, but there's a lot of effort behind it, explained Patrice Clos (FO).
Tonight, we're going to give our members an order to blockades, no blockades of supply centers.
But there may be a few more opponents who are not satisfied," he added.
Philippe Grillot, president of the TLF, welcomed the "right deal," although it was difficult to admit a high-level pay increase given the international competition ".
According to him, there will be an increase of 170 euros per month for the lowest wages and by €100 to €120 for the highest.
It is an agreement of common sense and respect for employees, CMaxime Dumont (CFDT) said, while Thierry Douine (CFTC) welcomed the "historical agreement."
According to Richard Jaubert (CGT), this is a "acceptable compromise."
The agreement also envisages a 3% revalanor of travel expenses and a report on the situation of road transport in the first half of 2010, which will also allow a focus on the issue of 13th salary and the modernisation of the collective agreement.
Bussereau recalled the "reinforction of €100 million in taxes on business wages" which was the subject of the government's amendment to the draft Budget for the 2009 Budget, which was voted on on the night of Thursday to Friday by the National Assembly.
The government will ask the Senate for a "sign" vote.
The signing allows this agreement to apply first to undertakings which are members of that organisation to the whole field, in the event of an extension by the Ministry of Labour.
It will take place "at the shortest possible date," Bussereau assured.
The whole process can only be hinder the opposition of employers' organisations.
The FNTR talks of a "bad trade" as €100 million "alseer to be offered to compensate for part of the carbon tax sector."
The Secretary of State for Transport forced us to act in an emergency session not as a result of the analysis with each other, but to keep the turkey's eaters from froze at the time of the upcoming Christmas holidays, Unostra complained.
For Otre, the agreement threatens to "make large numbers of small and medium-sized enterprises in the field" in the next 12 months.
Suburban trains RER A: disruption of transport at the weekend, unions dissatisfied with the proposals of the transport undertaking RATP.
The intermuture of traffic on the RER A commuter line, which is the largest public transport line in France in France, will continue over the weekend, as Friday's meeting between the unions and the RATP management on the second day of the strike did not lead to any specific results on the issue of the premium's request.
On Saturday and Sunday, the days of an important shopping weekend before Christmas, trains will run only between 10 a.m. and 8 p.m., on the main section (between La Défence and Nation) there will be every other train, outside this section only one of the four trains.
The link with SNCF will be interrupted at Nanterre Préfecture and passengers will be forced to transfer to another train.
Galeries Lafayette's commercial homes, which expect over 200,000 customers every day, welcomed the fact that "the RATP was trying to secure a link with the big store's stores."
The RER A line runs from the west to the east of the Paris agglomeration.
The RATP-managed section runs from Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre to Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, one of the two trains was in the rush hour, and virtually no train was running off-peak at the time, as planned.
As on Thursday, the people of Ile de France arranged differently and there was no confusion on the platforms.
So early in the morning there were far fewer people than usual in the station Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines), among other things because the pupils and students were absent.
Jack Nbakina, engineer, 29 from Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne) explained that he had risen "an hour and a half earlier to be sure he'd arrived on time."
The station Saint-Lazare was not overcrowded, the state railway SNCF announced, as a larger number of order attendant and vigilantes were predicted to be forecast.
Suburban RER A trains operated by SNCF in the direction from or to Cergy-Le-Haut arrived or departed from Saint-Lazare station with a metro line.
The next general meetings of the strikers will be held on Saturday and Sunday to assess the results of Friday's afternoon meeting with the management, which the union rated "weak."
The RER management proposes to negotiate a special protocol for RER A suburban trains in all respects, working time arrangements, career progress, etc.
However, this is not the point for drivers who are demanding a well-deserved bonus, according to Thierra Garon (Unions of Jih).
RATP even postponed the premium proposals for the time being, which scorped the CGT, with the management "not capable of solving the problem, while for travelers and SNCF it was possible."
At a new meeting scheduled for Monday, "take a review of the conditions of the profession" to be reviewed," he clarified to RATP.
Which was the reason why the union members thought the business was "making fun of the weekend's passengers."
In the morning, about 150 drivers were occupied by a company committee at its Paris headquarters.
The management, which until now has refused any discussion during the strike, has therefore decided to meet in order to "reinquire."
There is a danger that the conflict will spread to the RER B line on Tuesday, after Unsa and the Independent announce a strike alert.
The unions are asking for a bonus between €120 and €150 (€150 of them in variables (CGT, FO, CFDT, Sud (South), Indépendants (Independent) and make it difficult for them to deteriorate working conditions on this route, which carry a million passengers per day.
RER suburban train drivers earn between €2,200 and €7,700 of gross wages and €600 of premiays for irregular working hours and for work on Sundays and holidays at a more advanced time of their careers.
The Turkish judiciary has dissolved the Kurdish side, and the decision carries severe consequences.
Turkey's Constitutional Court on Friday decided to abolish the country's main pro-Kurdish party, and this decision immediately triggered protest demonstrations in the Kurdish community in the south-east of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision can greatly complicate the task of a government seeking to give the Kurdish community a friendly hand to try to end the 25 years of conflict.
The Democratic Society (DTP) party was dissolved because it became a "price of activities threatening the independence of the state and its indivisible unity," Chief Justice Chief Justice Hasim Kilic told reporters after four days of negotiations.
The decision was taken unanimously by 11 judges, when it took a majority-seven vote to dissolve the party, Kiliç said, adding that the 37 party cadres, including its president, Ahmet Türk, and MEP Aysela Tugluk, were banned from participating in political life for five years.
At the same time, the judge announced the annulment of the parliamentary immunity of Mr Türk and Ms Tugluk and the confiscation of the assets of the Ministry of Finance.
The DTP has 21 seats in the Parliament (of 500).
The party leadership had already warned before the verdict that MPs would rather leave Parliament than act as MPs without political affiliation.
The decision is a continuation of the trial initiated in 2007 by the prosecutor of the Court of Cassation, Abdurrahman Yalcinkay, who accuses DTP of obedience to the "guides" of the Workers' Party of Kurdistan (PKK), which Ankara and many countries consider a terrorist organisation.
Many observers believe that DTP is a legal political case for the rebels of the PKK.
The party assures that it has no "farea link" with the PKK, but refuses to label it as a terrorist organisation and calls on the government to negotiate with it.
The court's verdict comes as the government gives the Kurdish community a friendly hand and offers a series of measures to strengthen their rights and attempt to limit the support of the Kurds against the PKK to end the conflict.
DTP leadership has confirmed that the dissolution of the party could lead to a resumption of tensions in southeastern Anatolia, where many demonstrations have degenerated in recent weeks against the conditions under which PKK leader Abdullah Öcalan is being held into clashes with the police.
Since the announcement of the justice decision, thousands of demonstrators have gathered outside the DTP headquarters in Diyarbakir, a large town in the southeast that are inhabited mainly by the Kurds.
Police used tear grenades and water cannons, and protesters threw Molotov cocktails or shot stones from slingshots.
Also in Istanbul, about a hundred people demonstrated.
After the verdict was reached, Mr Türk said that the justice decision would only "whip overtake despair."
Turkey cannot resolve this issue with a ban on the party, he said in the press.
The government, formed by the party arising from the Islamist movement, also condemned the decision.
We are against the disrupting of the parties.
It solves nothing, said Minister of Energy Taner Yildiz.
This decision is a complete shattering of democratic proposals launched by the government, commented political scientist Ahmet Insel.
Of course, we may see a reaction from the PKK, he added.
On Thursday, the PKK claimed responsibility for one of the most deadly attacks in the north of Turkey, which killed seven soldiers three days earlier.
Snow may come
Pretty crunchy winter, that's what Wolfgang Brauburger wants.
Not because he would like to bully citizens, says the head of the FES Technical Services Department of Winter.
But to allow his employees to test and learn how to control all the vehicle technology.
This could happen for the first time this weekend, according to meteorologists.
Over 300 employees and 120 vehicles are ready to take care of the snow and ice.
At the same time, the FES is proceeding according to the exact plan.
Once it snows in Frankfurt across the board and temperatures drop below zero, they will travel to 20 so-called sections A of the big drecks, explains Brauburger.
These sections include main and transit routes such as Neue Weg and Hanauer Landstraße.
But also arrivals for firefighters, commuter public transport lines, pedestrian areas and descending sections like Atzelbergstraße.
The FES service starts at 3 a.m.
If necessary, it is necessary to sprinkle with damp salt, which holds better, in the course of a maximum of three hours, something like 1040 kilometres.
That's why the FES begins at 3:00 a.m. "to make the roads open when the right to get to work."
It's difficult when it only starts snowing at 7:30.
Then we have a problem, says the head of the Technical Services Department of Winter, "because no one is willing to make room for the sprinkle."
Only when they are not so fled as to, are there are the driveways and interconnection communications, which also include Rat-Beil-Straße.
The last priority is for the side and side roads.
Brauburger knows they'll complain.
At five o'clock in the morning, the FES infantrymen will set off, preferably cleaning up dangerous places and crossings.
FES usually can't take care of all bike paths.
There is a special service in Frankfurt that mainly tracks bridges from 22 to 4.30, says Brauburger.
As ice is formed quickly on them, the sprinklers come out as soon as the temperature falls below two degrees.
If necessary, they will be called by the police.
Cibles of dinosaurs
Tawa hallae looked like a lot of other carnivorous dinosaurs: An anchor two meters long and 1.50 meters high ran at two strong hind limbs, had an elongated skull with sharp, curved teeth, short forelich legs with sickle clawed and long tail.
If this species had lived a few million years later, it would have been nothing out of the ordinary.
Sterling Nesbitt of the University of Texas in Austin and colleagues in Thursday's edition of Science magazine write that Tawa hallae was one of the first dinosaurs with these bodily traits.
The pégra lived about 215 million years ago in what is now New Mexico, which was then in the equatories dry area of the supercontinent Pangea.
Tawa opens a new window to earlier evolution of dinosaurs, says Nesbitt.
He shows us a lot about kinship relationships, extensions and signs of early dinosaurs.
In 2006, Nesbitt and other paleontologists began excavating at Ghost Ranch in north New Mexico.
Sometime in one day we found a dozen dinosaur bones, this is unprecedented for the sediment of the triassa, reports team member Randall Irmis of the Museum of Natural History in Utah.
Some of the bones were identified by scientists quickly as a new species.
During the excavation, they collected the remains from a total of five individuals.
The discovery is confirmed by theories of the early history of dinosaurs.
The name "Tawa" comes from the sun god of the Hopi Indians.
To Sterling Nesbitt, it's an unusual find: "The dinosaur foosie of the Triassus is very rare, mostly there are only individual fragments."
Other dinosaur experts do not share this enthusiasm without reservation.
This finding is not particularly sensational, but it confirms some of theories about the early history of the dinosaurs, says Martin Sander of the University of Bonn.
In its current scientific opinion, the dinosaurs first appeared some 230 million years ago.
But many of the oldest fossils are not complete, so the assignment of pradinosaurs is mostly questionable.
Experts discuss, for example, when the lizers split into the three most important developmental lines: the carnivorous theropods, which later included the Tyranranosaurus rex, Velociraptor, as well as the birds, the "long-root" four-legged sauropods and their relatives, and herbivores Ornithischia (take-take), which included the likes of Triceratops and Stegosaurus.
Tawa hallae is the original therapy after the analysis of Nesbitt and his colleagues.
It exhibits an interesting combination of primitive and advanced properties, says Nesbitt.
On the Tawa hallae skull, researchers found evidence of aerial bags, which is also held by offspring of the teropods by birds.
The air sacs make bird breathing more effective than mammals.
At Tawa hallae, the spine bones were apparently partly filled with air.
Tawa is the oldest and most primitive theropod with air bags, says Randall Irmis.
As the related line of huge sauropods later also had air bags and light bones, this useful innovation was probably already created by the common ancestor of the two groups.
At least three migratory waves to North America
Because the most primitive dinosaurs still known lived in South America, scientists inferred that the lichini had first appeared there.
According to this, the three evolutionary lines were already divided up early and spread from South America to all the continents that formed a one-salty Earth mass at the time as the supercontinent of Pangea.
It would also be said for the fact that the team, along with Tawa hallae, found the remains of two others, not especially closely related to the theropods.
The three of them can't come from one common, poise-twisted ancestor, the scientists argue.
We believe there have been at least three migration waves to North America, says Alan Turner of the American Museum of Natural History in New York, co-author of the scientific study.
Of course, there are also contradictions.
One even older species, Silesaurus, which belongs to a group of the heaviest dinosaurs, lived in today's Poland, says Bonn paleontologist Martin Sander.
His conjecture could put together a distorted image, because very many primitive dinosaur fossils have been preserved in South America, with rare times found on other continents.
As the dinosaurs proved, that they evolved from the relatively rare secondary line of the reptile family to the ruling vertebrates on earth in the days of the Earth's Middle Ages, it still remains a puzzle.
During the Triassa, the dinosaurs shared their living space with many more reptiles, such as the ancestors of today's crocodiles and flying lichicurs and countless other livers.
Around the end of the triass, the dinosaurs spread around the world and evolved many new species, while the relatives died out and the interface of the Triassic and Jurassic.
The history of success did not last forever
There are two hypotheses to explain this change, says Martin Sander.
There could have been a mass extinction that the dinosaurs accidentally survived, but not the reptiles.
Or the dinosaurs had adapted better, so they could push out the competition.
The history of success did not last forever, anyway.
150 million years later, a meteorite impact helped another group of animals that had also developed into the triasso and had lived in the shade ever since: the mammals.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and the signatories are international.
The list includes professors at University Toronto, University of Cambridge, Vienna University, or Berkeley, California.
Associate at the docents from Naples, Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Bremen joined.
The police evlocation of the occupied casino of Frankfurt's Goethe University has made a global uproar.
The 278 professors and teachers of the University of Goethe, as well as universities across Germany, Europe and North and South America, have been solidarised with protesting students at the Westend campus.
In a statement written in German and English, they "didn'l" the presidies-spent police intervention.
Because the walls and works of art were scrawled, the university president, Werner Müller-Estler, had the building vacated by the striking students and lecturers occupied last week.
At the same time, five students were injured.
Damaged things, the signatories say, do not justify the "violent dissolution of self-organized teaching of students and teaching police commandos."
The clearing is an "unacceptable intervention" in the freedoms of research and science.
The ancindic focus on vandalism is used to "unjust the legality and criminalization of the protest" and distracts from the content.
The precision avoided the necessary discussion.
The Lee-talenters call for the prosecution to be discontinued.
It is claimed that most of the strikers did not support material damage.
A justified protest
The youth of the trade union Verdi and the German trade union are also solidarising with students.
The protest is a legitimate expression of growing concern for one's own future, says the mysterious Earth Youth, Verdi Alexander Klein.
Meanwhile, Hesse Minister of Science Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU) has defends the advance of the university president and the police.
We are grateful to the University President.
Destroying and casting are completely unacceptable means, she said in Aktuellen Stunde (Current E.C.) in the Wiesbaden Landtag.
We are sympathetic to the protest, but we have no sympathy for vandalism, said the member of the country's CDU, Peter Beuth.
Otherwise, the opposition factions of the SPD, the Greens and Linke saw it.
The CDU takes the painted walls to be an excuse to criminalize the protest, said Janine Wissler (Linke).
Instead of looking at the arguments and demands of the learners, there was a vacation.
Linke has filed a motion calling on the Home Secretary to report on the police deployment.
New Silicon-Valley
For years, it had been in favour of a secret city, inaccessible to visitors from the west.
Zelenograd, one of the ten districts of the capital of Moscow, in the Soviet Union, was a heavily guarded site where secret weapons research was conducted.
Today, this district of 216,000 people, 37 kilometres from the Moscow city centre, is considered to be the "Russian Silicon Valley."
There are significant micro- and nanoelectronic research and production centres.
Since September 2008, Green Nativegrad representatives have made contacts with the Frankfurt Science Center Riedberg - with the university institutions and the firm of the Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ).
There were several mutual visits and on Wednesday they signed the "Protocol on cooperation" in Frankfurt, Zelenograd and Ridberg.
The Russian delegation was led by Moscow's Vice Mayor Yuri Rosly Yoelly Rosly and the prefect of Zelengrad, Anatoly Smirnov, and was signed by the head of planning officer Edwin Schwarz for Frankfurt.
In 2010, representatives of the FIZ and SMEs engaged in science research will go to the Greengrad seminar.
Scientific exchange
This is a continuous scientific exchange.
But it is also about economic relations.
The FIZs will be allowed to take hold in the growing Russian market.
Russian scientific firms, on the other hand, want to get contracts in Germany.
Zelenograd is the headquarters of major Russian research institutes and companies.
These include the Moscow Institute of Electronics, the large concerns Sitronics and Rossiyskaya Elektronika.
The district was founded in 1958 as a so-called "socialist planned city" for weapons research.
Zelenograd (the literal translation "The Green City") has acquired its name according to the wooded hilly landscape, which is planted with research facilities.
Stuttgart brake
The dimension of Stuttgart 21 is not at all prepared.
For the project's fans, this is quite simply a 'new heart of Europe'.
Okay. The S21 is more than the launch of the station, a more than monstrous structure that pluck the capital of Baden-Württemberg into desperate building chaos for a century.
Stuttgart 21 originated from the spirit of the 1980s.
The dormitories, which ended up in the city centre, were then considered to be 19th-century transport-technical fossils, which act as the brakes of modern rail transport, as it took an enormous amount of time to cross the locomotives from behind in the forefront.
Go, stop for a while, keep going - that's how it should work.
And that's why the head stations are disappearing: Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: the transit station, which lies about halfway along the route of the trans-European railway line between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava - hence the slogan about the "heart of Europe."
It is indeed starting with the S21 although the 1980s' vision is no longer compatible with reality.
The very ambitious designers themselves recognized that in the Hessen and Bavarian cities, the start of construction was almost unfunded.
Since modern shuttle trains have been in place with motor and driving vehicles at both ends, the head stations no longer have trouble hinging and hinging out.
Still: It starts with Stuttgart 21 including the new ICE to Ulm track.
It was pushed by the country's and municipal politicians.
The runs are cooperating, also because the risks of the largest individual infrastructure project in the Republic are borne by the taxpayer and not by the state group.
Urbanistically, the project can still be excused in some way.
There will be a new urban space that - if we believe the designer's computer images - will contain much greenery.
For the rail transport system, the S21 is harmful.
The passable railway station and the construction of the line are for passenger transport, which - typically in the 1980s - was attributed to a huge increase.
Back then, there was no competition for cheap flights.
But modern transport policy must be about boosting freight, because rail transport is far greener than the lorry on the road.
But the new line is not suitable for freight trains due to the steep climbs.
More seriously, the S21 indirectly affects a lot of other rail projects.
The Švábsk was to be buried a good six billion euros.
That's the official number.
Experts consider ten to 15 billion to be real.
It is clear that in the next decade there will be a shortage of funding for other knot points and bottlenecks in the network.
There are sixty larger projects on the Department of Transportation's list.
One of the most important is the construction of the roughly 180-kilometre-long route through the Rhine valley.
It has been building on this route at a slow pace since 1987.
You'd need to push hard here.
But the S21 will be like a brake.
The line through the Rhine will become the neck of a bottle of international freight transport: right in the heart of Europe.
Government examines airport ruling
The country's government has left the Wiesbaden Landtag Open to go against the judgment of the Hessen Administrative Court of Justice (VGH) regarding the ban on night flights and has it revised.
The CDU/FDP coalition has instructed experts to legally examine the more than 400-page VGH ruling, said Economy Minister Dieter Posch (FDP).
VGH in Kassel explained in writing today that the state would have to re-tapped a night-time ban on flights in the event of the planned northwest runway of Frankfurt Airport.
The authorisation of 17 flights between 23 and 5 a.m., as the provincial government foresees, does not correspond to the statutory protection of the population against night air noise.
The coalition must decide by 4 January if it will demand a revision of the judgment.
The opposition criticised the postponement and rated it to the government's representatives to renounced the revision of the Federal Administrative Court in Leipzig.
The head of the SPD faction, Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel, called on the CDU and the FDP to revisit the promises it had made to ban night flights it had made before being elected. Otherwise, it is possible to view this as "breaking the word."
It's bloody hard, if you can keep your word, said the Greens leader, Tarek Al-Wazir, in reference to the FDP's election slogan, "We're keeping the word."
Minister Posch rejected the rebuke of Schäfer-Gümbel, the Landtiming the Government is trying to get to its night's flights by "overwraining the law and tricks."
The precise legal control takes its time.
The Coalition does not want to work on the basis of a "rapid first impression."
We need a realistic decision, said Stefan Müller (FDP).
His faction's statements to ban night flights have never been as given by the opposition.
US banks repaying aid
American, cruder-trocked big banks are getting rid of state restraints.
Bank of America repaid aid from the Tarp Banking Rescue Fund, a total of $45 billion (around €30 billion) at the same time on Wednesday.
According to a report by US-based CNBC, Citigroup is also planning to repay state aid.
The Constitution is thus intended to be disposed of by the restrictions that were made by the acceptance of money - a cap on the payment of bonuses to managers and the payment of high fees.
Bank of America has procured a well $19 billion of net money from investors with converge bonds.
She took the remainder of the amount from her coffers, which were filled, among other things, with trade union sales.
The bank's chief executive, Kenneth Lewis, explicitly thanked the US taxpayer on Wednesday night: The money injection helped us through the difficult time.
The cash institution was hurt at the top of the financial crisis by taking over the investment bank Merrill Lynch.
Citigroup also wants to free itself from its obligations to the state by procuring money in the capital market.
CNBC reported, citing sources, that the US bank could have announced a capital increase of around $20 billion earlier on Thursday.
A Citigroup spokesman would not comment.
In June, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley were already repaid in aid.
Quick Choice
It was going faster than expected.
The station introduced a successor to the successor just two weeks after the ZDF board pushed editor-in-chief, Nikolaus Brender, from the office.
Last night, the board wanted to settle on the person.
The favourite was Peter Frey, head of the ZDF studios in the capital in Berlin.
But the station has not confirmed this - officially, to avoid overtovate the process.
But the role could also have been played because they did not want to harm ZDF intendant Markus Schächter if the proposal failed with the board of directors.
Frey, Schächter's candidate, needs the support of nine of the 14 members of the board.
The outcome of the vote was not known before the deadline for this edition.
Two weeks ago, Schächter crashed out on the board of directors with his proposal to extend the contract with Nikolaus Brender for a further five years.
Only seven members voted for Brender, seven against him. Brender's loss of the mandate was a bitter defeat for Schächter, though it was to be expected.
Indeed, a EU major on the board had been signalling weeks before the election that it did not want to confirm Brender in office.
The opposition to the editor-in-chief was orchestrated by Hessen's Prime Minister Roland Koch.
He refused to remain in the high-weighted editor's office by arguing that the ZDF news broadcasting surveillance quotas had fallen under Brender.
Until shortly before the election, protests were therefore being sharply criticized in which political influence on the ZDF was sharply criticized.
The last time, the debate was even conflailered by 35 state law lawyers, who view Koch's approach as unconstitutional.
It was no good.
About the Person
Peter Frey was born on August 4, 1957, in Bingen.
He studied politics, pedagogy and romanistics.
He then worked for Südwestfunk and Frankfurter Rundschau.
1983 Frey went to ZDF, first to the "heute-journal."
Other stations: 1988 to 1990 personal editor-in-chief's personal deskcased director; 1991/92 correspondent in Washington; until 1998 leading and moderator of "Morgenmagazins"; until 2001 head of foreign policy at ZDF; then head of ZDF's chief studio.
After being deposed by Brender, who was voted the expert Medium Magazine journalist of the year on Wednesday, the Greens announced that they would file a constitutional lawsuit.
Koch's opponent on the board of directors, Rhenko-Falc's Prime Minister Kurt Beck, explained last week that the federal states should amend the state treaty with ZDF so that the intendant's staff proposals could not be blocked by a politically motivated majority.
But Beck also refused to expel party politicians from the ZDF supervisory boards.
Brenden's presumed successor, Peter Frey, commanded the board with a clever chess move - he strongly criticized the board for that immediately after the removal of Brender.
Thanks to this evidence of journalistic independence, he could nominate him for the post of editor-in-chief without losing his face, so he could be elected by the board of directors without being under suspicion of being pushed into office by the party leader.
In the party arithmetic, Frey is ranked as a left-wing liberal anyway.
Studies get rid of junk
Part of the success for students: After a year of striking, the ministers of culture finally went to the Länder on Thursday: At the conference of Ministers of Culture and University Rectors, both parties agreed that there was a will to improve the learning conditions for bachelor's and masters.
Students should be able to master their studies in the future.
Specifically, they agreed to reduce the load on the tests: Fundamentally, each study module should be completed with one single examination.
In addition, the workload of learners should be checked and a 'revocable and defensible degree' should be guaranteed.
In this hand, policymakers and colleges want to simplify the recognition of exams between universities in Germany and abroad.
The Lands undertake to create a more flexible, flexible, joint structural awards for bachelor's and master's degree courses.
Earth's deviations should cease to exist.
Fewer tests
Since the start of the student protests in the worm, the culture ministers and the university's rectors had winged words about better study in their mouths.
Now they are filled with concrete content for the first time.
The so-called Accreditation Board decided to reduce the number of examinations in part drastically: "Each module will generally be completed by one test," the 30-page report reads, which is to be partly newly regulated by the approval of the fields of study.
"Simmerly lower exam burden," said the chairman of the accreditation council, Reinhold Grimm, to be "fat by a flawed development that significantly reduced the intensity of the study."
For this, the "troadicity of the study" in the future is to be a "decisorable criterion" in implementation.
Modules and contents are "must be hard to recheck" to "unnecessarily not restrict learners in the election
seminars."
Students would have a "a step on the space that allows and supports their own initiative."
The rules are to apply when approving new fields of study, but also for existing fields of study.
These need to be "re-credited" every five years – but this means that it will take until 2015 before all the fields of study are reviewed.
There are ten accreditation agencies responsible for this throughout Germany, subject to accreditation boards set up by the Länder.
Culture ministers called on the "densive" federal states in October to act on the agencies in such a way that the subject of the apprenticeship was not too great and the exam regime was not strict.
In the various Länder, universities and universities have already agreed with the provincial ministries on appropriate measures.
As the only country so far, the Rhineland-Palatinos has pledged additional funds to develop the Bologna Process.
Of the money, universities should primarily cover consulting programmes and study consultancy, and strengthen the test and foreign authorities.
That's what countries and colleges want to spend ten million euros.
At the beginning of 2010, he wants to administer an amendment to the Higher Education Act to Parliament.
According to her, only one single test should be needed to terminate the study module.
Forming the study should be even more flexible, to ensure the recognition of examinations from other universities and to make it easier to make the master's available.
By the end of next year, the challenging of all fields of study in the country should be re-assembled.
The government and the opposition were again arguing about the country's learning conditions on Thursday.
In addition to the praise, the resolution was also criticized.
The Federal Directors of Juso's Higher Education Groups called for the education policy to be not taken up in the future "behind the closed doors" of ministers and university rectors.
At the latest after the strike, "the word should be spoken for at least" by students as the persons concerned.
Future academics also received support from the president of the Conference of the Education Rectors' Conference (HRK), Margreta Wintermantel: "We need the experience of students," she said at a meeting with culture ministers on Thursday, with whom HRK consulted on a joint reform report.
According to the Education and Science Department (GEW), the Bonn resolutions have not gone far enough: They are demanding a legal claim that would allow any graduate with a bachelor's degree in an Olympic master's degree.
Second, the federal states must ensure that today's Bachelor's degree students' generation of students are available tomorrow with the best possible study terms, GEW board member Andreas Keller said.
The federal countries must employ far more lecturers.
But the culture ministers have not commented on the free access to the master's programmes.
More than a footnote to Herta Müller
Getting to Germany and out is nice, almost no control..." reads the opening line of one of the poem of the poet Werner Söllner, who, in this torn-out language, themes the experience of arriving at the time of one dissident who gained his freedom but also lost his linguistic environment.
Werner Söllner was born in 1951 in the Romanian Banat, Romania, working first as a German and English teacher in Bucharest and later as a lecturer in a children's book publishing house, then relocating to Frankfurt am Main in 1982.
Söllner was awarded various literary awards, lecturing poetry at the legendary Goethe University of Frankfurt in 1993, and has been head of the Hesse Literature Forum in Mousonturm in Frankfurt since 2002.
He took care of a considerable extra-literous uproar stir last Tuesday at a seminar in Munich, which was "German literature in Romania in a mirror and a broken mirror of her safety act."
The clearly insecure and taken aback Söllner left a statement in which he confesses to fellow writers by the Romanian Germans, including Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodak and Helmuth Frauendorfer, admits to the cooperation as a secret informant of the Romanian secret service, the Securitate.
Together with some of the presenters, Söllner won the German Language Prize in 1989.
Attempts to recruit were said to have begun subtly, not until 1971.
I am, continued Söllner, "that is, someone who has not resisted sufficiently the attempted intimidation by the Securitate."
The poet Werner Söllner is a secret agent, Walter.
Almost at the same time as the award of the Nobel Prize to Herta Müller and her unparalleled literary deal with the mechanisms of the dictatorial government, the literary scene, and especially the community of German authors from Romania, is shaken by a case that marks the depths and the shamefulness of a political system that is based on control and spying.
Werner Söllner is not, at least if this can be said according to the current state of knowledge, only the perpetrator, but he is also a victim.
In the Securitate acts, the secret agent Walter played a role, Michael Markel said after Söllner's confession, referring to the positive effect on the undercover agent Walter.
"squar" me at the time on all the essentials to him, says Markel.
It has a moral obligation to make this comment.
Söllner's statement was unexpected in this form and in front of this audience, but absolutely surprising, the admission of the former dissident and his collaboration with the Romanian secret service is not.
Herta Müller wrote in July, when she read her own briefcases, 914 pages, that Germany was a pleasant reservation for the prickles of the Securitate.
The perise, one might assume, will speculate, and in some cases I guess, to know which name is hiding behind the code name Sorin, Voicu, and Walter, as well as Walter.
Other than in the domestic, meanwhile, very certain inspecting of the files of the Stazi files, the manipulation of the estate of the Securitate control is still very diffuse.
In recent years, systematic enlightenment has been obstrued and curtailed.
One of the Birthler authorities, which corresponds to the National Council for the Processing of the Securitate (CNSAS) files, was only established in 1999, the issue of the act has been rather lengthy since then.
Only since 2005 has there been a law that governs the administration of the files.
That the former Securitate members still had a lot of influence in Romania, one interview was substantiated after the publication of the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller, in which one of the former heads of the Securitate of Timisoani, commented with the award-winner.
He is said to have psychosis, after all, she has only been questioned once.
The inmation of power was expressed here quite indelactly in the form of freedom of expression.
Of course, there are inevitable questions about the Söllner case, as in the context of concealing wrongdoing.
Why now? Who has been hurt? The special reaction of the listeners on Söllner's admission is expected to be determined by the desire for knowledge rather than for blaming guilt and shame.
To the gene of Herta Müller's work, who accepted the Nobel Prize yesterday, it is more than a footnote.
Weat-releague deposit
It was as if a clean-dressed sales rep came from a cute Christmas party at which the sportswear manufacturer was handing out candy as he boarded a quarter of an hour after midnight to the summoned C-C-C Mercedes, the new coach, VfBr Christian Gross, accompanied by an orange-colored bag of a sponsor. ̈
A man with a striking bald bald man had been driven around him in a strange city for him.
Otherwise, he could drive himself - alcohol wasn't in play, and the 55-year-old was not drunk enough, too.
It's been a pleasant evening, but work will resume tomorrow.
Or it's just beginning.
In the words of the three days of the committed Swiss: "We reached the last eight," in the Champions League thanks to a 3-1 win over Unirea Urziceni of Romania, "but we must not be dazzled by success: It will be a brutally tough fight against the downhill."
"A more important task" faces us on Sunday.
It is important to repeat the performance of the royal class in Mainz even on an ordinary league day.
And to avoid the again-obvious weaknesses after three quick goals from Maricy (5th), Träsche (8.) and Pogrebnyak (11th).
Loos
The Champions League finals (catching 16./17. + 23/24 February/February/flip-final matches 9./10. + 16/17 March) will be drawn in Nyon on 18 December.
The joy of the onset of Babbel's successor will therefore remain preserved.
Not just for the supposed healer, who gave the precarious stuttgart professionals confidence, willingness to commitment and the joy of the game in a short time.
I went to the players and told them to focus on their strengths and urged them to be bolder, explained the soul healer Gross so simply-scented, but healing the Gross's simple-sout-anal-leaning successful recipe, which, under the influence of the therapist Babbel, showed no more effectiveness.
He sprawled a certain magic, admitted Babbel's follower, Jens Lehmann, "when a new impetus comes up in football, sometimes things happen that you wouldn't think possible."
And Sami Khedira, who after a multi-week injury break, became the best player on the pitch because of his dynamics, tried to describe the found "phenomenon" with the proverbial "fresh wind" and the work of the new supervisor: "He is a man who is radical and demands discipline.
That's what we need in the current situation."
It was clearly missing from Babbel.
VfB Stuttgart not yet saved, warns sports chairman Horst Heldt
VfB Stuttgart needs but more constancy.
Like Gross, the players and managers don't want to overestimate the victory against the weakened substitute and utterly overloaded defense of the Romanian guest.
They would have won in Glasgow before a nasty awakening came after the 0-4 defeat at Leverkusen, Khedira muses.
And the sports chairman, Horst Heldt, recalled that while one goal had been reached in the season, the other was still a long way off.
We're not in the clear yet.
That Heldt did not celebrate on his 40th birthday after his first home victory in three months was caused by the weekend's events, which were newly alive in the form of a television interview with goalkeeper Jens Lehmann just before the start of the match.
There are decisions that others and not Jens, Heldt replied to the harsh Lehmann's criticism.
He pitfed the board of directors with weak management and decided to change the coach after pressure from teenage fans.
Even the fact that he was cancelled his day off after the matches was described by Lehmann as a sign of the lack of sovereignty and envy.
Lehmann's statements "formululates pure egoism," Heldt replied, announcing the implications for the goalkeeper.
The two 40-year-olds will probably have no more joy in life.
Anyway, they're one with the others that without the job of a deposed coaching team, it would not be possible to perform such a gaming and combative performance.
Babbel and his assistants had a "great share of success," say Heldt and Lehmann in unison - and the man agrees with the plastic bag.
Battle of the World Heavyweight Championships
Passionate duel in Bern: Challenger Kevin Johnson constantly provoked the words and gestures of world champion Vitaly Klitschko.
However, after 12 hard rounds, the Ukrainian defended his heavyweight title of the WBC boxing organisation.
The referees' verdict was unanimous.
Hamburg - Vitaly Klitschko remains the heavyweight boxing world champion.
The 38-year-old WBC champion defeated American Kevin Johnson in Bern on Saturday night with points (120-108, 120-108, 119-109).
For Klitschko, this is the third successful title defence since his return in October 2008.
Prior to that, the Ukrainian was twice WBO and WBC world champion.
Unfortunately, it didn't turn out to be the No.o., which everyone expected.
Klitschko improved his record to 39 victories in 41 professional duels, was beaten twice by injuries.
Challenger Johnson was defeated for the first time in the 24th fight.
In front of some 17,000 spectators in the Bernsk arena, the 2.02-metre-high Klitschko duel was driven primarily by his left-high.
The 11 centimetre shorter Johnson, who was announcing the end of the Klitschko era before the duel, was pulling back before the world champions' strokes, so that Klitschko could not strike a decisive blow with his dangerous right.
In all, passive Johnson did little to the challenger, and he was just trying to get to the next rounds.
Klitschko provoked words and gestures, but his strikes rarely hit the world champion.
But even so, it is only the second boxer after Timo Hoffmann in 2000, who fought Klitschko for a full twelve rounds.
The challenger had taken care of the uproar in the Swiss capital before the duel.
He insulted Klitschko as a "sad zombie" that "creeds not really."
During the eighs on Friday, the champion was provoked, pulling off Johnson's sunglasses "so he can see his eyes."
Fourth victory after Klitschko's return
Klitschko remained undefeated after the fourth contest after his return on October 11, 2008.
After a nearly four-year hiatus, he defeated Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin and took back "his" WBC belt, which he had to hand in without a fight before.
He defeated Juan Carlos Gomez of Cuba in the title of defence this year and Chris Arreol of the USA in September.
In this fight I only got one shot and physically in good form, Klitschko justified a quick return to the ring.
But his dream remains to be the defence of all four important degrees in the family.
Brother Vladimir is the WBO and IBF world champion.
But the WBA is worn by Briton David Haye, after dethroning Nikolai Vulaev, the 2.13-metre-high throne in November.
Haye has this summer of the contest against Klitschko, who was scheduled for September.
He is reportedly planning to win the fight against Klitschko at Wembley Stadium in London.
The Kunduz case
The head-on attack from the opposition: The head of the Greens faction, Jürgen Trittin, called Defense Minister Guttenberg a liar about poor information about the Kundúz affair.
The SPD and Linke (Lee) are calling on the chancellor to provide an explanation.
Hamburg/Berlin - According to the latest findings on the Kunduz raid, the opposition believes that Defence Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) has committed conscious deception.
The minister said "consciously untruely untrue" on the sombard of two tankers in September, the head of the Greens faction, Jürgen Trittin, said on Saturday's news program ARD "Tagesschau."
Let's call it the usual expression: Lal.
The order to kill was issued in disregarding the rules of the International Security Forbusal Supporting Forces in Afghanistan (ISAF).
This is the essence of the report that NATO was reading by Mr. Guttenberg, Trittin said.
On Friday, it emerged that the attack was not only about destroying the hijacked trucks, but the targeted killing of two Taliban leaders.
The U.S. raid, requested by German commander of the Kunduz, Colonel Klein, was killed or injured by up to 142 people, according to a NATO investigation.
The Greens, the SPD and Linke called on Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) on Saturday to immediately comment before the Bundestag and also clarify what Guttenberg really knew about the event.
Mrs Merkel must explain whether the targeted killing strategy is part of the Afghan policy of the Bundestag - and if the Office of the Chancellor, the Bundeswehr and the intelligence service approved this new strategy, Jürgen Trittin and Greens' colleagues Renate Künastová called for.
Government spokesman Ulrich Wilhelm firmly rejected the criticism.
The chancellor's office has no influence on the specific deployment of the Bundeswehr in Afghanistan, he said.
There were also outrage doubts on Saturday about the Ministry's trial of the background to the dismissal of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and State Secretary Peter Wichert.
According to SPIEGEL's information, both of them informed Guttenberg correctly and completely of the background to the attack on the tankers.
Officially, it was said that they should have denied the existence of NATO reports and withdone the minister's sensitive details.
However, it was said from around the two top officials that they had even alerted the Ministry of Defence to several reports, among them a two-page document from the commanding Colonel Klein and one of the military police reports.
"Frankfurter Allgemeiner Sonntagszeitung" reports that Wichert should have asked in the letter to clarify the situation in the meantime.
It is noted that he has not yet received any response.
The Ministry did not comment on the criticisms on Saturday, pointing out that this would be dealt with in the Investigation Committee of the Bundestag, which will be established next Wednesday.
Worlds of Dreams
Some see images in the waking state and hear voices that others can't see or hear.
It is not only for the mentally ill or in the drug intoxication that the boundaries between imagination and reality come true.
As long as it happens in your sleep, everything's fine.
If we are lying with our eyes closed in our dark room, we are allowed to surround ourselves with the wildest notions and fantasy delusions.
But those who experience dreamlike states in vigilance, see and hear things that others cannot see and hear, pay in today's Western world mostly for a fool or a drug addict, or at least a weirdo.
However, such images and voices are not only created in the mentally ill or in the drug intoxication.
Our imagination is to our own: The same neuronal processes that allow us to design houses, paint pictures or write novels take care to see to it that they will fouls the boundaries between the dream, the idea and the reality.
The dream of a changed state of consciousness can occur in a variety of forms, in a better case we call them visions, in worse delusions.
Although the initiator and effect may be different, the vision of the mystic Hildegard von Bingen, the drug experiences of the prophet New-Age Carlos Castaneda, the shamanic states of delirium, psychossees and hallucinations, can be derived from such trials.
Hallucinations or visions arise if the balance of neuronal transmitters of the brain is d withdone - mainly dopamine, noradrenaline, serotonin and acetylcholine - and the interaction between different parts of the brain is canceled.
Complex hallucinations and delusional thoughts occur very often in schizophrenic psychosis.
Gravity doesn't have power over him
The link between the delusion and the dream has employed philosophers and doctors since antiquity.
Aristotle understood the hallucinations as a form of waking dream, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychology, stated in 1861 "a great resemblance to raving with dream states," for Sigmund Freud the dream was even "psychosis, with all nonsense, mirage, deception of the senses."
It's the fall of 2001, Henning T. is turning into a comic book character.
His body is two-dimensional and garishly colored.
Gravity has no power over it, it hoveres at the ceiling of the room.
He feels kicking.
Behind him, winged devilish figures with blood-red grimaces, his teeth heal.
They chase him, kicking him with heavy, fire boots, throwing it against the walls, feeling the pain all over his body.
Loud, evil voices are threatened from the walls and from the radio.
He can no longer tolerate the voices that call him and insult him.
Henning T. rips two cables out of the stereo, smashes them into a noose and cringing it on the ceiling hook.
He goes up on one speaker and puts the noose around his neck.
The jovel.
The loosen up.
Learn to shout chorus the voices tearing his eardrums, "won't go to the clinic and get treated!"
Today, Henning T. is 40, having experienced six acute psychoses, the last two years ago, the first almost 20 years ago.
LSD was launched.
His diagnosis is schizoaffective paranoiac psychosis, in addition he is mano-depressive, taking anti-depression medication, mania, schizophrenia.
He's learned to live with his illness, he's been married for three years.
In psychosis, I experienced the worst fear and deepest doubt, he says.
The phantoms are a terrible reality
About one percent of people get sick at least once in their lifetime schizophrenia, in psychiatric clinics it's the second most frequently treated disease after the depression.
With acute schizophrenic psychosis, disability can no longer distinguish the inner and outer worlds, they are given a reprosy state that can lead to hallucinations, size, relationship illusions, or the illusion of persecution.
A hearing of voices is particularly widespread - the voices that command, comment or conduct dialogues.
Even optical hallucinations are not uncommon.
The sufferer is unable to distinguish the important from the unimportant, the brain cannot filter out the disruptive signals, the consciousness is in the swindles.
Like the dream, the psyche of the floodgates opens up in a flood of thoughts and fantasies that come from the deepest layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychosis is centered on the subject, says Professor Thomas Fuchs, Chief Medical Officer of the General Psychiatrie Clinic Clinic of the University Clinic in Heidelberg.
Schizophrenic is at the center of the action, everything is meaning to him.
At the same time, he gets into a passive role, becoming, like in a dream, overwhelmed by events and cannot actively shape them.
Schizophrenics therefore often feel threatened, controlled and manipulated.
Comparing reality is not usually possible for them, phantoms are a terrible reality, waking up is out of the question.
Once in a lifetime to experience hallucination
Other than in a dream, says Fuchss, "is a sensual and spatial structure of the reality one perceives in psychosis fundamentally preserved is essential."
Delusional ideas and hallucinations are based on reality, the theft of the experience occurs in a real framework.
Scientists are still faced with a puzzle as to why exactly our brains are making sakes like this.
Exceptional states can lead to each person losing their relationship to reality in the short term, says Fuchs.
But not everyone develops into psychosis.
There appears to be a genetic disposition to schizophrenia, but studies on twins have shown that genes are not the only determinant factor.
Scientists are based on the fact that the affected people have minimal brain damage.
We believe that at an early stage of development there will be damage to the neuronal maturation of the brain, such as the viral disease of the mother during pregnancy, explains Fuchs.
But it remains a puzzle of how a neural system malfunction occurs, which has not shown up in the same way for years.
The influences of the surrounding area also play a role - stress or traumatic experiences can be the instigator of psychosis if there is a disposition to it.
Hallucinogenic drugs can also trigger psychosis because they interfere with the transmission system.
When our brains get in the forch
Crazy is that psychotronics suffer from their hallucinations, and to get rid of them, swallow expensive medications, others give money for drugs to get it, says psychology professor Erich Kasten of Lübeck.
Whether we see delusions as pleasant or unpleasant is often just a matter of attitude.
Kasten has been collecting reports of hallucinations and delusions for ten years, last year he interpreted his results in the book "Die irreale Welt in unserem Kopf" (The Inreal World in Our Head).
Hallucinations are one of the typical accompanying phenomic of psychoses, but also surprisingly many other diseases.
In addition to psychological disorders such as borderline personality or depression, also often diseases such as migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis or Alzheimer's or brain trauma.
Surprisingly hallucinates under certain conditions the brain of a healthy person himself.
The hallucinations, according to Kasten, consist of content of ideas that are normally suppressed.
They arise when parts of the brain in which sensory perception is processed are too active or repressed; if our brain is waking, or when the stimulation is missing.
Drugs can trigger the condition as well as brain damage or psychosis.
But also the withdrawal of the stimulus, the stress, the worries of love or other state of emergency.
In more recent studies, up to a third of respondents reported that they had hallucinated at least once in their lives.
In the summer of 2005, Sarah K. is 16 years old, living in a small town in Mecklenburg-West Pomerania and attending the Gymnasium there.
A perfectly normal girl, actually.
If there weren't those shapes and voices.
At the breaks, she can be approached by a colossal with long, dark hair.
When he answers, her classmates look at her with surprise - no one sees or hears this boy except her.
This shy girl considers an unymone to be an unymone, but she doesn't eat Sarah K.
He's awake, hears and hears and sees the boy, just as he hears and sees the girl sitting next to her in a bench.
He might even feel his presence, at least for a few moments.
It feels good, she likes the boy.
Am I crazy?, he asks.
But he knows that this boy and other delusions are not real and will disappear again.
At night, the appearations are rather dismal
Often the delusions are a burden.
When he sits in the classroom, he cannot watch the lessons many times, because the teacher in her eyes and ears is just representing a new classmate, but he explains to all the others audibly and visibly on the board of the mathematical equation.
At night, the shows are rather daunting.
When he waits in his dark room for sleep, which comes rarely and too late, he often cannot distinguish whether he is awake or asleep, whether the images he sees, the grimaces, or a girl with bleeding cuts on her hands and feet arises from her open or closed eyes.
Leave me alone, yelling at the characters.
She doesn't tell her parents and friends about it, they'd think she's crazy.
Autumn, 2009.Sararan K. is now 20 years old.
She graduated last year and lives with her boyfriend.
A year ago hallucinations stopped.
Since contacting psychologist Kasten online, she has known exactly that she has not froze.
Přeludra the arts are also an art out of despair
If someone is socially isolated or taken away by the stimuli, they will very likely have hallucinations, says Kasten.
I believe that the brain does not have enough jobs and takes care of its own fun.
Sarah K., an only child, was a little girl, afraid of other children, often playing herself.
Her hallucinations began when she learned at 13 that the man she called Dad since she was thinking was not her own father.
Because in visual and acoustic hallucinations, the same brain areas that also process real sensations and sounds are active, it is hard for the disabled as Sarah K. to distinguish delusions and reality from each other. "Each experience," says Kasten, "it takes place in the brain, reality is also depicted there.
Hallucinations are also images that will give rise to the brain, which is why they seem so real."
Night dreams are also evaluated by Kasten as a form of hallucinations.
The hallucinations of healthy people are not distinguish, as a major, from hallucinating in acute psychosis.
Compared to schizophrenics, psychologically healthy people are able to identify their delusions as unrealistic.
Casten therefore advises its patients to assess hallucinations as an extraordinary ability.
Border state between dream and hallucination
Unfortunately, in our world too much to be aware of the imaginary experience, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, a professor at Heidelberg and chief medical officer at the Florence-Nightingale Hospital Psychiatric and Psychotherapy Clinic at the Florence-Nightingale Hospital in Düsseldorf.
Psychosis is a severe, agitus disease, but it also brings positives, creativity - a mirage is also an art of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard explored the so-called oneirooid form of experience, a strange form of altered consciousness to the dream.
Oneiroid states are highly complex, detailed fictitious dreams that the subject considers to be real and cannot even distinguish retrospectively from the waking condition.
The one-iroid state of consciousness occurs in extreme situations caused by trauma or disease, such as polyradiocular inflammation, who experience in full consciousness of motor paralysis.
When a person is threatened with the loss of the world and one's own, perhaps persential, with complete inability to move, it replaces life-threatening real situations with one's own, imaginary world that is disconnected from reality, says Schmidt-Degenhard.
Type of borderline state between dream and hallucination.
As it is not possible to manage a situation in reality, there will be a change of worlds, but the real situation will become open to the image.
An intensive form of senses support and the transfer of senses in some insufferable situation that allows us people to move within moments of loss of consciousness.
Everything is real, even later in the memories
Also, art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen describes his one-irosed experiences in his book "Herzwechsel" (Heart Exchange) as a life-saving action of the soul.
He was 49 years old when, after surgery on the heart valve with a subsequent heart transplant, his consciousness vented his consciousness on a several-day journey, with his body lying motionless in the intensive care unit.
Claussen immersed himself in the world he had created, visited foreign times and places: He became an old man bedridden with a bed, in a train sanatorium, the robot guarding his health.
He lives in the early Middle Ages among the nobles who make intoxicating substances from the blood.
On his motorcycle, the Greek kidnaps him to his homeland, surfs in a hospital bed at a company in the Alps, and meets a Korean mobster.
It immerses himself completely into an imaginary action, everything is real, even later in the memories.
These inner paths are fundamentally different for Claussen from any dream.
The dream is a different state, describing its experience.
In contrast to dreams, the memories of those mental journeys are clear after years and in irrelevant details.
Even brighter and more intense than the real experience.
The intensity of this experience is breaking the horizon of our other true experiences, says psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
After all, they show one-did the states, psychossees, hallucinations and drug intoxication, how fragile our inner images of external reality are even in the waking state.
Every change in the state of consciousness, the psychologist Kasten summarizes, "can lead to a deformation of what we call reality."
A fact that can also be enriching.
Snow may come
Burda
In 27 to be taken over by publishers children
The new publisher Kallen is a transitional solution: In the long term, Hubert Burda wants to hand over his business to his two children, he told SPIEGEL.
Holding is also to be owned by a family 100 percent in the future.
Hamburg - publisher Hubert Burda has long seen his business in the hands of his children.
Both children will be inherited at the age of 27 and have a firm will to enter the business, says the 69-year-old SPIEGEL man.
We handled the details carefully for this.
The question of whether they are also active in the company is asked afterwards.
The question of whether they have the skills to do so.
It is not possible to put their children in the lead in the lead of 7500 employees if they are not sufficiently capable.
That would kill both the kids' kids, business.
Burda announced on Thursday that he was withdrawing from the Board of Directors' Presidency's presidency from January, appointing Paul-Bernhard Kallen as his successor.
The 52-year-old Kallen has been a member of the board of directors at Burda since 1999.
At first, he was in charge of the technology.
Later, with the Treasury section, the responsibility for the company's assets was added and, after the resignation of Jürgen Todenhöfer, Direct Marketing, Cizin, Tiska and Finance.
For the first time, none of the family members are at the head of the publishing house.
Burd's children are 19 and 17 years old, his son Felix, who would be 42 today, died a few years ago.
The appointment of Kallen is also used to "fell 10, 15 years," Burda said.
Holding should continue to belong to a family 100 percent in the future, says Burda.
With regard to the Schickedanz and Schaeffler cases, Burda commented that even the family businesses were not assured of a state of absence: "It has always been the case for companies that have been infected by the desire for capital that they speculated and thought they could become big players.
That was never my strategy.
He never had "says of world power," Burda says.
I do not see myself as a political preceptor of this country, like Springer, and I do not want to play in the world league with "Time," these deals are too big.

Singer Fergie has opted for an extravagant and very complicated cut.
Endesa and Barcelona, with an electric car
The Energy Company Endesa and Barcelona City Hall established the 'Office LIVE'.
It is a project for the development and promotion of an electric car in the capital of Catalonia.
The LIVE's office (Logistics on the deployment of electric cars) will set out and manage the Roadmap for the Incarlage in the City and provide mobility agreements, to deal, coordinate and submit contributions, etc.
It will also develop the projectMOVELE, promote electric cars, collect opinions and results of activities in the sectors involved.
Overall, the purpose is to promote this means of transport of the future.
3 'electric cities'
However, Barcelona is not the only city to join the project to introduce electric cars in Spain.
Madrid and Sevilla will join the project as well.
These are the three cities chosen by the government as part of the MOVELE Plan to support the introduction of electric cars.
Energy company Endesa has already signed a framework contract with the Catalan government.
The purpose is to support research and technological development activities in the Catalan Autonomous Community.
This includes energy-related activity and, above all, energy efficiency.
This is not the only initiative involving Endesa in terms of promoting electric cars.
The company is represented in European standardisation teams and actively performs a number of additional projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or PRICIT VERDE.
Zapatero predicts's a flide period's in the automotive industry.
Prime Minister José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero foresees that the Spanish automotive industry, the country's main export sector, is in for a quiet period."
In the Prime Minister's economic report for 2009, Zapatero summarised the measures that were put in place during the year to support the automotive sector.
"Without the Rival Plan for the Automotive Sector, we would face a state of abandonment today, the closure of some of our main manufacturing companies," the Prime Minister said.
"Thanks to this plan and the wish of individual brands, to continue to operate in this highly competitive sector in Spain, a period of calm for this industry is expected in the future, which is our main export sector," he added.
In that sense, he noted that the competing plan, which forms part of the Automotive Integral Plan (PIA), identified 800 million for projects of 19 manufacturers and 137 auxiliary firms that mobilised the investment of more than Euros.
The Prime Minister explained that this investment was intended for the development of new models, for the modernisation of production and existing processes.
Zapatero also underlined the government's support measure for the request and mentioned the 2000E plan, which is being applied in cooperation with autonomous areas and car brands.
According to the president, the plan allowed the average emission level for new vehicles to be sold on the Spanish market by 6%, and ensured a "superfile" increase in" entries, namely by "40 percent" in November.
20,000 square metres of classic vehicles
The first International Saloon of Classic Vehicles will be opened in Madrid, a space for a meeting of professionals and amateurs from the world of engines.
This initiative will take place on 5 - 7 February 2010 in the Glass Pavilion of Madrid, Came de Campo.
It is an exhibition area of 20,000 square metres, on which more than 200 domestic and foreign exhibitors will be represented.
Here you will find not only classic motorcycles and cars, but at ClassicAuto Madrid there will also be products of all kinds related to the world of the engines.
Exhibitors in the pavilion will offer accessories, spare parts, components, textile accessories, accessories, publications, miniatures, etc.
Hundreds of products related to classic engines, a real delicacy for collectors and curious.
Among the companies involved will be the following:Clásicos de Mos a Good Old Times, car sales; Juan Lumbreras, restored; Coupe-Francisco Pueche, car sales and renewal; or Cochera Clásicos, a specialist Mercedes Benz.
Tests of capability in the exterior
In addition, the commercial activities of this salon will be complemented by parallel activities: camping, sports performances, rehearsals, presentations and auditions.
They will also carry out fagworth tests for classic cars and motorcycles in a tailored circuit outside the exhibition zone.
Mazda3 i-Stop: preserving sporty style
Mazda intends to show that environmental friendliness has no negative effect on the sporting style.
And that's why the Mazda3 has a built-in engine stop and start-up system - also baptized asi-Stop-, a device that is currently only available with a 2.01 150 horsepower petrol engine.
This second generationMazda3 is characterised by the good characteristics it has achieved as a whole.
Surface finishing, vehicle design, habitability, behaviour, mechanics, i-Stop...
All of these aspects are excellent at the Mazda3.
The front seats, incl. the driver's seats, have excellent ergonomics and are superbly fixed.
The steering wheel is also extremely subtle.
Using a toolkit and console, we conclude that Mazda continues with a Japanese tendency to develop futuristic design with many buttons and controls and a distinctive red and blue color.
This style reminds us in part of the style, which is also presented by the Honda Civic.
Therefore, we can say that both the Mazda3 and the Civic, both Japanese, contrast with the soberness of German products and, more specifically, the Volkswagen Golf, which everyone wants to beat.
As usual, this Japanese compact product represents more than enough space for four adults who want a very comfortable ride.
In addition, the large luggage compartment and the regular shapes should be mentioned.
The automatic engine stop and start-up system is only available with a two-litre petrol engine and a six-speed hand gearbox.
This engine is a real delicacy. It is very fine, characterised by reduced noise levels, its performance and lower consumption.
Although the most desirable Mazda3 is in the diesel version, all those who don't travel that many miles a year should rule out this i-Stop with a petrol engine, as it is characterized by greater ride-engina comfort and reduced consumption.
As for the equipment, the version selected for testing is called Sportive and includes a larger number of serial features.
For serial equipment, it is worth mentioning the lane-tracking system (RVM), which prevents the creation of a blind angle, stroke and stability control, speed control, an indoor light-sensitive mirror, an on-board computer with a large screen, a stand-in sensor, a separate air conditioning sensor, a bluetooth and bluetooth audio and wheels made of 17-inch alloys.
And if the equipment was not enough, this version was equipped with a Pack Premium, for an extra €1,500: adaptable two-xenon light and BOSE audio system with CD holder, among other components.
Conclusion
The Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the most compact cars of its category.
It is mainly characterised by the quality of the materials used, its operation and its high level of equipment.
Plus, people who don't drive a larger number of kilometres a year can choose this i-Stop version, which is only with a petrol engine2.0 and 150 horsepower.
The only drawback of this model is its higher price, which is €21,770 for the Luxury version and €23,270 for the tested version -Sportive-.
For this high price the Mazda3 offers us a great deal of satisfaction for each day.

FonPeek's Promise
Peek is extremely limited, used only to view the post office, without being able to view a certain type of attachments or surf the network.
He enjoyed his five minutes of fame in the US when Time magazine praised it as one of the products of the year.
It's harder to see it out there, but the idea can be interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike smartphones, Peek is characterised by a very low price and monthly payments, less than half the amount paid for, for example, the iPhone data plan.
After its success, the company began to offer two new devices: one for Twitter, the other on the basis of permanently provided free data services, but for which it is necessary to pay a six-fold amount for Peek.
FonPeek, which was presented at the Le Web event yesterday, is a European version of the invention and its third transformation.
It is limited as much as his American counterpart, but he brings surprises.
The monthly maintenance price is around €12 a month and involves roaming across Europe.
People travelling with a smartphone already know what it means to lose data services after crossing the border or impatiently in search of a coffee shop with WiFi (or a Fon connection) to view the mail.
The idea with rooming at a fixed price is incredibly attractive and should have been introduced a long time ago.
Yes, some operators have special contracts and travel plans, but in my experience, you'd need a doctorate in physics to understand them, as well as very good glasses to read miniature letters.
The European Commission is constantly calling for the European Union to reduce roaming tariffs to be accessible to the whole of Europe, which still does not have the desired effect.
There is a reasonable fear of using data services outside the home state.
The fact that a device like FonPeek (it's interesting that it continues to be called the Fon when it doesn't have WiFi) reaches this type of tariff means that operators are starting to think differently and are considering different offers to compensate for their data network.
Kindle is another nice example, offering book downloads and other internet searches.
No contracts, no complications.
This device is connected and payable when purchased, not months later.
And that is exactly what I expect to happen in the case of the FonPeek, it is the possibility of buying with a permanent approach as Peek has already been introduced in the US.
Not because I want to buy it.
I'm checking the mail on the phone, thank you.
I expect this, because I think it is the best type in terms of the consumer.
It would be interesting if the same system could be used on a computer.
The color that Michelle adhetlach
Yellow is undoubtedly the popular colour of the first lady of the USA.
To take Barack Obama as US President, she chose a dress and coat in this color, the same color she also chose to do so by accompanying him at the second most important moment in his life: the Nobel Peace Prize award ceremony in Oslo.
Michelle Obama used very similar models in both cases: in addition to being a similar color - yellow-greedy-, both of which were a three-part ensemble - a dress, and a coat of the same fabric - a dress, and a coat of the same fabric - decorated with a large embroidery or collar.
At first glance, the first lady of the US had decided to follow in the footsteps of the Asturian princess and wear similar clothing.
The substance from which the clothing is made is made by the two models quite different.
On the occasion of her taking up her post, Michelle used a great lace, in Oslo the velvet with a print.
He also witps accessories: green shoes with a medium-high in-flake, now a model, but in gold.
He also wore various hairstyles: this timedarts, the hair previously dissolved.
75% of working mothers have work problems related to motherhood.
Discrimination at work has increased in recent years, especially for younger-age women who intend to have a child.
This is the result of the 'Frility and Work Career Career of Spanish Women's Study' by CSIC in collaboration with the Women's Institute.
The study involved 9,737 women between the ages of 15 and 75, and the results are clear: 75% of mothers working have limited opportunities in the labour market due to motherhood.
The study highlights that at the start of a partnership, there are many differences of opinion about the number of children according to whether they work or not, as well as by the type of employment.
Women who do not work outside the home, work part-time or do not have a stable job, start living with their partner earlier, give birth to their first child earlier and have more children overall.
On the other hand, women with stable employment, especially in the public sector, partner cohabitation and motherhood, are postponed, and have fewer offspring.
"Women from 35 to 49 with stable employment have their first child on average 3.7 years of their cohabitation with a partner. This figure is 4.1 for women who have devoted a greater part of their lives to the provision of their stable employment and thus have to postpone the partner cohabitation and the arrival of the children.
The type of profession also has a strong influence on motherhood, although less influence on the time of initiation of cohabitation with a partner", explains Margarita Delgado, who is researching in CSIC.
Another factor influencing the age of women at the time of marriage by anaro-dealing child is the degree of education.
Research shows that the higher the level of education, the higher the age of women getting married and having their first child.
There are also differences between women of the same generation.
For example, in the 35 to 49 age group, women with primary and higher education gave birth to their first child, aged 25.1 or 32,1.
"There is another difference between women, depending on their level of education.
Women with basic education marry and give birth to their first child before finding stable employment, while women with secondary or high education progress the opposite of preferring to obtain a stable job, to marrying and the birth of their first child," says Delgado.
Diane Kruger is also worth it
L'Oréal Paris has just added a new name to its prestigious list of representatives: Diane Kruger.
From next year, the German actress will become the face of various products of this brand under the universal slogan 'Because I'm worth it'.
The representative of 'Joyeux Noël', one of the most elegant actresses of the international level, is thus joining other famous personalities of L'Oréal Paris such as Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and Spaniard Penélope Cruz.
Prior to her, actresses Evangeline Lilly ('Feoling') and Freida Pinto ('Millionaire of the Shack') entered this selected club.
The men's section of this cosmetics brand is also represented by prominent personalities:Patrick Dempsey ('Grey's anatomy') and Matthew Fox (Evangelin's partner in 'Lost').
British fashion awards
The British have a lot to say about fashion matters.
Their most important representatives - designers and models, former and present-a- they met at the annual awards ceremony held in London, the Royal Court of the Nitre Justice.
No one was absat at the meeting.
Former model Jerry Hall and her daughter Georgia May Jagger, who was voted the best model of the year.
Manuela Vicente's Poker
Manuel Vicent is donating in 'Es' poker (Alfaguara, illustration by Fernando Vicente) to thirty X-rays of writers he met in his literary life (and, in some cases, in everyday life).
It does not do so in the feat and predictable genres (biographical similarity, life and work), but seeks something similar to the core of a creative personality.
The journey brings excitement, and Vicent spares no excitement or inspiration.
This book is an excellent reader's enjoyment, even with repeated reading.
Here I give some observations.
On Albert Camus: "On the pages of this book, I found that the Mediterranean is not the sea, but a spiritual impulse, almost physical, like what I feel, but it cannot be named: the benefit of the anti-gaddud, the morality without guilt and innocence without any god."
On Samuel Beckett: "The hilist, the allegorical Christian, wrote according to his own nature and not intellect, something between helplessness and ignorance, with blinding poetic humour, meaningless, as if it were the blade of a knife that almost killed him."
On Graham Green: "Our man has been laid against the passion of this woman for thirteen years, the fascio-in-it-setting, the pleasure and remorse, which is the spiritual privilege of reaching heaven by the path of gill."
About James Joyce: "This was published by the Odyssey in Paris in 1922 in Sylvia Beach. It is one of the eight-thousandth peaks in the universal literature that must be surpassed by the north side, from which the best climbers often collars fail."
On William Faulkner: "He was a strange person.
of himself, he said of himself that he was the heir of a landowner from the county, at other times that he was the son of a black woman with a crocodile.
Both times they were great dreams.'
On Louis-Ferdinand Céline: "This writer captured the pooled cry of this man from Munich on the bridge to bring his echo into the night of the XXth century in his literary form, fleeing from himself and calling for the future and speaking sharply to the worms."
On Dorothy Parker: "Once she knelt and said, 'Oh my beloved God, come on, let me stop writing as a woman.'
On Joseph Conrad: "On his grave were Spenser's verses: 'After the effort comes a dream,/ after the storm a quiet harbour,/after a war rest,/after a full life of death."
On Virginia Wolf: "He also carried his depression in his luggage.
The husband had agreed to tell him that Edward VII had been following her between the azalks, or that the birds were singing in Greek.
Never before has any man been so patient and in love with a neurotic, whose literary talent goes hand in hand with foolishness.'
On Pío Baroja: "What was it about Martín Santosovade other than to target Joyce on Baroja?
What was it for Benet to do but have Baroja executed Faulkner's gun?
What was all about Celo but being made by the glorious of the man's glory?'
Cowarded aggression
Last week, my 70-year-old mother walked through our neighborhood, in the district of Fuenlabrada, and a group of young people aged 15 to 18 walked past the round and our dog, a hybrid rescued from a shelter weighing no more than six kilograms, without a word, twice kicked and severely injured.
Our indignation is all the greater because we see nothing amusing in such an aggression against a small and defenseless animal that was also on a leash.
Plus, the old lady's shock after this incident, when she met these individuals on a walk, began to worry about her own safety, too, for such a devil-obsessed man who attacks an animal is able to do the same to a woman, a child, an old man, or anyone who is weaker than himself.
It happened at five o'clock in the afternoon, on a Tuesday, in the usually quiet neighborhood.
The dog cried all day.
Of course, we have lodged a complaint against the nearest police force, but we doubt that it was of any use, and in order not to raise delicate questions, we note that these cowardly killers were of Spanish nationality.
The indignation has prompted us to announce this fact.
We do not understand what is happening to today's youth when they enjoy the fact that they are troubled by the defenceless animal that gives us love, companionship and friendship.
We don't understand where the proper manners, the respect for the animals and the people, happened.
Michelin and Fesvial together for using the helm
Tire manufacturer Michelin, in cooperation with the Spanish Transport Safety Foundation (Fesvial), has launched a campaign to promote the use of the helm, mainly for younger motorists, as both of them reported today.
The purpose of this initiative is to highlight the importance of using the helmet, as it is the only means by which to prevent head injuries or, as well as, death in the event of an accident while riding a motorcycle.
Michelin states that this campaign forms part of their transport safety commitments, which "intin more than design and produce even safer products," and confirmed that it is trying to fulfil this purpose in other ways, in the form of an instructional and information campaign.
This new campaign to promote the use of the helmet while riding a motorcycle, under the slogan 'To be or not to be to be' to be' forbids, is the first phase when up to more than 500 repairs to the motorcycle will be placed to deploy the public to get to the attention of the widest public.
Finally, Michelin pointed out that the "higher issue" of the company, which is a manufacturer of two-wheeled tyres and whose main objective is to continuously improve product safety.
Increasing sales of light commercial vehicles
Almost two years later, the light commercial vehicle market is beginning to recover.
All 9,425 vehicles registered in November in Spain marked an increase of 12.6% compared to 2008 and, what is more, the first increase after 22 months of sustained bankruptcy, according to figures in the patronage organisation of the manufacturers Anfac and the sellers Ganvam.
However, a favourable figure is better put into quarantine, as November 2008 is a very poor comparison period and marked a 60% reduction compared to the previous year.
As a result, notwithstanding the rise over the last month, the total number of registered vehicles in the last 11 months is 40% less than in the previous financial year.
As of January, 95.853 vehicles have been sold, which includes all possible vehicles in the category of light commercial vehicles: car derivatives, pick upy, supply, smaller trucks and light trucks/riotes.
Nor have the gloom that most damaging to demand has disappeared, even if it was bought by private individuals, most of the purchases were made by smaller and medium-sized firms, and almost 100% of the time, these are funding through third-party.
To the limitations resulting from the closure of the bank credit source, other factors need to be added, such as stopping the activity or continuing the poor economic situation.
In the situation, unlike passenger cars, the purchase support of 2000E did little to help.
In addition to private individuals, it is worth mentioning the SME business license business of SMEs who intend to purchase a light utility vehicle up to 3.5 tonnes with a CO2 emission level not exceeding 160 grams per kilometre, but the number of operations has been confirmed.
Just yesterday from Ganvam they recalled the need to pay particular attention to the management of these vehicles as well as industrial cars (tranches and buses).
The association of sellers expects the development to be similar to last year's year and, according to calculations, sales for passenger cars and 4x4 will fall by 19%.
The manual brake auxiliary system is already a mandatory equipment.
As with the ABS anti-blocking system, this will be the case with the stability control of the ESP, the helpily handbrake systems, all of which will become mandatory equipment for European cars.
In fact, it already forms part of the mandatory equipment for all newly registered passenger cars and light commercial vehicles, while for others there is a deadline for the elimination of the shortage, which is February 2011.
The measure in place in the EU aims to increase pedestrian protection, while operating in such a way that it can help prevent many collisions.
The handicraft auxiliary system increases the pressure on the brakes in the emergency case, which the system detects after the driver presses.
But it can't always hold that pressure until the end.
According to a study conducted by car parts manufacturer Bosch, a third of drivers who have an accident have not brake before the collision, and half of them have not fully exploited the brake strength.
Up to 1.100 accidents
On the contrary, this assistance requires the maximum from the braking system, shortening the braking distance of the vehicle.
According to a study conducted in the EU itself, if all vehicles were fitted with this type of equipment, up to 1 100 fatal accidents a year related to pedestrians could be avoided.
Reducing this number will be even more noticeable-dean calculations would prevent one of the four accidents with an impact on the person-after introduction of so-called smart hand brake systems.
In this case, the vehicles will be equipped with a system that (using the radar or camera) will capture the obstacles and are reported by the driver, except for light braking.
If the driver responds, it will help him increase the pressure on the pedal if needed.
If the driver does not respond, even if the collision cannot be prevented, the device will act as intensively on the brake as possible and reduce the risk of damage to a minimum.
General Motors postpones plan for Opel until January
Nick Reilly, new president of General Motors (GM) Europe, to Opel employees in Figueruelas (Zaragoza), that the production of the new Meriva will start in the first week of April - probably 8 April- as reported by Javier Ortega, the US manufacturer points out that it will need more time to meet the Opel renewal plan.
Nick Reilly, the new president of GM Europe, is trying to get every point of the plan to be first agreed with the party involved.
As a result, it may be that the final document, which will first be submitted to the staff and then to the governments of the countries in which the production plants are based, will be issued late in early 2010.
GM, on the other hand, assures that the Saab sale decision should be taken in these days.
Not surprisingly, the Swedish government has increased pressure on the US producers to take a decision as soon as possible.
GM enables contacts with some new potential buyers.
One of them could be Geely, who also wants to acquire a Volvo, but is considering the possibility of Dutch sportscar manufacturer Skyper, which operates under the auspices of the Russian group Converg.
In the event that it is not possible to reach an agreement with any of them, GM could sell some of the assets of Saab to the Chinese company Baic.
The decision to close Saab remains in place at the end of the year, unless its sale is made.
Ride with Porsche Boxster Spyder
In the development of this splendor model, Porsche engineers used the Boxster S as a base and managed to reduce the weight by 80 kg, so the weight shows only 1.275 kg.
Based on, in the first instance, the automatic retractable roof was in a canvas design with manual control, reducing the weight by 21 kg; then aluminium doors such as the GT3 were used, which means an additional 15 kg less; removing the air conditioning, 13; the reduction of the fuel tank from 64 to 54 litres also contributed to a reduction in the weight of an additional 7 kg; after the mounted sports seats were fitted with an additional 12 kg, on a lightened 19-litre collars five kilos.
Finally, removing the CDR-30 audio system means another six kilograms less, and replacing the door handles with textile handles means the next kilogram.
Also offered with a dual-clutch gearbox PDK, one vehicle with a hand-marted six-speed gear box was tested, mainly on second-class roads in California, on mountain sections with many conglassged bendes.
His conduct can only be classified as untouchable.
The reduction in weight does not mean that the vehicle is not pressed for asphalt.
On the contrary, we have not tested such a small and lightweight model in a long time, which would also transmit such safety as it moves on the bend, even at high speeds.
He's a little athlete capable of warming his muscles during a short ride for the time he needs until we get a sprint, braking, and restoring the engine to use...
Anything we want, thanks to the steering, which is as communicative as accurate, whatever we hint with our hands on the steering wheel is what the car does.
And he'll do it with surgical precision.
The sound of the engine as he will
The sound of the V6 boxer, with 320 hg (up 10 more than the Boxster S) is very subtrade and can be amplified by the 'sport' option and through a system that modifies the sound of the engine previously used by the Panamera.
The capacity of the acceleration is brutal, whether in the clinging or recuperation.
The curtains are solid, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The tarmac of the roads through which we are passing through with the Boxster Spyder was rather damaged, but the car handled the potholes well.
The electronic support was almost unnecessary during the ride; and yet in some corners we came across the ice and gravel at dawn at dawn even in the advanced morning.
Ultimately, this ultralight car is one of the most funniest on the market, as it is a little more than a mere modification of the Boxster S.
The car will be put up for sale in February 2010 at a price of €70,831.
'Bag Girl'
Karl Lagerfeld's girlfriend, the Coco Cocoon series icon and the occasional 'starlette' at the 'firma' shows, the singer shows off her face to the evil girl as vehemently as her Chanel handbag.
More than 'Bad Girl' or 'It Girl', it's 'Bag Girl'.
Baskonia wins in Israel
The cash register won a brilliant 82-91 victory in their hosting at the complicated Maccabi Electra, despite numerous absences from the Dusk Ivanovice team, and thus came to the top of her group after a major performance by Mirzy Teletovic, who with eight triple points was the decree of the best in the squad (29 standings).
The Vitorie squad was able to replace the significant absence of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Mic's great deal of commitment and collective work, though it had to suffer until the end to win the victory.
In addition, the great accuracy of the circuit with 16 triple points participated in the final triumph.
The game started head-on for the blue, who from the start stood on the plate.
That the first four baskets for Vitoria were from a distance indicated that they had attacked the Israeli squad very harshly.
English and Teletovic were among the leading scorers at the end of the first part.
The second quarter was similar, but the Ala's squad opted for Barac's internal play and the work of Eliyahu, which was taken by whistle and applause to return to his original site to increase the advantage before the break began (34-43).
Teletovic was already beginning to be the best in his team with 13 points, although 'no six' in the review of Split' already suggested that it would not be the best night for the Brazilians.
But although the match was sharp until the break, the decision was not made in the slightest, and the Maccabejští wanted to remind Vitoria that not everyone on their pitch was winning, and 'the 'boo of Elías's hand to win.
Eidson and Pnini certainly contributed to the 'yellow' to return to the spotlight (50-49).
More inappropriate
Members of Ivanovic, injured but not dead at all, needed several precision games to catch their breath, and then Mirza Teletovic's machine gun appeared, returning the score to a reassuring (54-67) with the help of English and Ribas.
The Alavs had their skin cut their last leg, and English and San Emeterio (60-75) have already announced that they will not be allowed to be deprived of their deserved results of the first thirty minutes.
However, Pnini and Eidson, the best in their team, did not give up and tried to keep the team alive from the line of three points (70-77).
Despite this and with Split out of the foul with the Ivanovic, they did not hasten and defended well, and although the Israelis approached the final minute (80-85), the match already had the winner and that of the summer Aviv lost for the first time in a season.
Inh injured make Unicaja fight impossible
Unicaja lost significantly in Greece to Olympiacos, leaving him the Euroleague B lead in the Euroleague in a match that was marked with three attacks by Unicaja, but above all by the indoor game(Freeland, Lima and Archibald), which facilitated the Greek victory.
The Malaga squad did not face the environment of the Pavilion of Peace and Friendship, or of rivals, perhaps one of the sicker in Europe, and with a large budget.
The game in the first quarter allowed the Andalusians to dream. Aggressive defense and three triple points in a row, two thanks to Omar Cook and one Guillem Rubio, bewitched the field with a s12-18 minute.
Olympiacos was surprised by the intensity of theUnnicaja , although the arsenal of the locals in the indoor game with Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis, turned the score to 22-20, minute 13, which was the moment when the battle between the backing of USABeverley and Williams meant the exclusion of both players.
The Greek squad began to function and proved its superiority in both zones, where the absence of an English pivot due to injury to Joel Freeland and three personal errors by Carlos Jiménez burdened the Unicaja squad
Among the inner players and the Lithuanian wing Linas, Linas Kleizas with triple points, they increased the advantage to 44-32 to the 19th minute.
Impersttal rematch
The third leg was very offensive by the Olympiacos, who, despite losing by 19, showed the upper hand and even managed to make the difference from the match in Malaga Málaga 66-48, a minute 27 who rocked the lead in the group.
Unicaja struggled to overcome the absence and last absence of Scottish pivot Robert Archibald, who was injured in the last game.
Despite all the drawbacks, thanks to the lead and triple points, Cook and Lewis's contribution left some hope for a 66-57 win to win the 66-57, minute 31.
But it was virtually impossible, because Olympiacos, by strengthening and outmanitoring in its zone, proved that it was unstoppable.
Croatian pivot Nikola Vujcic, managed to equalise the 81-eight-62, the minute 37, and Unicaja's willls and handed the lead to Olympiacos.

During the week the app's operation, the search engine found that the Spanish worker generally "felt poorly rewarded," explained Albert Rivera, responsible for the Trovit product, in his report.
According to data at its disposal for Trovit from its search engines in the UK and France, the Spaniards are the worst paid.
The British programmer takes €45,226 gross a year and the French 3:4519 takes the French programmer, while the Spaniard receives 24,000.
Similarly, the driver has a salary of €34,247 net per year in England, 25.751 in France and 16.420 in Spain.
According to Trovit, the lowest-paid job is a waiter in Spain with €11,592 net per year, followed by a salesman with €14,725 and a worker with €15,67.
The most sought-and-truck jobs in the last three months are the driver, the half-time job and the social worker.
Brazil set a date for Zelay's departure
The Brazilian government has set a deadline for Manuel Zelaya to remain at its embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The oiled president must leave the diplomatic mission no later than January 27, 2010, when his mandate officially ends.
Francisco Catunda, the chargé d'affaires of the Brazilian embassy in the Honduran capital, confirmed to TV Globo that "Mel" knows he must leave the embassy by that date, where he has been hiding since September 21.
"He is aware that he must leave on 27 January after the end of his mandate, he must leave and seek other refuge."
The station also quoted a former statesman who confirmed his intention to leave the embassy before the deadline: "I intend to leave as soon as possible, logically under the auspices of the Brazilian government," Zelaya said by telephone.
After the November 29 election (when he was elected to Porfrio Lobo), Zelaya assured that he would remain at the Brazilian Embassy until January.
However, the same week he attempted to gain refuge in Brazil.
The operation eventually failed because Zelaya rejected the condition of political asylum, which the government was trying to impose on him by the government "de facto" chaired by Roberto Micheletti.
Thank you
After the days of wine and roses since last spring, when asset inflation represented the prevailing mood of the markets, uncertainty has reappeared in the markets, which should not be surprising, as it is already a natural state of affairs in an environment where the agents take decisions about a future that is in itself uncertain.
The medicine used by the central banks to stabilise the market was the liquidation of debt by directly the purchase of assets and the indirect release of liquidity at a close zero rate so that financial institutions could purchase assets to a deduction.
Central banks have already confirmed that direct asset purchases have virtually ended and, without calling into question their mismatch liquidity policies, are beginning to throw a little sand in the gears, as the Spanish Central Bank did last year with its auction.
Investors are therefore doubting the world economy's ability to maintain economic recovery without such heterodox measures, and we are taking part in the return of reducing risky returns.
The exchange's movement and the differences in the bonds have recunked points, although they are still very far from the abnormal level they reached at the start of the year.
States were forced to socialize private risk, which again affected public debt.
Once again, quality is being pushed, and the US, Japan and Germany have become a haven for the chosen investors, expanding the differentiation of eurozone countries to Germany.
Spain was almost not affected by this instability, but at that time Standard & Poor's came and threatened to revise the Kingdom of Spain's qualifications.
On the other hand, some insecurity is not unalculable to silence moral hazard advocates who have once again sought to burden the conscience of those responsible for the world's economic policy for hitting the devastating consequences of limiting crediting to employment, when in fact a new Thanksgiving day would need to be announced.
However, the situation in Dubai represents tribal battles between the emirs of the emires of restoring power in the Emirates, and as far as Greece is concerned, we have seen this before.
A government that hides the deficit, elections and a new government is taking hold.
Prodi did it in Italy after Berlusconi and Sócrates in Portugal after Durão Barros.
It makes no sense for the Ecofin to rescue Hungary from non-fulffuling of foreign payments at the start of the year and to allow the euro member country not to meet its commitments.
But what makes sense is for Ecofin to force the Greek government to be transparent and to commit to joint accountability of its own citizens, with the need for emergency measures to maintain the stability of its public finances.
If, as we expect, we find ourselves ahead of the period of normalisation of the interim risk bonic, after some excesses in the supported positions, they would be in anticipation.
In the Spanish case, while our differences in public debt will increase in the same way as the bonds of European companies, we do not have to worry.
If Europe's differences are reduced and ours are further expanded, it would be a typically Spanish risk.
The matter of Standard & Poor's is just an anecdote. When our leading indicators force most of the study services to anticipate their recovery scenarios and revise their 2011 upward scenario, including OCDE and the European Commission, to return to the Japanese scenario, it does not give the Spanish economy much hope of living to see this warning.
Again, it looks like it will be a great opportunity to buy Spanish assets, although for now "carefully, my friend drivers."

Iberdell's president, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, was the first to intervene yesterday in front of the subcommet of the House of Commons, where he is discussing Spain's energy strategies in the next two decades.
Following his intervention, followed by a speech by President Gas Natural-Fenos, Rafaela Villasecy, Galán made some remarks to the press about the proposal he had made to the subcommita behind closed doors.
According to President Iberdrol, Spain needs an investment of €50,000 million by 2020 and another 60,000 million from that date by 2030 if the nuclear power plants currently in operation are maintained.
Should this not happen, the necessary investments will not be as much as $9000 million, but as high as 95,000 million.
Indeed, Iberdrola believes that in the next decade, investment must focus not on increasing production capacity, but on grids and international interconnections
From 2020, the issue will change and performance will need to be increased.
Its supply is focused on gasworks and coal-fired power plants with mechanisms for capturing carbon dioxide and, above all, renewable energies.
In this case, he believes that a new 18,000 MW is needed, but with other "supporting energies."
The Galán, who believes the women's draft of the Sustainable Economy Act, which was just approved by the government, corresponds to the line the business demanded, did not want to bleed as a royal decree to promote the consumption of national coal, which contravenes the policy of combating climate change.
In his view, the "clear long-term bet" in this sense is a "purging" measure, as President Iberdrola called them.
Be that as it may, Galán believes that investment decisions, although long-term, must be taken into action already, as their maturation is ongoing and a stable tax framework is needed to start them.
Ferrovial wins 'handling' Aer Lingus at 10 airports
Ferrovial, a subsidiary of land services for airport ground services, the Swiss company Swissport, will play the role of a preferential partner for the Irish airline Aer Lingus for cost services at the 10 European airports where it is present.
Paris, London, Frankfurt or Brussels are among the most important of them.
The agreement, from which the economic deadlines have not yet been reached, is valid for five years.
Ferrovial, the Junta Castilla-La Mancha and the University of Alcalá de Henares, signed a cooperation protocol to create a Innovation Centre for Intelligent Infrastructures in the Innovation Centre
The association expects to invest 20 million by 2012, of which 50% is for Ferrovial.
One of the tasks of the Centre will be to research energy efficiency on motorways and airports.
Acciona seeks her first motorway in Australia against Hochtief and Bouygues
Acciona is vying for its first concession on the motorway in Australia, a market where it already works as an energy and water business.
The building in question is a tunnel estimated at 1,700 million Australian dollars (about €1,047 million).
Its rivals are the French business Bouygues and Germany's Hochtief.
A 5-kilometer-long tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane, on the east coast, became the closest option for the Caccionionia to settle in that country as a construction and concession motorway company.
City Hall wishes to have a tunnel completed at the end of 2014
After selecting public-private cooperation (PPP according to the initials in English) for the further development of the project in the business plan provided by Erns & Young, the administration already has the final list of candidates for the implementation of the construction and operation of the toll.
Offers are expected to be submitted in May, and the projected investment will reach 1,700 million Australian dollars (EUR 1.047 million) and in the last phase of the three concerns competitions with a significant presence in European buildings.
The group called Transcity is led by Acciona, the only Spanish company in the competition, and its associates are BMD and Ghella.
The first is one of Australia's largest construction companies and the second is based in Italy, one of Europe's largest underground construction specialists.
Against the Acciona Group, the Northern Direct group, with the presence of the British Laing O'Rourke, the Australian infrastructure manager Transfield and the French construction group Bouygues, are in play.
The third and last concern to pass through the net is LBRJV and is involved in the Australian capital of Leighton (a subsidiary of the German construction company Hochtief, represented here by ACS), also a local Baulderstone (ownership of the German Bilfinger Berger group) and a major firm specialising in the civil construction of Razel.
The Australian infrastructure market promises major structures and privatisations, but entails a clear entry difficulty in a way other than the environment of acquiring a local construction company.
The strategy followed by the aforementioned Hochtief or Bilfinger is still an example for the Spanish giants in the sector, in addition to the Asian references.
ACS acquired a market position through its 30 % stake in Hochtief, the owner of the quoted Leighton.
Million Million AMs
Acciona is betting on the most geographical area of importance for the sector, where it already has a significant presence through its energy supplier's activities and in the desalination trade.
Among other assets, it has the largest wind park in Waubra (192 MW) in Victoria and leads a group of businesses that build and manage the desalination facilities in Adelaide with a budget of 700 million.
Its plan is now to consolidate the two areas and to use the common energy to enter the areas of the construction and operation of infrastructures.
The toll-witter, which is the promoter of the City's Authority for the Infrastructure of the City of Brisbane, called Northern Link, is to connect the western highway from Toowong with the Kelvin Grove ring road (see map) of the 5-kilometre tunnel. It is the largest event to reduce Brisbane's traffic congestion.
The calendar set by the local administration plans to enter the summer of 2010 and the start of work for December next year.
Although this paid transit would open in the last months of 2014, the full completion of the works is not scheduled until 2016.
The tunnel began to be designed in 2005.
It will include two currents in each direction, an electronic toll system and a comprehensive ventilation system.
The Queensland government will provide 500 million Australian dollars (€308 million) to finance it.
Brisbane has already offered this contract to Hochtief
Australia still makes a significant profit for Hochtief as it announced yesterday a contract with the government estimated at 154 million.
The ACS will make the national broadband network infrastructure operational via its local Leighton filial, with a fibre fibre cable.
This situation will allow for fast internet access to 400,000 people and provide the work of the German company for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company left the 27-storey project to build the King George tower in the Australian city of Brisbane. Construction work was yet to begin and Hochtief closed the sale for 129 million.
In the UK, specifically in Manchester, he will be involved with Laing O'Rourke in the construction and operation of two school centres for 25 years.
The initial investment will be €75 million.
FCC was allocated a tunnel in Slovenia for 64 million
The FCC, through its Alpine filibic, received the allocation of a construction of a 2.1-kilometre tunnel for the motorway in Slovenia worth €64.5 million.
The company received the contract a few days after the construction of the construction of the construction to expand the tunnel in Bosruck (Austria) for 130 million.
In this way, the Alpine strengthens its experience in tunneling.
The start of work is planned for the start of 2010 and the implementation deadline is 32 months.
Sra. Rushmore wins ad at Renfe
Renfe has allocated advertising and marketing services to Sra. Rushmore for an approximate sum of €3 million a year, the railway company reported.
The contract includes the possibility of an extension of 12 months each year. Sra. Rushmore was selected among the 16 agencies to be presented in the bankruptcy of Renfe, of which four advanced to the finals, among them TBWA , which was responsible for creating advertising for the last three years.
From this point on, Sra. Rushmore will take care of the design and production of campaigns.
63 million fine for France Télécom for braking the competition
The regulators' regulat authority in France fined IFrance Télécom 63 million for anti-competitive conduct in the Caribbean areas belonging to the country.
According to this institution, the operator has restricted competition from fixed and mobile phones by signing exclusive agreements, pricing plans and fidelity programmes with consumers on the margins of regulation.
With this sanction, the former French monopoly and still the state-owned company has piled up more than €560 million in fines since 1994 for imposing obstacles to its competitors.
The fine imposed yesterday was de facto increased because the authority overseeing the competition considers that France Télécom has committed a similar offence as in the past and that there has therefore been a relapse.
app store
On the other hand, the French company's mobile branch is still a star among other operators and has opened an online app store to increase revenues that will not come from voice broadcasts.
From the start, the Orange app store will be active in France and the UK.
It will be necessary to wait until 2010 to enter other countries such as Spain.
Playing in the Champions League brought Madrid and Barça from the start
The Champions League has become a source of revenue for these clubs since its inception in 1992.
To the extent that Real Madrid and Barcelona have made 476.4 million since then, making them the third and fifth most profitable clubs in the competition.
The list is led by Manchester United.
The list is led by Manchester United.
Winning the UEFA Champions League does not only bring glory. It is also one of the main sources of revenue for the big clubs.
To the extent that the competition divided €5,362.5 million between the 105 teams (of which 12 of them were Spanish), which had participated in this event since the start of the 1992/1993 tournament, according to UEFA data.
Real Madrid and F.C. Barcelona came out of this division very well.
The White Club was third on the continent with the most money they received for their participation, and the only one, along with AC Milan, who won the top prize three times.
Catalonia's current champion and last winner of the defunct Europe Cup in 1992 is fifth in the 1992 classification.
The list is led by Manchester United and Munich's Bayern, two teams that also charged the most money to participate in the last Masters.
Even though she lost both to Barça.
On the other hand, Spain is up to the third country to raise the most money through the Champions, despite receiving the most titles of all (five against four for Italy, three for England and two for Germany).
Distribution
This apparent paradox is explained by the complex process of distributing money used by UEFA.
For this accounting year, the body chaired by Michel Platini is planning to earn the Champions League of 10.090 million.
Of this money, UEFA will donate 413.1 million to fixed payments: each of the 20 clubs that took part in the preliminary classification round (including Atlético Madrid) received 2.1 million.
In addition, those who reached the attendance received 3.8 million only for their presence, among others €550,000 for each match in which he participates.
There is also a bonus for the winnings (€800,000) and a draw (€400,000 for each team). The eight-finalists will receive three million each; eight quarterfinalists3.3 million.
Each of the last four will get 4 million.
The champion earnings 9 million, while the second finalist will earn 5.2 million.
In this way, the club earns a minimum of 7.1 million and a maximum of 31.2 million in fixed payments.
On the other hand, Barça received 2.5 million for winning the European Super Cup in August.
In addition, however, there are variable payments, for which 337.8 million is earmarked.
This money is divided according to the relative value of each television market.
The Spanish is one of the main ones and has four of the a few's.
The champion from last year will receive 40% of the money being allocated, the second 30%, the third20% and the fourth 10%.
The second part will be paid according to the number of matches played this year.
Nueva Rumasa offers €61m for €29.9% Sos
Yesterday, the Nueva Rumasa Group released details of the stock buy-in offering to raise a top job between 25% to29.9% of Sos' capital.
This percentage does not oblige to make a public bid for the acquisition of all securities.
In particular, Nueva Rumasa is offering €1.5025 per share to be paid at the age of 10 and for which he would pay interest for this deferral1% per year.
Yesterday, Sos shares ended trading at €1.85; so Nueva Rumasa's bid rates the company 18% below market value.
According to Nueva Rumasa, the price of €1.50 reflects the fair value of the Sos.
The bid is subject to the appointment of eight of the 15 members of the Board.
The Jerezská Group provides a 15-day period for shareholders to announce their interest in selling the shares.
CNMV said it had not been informed of the offer, even though Ruiz Mateos confirmed that it had contacted the regulatory authority.
If the purchase is made, the price would reach 611.7 million, while the capitalisation of the Sos is 254.27 million.
Meanwhile, Sos is further changing the structure of his leadership.
As an attempt to remain on the sidelines of possible offers to buy and settle the court-curdier swings of his former leaders, the Yesús and Jaime Salazar brothers, the election of María Luisa Jordá was announced as the head of the internal audit.
This decision makes her the first woman to occupy a high-ranhered role in a food business.
It is a newly created place that will be directly succumbing to the president of the group.
And it is not taken out of controversy, as the business continues to be immersed in the legal battle over the alleged transfer of more than 230 million from the Sos companies of the Salazar brothers.
De facto, there is no shredding of the possibility that Sos will unveil new fund transfers in the coming months
As for the Salazar's credit, former board members Ildefonso Ortega and Ángel Fernández Noriega (representatives CCM and Unicaja) testified at the National Court yesterday and confirmed that they had approved the transfer of 212 million without knowing their destination.
CNMV authorises option to exclude the Paternina in which Inversora Mer participated
Yesterday, the National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) authorised the exclusion in which Inversora Mer participated in the exclusion of Federico Paternin on October 9th.
The supervisory authority explained that it authorises this operation as it understands that its conditions comply with the applicable standards and considers that the content of the explanatory bog submitted after the modifications introduced on 2 December is "sufficient" content of the explanatory bog.
CNMV stated that the offer was to obtain the 550.008 shares of Federico Paternina at a price of EUR 7.65 per share, which represented 8.95% of the company's capital, which comprised 6:142.786 shares accepted to trade on the Madrid and Bilbau stock exchanges.
He further explained that 5.592,778 million shares had been immobilised and could not be transferred in any way until the tender specified in the conclusion that the price had been set by Federico Paternina in accordance with the provisions of the applicable standards was closed.
New tools for car pricing
These days, storms and accidents are being made not only by car service.
Each day, thousands of cars that have suffered an insurance claim are towed to the service, where the expert must estimate the damage and the cost of the repair.
No insurance claim is the same, and calculating the cost of parts and time of the workforce can be a long and complex job.
To calculate manually the cost of repairing from €20,000 to €30,000, including parts and workforce, can take two or three hours.
However, with the support of new computer tools, this would be a matter of minutes
That's why almost 100% of the connoisseurs use this kind of system.
Suppliers of services and solutions for estimating claims and maintenance are dedicated to collecting the information provided by manufacturers to then draw up and offer their customers a useful tool.
In Spain, Audatex, of the American Solera Group, is the leading firm; 80% of the ratings are made with its products.
Other firms competing in the field of valuation tools and the development of sector information are GtMotive and Eurotax.
Working with the data provided by manufacturers is not easy at all.
According to Eduard Velázquez, the commercial director of Audatex, they work with 63 producers and importers in Spain, and each of them provides information to them in a different format.
In addition, the amount of data for processing is still growing as more versions, variations and motor solutions have been presented in the last five years than in the previous 15 years.
As soon as the new vehicle enters the market, these businesses will start working.
This is a very frantic job, as you need to cathoon each of the thousands of parts of the vehicle and set its price.
In addition, for each model, "intelligent" graphic processing is performed" where it is possible to "punish" individual parts of the tourist cars.
When it comes to a massive sales model, the job can be done in a week if the process is very fast.
In terms of a minor car, it can take three or four months. Currently, Audatex has complete information about 99.2% of cars sold in Spain.
Among the most exclusive models they have information about are Porsche, but not Ferrari or Lamborghini, for example.
The mobile park in circulation exceeds 99%.
To do the work of documenting and drafting databases, Audatex has eight centres divided around the world (Spain, France, Germany, USA, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan) and each of them specialises in specific brands.
The national headquarters is in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There, more than a hundred technicians (normally mechanical experts) work simultaneously with three computer screens.
Audatex invests €90 million a year to develop these databases.
2.5 million data is included every month and customers receive updates every two days.
The processing of this immense flow of information enables businesses to use and supply of different products.
The most common uses are concentrated on repair and maintenance, but according to countries, there are also tools to manage spare parts or to calculate the car's sales or residual value.
The only undertaking available to have a guide to informs about the value of the used vehicles in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex does not offer them in our country, but in the United States it is.
In view of the products offered by Audatex, it is easy to get the support that can be used by professionals in the sector.
This business offers ten different assurrenments, with the stellar product being AudaPlus, a standard insurance valuation solution for the expert.
It includes cars, motorcycles and light and heavy industrial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of parts, it also includes the time for the repair, estimated by the manufacturer or paint shop.
