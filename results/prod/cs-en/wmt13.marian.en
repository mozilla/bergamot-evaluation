Republican Party's strategy against Obama's re-election
Republican leaders justified their policy with the need to fight electoral fraud.
But Brennan's center calls such a fraud a myth, saying that electoral fraud is less common in the US than the number of people who die after being struck by lightning.
Indeed, Republican attorneys have recorded only 300 US electoral fraud cases in the last decade.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, these measures will partly undermine the American Democratic system.
Unlike in Canada, individual states have a responsibility to organise federal elections in the US.
And, in this vein, most US governments have been announcing new laws since 2009 that make it difficult for the election or to enroll in the electoral roll.
This phenomenon boomed after the November 2010 election, during which 675 new Republican representatives were added in 26 states.
As a result, in 2011 alone, 180 bills of law restricting the right to vote in 41 states were submitted.
New electoral laws require voters to produce a photo identification card and a document of American citizenship.
Moreover, these laws limit the election periods in advance, invalidate the right to be enrolled in the voting list on the day of the election, and take away the right to vote for citizens with a criminal record.
Prior to the 2006 election, no US state required the submission of a pile of identity with a photo.
The first state to implement this requirement was Indiana.
The Constitution of the Indyan Act was upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2008.
Republican authorities rushed to expand the process to other states.
Over the past two years, they have supported bills in 34 states to force voters to present photo ID cards.
It should be noted that, unlike Quebec, American citizens do not have a universal identity card, such as a health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of American citizens, or 21 million people of age to choose, do not actually own any ID with a photo issued by the government office of their state.
Furthermore, about five million new voters do not have such an identity card in 2012.
In addition, the acquisition of the required identity card often costs more than $100.
The new restrictions disproportionately affect mainly young people, minorities and low-income earners.
25% of African-Americans, 15% with incomes below $35,000; 18% of citizens over the age of 65 and 20% of voters aged 18 to 29 therefore do not have the required photo identification card.
And that's not all.
Students who, as voters, are known as voters for their incursion to democratic candidates, are not entitled to use their photo ID in several states, with a photo issued by their school.
On the other hand, the same states allow members of hunting or fishing clubs who vote for more Republican candidates to use the cards issued by these clubs at the polls.
Until 2004, no state required a citizenship certificate for the elections.
The first such requirement was introduced by Arizona.
Since 2011, about a dozen states have adopted laws that provide for an obligation for voters to prove that they are American citizens.
These measures clearly aim to limit the number of votes from the Hispanic minority.
Indeed, it should be noted that two of the three Hispanics prefer the democratic party.
In 2011, Republican Legislaturalists supported laws in eight states that abolate the electoral record on the day of the election.
In addition, they have restricted the right of people and groups to provide assistance to voters who want to sign up.
These restrictions have consequences.
For example, during the 2004 general election, campaigns for the registration of voters helped to register around 10 million people.
But the measures taken after 2009 caused a 17% drop in the 2010 new voter-leaning down from 2006.
Republican lawmakers then passed laws in the other five states aimed at shortening the election-by-country period in advance.
For example, during the 2008 general election in Florida, African-Americans were 33% of the electorate who voted ahead of time, even though African-American voters in that state were only 13%.
For Hispanics, it was the same.
They were just 11% of all voters, but 24% of the citizens voting in advance.
On the other hand, whites, who accounted for 76% of all voters, accounted for only 46% of the electorate who voted in advance.
Of course, the passing of laws restricting the registration of voters was very strongly opposed by the democratic legislators and their supporters.
Democratic governors blocked several bills with their veto.
In order to suspend the most controversial laws, the U.S. Attorney General has even intervened.
They were partly able to reduce the damage.
For example, laws requiring the presentation of a photo identification card were adopted by only 16 of the 34 states.
However, the newly introduced rules will make it quite undeniably more difficult to exercise the right to vote in 2012.
Democratic critics speak primarily of bias in the laws passed and see them as an apparent effort to influence the results of the 2012 election in key states.
A 2011 report by the Brennan Centre shows that the states where these laws were passed represent 171 of the 270 votes in the Electoral College required to win the presidential election.
It is too early to say with certainty that these legislative changes at the electoral system level will have a significant impact on the outcome of the 2012 presidential election.
But one thing is certain today: these new provisions will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, these measures will partly undermine the American Democratic system.
Revealing prostate cancer: undergo an examination or not?
The PSA test produced sometimes erroneous results that were wrongly negative or even incorrectly positive, leading to unnecessary medical procedures.
All of this increased the hesitantness of the men, who were already so reluctant to go for the examination.
Get examined or not?
We have asked for the opinion of two experts.
Studies conducted in the US showed high levels of contamination between the different groups tested, so it is difficult to interpret these results and make valuable recommendations.
Another study, this time a European one, noted a different mortality rate between the patients who underwent the examination and those who did not go to them.
This study also showed, after a 12-year gap, that those who do not go for the examination have a 30 to 40% higher risk of metastasis.
So I recommend an examination from the age of 50 or from the age of 40 if your direct relative had prostate cancer.
A more vulnerable group are also men of African-American descent.
The key is to take the right decision once cancer is detected.
There are aggressive types of cancer and species that are inert.
It is therefore necessary to correctly explain to the patient the level of danger of his or her type of cancer, to offer him possible alternatives, not to treat prostate cancer, which does not have an impact on life in the long term, and to focus more on the active supervision of the disease in these cases.
Today, a number of men who have been diagnosed with cancer are not being treated for treatment, as their type of cancer is not aggressive and is not at risk of life.
We will propose to them to conduct active surveillance and, in the event of disease progression, we will offer them treatment.
Increasingly and more, we are setting out criteria that help in deciding which species to treat and which not.
Nevertheless, I recommend undergoing the examination.
However, it is important to have an interview with a doctor and determine whether it is appropriate to undergo the examination or not.
In collaboration with the International Urological Society, the Movember movement has created a tool that allows for and against evaluation for and against the PSA investigation.

Prevention of disease
Unfortunately, there is no miraculous procedure for cancer prevention.
Despite the advances in the research, the best means of limiting the risks of disease seems to be adopting the principles of a healthy lifestyle.
It is estimated that if everyone ate healthily and moved enough, up to 30% of cancer cases could be avoided.
"If everyone stopped smoking, this figure would rise to at least 50%," underlines André Beaulieu, a spokesman for the Canadian cancer research company.
By contrast, it is estimated that about 10% of the cancer disease causes heredity.
A percentage also remains completely unexplained.
For the Canadian cancer research company, the fight against smoking remains a priority, even as the number of smokers drops.
Cigarettes are worth 85% of lung cancer cases.
They are also a risk factor for several others.
This is extremely harmful to human health.
"There are 1.5 million smokers in Quebec today," says spokesman André Beaulieu, shaking his head.
Encouraic: 10 years after the smoker stops smoking, the risk of cancer death decreases by half.
Weight
According to the SCC, heathement and obesity are an additional risk factor for the onset of the disease.
They increase the risk of breast, colon and rectal, esophermal, pancreas and uterus.
"Frehe research shows that regular physical activity protects against colon cancer throughout a lifetime," the report adds.
Alive are life
The organisation also recommends that the consumption of red meat be reduced.
With too high consumption it can lead to an increased risk of colorectal cancer.
It is also advisable to avoid sausages for which the same is true.
Preserving meat by conserving, drying or salting can lead to the formation of carcinogenic substances.
"They can cause cell damage to the body and lead to the development of cancer," the report adds.
Vitamins
Recently, various scientists have focused on the link between vitamin supplements and cancer.
However, the research has not yet drawn unequivocal conclusions.
Vitamin E studies are contradictory, according to SCC.
Although one of them says the risk of prostate cancer will be reduced, another study is more likely to suggest an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer is not clearly established.
Mr Beaulieu also insists on how important it is to talk about his family concerns and precedents with his doctor.
"Submithing an examination doesn't mean you'll have cancer."
Higgs boson explored
The announcement of the likely discovery of the Higgs boson triggered a legitimate uproar last summer.
There is a view that this boson is involved in the mechanism that is responsible for all the mass in the universe.
And it is the last particle whose existence is predicted by the standard model - our best or "least-mastly poor" explanation of the nature and behavior of matter - but which has not yet been empirically observed.
Among physicists, however, there is not yet a 100% certainty that it is the Higgs boson.
There is no doubt that we have a completely new particle at our disposal, which is very similar to the Higgs boson as predicted by the standard model.
The new data released this week during the big physical congress in Kyoto rather confirm it, but all the data is still missing so that we can be absolutely sure.
However, let's assume that this is the Higgs boson, as the risks of the mistake appear to be small, and look at what is really going on.
In this world, there is a completely indisputable law under which two things cannot occur at the same time in the same place.
This rule cannot be circumvented - and don't try too hard to do so, or you will hurt yourself.
Although particle physics is a very strange world, it turns out that a similar law applies to it, too: the Pauli's exclusionary principle, according to which two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quantine state" - this "station" roughly, in roughly speaking, creates some of their properties.
It also divides the physicists' particles into two categories.
On the one hand, we find orderly citizens, or fermions, who obediently adhere to the Pauli principle.
And at the other end, bosons, underneath anarchists who don't value anything at all - certainly not of this principle, which means they may well be in the same place at the same time.
These bosons are further divided into two groups according to the device (quite amazing, by the way), which is The Particle Adventure, in the Berkeley laboratories: mesons, which we let go unnoticed here, and the "force particles" that spread by the great forces of nature, and with which the Higgs boson is probably somehow related in some way.
However, it must be said that these bosons are not as exotic animals as might be thought to be.
If you read this article, it is thanks to a boson with unusual banality: a photon, or "particle of light" which is the "worreth" of electromagnetic force.
Indeed, when an electric-crula particle accelerates or changes direction, it "crears" the electromagnetic field in this particular place, much like a pebble thrown into a pond.
This "cancellation" will produce an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared or ultraviolet radiation, etc.) and this wave is nothing more than a photon - and thus one of the bosons, the "carnaughing of force."
Stable fields
It's also with the Higgs boson, with the difference that it is necessary to "cancel" another field, the Higgs field, to make this boson appear.
This Higgs field is much, much more stable than the electromagnetic field; to its excitation, it is necessary to achieve very high energy values, as with the frozen surface of the pond, which only a very large boulder will beaked.
For this reason, it is necessary to use such a huge part accelerator as the accelerator in the CERN laboratory - a large rag rag with a friendly binding ring is a circle with a circumference of 27 km! - to develop such energy.
Analogy with an electromagnetic field is again suited to us to clarify the relationship between the Higgs and the mass.
With the electromagnetic field, neither all particles or all the materials react.
Some, such as magnets, do so, but others do not - a piece of paper, for example, will never be kept on its own on the fridge.
Nor, anyway, is that all the particles react with the Higgs field: those that do so have a certain mass, while others (such as a photon, let's look at it) do not have it.
And Mrs. Novak asks, what is all this research for, what are "it will bring us"?
In the scientific point of view, it is a confirmation of the validity of the standard model (SM), allowing physicists to examine any mismatch between observations and the predictions of the SM.
Moreover, not a few physicists literally want them to be found, because the slightest difference could open up the space of "new physics" and close some gaps in the model.
It should be noted that the model has hitherto huge flaws, does not provide any clarification of gravity (emha!) or dark matter, which accounts for approximately 80% of the space mass (eshah! again!).
However, the CERN has not yet discovered such contradictions.
Responations
The sends of these research in the daily lives of Mr. and Mrs Novak's are very difficult to predict, but the mistake would be to assume that there would be none.
Behold: in the very early 1960s, the pioneers of the laser in Bell Laboratories had no idea of the revolution their work will provoke.
They assumed scientific use, but nothing more.
Physicist Willard Boyle - who worked at Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who created the first permanent laser beam (previous rays were pulse) in 1962, I already said it - the laser was initially considered such a "heap to the lab."
Just imagine...
In addition, it can also emanate from all the tools surrounding the research.
For example, the same Willard Boyle created a small light sensor in 1969 during his opics-oriented work.
This sensor, although Boyle did not plan to do so at first, now serves as the "eye" of all the digital cameras in the world and earned him the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physics.
Of course, this does not mean that the activities around the LHC necessarily have to change our lives, but it means that you really never know...
Paliative Care - The best way to leave your life... | Le Devoir
Through his Commissioner for Desity, Quebec recently engaged in a delicate question about the end of life.
The debate should continue shortly and, at the same time, a bill is planned.
In this crucial area there is still a lot of work to do.
Le Devoir magazine attempted to look at the issue in more detail.
Less than a few weeks ago, Mr. L. was still living alone in his apartment in Montérégie.
Prostate cancer, which consumed it, gave him a two-year delay.
"They gave me five years of my life and it's already seven," he says, without emotion on his bed in the Victor-Gadbois house in Beloeil, where he had arrived the previous day.
"It's still a shock, though, you can't prepare for this," he adds.
The disease has done its work: immense weakness makes it impossible for him to go to the bathroom himself or just eat himself.
He looks back at the tasty-looking breakfast in resignation and agrees to help him eat.
He is brave and even smiles, talks to the unknowns who stop by his place, bring him medicine, offer him a bath.
Courage to die.
"My biggest wish is to get rid of the diarrhea, it humiliates me," he confides.
A few hours later, a team of doctors found a cure for his problem.
"In the whole life, you learn that men urinate standing up," says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at the Victor-Gadbois facility.
Returning to the child's stage is an unacceptable humiliation for some people.
"It depends on the abilities of the one person's ability to accept that return, the psychologist says.
In the view of a number of people dealing with the paliational care, the crucial moments take place at the very heart of such a return.
Patients who enter a home with the paliative care of the Victor-Gadbois are all suffering from cancer.
Their prognosis is a maximum of three months to live.
At this stage, the team of doctors and nurses who care for them does not provide them with so-called "therapeutic" care.
In the case of Mrs.A., 89, the worst fear is to die "for asch in full consciousness."
The disease, however, allowed me to discover my children.
"I have good children," he adds.
"I have no more wishes in my life," he says, and then he sans on us to put her in a breathing apparatus.
Nevertheless, he is still looking forward to his son's last visit from Italy in the coming days.
At the Victor-Gadbois home, in collaboration with a group of volunteers, it provides body care with the help of nutrition.
This is the Palliative Care, which is coming in, if nothing else can be done.
To make death more comfortable.
In Quebec, there is a one-bedding of caliber care per 1,700 residents.
That's very little if we realize we're all going to die one day.
Here life continues in optimal conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors at the home.
Whether it's the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
When a person dies, you can provide, for example, a sip of brandy or pepsi, to the taste.
Diabetics no longer need to watch his sugar level.
And death is part of everyday life here.
Last night they were carrying a beer for Mr. X, who died later that night.
This morning, his son will finish his drink in honor of the late father.
"We help patients as well as our loved ones," says Nathalie Savard, the director of the nursing home.
In the Victor-Gadbois home, they go for days one after another, but they are not like each other.
Next to a 93-year-old man who rejoices at his last meeting with his family, thoroughly paddy on the pillows while toasting him in his honor, a tragically 36-year-old man, surrounded by his parents, a wife and two young children, dies tragically after trying out all the possibilities for him to survive.
"For six months there are always three to five beds that are designed for people with cancer under the age of 45," Dr. Christiane Martel tells us with concern.
53% of the patients who come to the Victor-Gadbois home come from their homes, 47% come from hospitals.
Problems with access to Palliative Care
It is said that 77% of Canadians simply do not have access to the caliational care, i.e. the care that is designed to alleviate the suffering as soon as the sufferer reaches the final stage of his life, whether it is at home, in a hospital or in a nursing home.
And several organizations, such as the home of Victor-Gadbois and the Grand Montréal Predigenal Palliative Treatment Society, are more or less specialised in the care provided to cancer patients.
And it is this fundamental unavailability of health care in Quebec that leads to a number of physicians specializing in caliational care fearing the adoption of the euthanasia and assisted suicide law.
Since October, the manifesto has been circulating in circulation, signed by the leaders of the aliative treatment of the dr. Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr Bernard Lapointe, in which they demonstrate their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, the Quebec health system is not efficient enough to ensure all people's access to high-quality Palliative Care before it is possible to agree to the implementation of euthanasia.
As she says, she recently experienced a patient who spent 14 days in the emergency room in great pain without anyone taking the necessary steps to make her feel any relieved.
She is concerned that patients should not apply for death because they are not receiving appropriate care.
At the same time, many oncologists are caring for their patients until the last moments, regardless of the unfavourable prognosis.
Hélène Richard's chances of survival were already minimal when she left the demanding chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I was quitting the treatment, she said she regretted the fact that I was quitting fighting, telling us.
And she told me it was over!
There is no all-powerful care
Dr. Martel estimates that 90% of the sick who wish to die thank their attending physicians thank their attending physicians for not fulfilling their wishes when a team of cervishing cunt eased their pain.
But it has to be said that the Palliative Care is definitely not omnipotent in pain treatment.
According to Elsie Monereau, director for Palliative Care at the Grand Montréal Home Palliative Care Society, patients are resisting pain treatment in 8% of cases.
At the very end of life, doctors often use a pliative sedative to put the patient to sleep until the moment of the demise, either on the impact or whether the sedative is given to him permanently.
It is impossible to pretend that we do not perceive this part of suffering.
A patient we will not get rid of the pain will have an increasing opportunity to access the paliational sedatives.
The sick who are not provided with a sedative are always saying the same thing: 'I want to die'.
But this does not necessarily necessarily mean "I want you to give me euthanasia," it means more "I want you to relieve my pain."
The implementation of this report was made possible by a grant for journalists from the Canadian Institute for Health Research.
Extenshe real estate scandals in Quebec
Road administration officials, construction and public works businessmen, political party lobbyists and Italian mafias experts still tell what they know about the amazing "system" that mixes construction, civil servants, politicians, trade unionists and mobsters.
This "the field" cost the Quebec taxpayer very dearly, especially between 1990 and 2000.
"It is interesting how the system has been crumbled since we took major measures," says Jacques Duchesneau, a Quebec MP and former head of police in Montreal, ironically.
Thanks to him, a scandal erupted in 2011 on the basis of a rigorous inquiry into the embezzlement of funds in the context of road construction contracts in Quebec that the then-liberal Quebec prime minister, Jean Charest, approved only after lengthy deferrals.
The "Duchesneau report" confirmed a direct link between the industry, opaque party funding and the corruption of civil servants.
"Sever since the investigation began in 2010," he says, "the Department of Transportation alone has investigated a billion dollars in contracts," when some people kept their instincts to gain a share of them!
The Charbonneau Commission "alone brought two mayors to resign," he adds, hoping to "cover the cunning of some people."
Permanent Corruption Unit established in 2011
A permanent corrupt force founded in 2011 is also involved in the fight with its military of government controllers, investigators and analysts.
On top of that, the "Marteau's retinue" police officers, who have ensured since 2009 that the Montreal "cards of money" would significantly mitigate the auctioning of contracts...
In recent weeks, they have conducted a series of searches and indicted for fraud and corruption charges a number of municipal councillors, such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, the mayor of a suburban municipality.
Another on the list is to be Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just resigned as mayor of Laval, the third largest Quebec city.
He is suspected of repeatedly accepting bribes in exchange for public contracts.
The formal charges have also been received by transport engineers from Montreal and Italian-born entrepreneurs such as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito.
Lino Zambito drew a sensation by explaining the "system" mechanism for obtaining public procurement to the commission.
He himself devoted over those years to the 3% of the value of the contracts he had won in Montreal to a midfielvector associated with the Mafia, who then transferred the money to the Union Montréal party, for which the mayor of Gérald Tremblay ran.
Zambito was generous in all sides after 2000, and donated more than $88,000 to Canadian dollars (approximately 68,000 euros) to provincial parties, but especially to the Liberals in power at the time.
He also admitted to organizing illegal fundraising for former liberal Deputy Prime Minister Nathalie Normandeau.
Contracts of money-making, the prices of which he overstated
In Montreal, the "system" of corruption worked very briskly.
Gilles Surprenant, a former transport engineer, described him in great detail to the commission: over the course of ten years, he received gifts from the construction companies, the invitation to the tours, the golf tournaments, the restaurants, the hockey games and the pocket money worth a total of $736,000 in exchange for contracts with the money-touring contracts at which he overstated the price.
Other public officials from the traffic sector admitted to having paid their bonuses for upgrazing by 30% to 40% to overestimate invoices through false extras.
The mayor's party organizer, Martin Dumont, then accused Tremblay of having no embarrassment to turn a blind eye to the parallel budget that brought dirty money into his coffers.
On the basis of these revelations, Tremblay resigned in early November, plunging Montréal into a major crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was among the first Montreal MPs to issue a warning signal.
As mayor of the district of Rivière-des-Prairies in the east of the island, it has been advocating since 2010 against the sale of a municipal land purchased for $5 million and sold for... 1.6 million promoters directly in the middle of a flourishing real estate deal.
70% of dirty money in election campaigns
The investigation, which will finally be launched, says it says that "he is pulling the strings in an attempt to understand the functioning of the coy-watering system to stop the gangrene and catch the culprits."
The trial, she said, was "painful but positive."
We are in the wound cleaning phase, but it is necessary to set up our own investigative unit in Montreal and to ensure supervision so that these dubious practices cannot be reversed back.
Like cleaning up.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau himself says that "the public officials have seised hundreds of millions of dollars," but he is particularly concerned about the role of "misinformed by the informants of this crap" if they did not get involved in these shenanies!
He estimates that 70% of the funding for election campaigns in Quebec comes from dirty money, adding with irony: "I have heard that this is just a weak brew of reality."
The Quebec government proposes to limit the donations to the parties to $100, but he says that will not resolve the situation: "Until the electoral spending is strictly unlimited, dirty money will not disappear from politics."
It proposes a comprehensive review of the awarding and party funding system: "We can't fall back to the backstablet; if we boldly focus on the essence of things, we can rebuild on a firmer footing and with more scrutiny and law enforcement."
If this story has blacked out an image of Quebec and Montreal abroad, Duchesneau recommends everyone who mocked him to see his own backyard...
"PSG is not FC Barcelona!"
This season you and PSG have set a whole new pace.
How do you explain this development?
It can be explained by the fact that all individuals went into each other, or the absolutely new dimension of PSG.
The big players came to us.
I get on with them every day.
The technical team helped me a lot, too.
Every day, these realities allow me to raise the level of the game.
And it's easier in the games.
In football, everything goes very fast.
I'm not dwling my head.
Ever since my beginnings in the prep school at INF Clairefontaine to the transfer to Saint-Etienne, I have always moved up by individual stages.
So you're using the competitive environment that was introduced by Carlo Ancelotti...
The ups were used to playing matches at a very high level.
They also know that every training is essential.
And it follows that a player like me then has a greater appetite for the match and wants to give the maximum performance.
Plus, Carlo Ancelotti gives me a lot of the status.
He has assistants to his hand like Claude Makelelele, who used to play in the same post as me.
And does Ancelotti have the final say at the right time?
Of course.
Ancelotti has the respect of all the technicians.
He is no equal in League One today and is one of Europe's best coaches.
He has vast experience and has won a lot of titles with top teams.
He also worked with excellent players.
I think he's going to win more titles in Paris.
I had a reassuring interview with him in January.
I've had a number of injuries.
The trust he gives me is another reason for my performance.
How do you feel about the first part of the PSG season?
In League One, Lyon took away our top position.
But we remain in tow.
One of our main goals is the Champions League: we made it to the last eight very easily.
What is your club's goal in this competition?
We'll try to go as far as we can.
Anything can happen now.
But we definitely want to be a tough opponent for quality European teams.
We want to win our qualifying group before Porto first so we can play in the last-eight rematch at home.
Can PSG become a big European club in the short term?
The budget's got it...
To become a major European club, Paris must win the titles and make history.
It is not like this yet.
PSG has the means on the financial side to implement this intention.
And would it be a big failure not to win in League One like last season?
Of course, that would be a big disappointment.
We really want to win the league title this year.
Last season we missed a lot.
We were disappointed in May because we had the time to win.
We had a great season.
We've collected 79 points.
Usually, with 79 points, you're a clear master...
But another club, Montpellier, had an even more astonishing season.
I think it will be done this year.
Even though the title is sought by the big teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux, I think we have the weapons at our disposal to beat them.
Do you think the media expect too much from PSG?
It is not unusual to expect a lot from us given what has been invested here and what players we have.
We totally accept that.
It's a fact that if we beat Troyes 4-0 at home and there's still something they blame us for in the paper, that's not exactly pleasant.
One asks what people want more from you.
Of course, you can't win 4-0 every weekend.
We're not FC Barcelona!
We're trying to set up a game style.
You need time to build a team.
In the Champions League, we proved that we can play.
Take a look at Manchester City, who didn't make it to the last eight for the second season, and they've also invested big sums!
Given the sum invested, you'd expect to be ahead of the other 15 points!
You insult the other clubs and the French league.
Clubs Lyon and Marseille, which did not do well well in last year's season, moved up to the next stage with the new PSG.
That shows how amazing the League One is.
I hope that in May we will be able to smile and tell ourselves that, despite all the difficulties, we have managed to win.
It seems as if PSG are relying on the performances of Zlatan Ibrahimovic in everything.
It is good that they say there is a "addiction to Zlatan."
That means Ibrahimovic is very efficient and that he scores a lot of goals.
That's why he came here and proves to be the star of the league.
Everywhere he went through, he's proven to be a big player, a world star.
In our team we respect both man and the players.
He, too, respects the people he has around him.
What he has achieved is truly exceptional.
This has also led others to raise their own level of play.
Thiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, also allows others to grow alongside each other.
How did you experience the Euro 2012 with the French national team?
As a disappointment.
I really wanted to play in this tournament.
Unfortunately, because of my injury, I couldn't play the way I'd have imagined.
But I experienced it and came out stronger.
Today I am also doing well in the national team to play good matches.
And that's what I've been hoping for since I took over.
We have learned from what happened in Ukraine and today we owe it to ourselves to make our demeanour exemplary.
How do you feel about the first months of Didier Deschamps at the top of the national team?
There are results for him.
We are in a good place in qualifying for the World Championships.
The coach selects sternly, is close to the players and he can thrilled to win.
So was Laurent Blanc.
I don't want to compare them.
Blanc has achieved his goal by qualifying for the Euros.
I hope Didier Deschamps will take our team to Brazil.
Is the draw (1-1) of October 16 in Spain a solid starting game?
This game gave us confidence.
We all fought for the team.
Before this shock in Spain, I have not experienced such a match in my career.
Thanks to Bitcoin, you can pay and sell without banks
All the downsides to current financial transactions based on central banks, identified transactions and the cost of processing between beneficiaries.
Moreover, as is often true within these technologies, there is an obvious political outlook: the belief that the existing financial system built on banking monopolies is leading to financial crises.
Bitcoin, inventor of which is Satoshi Nakamoto (pseudonymous), represents both virtual money (transferable to dollars, euros...), and a secure transfer protocol similar to the BitTorrent, which allows the file exchange between pairs of partners.
Thanks to the 15,000 computers involved in the network, about 200,000 transactions have already been registered.
About a thousand websites already accept bitcoin as gifts or as a means of payment.
Bitcoin's exchange rate first reached a peak of $30 ($23) in June 2011, dropping to $2 five months later, hovering at about $10 today (the odds overview is shown on bitcoincharts.com).
Compared to the world's in exchange for real money or financial products, this is not impressive.
And yet the European Central Bank (ECB) is interested in this in its report on virtual finance, which was published in October.
Bitcoin calls it "the most successful virtual money," a "competing dollar and the euro" and "the day of ordinary money."
Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual money in that it is, as "credits" used to advance in the video game, which one obtains through the game or which one can buy (and sometimes replace it again).
The social network Facebook has also developed a similar system.
But every month, the central authority checks and processes individual communications.
In the case of Bitcoin, all nodes of the network are current account books, inspectors, issuers of money and buyers as well as sellers.
How does this network work?
Each transaction between two users actually takes place between two e-mail addresses.
However, the user can choose a different address for each payment, thus ensuring anonymity.
The information file related to this transaction is electronically signed by a double-cermal encryption system.
The network can thus verify the legitimacy of the transaction.
The content of the file further allows for the possibility to ensure that the exchanged bitcoins exist in a public book of current accounts, which is distributed throughout the network.
The key phase is to write this new transaction in this book.
It is through the process of resolving the mathematical task commissioned by the computers, whose solicfutor, a temporary central banker, will have the right to finish this additional line.
This is a stage of dismembering the file; i.e. the transformation of the huge file into a shorter and unique digital imprint.
Computers "transcow" to this new transaction and add a number to it, only then to "slash" the whole.
The goal is to find a number that provides a specific imprint (a lot of zeros at the beginning).
As soon as this number is found, the other nodes will easily check its accuracy.
The transaction is then displayed in an indestructibly connected to a string of all other transactions; any modification would change the fingerprint.
If a user would like to pay twice the same money in a row for the purpose of fraud (within ten minutes), the network will only confirm one of the two transactions - the other one will be abandoned because each of them has a different print.
The computer that solves the challenge will win 50 bitcoins.
To avoid inflation, this remuneration is shared regularly by two, probably until the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is thus limited by 21 million, but can be divided into a hundred millionth, so the margin space is...
The difficulty of the task specified is also increased as the calculation level increases.
The net has seen its ups and downs.
Websites that provide services for Bitcoin have been attacked and stored bitcoins have been stolen.
"The used loophole does not concern the protocol itself," assures Pierre Noizat, who founded Paymium, a real-money payment company that uses the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also controls the money laundering options thanks to this anonymous service.
But this problem also applies to cash.
Prominent players like Wikipedia reject gifts of this nature.
Others, as a WordPress blog platform, receive them.
Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron of the Weizmann Institute in Israel recently analyzed a book of current accounts and proved that it does not overseer nearly 80% of bitcoin.
In November "Honer discounts" were launched.
"Firty $1,000 was exchanged," rejoices Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul's conversion of bitcoin into gold.
Pierre Noizat, who is also the author of a teaching book on this money, has great confidence in the potential of this technology as a transaction network.
Its system, Paytunia, is an equivalent credit card (with real money) or contactless mobile payment, but uses a Bitcoin system to verify transactions that make it cheaper.
In addition, the wearer manages his identity and can thus remain anonymous.
The system is easy to set up for merchants where there is no need to install new terminals or software.
Just give the address that can be "photographed and discerned" by your phone, Pierre Noizat states, assuring that it already has thousands of users.
There is a general movement to question hierarchical systems and a transition to more horizontal systems.
"It will take a while for Bitcoin to assert himself, but 2013 could be crucial," he predicts.
In addition, in its report, the ECB envisages a rethink of the various risks that are now considered to be increased if this type of money is successful.
We left Afghanistan.
What's next?
French troops have left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and U.S. troops should follow in late 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to take control of its territory and for the Afghans to choose their own future and not wait for everything from us.
The greatest harm was suffered by the people in the Afghan countryside, who we punished because we considered them terrorists.
And so are we, we've lost 88 soldiers killed, and all the wounded and maithesed.
The Taliban are composed of foreign extremists, former leaders who have fled to Pakistan, but are often peasants who reject the presence of foreign armies as in Soviet times.
They just want to defend their ancient and archaic traditions, even with the jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks, Tajiks joining them.
They are now experiencing tolerance and frequent help from local rebels, but if the Western forces withdraw, their support will decline.
The departure of the French units from the foundation of Nijrab, which I watched from the peaks of the mountains littered with almonds thanks to French loans, took place in an orderly fashion.
Convoys of trucks and armored vehicles arrived in Kabul without attacking with the aerial accompaniment of helicopters.
As of the end of 2014, the Taliban will no longer be as active in Kabul.
Since their unstoppable practice from 1994 to 1996, conditions have changed considerably.
Kabul was empty then, and the ground was in the blood and fire as a result of the fighting between the various resistance groups.
Their takeover of the country was then considered a kind of liberation, a return to security.
The Afghans paid the price for the obscurity of these peasants, which were completely dominated by the Al-Qaeda organization, but their situation has not improved until our time.
The former Mujahideen, the Afghan government and the current Taliban agree in an attempt to preserve women in a subordinate position.
The chief dignitaries of the war against the Soviet troops returned to power in 2001.
They became trafficks, seized the state-owned land they sold as building land to refugees from Iran and Pakistan, and used huge U.S. contracts for subcontractors.
They discredited themselves; most of them had never even been in combat.
From what I've heard in the campaigns, people are craving a government that will not be made up of thieves.
Many of the young want to leave as those who have managed to take advantage of American generosity will leave: the capital flight is significant.
The young are tired of the war and its associated ideology.
During their exile in Iran or Pakistan, they got to know the modern world and their advantages were intrigued by it.
About 65% of the population is under 25; there are currently 5 million people in Kabul, a fifth of the total population.
In the cities, state schools are full, with girls and boys.
These young people will need to be given jobs, they no longer want to return to the obscurantism of the former parties or to the corruption of some of the leaders.
Everyone, including the armed opposition, likes mobile phones; they watch TV and Turkish series, which show the modern world, everywhere.
The army is already present.
Will the authorities that lead it in the lead be considered legitimate?
Former commanders of the fight against the Soviet army are already being relacking provincial militias beyond the control of central power.
Afghanistan, a mountainous country with a strong influence of local identity, should enjoy some degree of decentralisation along the lines of Western nations, but the US wanted to transform it into a centralized state with strong presidential influence, so that the post of prime minister, which had existed since the adoption of the Constitution in 1964.
President Karzai does not want foreign control, especially on the occasion of the elections scheduled for April 2014.
But his country has been heavily dependent on foreign aid since the 1950s and earlier years.
No industry has been restored, no dam is working, no major irrigation system is being repaired.
Everything is imported; nothing is being done, only fruit and vegetables.
Priority is the private initiative.
In a country destroyed by three decades of war, government infrastructure control would be necessary.
Rumors have been overtaken that Afghanistan has a huge mineral wealth.
And this only fated the feeling that the Western states were only there to seize it.
Without the energy for the processing of iron ore or copper on site and without the means to transport raw materials through the mountains, however, there can be no mining of minerals.
The Chinese have almost left the Mes Aynak copper mine, leaving the international archaeological teams (at the support of the World Bank) to explore the sprawling Buddhist compound to retain the role of the most important employer in the entire province.
One day, Afghanistan and Pakistan, on which a large proportion of imports and exports depends, will also need to resume normal relations.
The departure of the French combat units was completed on 20 November.
The new cooperation agreement foresees the continuation of the common types of assistance: girls' and boys' lycee, the Department of French at the Universities, the French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural fields, the promotion of an archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, the "Getting Heat and Soul" initiative has worked, attempting to harmonise the assistance and military activities, in which the Ministry of Defence's "Citizen-Army Steps" service, which was abolished in 2012, but achieved a number of successes in the area of mutual interest and agricultural recovery in dozens of mountain villages, thanks to a small French NGO.
These works, involving a multitude of local workers, helped to dampen uprises: irrigation, wells, drinking water, woodland, fruit trees, protection of the soil and the expansion of cultivatable areas.
What memory will we leave after two billion euros of army spending?
A much more modest budget would contribute to improving the local living conditions, which are very challenging in these valleys, which are often at an altitude above 2 000 m.
The embassy received dozens of written requests for small-scale agricultural aid from the local communities in the province of Kapisa.
To free themselves from the uprising led by foreign groups, these farmers wish, in their words, to achieve a slight civil assistance in their favour, which would be properly controlled and directly affected.
Difficult work on the Egyptian Constitution
President Mohamed Morsi has embarked on another game of poker.
While Egypt remains the most divided in its history because of the proclamation of a constitution that temporarily grants unlimited powers to it, it has decided to play the ball.
On Wednesday, he announced, regardless of everyone else's opinion, that the Constituent Assembly would approve the final text the next day.
Less than a week ago, the head of state awarded this rally another two months to complete the necessary work.
For almost two years, Egypt has been using a makeshift text that has been supplemented many times, weakening the country's constitutional stability and leading to legal conjecture.
This new initiative has only further strengthened the country's ambivalence.
From the opposition's point of view, the president persists in his "autocratic delirium," continues to "violate his word" and "trags the law."
But his supporters assure that this is a means of fending a constitutional and political crisis as quickly as possible and accelerate the transition process.
A referendum should take place in two weeks' time.
This is a very short period of time that will force the Brotherhood to withdraw from the intention to clarify the text to the Egyptians article after the article.
For the president, it is also a way of reintroduit national and democratic legitimacy, while the country is in the throes of protests.
As he confirmed in an interview with the American weekly Time, Mohamed Morsi seems convinced that the Egyptians will vote in favour.
Especially because this hastily organised vote puts the people of Egypt before the ultimatum: 'Either you approve my text or I will have unlimited powers' left to myself', which should otherwise end after the new constitution is approved.
And in this particular climate yesterday, the 85 members of the aforementioned Constituent Assembly, with a large majority of Islamists, approved the text.
Most of the Liberals were absent from the vote.
In mid-November, not long before the constitution was announced, they slammed through the door, saying they did not have the opportunity to assert their views.
Defenders of human rights, civil society or members of religious minorities have emulated their move.
In order to achieve the quorum, 11 alternate members were hastily added yesterday morning.
Some of them are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
It will then be unsurprised that the articles of the Constitution were often voted unanimously.
Commentators further questioned that one of the few disputes revolted around . . . a prayer class that day, with some committee members of the opinion that the hours in the conference room were not properly set up.
The text, which was still voted on last night, consists of 234 articles.
The subject of general attention, Article 2, remains the same as that of the 1971 constitution, and stipulates that "the principles of Sharia law are the main source of law."
The Salafist parties, for which the introduction of Islamic law is one of the essential requirements, hoped to replace the term "fundamentals" with the term "rules," which would allow for a more stringent application.
For the Islamists, the fact that this article was not corrected represents a sign of their goodwill and respect for other parts of Egyptian society.
"Hy-try," the liberals object, seeing only a rhetorical problem.
According to them, the Islamization of the Constitution takes place through other articles.
They focus in particular on Article 220, which entrust the consultancy role to the University of al-Azhar, in particular on issues relating to the monitoring of the conformity of the laws with Sharia law.
According to Egyptian expert Sophie Pommier, this is unsettling because "persons called for comment are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
This can be seen as the beginnings of the theocracy'.
The concerns of the Liberals are further fuedoned by the fact that the next university rector should be less moderate than the current one.
"So far, there has been no specific religious consequence.
With this constitution, Egypt remains a framework civil state.
Most of the lawyers who have worked on this text are not ulamans, but university staff, many of whom have studied in French schools," says Alexis Blouet, who is preparing a job on the constitutional transition in Egypt.
However, he agrees that "there may be contradictions about the interpretation of Article 220, because the terms used in it belong to the religious dictionary.
There is in particular a reference to "fiqh" [Islamic legal science, ed.].
And in the future, the question of the extent to which civil judges are competent to comment may be of the question of this."
The text approved yesterday is highly criticised in addition to the religious sites because of the expanded powers that awards the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood insists that there has been a significant reduction in them compared to the former regime.
Another disputed place: powers vested in the military.
In accordance with the wishes of the military's representatives, the verification of the defence budget will not be carried out by parliament, but by the National Defence Council.
Furthermore, the military courts will not be banned from driving with civilians, as the human rights association has called for.
These associations speak of their doubts in the context of the text, which they say is directed against freedom.
The offence of blasphemy is preserved and the insult remains prohibited, which could have serious consequences for freedom of expression, especially for the press.
Moreover, no article deals with the protection of women, stresses Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch.
In its view, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture laid down in Article 36.
This word was not mentioned in the previous Constitution.
While the Egyptian president was due to address a televised address last night, rallies are scheduled for this afternoon.
The followers of the head of state will then rally on Saturday.
In Israel, holy places, the world's navel and the sea are waiting for Ukrainian tourists from a saturated salt solution
The Promised Land combines the greatness of biblical truths, modern comforts, and the touch of nature.
AaF has identified the five most important reasons why you should visit Israel.
Cingle with the holy sites
To visit the Jordan River in which Jesus was christened.
It is said that all who enter this "peew" will descend on God's mercy.
And the Galilee - a place of Jesus' miracles: the transformation of the water into wine at the wedding, walking on water, the soothing of the storm and the filling of the nets.
Here, too, Jesus appeared to his disciples and after the resurrection.
But the most holy places are in Jerusalem.
The believers will pass the Passion of Path, or the Way of the Cross of Jesus (Laten: Via Dolorosa).
It begins at the fortress of Antonio - Pretoria - where the court took place, walks through the streets of the Old Town and leads to the Temple of the Holy Grave of God on Mount Golgotha - to a place of crucifixion, to the stone of the anointed and the place where Jesus was buried.
Here is the symbolic Christian navel of the world, which symbolizes the salvation of mankind.
And the monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem was built on the site where, according to the Christian legend, the tree from which they made the cross to Jesus' crucifixion grew.
In Jerusalem, there is also the most sacred place for the Jews - the Wire Wall, the rest of the temple that was destroyed by the Romans in 70 AD.
According to tradition, people of different faiths leave notebooks with wishes, which are then fulfilled.
Business a path of the vertical
The ruins of the fortress of Masada remained from a secret hiding place from the enemy that Herod the Great built in 25 BC for his family.
The ruins are located on reefs in the mountains at an altitude of 450 m above sea level.
It can only be reached by its own forces by those involved in climbing.
The others will take the cable car to this historic mountain.
And in the north of the country, at an altitude of 1,600-2040 m, there is the well-known ski resort Hermon, which is experiencing a huge influx of tourists in the winter months.
To this skiing paradise, a shuttle bus takes tourists from the foot of the hill.
The total length of the mountain slopes is 45 km.
According to the ancient legend, the pagan gods supposedly lived on the top of the mountain.
Visit unique museums
There are around 300 museums in this country.
During one trip you can't visit all of them.
But at least five of them, the most interesting, are certainly worth a visit.
Among them is the Museum of Israel, located near the Knesset (parliament).
It houses the ancient Kumrán manuscripts, or scrolls of the Dead Sea, which were found in the caves of the Judea Desert, and approximately 500,000 archaeological and anthropological exhibits.
The Museum of Art in Tel-Aviv is also worth a visit.
His exhibition is widely represented by the Impressionists and Expressionists Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall, Picasso.
In Akkon you can visit the Al Basha spa museum, which for visitors are represented by several rooms of the ancient Turkish spa with mannequins of spa users and spa keepers from that time.
In Caesarei, the unique private museum, Ralli, is worth a visit, admiring the statues of Dalí and Roden.
There are no guides or souvenir shops.
Admission is free and donations are strictly rejected.
The Fifth Museum - the Holocaust Museum, or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv - tells of one of the most dramatic aspects of history.
The most tragic part of the museum - the Children's Memorial - was built in memory of 1.5 million children who were murdered in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You go in - and you find yourself in total darkness.
The stars glitter.
And the names of the Jewish children and the names of the countries in which they perished.
Ukraine is also being introduced.
Improve your health
Israel's three main spa resorts are on the Mediterranean, Red and Dead Sea coasts.
Each offers swimming pools, aquaparks, dolphinarium and oceananairia.
Interestingly, you can swim in the Red Sea even in the winter months, as the water temperature in it does not drop below 21 degrees Celsius and the air is heated to 23 degrees.
The dead sea is even warmer, and in it people bathe all year round.
The Dead Sea, by the way, is the strangest sea in the world, located at the lowest landrest point on the planet - at 417 m below sea level.
The bourger water in it is saturated with a saline solution that is easy to keep even people who can't swim.
The surrounding countryside is unrealistically beautiful.
Come here to undergo treatment using salt water - brine, and a healing mud that can treat health problems with dermatitis, allergies, asthma, ecstasma, arthritis, bronze inflammation, diabetes inflammation, diabetes to heal your frayed nerves.
Touch the mysterious ancient past
It's being protested by the ancient part of Tel Aviv - the town of Jaffa on the Mediterranean coast.
Across them was a famous naval route connecting Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia.
The references to this city are found in the oldest Greek and Egyptian legends.
According to legend, this is the place where Noah built his ark and Perseus saved the beautiful Andromeda, with which they then shared a long and happy life.
Tourists do indeed love the wanderings of the narrowed streets, named after the signs of the zodiac.
They say that if you press your face to the walls in the aisle of "his" sign, your luck will be favorably favourably favored.
In Jaffa, you may meet the newlyweds who come here from all over Israel and even from other countries to get their picture taken.
And in Caesarei - in the city of King Herod - you can walk through the Roman theatre and "conquer" the fortress of the Crusaders.
In Roman times, Caesarea was the capital of Judea and the seat of the Roman prosecutors, including Pontius's Pontsky.
The carefully renovated theatre is used today for evening concerts and opera performances.
Tourists, a word for a word
If you're going to Israel, you don't have to worry about your imperfect English: in this country, about 30% of the population speaks Russian.
It is better to take money with you in euros for the journey, but in dollars, which you can easily exchange for shekels (nowing 1 is approximately 3.8 shekels).
The city's transport is mainly buses, but there is a fast tram in Jerusalem, and in the city of Haifa there is the only metro line in the country with six stations that connect the lower city to the upper town.
It's basically an underground funicular.
Travelling by all types of urban public transport costs 6 shekels, for which you can travel with a 1.5 hour of rearranging.
In Israel, according to Jewish tradition, the Sabbath is celebrated on Saturday.
From Friday night to sunset on Saturday, work stops in marketplaces, shops and public transport.
And Sunday morning starts the working week.
In many cafes, restaurants and hotels, you will only get kosher meals: with the exception of pork, seafood, no-scan fish and dishes that include a combination of milk and meat.
They offer a large selection of sauce and beef, soups and desserts, prepared from coconut milk, traditional Jewish mush cream hummus, a variety of sauces, minced chickpeas balls - falafel, fruit and vegetables.
There are no stray dogs on the streets of Israeli cities.
But there are very many fattened cats who are graciously "toughet to their taste."
In the evening, you can see them sleeping on the roofs of parked cars.
The purred cats love populated places and are relish in every goodness.
Renting a car, according to the car, will cost from $37 per day (Hyundai Getz) to $188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80) per day.
Plus insurance - $15 a day.
And borrowing a bike will cost around 15 shekels a day.
Tickets for the museums cost an average of 30 shekels.
Exited by the numbers
In 2012, more than three million tourists from around the world visited Israel.
To recognize the country and to rest came the most citizens of the US, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England and Ukraine.
The promised land was visited by 118,8 thousand Ukrainian tourists from January to October 2012, up 51% from the same period in 2010, before the visa waiver on 9 February 2011.
"Big and Powerful" to Moscow announces: emigrants save their language money
While MPs and human rights activists are still debating the law on compulsory language exams, fraudsters have already appeared in the country selling 'futilished' certificates
In Moscow, St. Petersburg and other Russian cities, 13 million foreign workers come to the city of next year.
Most of them are citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmen.
Their only goal is to make enough money to support families at home.
On 1 December, a law came into force, under which each working migrant will be required to pass a test of knowledge of the Russian language.
So far, this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the services, housing and municipal sectors, lifestyle and retail sales sectors.
However, the FMS promises that over time the relevant tests will be mandatory for all visitors.
However, the exams will consist not only of language skills, but also of Russian history and the foundations of law.
The knowledge of the language will also have to be confirmed for obtaining and extending the work permit.
The exemption applies only to the citizens of countries where Russian is an official language.
This law is not subject to people who successfully obtained an attestation and obtain an academic diploma until the collapse of the USSR in 1991.
Use, condemnation and protection of rights
The network of examiners will be working under the auspices of the Pushkin Institute of Russian Language, the University of Friendship between the Nations, the Moscow State University, the State University of St. Petersburg and other Russian universities.
Migrants can take exams in all cities; more than 160 such centres are already open in Russia.
The initiative to support the introduction of the testing was also supported by the members of the State Duma and FMS (Federal Migration Services).
But before the law came into force, human rights defenders were able to ask the press many times: what would it really bring?
What will change the obligation to know the language for the Russians and for the visitors themselves?
For starters - the migration service's representatives respond - this will make it possible to reduce the number of people who are suffering as a result of 'Totroco's work'.
Many people are now talking about protecting the rights of migrant workers, explains FMS Russian Chairman of the Board of Directors in Tajikistan, Viktor Sebelev.
The protection of their rights should be initiated before they leave.
Only the system of organised recruitment will make it possible to solve the problems of foreign workers 90%.
Problems arise for emigrants without professions, without education, who do not know the language and do not have a medical examination.
Without knowledge of the language - he says with the conviction of Self-assion - the future migrant is doomed to clashes with dishonest people who, on the pretext of help, will provide him with "victertion" for the horrible, tight hostels in which he and dozens of others, such as himself, will languish for months without food and documents and toil for 12 to 14 hours a day.
We receive many complaints from our migrant workers.
"In their homeland, they promise them one thing, but they will be cheated on arrival, confiscated their passports, they do not pay the promised wages," confirms the head of the Main Tajžice Work Migration Administration of MS Tola Sharipov.
Don't wit!
All less so because many of the Central Asian republics who intend to go to work in Russia acknowledge that they are not only unaveined with the language of the country they want to get into, but do not even have the experience of the work.
Of course, it is not so much their fault as it is unhappiness: only very few Turkmen, Uzbeks, Tajiks can afford to receive at least adequate basic education.
After all, their families also need to feed their children with something, not to mention the fact that they need to be dressed, put on, and equip them for school.
As children grow into working age, they must go to work at the first opportunity.
Without knowledge of the language, it's hard - they admit.
"You feel humiliated and inferior."
It is true that, in the light of the Language Tests Act, the human rights defenders point to one important thing.
Testing will only be carried out for those migrants who are legally in position.
If they don't have it, they won't take exams or get any more official work.
Meanwhile, most migrant workers live illegally as they used to in Russia.
"Welcome, or Unopled in the Uncalled Entry"
Many of the incoming workers say that getting official status in our country is not easy.
The reason - the bureaucratic obstacles and all the linguistic difficulties.
Legalization, moreover, costs money: from 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
But a fake registration can be obtained quickly and only one and a half thousand.
Russian police staff know we have basically fake documents, without registration, and there are cases of blackmail.
"They require a hundred, two for cigarettes, tea," - he shared with the press about his experience with Tajikistan's citizen Umed Kushkadamamov.
"Come, don't be stingy, buy a painting"
On the first day of the Language Act, it was found that not only migrants' registration documents were found to be false.
FMS staff have already confiscated several fake certificates of passing the language exam.
Counterfeit documents are printed on a plain colour printer.
Of course, they did not reach the new owners for free: each of the migrants, in the hope of making the test problem so easy, paid 7,000 rubles for the document.
That's two and a half times the amount more than passing the official test: it's going to cost the migrant workers three thousand roubles.
The main task of the immediate future is thus to safeguard the system from corruption so that workers cannot simply buy the documents, in which government officials and human rights defenders agree.
In the meantime, government authorities can promise foreign workers who failed the tests the first time they needed to take a course in the foundations of the Russian language.
Visitors who do not speak Russian are expected to work in areas where active negotiations with people are not required.
MVD (Ministry of the Interior) does not circulate the illegal market for weapons
The proportion of offences using legally held weapons is very low
Russia's MVD is tabling a proposal to tighten the law in relation to owners of civilian weapons.
It is a response by government authorities to recent events: the impetus for the shootings at weddings that passed without casualties and the massacre prepared by Moscow attorney Dimitrio Vinogradov, which resulted in seven deaths.
Police want to ban the carrying of dangerous weapons in public places and to increase the age from which to obtain a licence to carry weapons - from 18 to 21.
This idea is supported by the head of the Duma Committee for Security and the Fight against Corruption, Irin Yarovaj, who promised that changes to the Weapons Act would be submitted to the State Duma in the near future.
Not everyone is satisfied with the fact that the Russian state authorities are trying to cope with the problem of the "swatches of the screws" path.
An open letter has appeared in the network, with the authors - representatives of various social shooting organizations - demanding a rejection of the "sensionless tightening" of the law.
The percentage of hooliganity with registered weapons is minimal, said Vasily Lesnikov, a lawyer and criminologist in an interview with the Russian bureau of the BBC.
According to statistics from the Ministry of the Interior, 142 crimes were committed in the six months of 2012 by the use of firearms registered by the authorities of the Ministry of the Interior, while a total of 1168 thousand crimes were committed during the same period.
The authors of the open letter are convinced, the tightening of civil weapons legislation will not bring the perpetrators to switch to the "black" market.
In their words, any weapon can currently be found in Moscow at a low cost.
At present, the Ministry of the Interior claims that the situation with the proliferation of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: from races to officers
The "black" gun market is supplied with several channels.
The main channels are five, says retired colonel Victor Baraněc, who worked for ten years at the Department of Education and the General Staff.
Screenshot pages that take weapons orders
The first - "armal or military journey," that is, the weapon that was the adegated during the fighting in the Caucasus.
"The soldiers were also stolen by Russian officers and the Caucasians themselves," Baraněc says.
Another type of "black weapons" are guns stolen by criminals from security forces officials.
Baranec explains that this includes thefts from police warehouses as well as weapons stolen directly from the employees of law enforcement authorities.
The illegal "mainly" go on sale from the military warehouses.
In many military warehouses, there are often explosions.
"It is proven that some of the fires were started intentionally - to cover up the manor," says the former soldier.
In the words of Barance, the contribution is also provided by the manufacturers of the gun.
"At present, private arms companies are being created that are not competitive on the international market and are decommissioning the weapons they supply to the black market, including Moscow," says the expert.
Another source of the "black" market is smuggling.
A particularly large number of pistols and vending machines come from poor countries such as Kyrgyzstan.
"There is their production, sometimes the weapons are made in small-production, and a mafia was created to organize their fluid production," explains the former soldier.
Where's the gun from?
Experts have read up the approximate share of individual sources of shipments of illegal weapons in the "black" market.
The report on this issue was prepared in 2011 by the Centre for Investor Analysis and the Design of Public Administration.
Specialists have dismantled the reports of the Ministry of the Interior and the Russian Statistical Office, the criminological literature and the data of public data portals focused on the topic of arms.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, researchers report, come from the military and executive authorities.
Half of all weapons have been found on the black market by "the fault of the official officials whose work is linked to the weapons," the report says.
According to the data available to the researchers, 17% of the weapons come from armed conflicts, in 14% of cases theft of weapons was stolen in their manufacture, 5% is "black archaeology."
The dealer-consultant at one of the gun shops who asked us not to give his name is believed to have been purchased by the guns found in the excavation by the black "archelogists" by now - they are simply too old.
Most often, he says, vendors go to military warehouses for new shipments for new shipments.
Through the Ensecor, the bidder buys a unit, such as a TT pistol.
You order the gun at his and he sells it to you over the fence.
"He takes it to the city and sells it for 900 euros apiece with two magazines," he tells me.
"The law is that the police are well in the pence, which is why whenever a plan burns to them to clarify the offences, they will carry out a control purchase with illegal arms dealers," the consultant adds.
"Like a luxury store"
The seller and the buyer are most likely to find each other through their acquaintances.
I visited websites and blogs until a guy came along who offered me the chance to switch to the "Tatrobes" platform, where there would be a man to lead me to the "out of out" where we would negotiate.
The award was mainly learned there
Military correspondent Viktor Baraněc
If I want to get a gun, I need a friend who knows the way out, the salesman tells us, the clerk.-I have such an acquaintance, but I don't fully trust him.
The sellers on the market are, but there is also a need to go, hypothetically "from Mr. Ivan Ivanovich, who asked me to tell me that my daughter's tooth had fallen out."
And now I get there through the person I'm sure of.
He'll only deliver them to me, too, because he knows I won't turn him in.
Beginners are looking for weapons in different ways.
Former soldier Viktor Baraněc tried to buy illegal weapons in the mid-1990s, when he was processing a essay to publish the subject.
The schemes, he said, had not changed.
They gave him an album with photographs of "everything you thought about."
"I felt like I was in a luxury store," the soldier recalls.
The buyer, in the words of Baraněce, is not offered a hulk in a bag - you can try everything out.
I, a potential client, just don't buy - we're going into the woods with the seller and we're going to build a target.
"They give me the chance to shoot, and when I find out that the weapon is shooting well, we are starting to act," the expert describes the procedure.
The reservor on the sofa
Search engines will bring you to the internet to the "Compact" groups, where you can buy a weapon "for different purposes."
This requires no documents or face-to-face meetings.
"Just have a set amount of money," the website says, "Buy a combat pistol or a vending machine."
On this site, users leave their notifications and ask questions.
And selling to minors?
"Of course no license," the user asks "Ivan" (the curriculum is preserved).
"I'll buy TT.Moscow" - briefly formulating the "Fedorenkov" request.
The Federal Security Service recently has pledged a vast network of dummy websites on the set-purchase, and people who wish to buy a military weapon can be shovel.
People flock like hungry fish for bait and then conquer coal in Siberia.
Military correspondent and senior military dignitary Viktor Baraněc
I've heard of such schemes:web sites are usually registered beyond the scope of Russian law.
People take orders.
The buyer makes the payment via the ATM.
"In response, the seller sends him a photograph and a description with instructions on where the weapon is hidden," says the press spokesperson for the NGO "Lawn right" Dmitry Kislov.
Viktor Baraněc confirms that after placing the order on the website, you can remain unarmed and find yourself behind bars.

Makarov for $100
When you buy an illegal firearm, you estimate you will pay the amount of usually between $100 to $900.
In the words of Dmitry Kislov of the NGO "Belield to the Gun" NGO, you get a Makarov pistol for between $100 and 300.
You have to wait a month to a month and a half months.
The weapon is shipped from warehouses for long-term storage through the warehouses of the middle article.
According to the official Bureau of Statistics, the number of these crimes in Russia fell by a total of 7% compared to the January-October 2011 period, and at 22.9 thousand cases, and the number of cleared cases of theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices decreased by 7.8%.
In the US, fast-food and supermarket workers strike
Work at the box office of "McDonald" will be passed by up to a quarter of all American teenagers
In recent days, there has been a wave of protests in America against low wages in Walmart's hypermarkets and the restaurants of popular fast-food chains, such as "McDonald," "Burger King," "Taco Bell," "Wendy's" and "Kentucky Fried Chicken."
So far, no one can predict whether this wave will be transformed into a wave of the ninth or whether it is meant to be extinguished soon.
All of this share is supported by trade unions and a number of left-wing social organisations.
In addition to the increase in the humble salaries received by the ranking staff at the Walmart and the fast-food systems, the aim of the protest organizers is to achieve their creation in their trade unions.
At present, this economic sector is virtually untouched by the trade union movement.
46 cents a year?
The events began last week after Thanksgiving, on the so-called "black Friday," when an orgy of cheap sales struck America, engulfed millions of residents and, in some cases, accompanied by fights.
On this day, some Walmart workers, in which 2.2 million people work worldwide, left their workplaces and demonstrated together with unions and left-wing activists of multinational commercial chain companies whose goods are for the people of the lower and middle-class.
Walmart sells everything around the world, from diapers to hunting rifles and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
Products in its stores are on average 8% to 27% cheaper than in major supermarkets.
That's why many low-Wage employees at Walmart stores only buy at work.
The availability and range of goods made the Walmart chain one of the largest companies in the Americas.
In the words of critics, Walmart can afford to sell goods so cheaply because they pay little of their employees.
They also complain about poor working conditions, such as the lack of automatic carts or hand-sensors.
Demonstrators on "Black Friday" demanded a pay rise and complained that the cost of the health insurance costs provided by the company rose sharply from $30 to $100 a month.
The typical Walmart worker receives $9.5 an hour, but this does not match the cost, the staff say.
Scientists at the University of California at Berkeley show that if Walmart raises the average wage to $12 per hour, it will cost the company $3.2 billion a year.
It is on average 1.1% more than this company is spending on salaries now.
If Walmart moves the wage increase fully to the shoulders of consumers, each visit to the shop will only cost 46 cents more.
As a result, customers spend about $12.39 more in a year than they do today.
Walmart's attorneys point out that the protest took place in only nine countries and should cause virtually no damage to the company.
"Black Friday" at the company's stores lasted from 8 a.m. on Thursday until midnight the following day, and during that time, Walmart was selling about 5,000 items of merchandise per second.
Overall, her coffers made nearly 100 million transactions on "Black Friday."
In an interview with the Huffington Post's left-leaning website, a representative, Dan Fogelman said the jobs had left jobs in total with "less than five" Walmart employees, and that the protest was all but the "further media sensation" orchestrated by the unions.
"An unoccupied treasury!"
Protests continued this week in New York, where their destination was not Walmart department stores (ticks in that progressive city are not very popular, and therefore hardly here), but "McDonald" and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald says he sells billions of portions, and then he doesn't even pay you sick leave and doesn't pay you properly for your honest work!
Jumaane Williams, New York City Council Member
Currently, the minimum wage for work in accordance with federal and New York regulations is $7.25 per hour.
Fastfood restaurants are gradually increasing this wage, but only slightly, and on average, their regular staff in New York receive $8.90 per hour.
In this expensive city, no one has a lower wage.
I don't quite understand how you can exist in New York for that kind of money.
Nearly a quarter of American teenagers who work for the "McDonald" pass the post-school desk and live with their parents.
Few people see it as their main source of livelihood or plan to stay there for a long time.
At the moment, I am constantly met in an interview with "McDonald" staff who complain that they have to live on this money and sometimes even feed my children from it.
On the other hand, a commentary hangs on the Wall Street Journal forum, the author of which notes that it is irresponsible to have children if you don't know how to feed them.
Participants in the protests, which began at 6:30 a.m. on Thursday at "McDonald" on 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that cashiers and cooks at fast-food outlets start receiving at least $15 per hour, more than double their current minimum wage.
They also called for trade unions to be set up in the fast food sector.
US law prohibit the administration from defending the establishment of trade unions and punish activists in the labor movement by bullying and dismissal.
On the other hand, the administration rarely makes their lives easier.
However, the introduction of fast food in the detonated food outlets of the trade unions is also complex for objective reasons.
One of the main reasons is the extremely high turnover of staff.
Disagree
There were noisy protests on this day in a number of other cheap restaurants in Manhattan.
The climax of the event was a rally at "McDonald" near Times Square at noon, where several local Democratic politicians, notably city council member Jumaane Williams, spoke, who said: "McDonald" says he sells billions of portions, and then doesn't even pay you sick pay and doesn't pay you properly for your honest work!"
The demonstrators also received the support of other prominent New York Democrats, such as the city's mayor's candidate, Bill de Blasio, who said that "we must speak together in support of fast-food workers to achieve a fair reward for their work and economic prosperity that every New Yorker deserves!"
As the New York Times described it, it was the largest event of its kind in the history of the American fast-food spheres.
But only a few hundred people attended, though by no means all of them were fast-food employees, who employ tens of thousands of people in New York.
Whether this event will become a spark to igth the flame of the mass movement is as yet unclear.
"So far, the brain is deceiving average"
Among fans of modern virtual reality technology, the augmented reality is a popular theme; lately, this means seeing the world especially through the prism of special glasses.
At its early summer, Google presented a working model for the news at its annual conference, and it was announced in November that Microsoft had also filed the application for the relevant patent.
An interview with the head of the interactive 3D technology group at the Cambridge-based laboratory at Microsoft Sharam Izadim's Cambridge laboratory shows that for the company's scientists, the glasses are a thing of the past.
They are attracted by the prospect of manipulating virtual objects in the air with bare hands, the creation of virtual public spaces.
- Please tell us, in a general way, what is your research group doing?
- We deal with human-machines interactions, but at the same time we try to push the boundaries of this interaction.
Humanity, meanwhile, is stuck in the stage of working with pixels on a flat screen, at most sometimes touching the screen with a finger.
We want to look for 5-10 years ahead and anticipate significant changes to this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and Kinect sensors are a step forward, and almost no Xbox is now on sale without Kinect sensors, because for all of them, the way to manage with gestures is very interesting.
- What else is ahead of us in the future?
- Regardless, the Kinect system has transferred the interaction to a physical level, very many interactions are still taking place on the flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input flow of information has improved (the system receives a larger amount of data), but the output flow is not particularly so far.
We are trying to change that, we are working on truly three-dimensional imaging systems based on various technologies, including projective ones.
You need to let the computer world into our physical world, make it more real.
To this end, however, it is necessary to get to know not only the user, but also the space around him.
Then we will be able to add virtual objects to the real world in a much more appropriate form.
And in the first place - to hell with those stupid virtual-reality helmets!
- What do you think of voice control?
That's a popular thing, but doesn't it be overestimation?
- Surely it cannot be considered a panacea - the question of privacy arises, because we do not always want to inform others in our surroundings about our activities and intentions.
In fact, all types of interaction with computers are good, but in their own environment.
For example, to control equipment in public places, we had a project in which we thought about gestures, but not about sweeping, just such skimmies, short.
The gests would not be taken with the camera of the device, but with a bracelet that would track the movements of the bones and muscles.
It's big so far, but it can theoretically be reduced to the size of a wrist watch.
In general, however, the future has a mixed type of control, such as a gesture + voice.
How's that?
- How, for example, will you ask me to give you this can of lemonade?
You'll say so and show it at the same time.
I usually just just talk.
- Oh, that's going to be very difficult to recognize.
- So you want to get the users to adapt to what the machine can or can't do at any given moment?
- That's not necessary at all, but it's a mutual rapprochement.
I think in the near future we will have to work primarily on developing new types of sensors that can more accurately detect human reactions.
These can be, for example, laser sensors that provide a relatively good depth resolution, this is very important.
- If you are to talk about your work with the Xbox Kinect sensors, what are your requirements for modern cameras?
Isn't the resolution, depth or anything else today?
- Basically the current generation - that's what we can bounce back from in our work on three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, it would be good to get 8 megapixels at 1,000 f/s.
But it's not just the megapixels themselves, it's like math and depth.
At the current point of view, all current technologies are insufficient for us - this adds work to algorithm designers.
So we have to keep in mind not only the resolution in the axes X and Y, but also Z.
So it's also very important to speed, the number of frames per second.
Human movement is quite dynamic, and the current data flows of 30 frames per second are frankly a little small, especially for gestures.
Stephen Betishes from our laboratory in Redmond made a touch sensor with adjustable processing delays of 1 to 100 ms, with the current, mass-produced sensors closer to the second value (60-100 ms).
Not everyone understands the degree of that affects a person's interaction with a machine.
For me at work it would be a very useful equivalent of such a device, I just don't need so many touches, but I need some extra per second.
- And increasing the number of cameras is not necessary?
- Three "cameras" are now used in the Kinect system, one of which is actually an infrared transmitter and the other - a reflected signal receiver.
And the third camera - that's actually a common sensor of the visible band.
This is not used to determine the depth of the object.
A larger number of cameras could potentially solve the problem ...
Or make it worse because it would increase the necessary volume of calculations made.
It would be nice to create a flexible analogue Kinect system, play with the curvature of the camera location and see how it helps in determining the three-dimensional position.
- If I recall correctly, Microsoft (as opposed to Google) did not present its glasses publicly.
Don't you think that when it comes to the daily use of augmented reality technology using special glasses, it is one of the most promising platforms?
- Of course, walking while constantly holding the smatphone in the raised hands is not very comfortable, but I think: the strongest option would be the "portable" form of the expansion of reality, when it would be possible to switch at any time from glasses to a smartphone, a projection display and on around.
The glasses - this is a very personal device, that's their strength (only you see private things), and at the same time also weakness - augmented reality based on the glasses will not allow you to work on virtual objects at the same time as other people.
- Imagine, for a moment, that the manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is available not only to Tony Stark in "Iron Man" but also to the ordinary mortal.
There is one problem that critics often point out:there is no touch response!
Hands don't feel anything!
What answers is your group preparing for this challenge?
- In my lectures, I often say that augmented reality - this is the seventh consecutive breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the addition of tactile sensations could easily become the eighth breakthrough.
So far, one of the interesting tricks is used - the use of the second hand as a kind of background for imaging.
He's excellently recording the compression!
But there are also technologies that are really focused on adding tangibility to these "flight-air features" - for example, the interference of a few directional ultrasonic rays at the defined point where the finger is located, evokes a tactile sensation, but it is still very faint - as if you were blowing on the tummy of your fingers.
There is also a wrist bracelet that affects the nerve endings in the fingers - also a promising direction.
- Have you tried to deceive the brain yet?
To think he's feeling what he seems to feel when he's seeing something when he's seeing something?
- That's a good idea, we haven't tried that yet.
Here is yet another challenge that will be fought for a long time - how to get a person who is physically in a very cramped space to believe that he is walking through an open, virtually endless space - we are also working on the concept of running tracks (not at all in the clubs), moving platforms, as well as huge balls.
If brain deception becomes a target, then work is still for many years.
This is what makes working on virtual reality so appealing to researchers - many things are in the very beginning.
Taste instead of culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" is a continuation of the "St Petersburg avant-garde" project, dedicated to the citizens leading the way, is the avant-garde of culture and the arts.
At the top of the list were already the eminent figures of the art scene of St. Petersburg, whose achievements go beyond the city, often find recognition in Europe without achieving all-inter's renown.
The new hero of "Rosbaltu" is the stunning artist Cyril Miller.
The whole city knows Cyril Miller - a bearded man who is all dressed in red, who you meet here at the Russian Museum, the one at the Summer Garden, the one in the fashion pubs and the openers.
The paintings of Cyril Miller, wherever they are on display, always attract crowds of spectators.
Cyril Miller is one of the purely social and philosophical St. Petersburg storytors, the creators of new mythologies.
Cyril Miller - this is the striking man of the St. Petersburg avant-garde of the late 80s and early 1990s.
In addition to being a city man, his appearance on the streets brings a smile to the people's face, he increases everyone's mood.
He recently picked up a flask and became a St. Petersburg organ grinder, having matured into this complex role with his entire bohemian life, philosophy and image.
- Cyril, why do you walk all over the city in red and not in yellow or, for example, in turquoise?
- I chose the red color as a designer dealing with the look and image.
In this world, the red colour represents a compromise between the artist, the imagemaker and the public.
While, in general, everything that is only a little different from gray is an aggressive and awakens bad qualities.
But my provocations are aimed at having a conversation established.
The whole history of my provocative acts is primarily an invitation to discuss.
- And when did you realize you had to be an artist?
- At the exhibition at the House of Culture in Nevsky, where my works were exhibited.
I understood what my journey was.
That's when the wave of old free unofficial artists passed, and I couldn't understand the new, free types of artists.
I befriended the new-wave artists, the post-gazonvic, who brought us to "Pushkin 10," and there were no other waves.
It attracted me to the theatre, to dress, to the music, to all genres except for the word.
- And all of this merged into your art-clinic ...- It was important for me to find yourself in the centre of St Petersburg's culture, where all the best forces of creativity should be gathered.
In 1995 I took a place on Pushkin 10 and there before the reconstruction there was a music-artělecký club, a bohemian club, home to the petraburg bohemian.
Much was born there:NOM, Tequila Jazz, don't forget how Šnura was brought in with the "Ucho Van Gogh" project.
Šnur and his friends sang light songs under the plywood, dressed in tight leotards, in the middle between them by the composer Igor Vdovin, who is now in fashion.
When the band started playing live, they became "Leningrad."
Trachtenberg led many programs of the Hali-Galli times.
We gave them Trachtěnberg, thus starting his great career, basic education and training he got from us.
Gallery "D 137", club "Gribojedov - this is the reverberice of the Art Clinic.
This is where our workers and permanent guests left.
I am the hero of the last century, when culture still meant something.
In 2000, the survey was held in the press, a special award being "People in Our City."
In the nomination of "Artist of the Year" I was named, which ended my peak.
In new times according to the old rules, the work is unpleasant, I am a man of the truth, honesty and culture of the last century.
In the current years it is easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are different things today, you can be popular, but not too cultural.
- Your works are characterised in a recognisable way.
- Many of my paintings - these are the hits in which the topicality and penetrating is vividly captured.
I'll have a programm show exhibition called "Russian Museum in Clowns."
Clowns are a timeless category.
I used to be social, now being so is painful and terrible.
But in clowns, everything is blurred, the tragic is taken.
I love the grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, to save the world through totalitarian disguise in the adjustment order.
Today, people meet by their clothes, focus on external mechanics, not the inner person.
Or maybe you can't shake his hand and you need to spit in his face.
And the deception will be removed by changing.
- We saw you the role of the city's organ grind recently.- A cultural city should have such a hero.
And who should be him if I not?
- Can commercial art be beautiful?
- Currently, commercial, utility art should be thorough, tactful, sweet.
There is a breakdown of cultures.
Previously, people would gather in clusters, to love one, simple other people.
Today everything has broken down on the micro-companies, today it is very hard to please everyone.
I'm not a $100 bill to appeal to everyone.
You need to think today who you like.
Today, every cultural hero has his 100 fans.
- And there will be several thousand spectators in Stas Mikhailov!
- Fans will come to him, where the sexually social sphere is involved.
And 300 people come to the cultural land, and 10,000 don't come, and the result is less management, money, everything withers.
I have fans, the main thing is that no one will flout them and break what is experienced.
When I was young, I painted pictures that hung on the wall at a collector's wall with Falk and Larionov.
I started with the paintings that people usually end up with.
Today, people often confuse concepts.
They say:Culture of the spiritual, culture of consumer.
There is no consumer culture, that is from elsewhere.
I am a man of the culture of yesterday, I grew up on the examples of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, refusing money to draw paintings.
And I'm for such a culture.
- Cyril, what is scarce in Petersburg?
- Good culture experts.
There is such a concept: an official through culture.
But not all of them can deal with culture.
In the days of proper Tsars, it wasn't in everything, the tsars, perhaps, didn't understand much culture, but they understood the need to support real experts.
There are good consultants in Moscow today.
Back home in St. Petersburg, we have people who might be experts, but they are tucked away in a corner somewhere, because there are a need for big experts who will correctly appreciate these experts and put them on the right track.
Today, taste is thriving.
The same Erarta, but it differs in that they sincerely say that not all modern art we accept, there are artists who should look for other museums.
- What do you think is Peterburk?
- Peterburk - this is not the capital of culture, there is much more culture in Moscow, there is the right land.
And on our angle, art is fare miserably.
We need cultural land, but with us today there are more writers than readers, that's wrong.
There are very many people in Europe who are inquisitive, who like to go to shows, concerts.
With us, such a layer is just weak.
We need art to become a fashionable affair, as it was at the beginning of the last century.
The project is implemented for the funds of the St. Petěrrbourg grant
Birth in Space
The country is in danger.
Global warming or collision with a killer asteroid.
Spacecraft caravans with Earthlings on board are on their way, looking for a replacement planet.
To save humanity, the main question arises: how to keep their house in the conditions of weightlessness or on a given surrogate planet?
I don't think the selection is very big.
In fact, there are only two planets that can be adopted, if only hypothetically.
"It's Venus and Mars," says a senior senior researcher at the State Astronomical Institute at P. K. Šternberg (SAIŠ) Vladimir Surdin.
But while conditions for life are better on Mars, temperatures reach 500 degrees Celsius on the surface of Venus.
It is only possible to live there at a great height or orbit in Venus... in space.
The issues of reproduction in the universe have started to be addressed by fauna scientists.
Already half a century ago, experiments were carried out on plants.
The four generations of peast grown in orbit are no different from their Earth's relatives.
It was then carried out by the insects to orbit - the very small fruit flies of Drosophil.
In 1979, a quail egg was sent into space to check for the embryo to evolve in weightlessness.
We get an absolutely normal bird on the climb.
But then the problems begin.
"There is a problem with this bird having to find a foothold, it must stand on its own two feet and start to move," says RAN's head of the Institute of Biomedical Problems Institute (IBMP) at RAN.
If they don't find support, the birds fall erratically and do somersaults.
After 10 hours, the newly-crawled birds had a complete demise of instincts.
The birds did not respond to the light or the sound.
And the trouble was, they just died in four days.
"Twice we let the birds glean, but then we refused because it is simply impossible to work with them there," says Vladimir Sychev, commenting on the failure of the experiment with chickens in space.
The last "miniarch" with the animals flew into orbit 16 years ago.
In the spring of 2013, the experiments will continue.
In the bio-saticality of "Bion," however, there will only be beings of one sex.
There was an experiment with rats who were already gravoid broadcasting into space.
They basically didn't discover anything supernatural.
"It was only on the biosatites, but again - this is a unique experiment and such attempts need to be carried out," says Vladimir Sychev.
After landing on the ground, the space rats were born offspring.
However, it has not yet been approached to the problem of reproduction directly in the universe.
It's a tough task.
Animals simply cannot realize their sexual instinct when the normal environment is lost.
Man, unlike animals, can in principle.
Homo sapiens reigns with abstract thinking and is able to create an appropriate emotional background.
For ethical reasons, such experiments are not conducted.
But women have been flying into space for 50 years.
The greatest danger was to Tereshkova.
The most valuable thing that mankind has is the female body.
Our Chaika had flown, and no one on Earth could have said whether they would last a flight into space.
Whether he can give birth to a child after such a flight.
"After all, no one has answered this question yet," says Vachtang Vachtang Vačnadze, a veteran of the rocket-space industry.
In June of 1964, more than a year after a flight into space, the first female-cosmonaut, Valentina Tereshkova, gave birth to a daughter.
The child's father was also cosmonaut Andriyan Nikolayev.
In 1988, the son of the second-chomcoat-cocred Svetlana Savicka was born, who visited the orbit twice and who also worked in the open space.
But the risk remains.
We have only a few cosmonauts who have been born after long years and are growing healthy offspring.
"In addition, it can be dangerous even in the orbital flights," says the cosmonaut-pilot, Hero of the Soviet Union and Hero of Russia, Valery Polyakov.
Yet humanity must inevitably seek new paths in the field of biotechnology, radiation protection, and the creation of artificial graves.
The CPK hydrolaboratory is a mandatory stage in the preparation for flight.
Here, in conditions with zero appeal, the cosmonauts are taking the habits needed to work in the open space.
The water mimics weightlessness.
Though for adults, the water is even a comfortable but, in its own way, a strange environment, it is a natural element for young children.
The little ichicanders seem to confirm that life on the ground comes from the ocean.
There is a link between the fact that the child is in the mother's amniotic's amniotic fluid on average for 9 months and that it makes it easier for them to get used to the water.
This is logical in principle, because from the moment of birth, from the moment of that first redeeming, only 2 weeks will pass.
"That's very little to make a child forget," says newborn swimming instructor Marina Aksenova.
In short - if weightlessness is a more natural state for a newborn baby, then for women, an inescapable gravity, an attractive force, is a more natural.
In weightlessness, the withers of the abdominal muscles, the pelvic muscles, the body's ability to expel the fetus decreases very quickly.
We can leave that aside if muscle activity stimulators in childbirth work.
After all, it is possible for the birth to take place in a special chamber in which the mother's organism is expred.
"What next?" Valery Poljakov asks the intricate questions.
On the other hand, the baby also needs artificial gravity.
If the organism does not have the gravity of the Earth's gravity, it cannot properly shape the skeleton or the system of muscles.
Newborn in orbit is not possible to dress up as an adult in a special suit with a load in which he could train.
He will simply be stripped of what he needs to develop unconditionally.
"If we go with you to an experiment that will allow the birth of a child in an alien environment, we will bring to Earth a disabled person who will be totally unadaptable to the local environment," predicts Igor Pestov, head of the IBMP bioethic Commission for IBMP RAN.
So the birth of children in the universe is now just a theoretical question.
But there will come a time when it will become a reality, and when the Earthlings will go in their ships to a far-be-detched planet that will become home to their descendants born in space.
Head of the SAO: Sheat-system control failed through politicians
The Czech Republic has good auditors and quality legislation in connection with public contracts, but lags behind in its application.
In an interview with Aktuálně.cz, the vice-president of the Supreme Audit Office, Miloslav Kala, says so.
"The law will never be perfect, but its application must be the right thing to do - that's what I think is missing from us," Kala comments on the current situation.
Similar conclusions are also indicated by joint control of Czech and German controllers.
As an example of incorrect practice, Petr Nečas's approach to the so-called "sharticsystma" refers to the so-called "chicsystem."
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the ODS would not harass the businessman by checking him - is he, therefore, banned or permitted?
"The law must be somehow set up, and if it does forbid something, then even the Prime Minister cannot prevent the activities of the office, which is obliged to go to check and enforce the obligations," Kala says.
At a meeting of the Audit Committee in the Chamber of Deputies, you spoke of a joint project between the Czech and German parties, in which the legislation on public procurement in both countries was compared.
What exactly was it?
This is a parallel check that we launched about two years ago.
In simple terms, the point is that European legislation regulates how to deal with public procurement, followed by individual national legislation and then through the practice itself.
We have put all this together, and even though the control is not yet completed, we have shown very interesting differences - in general, the legislation is perhaps "strighter and more perfect" in our country, however, the practice itself is better in Germany in some parameters.
So it is confirmed that it is not enough to create more and further precise rules, but the application of the law itself needs to be addressed.
What can this project actually help you do, what does it mean for you?
It is such joint control that could contribute to the avoidation of efforts to refine the laws, reduce and improve the limits when it does not have such a positive impact.
Economicality means getting the right thing as a reasonable (which does not always mean the lowest) price to avoid enrichment and possibly criminal conduct.
But by lowering the contract limit, we do not necessarily have to achieve this.
Maybe the system will be overwhelmed with so much "paper" that those who want to look for holes in that system will draw on it a lot more easily than if the limit would be higher.
You are talking about domestic problems with transcends of public procurement legislation.
How does the control system in Germany work?
Is the office similar to our SAO, or is it set up differently?
As far as the authorities are concerned, as the SAO operates there the Bundesrechnungshof, which is organised in the same way as we are, also has a college, only forms in a slightly different way, but in principle the two authorities are proceeding similarly.
The powers are also similar to a certain extent, but in the fact that Germany has a federal set-up, so it has these accounting yards at the level of the various Länder - in this, the system differs a bit from ours.
The BRH can only control the federal money, represented by the state funds in our country.
Public funds managed by the county and municipalities are checked there from the level of the federal accounting yards.
As far as legislation there is concerned, is that easier than ours?
In general, I would not like to compare this without specific data, however, in some respects Germany is often referred to as a model, but it is certainly not possible to say that it is better at everything.
Is it also necessary that they have better controllers?
Certainly not, but I'm saying again, I don't like that kind of comparisons.
But it has to be said that even countries that we see as a role model face a whole range of problems.
Otherwise, it wouldn't be of any benefit for them to cooperate with our office, would it?
As for domestic legislation, what did the amendment to the Public Procurement Act mean for your office, are there any of the effects on it?
Given that the period of validity of this amendment is relatively short, so it has not yet been reflected in the control actions in our country.
Because we are doing ex-post checks, we need to count on some delays.
We only observe this so far in the process of preparing future controls - we have kick-started our new tool "detfits of risk of inefficiency" through which we have chanlazed almost 14,000 public contracts, and we have analysed them - there, of course, the changes will be manifested there, because the limits will change, the conditions of some types of the tender will be adjusted and the like.
So you consider the approval of this law more to be a benefit or a further burden on the bureaucracy system?
I think this law is definitely a step in the right direction, and I hope that's confirmed.
A problem that may arise here that the rules will be "stroit" and it will not be possible to abide by them.
Already under the functioning of the previous rules, the audited persons are bound by the provider (for example, in the case of regional operational programmes by the regional council) to the fact that any non-compliance with the Public Procurement Act constitutes a breach of budgetary discipline.
Is it therefore worth making the law tightening up in this way?
I think not in this way.
The system must exclude those who want to challenge and abuse it, and not to punish those who commit a formal misconduct that has no impact on decision-making.
Such a system will only create more pressure on the bureaucracy.
Then how do we get out of it?
Let's see which way the road is not.
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the ODS would not harass entrepreneurs by inspecting the so-called 'shartch-system' - and what does that mean?
Is the ŠvarcSystemboned or allowed?
The law must be set up somehow, and if it does forbid something, then even the Prime Minister cannot prevent the activities of the office, which is required to go to check and enforce obligations.
He can say, "Let's change the law and we'll pass it up," but he can't say we're going to act like nothing.
There are fairly strict rules in the Public Procurement Act on how to formally be done - which is correct to protect the public tender.
But on the other hand, it is tragic when the candidate with the best bid is excluded only for formal shortcomings.
The law will never be perfect, but its application must be correct - that is what I think is missing from us.
Roads are frozen in places, but mostly passable
In several parts of the Czech Republic, the roads are frosted and also snowy.
But most of the roadways are passable, with caution somewhere.
Karlovy Vary Region
In the Karlovy Vary Region, the roads were passable this morning, but frosted in places and also snowy.
The temperature has dropped between five and ten degrees below zero, but is expected to warm up slightly during the day.
The snowfall in the region has stopped and only a weak layer lies in the lowlands.
On the ridges of the Ore Mountains, however, there is about 30 centimetres of snow.
There was also lower visibility due to fog in places, according to the control room of the regional road workers.
The R6 expressway and the first-class roads are now passable in the region without restrictions.
Caution, however, is in place, for example, on some bridg houses, where the surface can be frosty and slippery.
The travelways of the second and third class are also available, including mountain roads.
On them, however, in some sections still lie the remains of frozen and travelled snow.
Especially at higher elevations, the ride needs to be given extra attention.
Pardubice and Hradec Králové Region
On some roads in eastern Bohemia there is a risk of frost, on higher ground and on the mountains there may be a travelled layer of snow on the roads, the Road and Motorway Directorate reports on its website.
Road crews warn drivers of frost, it can form especially in the higher elevations of the Pardubice Region.
The ice can be in the vicinity of Lanškroun, Ústí nad Orlicí, Poličky, Svitav or Vysoké Mýto, especially on the roads of second and third classes.
Chemically treated roads I/43 and I/34 at Svitav.
Snow is especially on the roads in the Giant Mountains and the Eagle Mountains.
The travelled snow layer is at the highest levels on the roads in the districts of Rychnov nad Kněžnou and Trutnov.
In eastern Bohemia today, it is most often clear to partly cloudy with no precipitation.
Temperatures usually range between minus three and plus one degree Celsius, with a light wind.
Plzeňský kraj
The roads in the Pilsen Region are passable this morning, but in places with increased caution and the ride needs to be adapted to the weather.
This is chilling in the morning, with temperatures ranging between three to nine degrees below freezing.
After the previous snow and subsequent cooling, some of the roads may be frosted.
Drivers have to count on fog in places, but visibility will gradually improve.
This is clear from the information of the Regional Road Dispatch.
The D5 motorway is almost free of restriction, but the road manager is advised to be extra careful between the 80 to 131 kilometres.
Most first-class roads have a dry and frozen surface.
In the southern Pilsen and Tachovsk, however, there may be frozen sections.
Second and third-class communications are wet and also in this case the frosted sections are notifications.
Drivers should be careful mainly on less frequented trips in the Šumava area.
Olomouc Region
Today, snow mash on the road must be counted by drivers heading to the highest levels of the Olomouc Region.
After the chemical sprinkle, she remained on the Red Mountain saddle and on the road in the direction of the Videl Cross.
Road workers were driven into the terrain by snow at night, snowing on Šumpersk, according to the travel managers, snowed about three centimetres.
In other parts of the county, the road roads are mostly passable without restrictions.
"On Šumpersk, the highest-leaf remnants lie in the highest positions.
Drivers have to count on the snow porridge on the Red Mountain saddle in the direction of Jeseník," the dispatcher of the Shumper Road Administration told the Czech Press Agency today.
Their colleagues set out into the field at night at the time and their colleagues on Jesenicko, the roads up to ae the highest positions are now bare and wet after chemical treatment.
On Olomouck the roads are passable without restrictions, but on Šternbersko drivers should be careful in the forest sections where the roads have remained damp.
Ústecký kraj, Liberec Region
Several difficult-to-trike locations are reported today in the morning by road workers in the north of Bohemia.
In addition to several places with fallen snow or ice, the mountain road from Telnice to Knínice to Ústí nad Labem is also closed, according to the police database.
Temperatures also stay below zero at lower altitas, so both the ice and the snow will probably last on the roads.In the lowlands, especially southeast of the Bohemian Central Mountains, on the contrary, there are no problems and the roads are generally dry.
Operating complications are not yet reported.
The occurrence of the ice reports road crews mainly from the surroundings of Štětí.
According to meteorologists, conditions were ideal for her at night - rain and melting snow during the day, clear and frost at night.
From the main draws, unfavourable conditions are also reported on the I/13 road on the border of the Ústí and Liberec regions.
The closure from Telnice to Knínice was forced by bent tree branches, which bent to the pavement of the road under the snow.
Šimon Ornest: We want to gather positive energy at concerts
What do you think of the end of the world in less than a month?
It's just one of the other alarms that we humans like to catch on.
Together with the band The Tap Tap, we make a joke of it and say that we are the only band in the world who can gather enough positive energy to delay or prevent the end of the world.
In December, in addition, you will stage a completely unique project three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you introduce it to the readers?
This is a nationwide fundraiser that we've been planning for two years.
We decided to tap into the marketing potential of the end of the Mayan calendar announced for December 21 at 11:10 a.m.
The day before, on December 20, from 9 p.m. there will be 3 concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will be out of the day when the Mayan calendar will end on Kiribati Island in the Pacific, which is 12 hours ahead of us in the time zone.
Who came up with this idea?
Originally it was probably my idea, then we invented everything together with our artist Honza Augusta.
In addition to the fact that we want to gather enough positive energy and prevent the end of the world, we also want to think, along with the public, about the state in which we will one day pass this world on to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the Mayan calendar, we have also created a unique collection of items of shoes, T-shirts, bags or original keys against the end of the world, which people can also support us by purchasing at www.e-tap.cz.
The Tap Tap, along with other performers, also sang the so-called anthem against the end of the world, which is called "The End of the World Cancelled."
She is already very popular on YouTube, will she also be heard at these benefit concerts?
Of course, at the very end, that is, if we succeed in everything and the end of the world is not...
It will be sung by all performers at all three concerts in parallel.
The anthems will suddenly also be intertoubted in a unique live broadcast on Czech Television.
The words for this song have been written and the main role of Jesus in the clip are played by Tomáš Hanák, it is also sung by Xindl X...
How did you get to work with them?
We also work with other personalities of the Czech cultural scene, given that we organize a lot of fundraising events and concerts...
We are trying to engage them intensively in these projects.
It turns out that most of them are interested and entertaining to work with us.
What will the proceeds from the concerts against the end of the world go to?
To equip the barrier-free education centre Studeo, which we have been implementing for the sixth year with the civic association Tap in the Jedlička Institute.
For school students, Jedlička's institute is regularly attended by lecturers and devoted to them in activities they enjoy and interest.
The students themselves do not have the means to go to the lecturers themselves, so we try to enable them to do so in this way.
As part of the completion of the Jedlička Institute, a separate building will be created in the future to which we will move with this project.
Each concert will feature several musical groups and performers.
How did you choose them?
We tried to put together a program that will appeal to all generations, including children.
For example, Chinaski, Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bangoo and Jiří Suchý will perform in Prague.
You can find out all the details at www.kpks.cz.
Are you planning any similar "bombastic events" for the future?
In May we will perform for the first time at the Prague Spring, so here too we will certainly prepare an interesting programme with interesting guests.
Next year we would also like to play at the Czech National House in New York, and I, when we are in the US, I would like to link it to performances in Washington and Chicago.
Your foreign plans are not minimalist, you have so far performed in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow, for example.
The Tap Tap is, however, a group made up of handicapped people.
How do you manage these journeys logistically and organizationally?
It's not as bad as it first appears.
We have five members on an electric cart, their carts have to travel in the luggage compartment, then, of course, we are lugging with us a large amount of cargo and crates with instruments...
However, so far it has always been done without any problems, with CSA and British Airways making a great preparation for us that I have wondered how many times.
Even in Moscow, from which we returned recently, it was no problem.
Thanks to trips abroad, you can compare how different ones differ in barrier-free, public access to the handicapped and the like.
What have you encountered so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other places where everything works better than ours, we have just seen in Russia that in the East everything is still in the very beginning.
Compared to Prague, Moscow is very barrier-free, here it is still unusual for a person on an electric cart to move in the city centre.
It doesn't even apply to such obviousness, as a wheelchair-in-writer, for example, preference in the lift.
Fortunately, civic associations are already being formed there as well, trying to draw attention to the problems of people with disabilities.
And in what way, on the other hand, do we still have to catch up on more advanced countries?
There's a lot of things we're still behind...
But it is important to mention that improving and improving the situation is always dependent on the efforts of the people involved.
In both London and Madrid, it is quite common for people with a heavy handicap to move independently in public, to go to the toilet, to the museum, anywhere...
But it is not very common for a large number of people with disabilities to actively participate in social life, in that, on the contrary, we are a little ahead with The Tap Tap!
Respecting the public or barrier-free is one thing, but it's only when we become important athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers that things start to change in earnest.
So far, these are isolated cases of people with a strong will.
The band Tap Tap is very popular at the moment, but let's go back a few years since you made you start it in 1998?
As a tin man, I joined the Jedlička Institute, where I had many young people around who were interested in doing something.
And since I am a musician myself, I play a saxophone, among other things, I started a special-interest music club with a colleague.
Well, over time, as our presenter Láďa Angelovič says, it got a little out of hand (laughter).
But the popularity came only in the last few years, or am I wrong?
It is true that it helped us when we started to connect with well-known singers and also actively work to promote the band.
We figured that a job that couldn't be seen didn't seem to exist.
In addition, thanks to the contributions from the European Union, we can afford quality tutors, equipment and so on.
Was your goal to make it this high with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning I felt the potential to do something differently.
Showbusiness is crowded with things where one imitates another.
It's logical in its own way, everything new is accepted cautiously and takes a long time.
Things that are unique are very few, but I dare say that Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression in the person who sees us for the first time is, of course, regret, that's natural...
But the regret is completely in vain, because people with disabilities are not suffering from all the abandoned beings we must be sorry for.
These are people who can live a full life and develop, provided, of course, that they have the means to do so.
I say that when people with a handicap get something done, it's not just a shift for them, it's for the whole of society.
Did it also help this success to be the strict boss, as many people have called you?
When we want to do quality work, we have to be uncompromising about many things and demand a certain discipline.
But I think that's perfectly normal.
Some people come to us with a romantic image and with their heads in the clouds, and when they find out they have to go to the exam twice the week, attend the product and spend a lot of time on the road to the concerts, the enthusiasm quickly leaves them.
But that's how it works everywhere, in every group that wants to work and who wants to achieve something.
The band The Tap Tap currently has 20 members.
How many of them were at her beginnings in 1998?
Only one Lada Angelovic.
We're an open group, people are leaving and coming, you can't stop it.
Those with the will and taste always have an open door with us
The day before the expected end of the world, on Thursday 20.12.2012 from 9 p.m.
It will take place in Prague Incheba Arena, Brno Fléda and Ostrava Gas-jit with the participation of 12 bands and other musicians from the Czech Republic
All three cities will be connected to the telebst at the end of the evening in the joint singing of the song by the band The Tap Tap "The Won't End of the World Cancelled"
The aim of the concert is to collect funds to equip the multifunctional barrier-free educational centre STUDEO at the Jedlička Institute in Prague in the volume of CZK 25 million
Admission to the concert is 400 CZK, children under 12 have free admission tickets in the pre-sale of the Bohemiaticket
Poland and the cosmos.
In the past week, at a meeting of ministers of the European Space Agency countries, Poland was admitted as the 20th member of this European Space Agency, as the second country from the countries of the former Eastern Bloc (after the Czech Republic, which became a full member of ESA on November 12, 2008).
Poland started close cooperation with ESA in 1994 and participated in a number of of Agency projects over the following years.
However, Poland's journey into space began much earlier.
The flight to space was attended to by Polish enthusiasts before the Second World War; but they did not always meet with understanding.
I will mention, for example, a lecture by A. Šternfeld at the Warsaw Astronomical Observatory, which on December 6, 1933, presented the ideas of his pioneering work Entrance to Space.
The young engineer's ideas (b. 1905) left the listener cold, and years later, Šternfeld recalled that only Dr. Jan Gadomski was interested in his work.
In 1934, Šternfeld won the Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch a prize for the Going to Space in France.
The recalled Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) later became a great promoter of astronomy and space.
He published hundreds of articles in Polish journals and wrote a number of books devoted to these scientific disciplines.
Gadomski became a world-famous promoter of spaceflight, and his contribution was also praised by the fact that one of the craters on the far side of the moon was named by his name.
Already in 1925 a rolling trolley was built in Poland to be fitted with a missile engine.
Unfortunately, the author of the proposal is not known and the details of the project are not known.
It is not even clear whether the rocket should have been used to start the trolleve or to brake it.
The information about this tsack is only known from the period press.
From 1933 missiles began to dwell with Polish artillery.
The research was provided by Komórka Technicii Uzbrojenia in cooperation with prof. Mieczyslaw Wolfk and Prof. Gustaw Mokrzyckiegi.
It is clear from the preserved materials that the research has reached the stage of the age-based exam.
However, the arrival of the German troops was interrupted by the research.
In 1937, a draft of a photoelectric fighter rocket, designed by engineer Rohoziński, appeared in the professional press, and in the following year the work of Rakieta - the torpedo powietrzna and the rakietobomba of the lottery for the author Leliwy-Krzywobtto, was published.
Both projects were intended for the military use of missile engines.
Just before the war, all military-use projects of missile technology were addressed by the Temporary Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy), which coordinated all the work.
The committee was founded in 1937, but after two years of activity, its activities ceased to be launched.
Other work devoted to spaceflight appears in the Polish press after the war thanks to the work of the Polish Astronaut Society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautycz).
For the first time, there is mention of the company in the November 1954 edition of the magazine Problems, which houses four more comprehensive articles devoted to astronautics.
In one of them, by Prof.M. Subotowicz, it is proposed to create a company to deal with spaceflight.
By then, artificial satellite projects were in the pipeline, and it was clear that space research was a forward-looking field.
Since the beginning of 1956, the Polish Astronautical Society (PTA) has tried to join the International Astetautical Federation (founded 1951) and became a full member of the PTA in the fall.
And in the following year, the first PTA president, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 to 1959) became vice-chairman of the International Astronautical Federation.
He held this position until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, the PTA has made a major contribution to the development of the highly successful Meteorological rocket RM (Racieta Meteorologiczna), which became the first Polish rocket to conduct scientific research.
The first RM-1 was completed in 1957 and was first launched on 10 October 1958.
The missile with a range of 1,800 metres was about 80 cm long and its weight was less than 5 kg.
Later, a perfuit RM-1A was built, and in the summer of 1959, the Bledov Desert flight tests of the two-stage RM-2 rocket were launched.
The rocket was 1.4 metres long and its weight was about 11.5 kg.
Another development type was supposed to be capable of real scientific work - the RM-34 rocket was supposed to have a range of up to 14.5 km and was tasked with tracking the high-altitude wind.
However, in 1962 further developments were suspended.
The first RM rockets were the A Meteor-1 rocket, developed between 1962 and 1965.
The rocket was designed as a two-stage, total length of 510 cm and the starting weight was 32.5 kg.
Three types (marked by Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) were developed, differing in the size of the space for scientific instruments.
The Meteor-1A racket was available for 0.4-litre space, the Meteor-1B with a volume of 0.34-litre and a Meteor-1C 0.62-litre.
The maximum range for all three types was 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1968, the Auschic Institute was the development of the Meteor-2 rocket, the first flight tests of which began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket had a starting weight of 380 kg and was able to carry a payload of 10 kg to a height of about 60 km.
Subsequently, versions of the Meteor-2H and Meteor-3.
It is also worth mentioning Poland's accession to COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 and the creation of the COSPAR National Committee two years later.
Poland also became involved in space exploration of Soviet artificial satellites as part of the Intercosmos program, and in 1978 the Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became the second intercosmaut after Vladimir Remko.
The repeal of the Public Work Act is not the solution.
In the past week, the Constitutional Court annulled the Public Works Act.
The resolution sparked a lively public debate.
It will certainly be interesting to look at the issue from a broader perspective.
Liberal-oriented economic systems in the EU as well as in a globalised world are based on the principle of more, unregulated competition.
In its effect, this means that the various economic departments, the national economic systems, stand in a permanent conflict between themselves.
The cause is the principle of free trade and the free, unrestricted movement of private capital, along with the unrivalled financial speculation.
As a result of significant differences in the cost of labour, (the pay) there is a price voltage.
This term should be understood as a situation where the manufacturer seeks to compete by importing cheap goods by "undering" the price of a competitor in order to tear down a greater market share and thereby increase its own profits.
On a massive scale, this means, for most entrepreneurs, either to transfer production abroad, or to buy cheaply or to disappear there.The result is high unemployment in countries where labour prices are high compared to other economies.
Because private equity has no social responsibility and thus the responsibility for its unemployment, social spending is necessarily rising for the state.
The whole situation is heightened by the total reluctance of the entrepreneurs' masters to pay taxes and thus to compensate for the economic and social society-wide damage he has done in the pursuit of profit.
The situation is so widely known that there is no need to provide specific statistical data.
Reckless practices of private capital create a situation in individual economies where national governments are forced to enter into competition with a view to artificially lowering the social level of the population's own population in order to attract foreign capital to the country.
In other words, governments are putting their own populations at a risk to private capital, regardless of the social downturn.
This is particularly reflected in changes to the laws in force.
The aim is to economically force their own population to adopt the price dictate of private capital, particularly in the area of wages.
This is done both through the economic coercion system in the event of long-term unemployment and by restricting workers' rights in the field of labour law.
The result is rising poverty, along with an increase in the gap between the poor and the rich.
In Germany, there have been public food outlets for many years for the poor, who cannot make a living from their own work.
The number of these people is already in the millions.
As part of the increase in the competitiveness of the German economy, there are quite common cases of duly employed people receiving such a wage that the state must pay them to the subsistence minimum.
Such a scandal was also made public in the case of the auxiliary staff of the Federal Assembly.
The austerity measures by virtually all of the southern EU states undoubtedly lead to the same state in which people are forced to either emigrate, under the pressure of a catastrophic fall in the social level, or to languish for hungry wages on the margins of society in the hope that private investment capital might one day come to the country.
But here it is necessary to ask where he will come from?
If it is from other EU countries, then poverty will move from one country to another, or it will not come at all, as a Chinese, an Indian, a Brazilian, or a Turk, a Moroccan, or an Egyptian, or an African, still working for a fraction of Europe's wages.
This applies to all of Latin America.
Liberal theory and the media to the hint of the fact that the state cannot participate in capital on its own economy, that a managed economy leads to an economic disaster.
Private capital sticking to the view that the state must not interfere with the economy by the management of the intervention.
Then it is necessary to ask whether it is influential in private capital, now it actually governs the policy and thus the whole state in its own egotistical sense.
Here is the unequivocal answer that it is.
The proof is the existence of a virtually all-powerful and, in all states, the ubiquitous lobby.
The result is a desperate situation manifested in the area of corruption, by providing mutual benefits, by legislating, where virtually everything is reprehensible, but nothing criminal.
In Germany, the situation is that state ministries for lack of funds are commissioning drafting bills to private legal firms that are often in liais and related to industry.
These bills are then agreed in the Bundestag.
All of them don't come from the people like Western-style constitutions say, but from financially strong groups who prefer their own interests.
It is clear that liberal-leaning democracies are now rapidly in the situation, as described by Appiános in its work The Crisis of the Roman Republic in the Time of Caesar and Pompey:" The state has long been in complete decay and the authorities were being taken forcibly.
For bribes, illegal sourcing of favor and with the use of stones or swords.
The bribery and corruption were rampant without any inhibitions, and the people went to the polls with a pre-sold voice" ..."characteristic people didn't even attend the office, so that once, as a result of this disruption, the state was eight months without consuls".. .."It was time to talk about the fact that the only cure in the evil situation was self-government and that it was necessary to elect an energetic man.." Appiános thought of Pompeia, but became him Caesar, who changed the democracy of the self-rule.
Conclusion As in antiquity, the current society is based on a reckless preference for its own benefit, regardless of the society's interest.
By its very nature, private capital is no longer able to understand and exercise society-wide benefits.
The result is now, as then, the unprecedented decadence of the elites without any effort to reform a deeper nature.
The caucus of the emergence of both fascist and communist regimes must therefore be sought in the ruthless liberalisation of the economic systems of the 19th and 20th centuries.
As it stands, the demise of these systems in favor of liberal-type democracy can be seen as a kind of break with the expectation of the next round.
What is particularly disastrous is the fact that the current elites are completely ignoring in the future the possible hundreds of thousands of dollars of loss of life, humanitarian and social disasters that we are already witnessing with the crimes against humanity as we know them from both old and new histories.
The repeal of the Public Work Act is not the solution, at least not to the permanent one.
Under the pressure of competition at both the international and domestic European level, the government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue looking for ways to further reduce the social population level.
This trend is therefore systemic.
The solution is targeted political- social reforms that will boost the state's capital participation in the economy, strengthen the influence of citizens on the government and weaken the monopoly position of private capital in society for the benefit of the state.

"There will be no violence and there will never be any way to go" Sting in the song Fragile, whose main verse in the chorus is "let's forget how fragile we are"
"If my sons didn't want wars, there would be no "great" dying Gutele Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild in 1849
After the last wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, as always, a lot of reactions have arged.
One stands behind Israel, argues for its right to self-defense, and cast the Palestinians as terrorists, others support the Palestinians, argue for the racism of the Israeli state, the genocide perpetrated against the Palestinian Arabs, and the state of Israel is cast as the role of a terrorist state.
I don't want to think about who is the culprit in the periodic repetitive waves of killing and who is the victim, after all, today's people of Israel, including the self-governing territories, were born into the current political situation and have not experienced the beginning of violence.
I am concerned with offering readers a look behind the curtain, a view of who, above all, has served the already 95-year-long tension (counted from the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) on a small piece of the Middle East country.
Some of my thoughts are supported by the available historical facts some are derived from them based on my own understanding of who or which group of people is the main driver of the events of modern history.
Humanity's history is, first and foremost, a struggle for power.
In each epoch we can trace one of this Alexander the Great or Napoleon.
What is not so evident is whether it was always these personalities who governed their actions in a totally autonomous way, or whether there was someone behind their throne who directed their actions to the pre-arranged goal.
We must admit that we live in a time when the world's wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few individuals and that this concentration of money and the resulting power could not have occurred in the lifetime of a generation.
Among these astronomically rich families, one stands out who might think of herself as the head of the octopus (if there is still someone above them I don't know, but I don't rule it out) - the Rothschields.
There's not much written about them.
Of course.
They bought the first press agency (Reuters) as early as the 1890s to stop the connection of their name with the highly criminal deeds they were behind, which always meant for them to consolidate power, the mass of wealth, or both.
They have the main stakes in almost every central bank in the world, and against countries where the shares in the central bank are not fought or are being prepared for wars (it was 7 countries before the attack on Afghanistan, after the invasion of Iraq it was 5 countries, after the overthrow of Gaddafi there were only four left, but in the meantime Russia subdated the central bank to the Russian government).
Whoever tried to defy this family died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to restore central bank status to Rothschield's Bank of America, began issuing his own (meaning government) money during the Civil War, and was assassinated in the theatre in 1865.
JFK began to issue his own money and wanted to abolish the FED, was assassinated in 1963, MP Louis Mc Fadden was poisoned in 1936 after he wanted to sue the FED for unleash the Great Depression in 1929.
Their desire for global power led to the formulation of the plan of the three World Wars by the most high-grade, 33rd stage-insecure by Albert Pik, in the years of 1859 to 1871 to form a plan for the world.
The first war was tasked with removing the large monarchist state states in Europe, the second was to remove the colonial estate of Great Britain in particular, and the third was to lead to a reduction in the world's population somewhere to 0.5 - 1 billion people (such a number of slaves are enough for their comfort and luxury and they don't consume as many resources), the creation of one universal religion (ecumenism is nothing more than a pre-themed for such a solution) and a final takeover of absolute power.
The method the group of the richest families, headed by the Rothschields, is to trigger the crisis and then offer a solution (order ab chao - order of chaos).
But these solutions are bogic and always lead to a deterioration in the situation (see the founding of the FED to avoid repeating crises like the one they brought about in 1907).
So after they succeeded in assassining the Habsburg-R-U heir to the throne, Ferdinand, in Sarajevo, to start World War I, destroying Tsarist Russia by launching the Bolshevik Revolution.
The First World War ended with sudden, military and economically unfounded, the surrender of Germany (there was no need for war to destroy Tsarist Russia) and subsequently the Central European power, Austria of Hungary, was fragmented.
To make it easier for the Second World War, the bankers of the politics had a latent conflictual situation created by imminent reparations on Germany, thus creating a prerequisite for the radicalization of the invultered masses, and then all they had to do was slip the Germans to the Germans, the culprits identifying and the simple solutions bidding the Führer, as well as the creation of a multinational Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority to play, and also played, the function of the fifth column, in igging a war fire.
In the late 19th century, the Rothschields were the founding of the Zionist Movement, one branch of which sought to create a Jewish state, preferably in the historical Judea region with Jerusalem as its capital (the return to Zion).
The aforementioned Balfour Declaration created a prerequisite for mass immigration of Jews to Palestine, the first clashes with the local Arab population.
The terrorist attacks took place on both sides.
World War II broke out, if Hitler went off the rails, on which international bankers initially held him, or all he did was hard to gauge, in any case, the suffering of European Jews in concentration camps was a prerequisite for the acceptance of the Jewish state by the world community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948 and, like Germany's war reparations were set for World War II, the declaration of the state of Israel was created by the outbreak of the Third War.
If international bankers succeed in unleascent it, the Jewish people, as in the second, will be victims in the first-line of combat, now together with the Arab or generally Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a vast laboratory, a source of contention and chaos not only within the country, but also internationally (let's just be as sharply divided by the people of supporters and opponents of Israel).
Who is the culprit and who is the victim in the Palestinian - Israel conflict, where the grievance breeds a grievance in an endless chain of violence when, at the beginning of everything, the greed of individuals and their desire for global power stood?
Here, it is necessary to distinguish the simple people of Israel from their leaders, because, like us, international bankers slip people to choose from the election exclusively to their own candidates.
The current prime minister of Israel's hawk, Netanyahu, is a typical example of a fascist, loyal international bankers, a politician who is doing his utmost to start a war with Iran that, would, given Iran's membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), threaten to escalate into global conflict and, given Iran's control over the Strait of Hormuz, through which 20% of all world's oil (the caseor-wide is only 2 miles wide) as well as the destruction of the world economy.
In what light now appear to be the words that David Rockefeller uttered in 1994: "All we need is a general crisis and people will agree to the new world order."
The new world order in their imagination is the world of masters and slaves.
A world where the rest of the human population serves the comfort of a handful of financial aristocracy.
A world where a newborn individual is implanted at birth with a chip that makes him a totally controlled being.
"And it forces all the small and the great, the rich, the poor, the free, and the slaves to have a brand on their right hand or on their foreheads, so that they cannot buy or sell who is not marked by the name of the beast or the digit of her name.
This needs to be understood: who has the mind to add the digits of the beast.
The number indicates a person, and it's the number sixty-six-six."
The film Argo: When the worst is the worst, call Hollywood
In November 1979, a crowd of Islamist students were seized by the US Embassy in Tehran and taken hostage by 52 diplomats.
They were to be released in exchange for the ousted Shand Mohamed Réz Páhlai, who fled to the US, which had been the patron saint of his regime for several decades, after the revolution.
For the US administration, the situation did not offer a positive way out - it could not afford to throw the Shabi overboard because it would thus fundamentally threaten trust with allies in other countries.
But the release of the hostage in Iran, where the revolution resulted in the establishment of a theocratic regime, was unable to reach.
It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which was later deepened by the fiasco of the attempt to free the hostages by force.
The jingled diplomats were eventually released after 444 days, after the negotiations were mediated by the Algerian government.
Their poling at home triggered a wave of solidarity and anti-Iranian sentiment.
The debacle in Iran contributed greatly to Jimmy Carter's loss to Ronaldo Reagan in the 1980 presidential election.
The film directed by actor Ben Affleck Argo describes one episode of that history that brought America a minor victory.
Just before the embassy was occupied, six employees fled it.
After difficult periods, they ended up at the residence of the Canadian ambassador.
The CIA, in cooperation with the Canadian authorities, managed to get them out of Iran, helped by an extravagant cover story - they went to the Canadian passports as members of the film crew who surveyed the country's loincloaf for the set of sci-fi big movies.
Combination of genres
The plan, devised by "exfiltration" expert Tony Mendez, also required the cooperation of Hollywood.
To make the legend credible, the film project was written about in specialized magazines, press conferences were held, the fictitious production company had a real office.
Details of the operation have been kept secret for a long time, based on the memories of Tony Mendez.
Affleck's film is a special combination of multiple genres.
On the one hand, a realistically conceived political thriller, at the same time a so-called "caper movie," a story of a successful piece, a backstake - an example is the Danny's Partners series.
The film thus alternates with moods - on the one hand, the documentary-concepted sequences from Tehran (the captive sequence shows iconic period photographs of events as well as the way the same situations were shown in the film - there are no big differences).
On the other side of the lightweight passages from Hollywood, dealt with irony and a mild exaggeration.
And then scenes from CIA headquarters and other institutions - the under-suit-chicles the situation at the meeting tables, in the corridors of the bureau, on the phone...
Ben Affleck made a remarkable career reboot.
He became a respected director from the mocked actor, and his acting ceased to be the target of ironic remarks.
Argo is his third feature film, after the dark crime Gone Baby Gone (2007) and the thriller City (2010).
It is also the first of Affleck's film to take place in the director's home home, Boston.
The sense of the atmosphere of the place was among the characteristics that the director's older films elegeed above the Hollywood standard.
And Affleck also shows it in Argo, where Tehran "plays" Canada.
The best scenes in the film take place in the streets, in the reconstruction of real events - the opening sequence of the embassy's fall is impressive in its clarity, which also conveys the emotion of the confusion and the recklessness that occurs when history is out of the blue.
Similar effect Affleck and his collaborators achieve in the fictional scenes (a false crew at the Tehran Bazaar).
Too many events in too many places
The director also had to deal with the fact that the story narrated does not actually offer much in the film sense of thrilling scenes.
He almost works with it quite successfully, sometimes he makes a point of reality - everything doesn't work out so gracefully there (a scene in which the imminent crisis at Tehran airport averts a phone call in America and a runway chase quite far-fetched).
But the weakness of Argo is the disenfroned resulting from the need to show too many events in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman are very charming in the roles of Hollywood collaborators, but their characters deserve more space and are far from the only one in the film.
Affleck's film is kind of losing its dramatic move, a film that can be watched with mild interest, to appreciate the realisation as well as the retro style evading the thrillers of the 1970s.
But it will be hard to tear down.
As a reminder of one in a way to date, a living history, as well as a testament to how exaggerated the notions of all-powerful and all-it-it-all secret services are, but suffice.
Rules for balloon-felling, bananas and a circus
The website www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which annually announces the poll for the most absurd bank fee, has now decided to announce a competition for "the most absurd regulation or ideas from the EU."
"We were led by the last event where the EU plans to accept a 40 percent quota for women in the management of large European companies," the poll organizer, Patrik Nacher, told Právo.
Among the absurdities nominated, for example, is the recent European Court's ruling on the unification of insurance premiums for men and women.
So far, women have been favoured in life insurance prices because they are objectively less risky for insurance companies.
"Fine some incredible ideas from the EU can be nominated by the end of this year.
The vote itself will then take place until the end of February 2013," Nacher informed.
The controversial EU regulation includes the mandatory incorporation of bio-plings into fuel, which is a detriment to nature as a result, as well as a ban on the use of reliable mercury thermometers simply because they contain a relatively small amount of hazardous substance, or a directive the size of chicken cetations that has made eggs soar this year.
Criticism was previously faced by a de facto ban on the use of the term spread of pomegranate butter or the removal of classic bulbs from sale.
High-quality bananas are supposed to be 14 centimetres
The EU apparatus is often decided by the trade or industrial lobby, whose demands in Brussels are usually defended by a state or a group of states (so the Czech Republic now, even with a threat of a veto, is advocating the demands of its banks).
The lobby's interest was also behind the fact that, for example, highest-quality bananas in the Union had to be at least 14 cm long and not allowed to exhibit "anomal curvature."
The European Commission defended itself by merely harmonising the inconsistent national standards that made trading more difficult to date.
Standards on fruit and vegetables have already been softened by the EU, despite opposition from some states, pointing out that the existing directives lead to food waste.
The candidate to win the poll may also be last year's EU regulation, according to which the inflatable balloons must be a mandatory warning that children under the age of 8 may not be inflating with the supervision of adults.
The EU has referred to US research here, according to which balloons among toys are the leading cause of death of children to asch.
A similar restriction now applies to children under 14 when blowing into the fair-timer fresses.
Curious ideas are also born at home
Quite absurd is the rule concerning the European officials themselves - anyone with an official function in the EU cannot use the name of Macedonia with regard to the sensitivity of the subject to Greece and must instead talk about FYROM (Former Republic of the Macedonia).
Bankruptplates.com, in cooperation with the association of liberal economists Laissez Faire, has nominated the EU regulation on the volume of food stocks in the territory of a Member State for the poll, in addition to some of the above absurdities.
The EU has set maximum amounts of food stocks that may have been on the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of our accession to the Union.
The Czech Republic then exceeded, for example, the specified volumes for canned mushrooms, for which it was facing a heavy fine.
The organizers of the poll were also intrigued by the idea of paying some countries for not having the seas and the idea of awarding subsidies for a grant.
However, these ideas were not created in Brussels, but in Prague.
"We are handicapped by the fact that we have no sea.
We will ask the European Union for a refund," said then Minister of Agriculture Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD) in autumn 2004.
As an argument, he said that a lot of grain had been harvested in our country and, as a result of the so-called intervention buying, the state had to be full of warehouses, which it had to export.
For the Czech Republic's continued to go to the ports, the EU was to pay us hundreds of millions of euros, according to Palas.
The European Commission eventually reached out to the Czech Republic by organizing a tender to buy grain from countries that do not have access to the sea.
The subsidy for obtaining the subsidy was offered to the municipalities by the Ministry of Regional Development, managed by Minister Pavel Nemec (US-DEU), namely to write an application for subsidies from Brussels.
EU: Bizarre regulations are the exception
While regulations are easily criticised in the Member States, EU efforts to regulate and, at the same time, to make the Union more effective to function and develop the whole Union, according to a number of experts, merit recognition.
A more serious problem, experts say, is drawing on EU subsidies for projects that have nothing to do with the deepening of European integration, but which were forced by the Member States in the budget negotiations.
The impurity among Czechs is also aveled ave of the fact that, like other countries of the Union, the Czech Republic must fight for the right to a specific designation of its traditional products in Brussels, while it does not always succeed in this match.
Although the Czechs defended the designation of Olomouc shapes after a six-year fight with the Germans and Austrians, but the domestic rum, the tradition of which dates back to the 19th century in our country, had to be renamed our producers domestic.
The name of the rum can only be carried by cane distillate products and not from sugar beet.
In the official EU-registered product list, the company of the world-famous feta and gorgonzola cheese, the marzipan from Lübeck, Germany, or Parmo ham, have already found them, for example, Carlsbad crackers, mountain and Třeboň carp and Hutter hops.
The EU's trademar can also be prided by Pardubice gingerbread and bitter tubes.
People want me to save the republic, but I'm an amateur, Okamura says
Senator, how does it occur to you that he wants to run for president?
I don't care about being a senator or a president.
If it works in our country without any problems, I'm not running for office.
But I can no longer watch the country steal for the last twenty years, the thieves run around, people's taxes and their retirement ages.
I had no idea to be a politician.
But when I see something I don't like, I try to come up with a solution to change it.
And since I've turned 40 and I'm an independent outsider, I have no choice but to run for senator or president.
You made it to the Senate, but you soon set off for the Castle.
Won't that backs be on the people who elected you?
I've been saying all along that I'm going to fight for the Castle in the Senate election, depending on the outcome of the Senate election.
I later clarified that if I was elected senator, I would run for president.
But my goal is not function, the function is a tool for how I can make my visions happen.
That is why I need as much influence as possible and the strongest possible mandate.
But the trouble is not only that, as a nation, we swear at the pub and in front of the TV, but trampling on anyone who wants to try to make a change.
This will be joined by the media, which defame a person and who confuse freedom of speech with the freedom to lie.
For example, I was claimed to be bribing journalists or that I was an adviser to Jiří Paroubek.
Let's go to your visions.
You went into battle for the Castle with the thesis of the material and criminal liability of politicians and retrospective asset declarations of over twenty million.
To do that, you have to change the law.
As president, however, you do not have that authority, and only the Senate as a whole can draft laws.
How do you plan to solve this?
When I lobbied as a citizen to make guides a free business, it was passed.
The problem is politicking - when someone comes up with a good proposal from the left or from the right, it is deliberately rejected, and it delays the citizens.
As an independent outsider, I have much more potential to receive support from all the parliamentary parties.
My preference is that without party-swinging and dogma, I can take something that is best for our country, from each side, and apply it.
Do you think of yourself as a right-wing or a left-wing person?
From the Czech point of view, it seems to me that people rank me more to the left.
It's not important to me at all, whether a little left or a little right.
It's important for me to go forward.
I don't care whether someone belongs to the left or the right, but I want to bring people together.
I will always support any public-spirit solution, even if proposed by the KSČM or ODS, and I will also be against the wrong idea.
You're the devil when someone says you're a populist.
But don't you prove it with what you said?
When you're a business plan at a company, you also have some ideal goal and vision.
And you're trying to get close to that.
Some may call it populism, but all the suggestions I'm talking about already work in the world, or were spoken of by prominent experts.
But without the support of parliament, all you have left is the slogans.
And with that, you don't get by in politics in the long run.
Or do you think that if you go to people and talk to them, that you will succeed in for example to enforce criminal and material liability?
I have no choice.
Convincing politicians, journalists and the public and try to get them on our side to get it through.
If I were elected president, there is no problem to hold a televised live broadcast, where I will ask the presidents of the parliamentary parties to enact material and criminal liability for politicians, civil servants, judges and prosecutors.
And they would eventually have to say why they didn't want it.
If there is a strong figure who names the misforthes, one can push the political scene.
Take the direct election of the president, it was a credit to public pressure.
Frankly, I'm an amateur, that I'm neither a genius nor an intellectual.
For my opinions and visions, I try to find allies.
I have only just started in politics and I will try to win majority support for my agenda.
I try to move things by myself, if I can't, I'll quit in six years and go back to the private sector.
It sounds a bit like Okamura is going to save the Czech Republic.
I'm not a savior.
I know I'm not going to do anything in one person, so I've been circled by a number of well-known people to see if they'd run for the Senate, too.
I went to see Radim Jančura, who refused because of the amount of work.
So I at least supported the investigative journalist Jana Lorencová, who uncovering the scams of light fuel oils.
I ran, saying people were really unhappy, but now I'm on the fence.
Sixty percent of people didn't vote, and those who went mostly elected establishment leaders.
We're only two independents in the Senate.
People have called the Senate in such a way that changes will be difficult to enforce.
Nevertheless, I will fight for my visions, such as the direct election of mayors or governors.
Are you considering starting your own party?
I haven't even considered that because I don't have time to check out every potential party member's clean past, and I don't even have the money to do that.
I don't even have the money for the presidential campaign, there's only 20 grand in my transparent account.
No money?
You're talking about asset disclosures, what's yours?
I estimate private property to be about 60 million.
In Prague I have a plot of land for about 25 million, an apartment for ten million, another apartment for eight million, a collection of works of art for about ten million, Aston Martin for 3.5 million and a one-million-dollar Skoda Superb, and then I have a few million in my account.
By the way, I have an Aston Martin because it was my boyhood dream - I've always liked James Bond, who rode in the car, was gallant with women and at the same time fought against wrongdoing and mischief.
You drive an Aston Martin, you have a $60 million fortune, and you don't have campaign money?
You say you want to change the republic, but you don't want to put your own money into it.
That's not very convincing.
I don't have 15 million for the campaign.
Is that supposed to go into debt?
I've already hit the campaign for 2.5 million.
The fact that I don't have any sponsors is indicative of the fact that I don't think there's much interest in my program.
And I'm not obliged to pay the campaign out of my own pocket.
The campaign costs will basically be covered by the kind of senator's salary I'll be.
But I wouldn't buy from it, for example, I wouldn't be able to pay my son an English school that costs 30 grand a month.
If I just wanted to make money, I'd not run for office.
So you're going to keep in business so you can live?
Didn't you say you would dampen these activities?
But it's not related to the salary.
As I promised, I partially dampened my activities.
For example, my deputy will become the manager of a travel agency in the spring.
People would like me to be a Samaritan to be the Republic.
But I need to live on something, too.
How much was used to taking monthly as an entrepreneur?
Two to 400,000, which I'll take further.
And if I were president, I would have quit my business.
The full interview can be found in Saturday's edition of Law.
The architects of the MVRDV are proof that real adventures are not just played in the head - for example, by Spijkenisse and the recently built Mountain of the Books - 2 pictures
"The building feels cheerful, it looks futuristic. Finally, there is something interesting to see again," says Lisette Verhaig, who walks along the side of the road.
Stefan Spermon, an IT technician in a nearby big business, says, "Of course, the house is nice."
But I ask what we need a library for today.
They all have internet, iPads and e-books.
None of these old-style libraries are now volunteered to attend, do they?
Spijkenisse, a housing estate in close proximity to Rotterdam without their own job opportunities, which are not worth a visit, hold a special record.
This municipality of 80,000 inhabitants exhibits the lowest level of education in the whole of the Netherlands.
To resolve this stupid situation, a few years ago, a decision was made to contribute to general education and build seven nicely painted reinforced concrete miniatures of the fictitious bridges that are depicted on euro banknotes.
But the success of the educational offensive was not staggering.
And so the city councillors recognized that there was only one way to become the masters of the statistics: we must have a library!
Winy Maas of the Rotterdam architectural studio MVRDV, a master of insanely daring bar charts and a contractor of funny, often even cynical, buildings, took the matter with the usual calm, and at a competition meeting in 2003, he appeared with five books under his arm and a grin on his face.
And while the commission looked around in amazement and shrugged, the insolent Maas piled his gifts to his size, and ended his activist-justified speech by the words "The City of City Mile!"
So this is my proposal for the Mountain of Books in Spijkenisse, the so-called Boekenberg!
Nine years later, the €30 million mountain was piled up.
It is part of the revitalization project, which also includes underground parking, supermarket, post office and several adjoining residential and terraced houses with a total of 50 flats.
In early November, the Mountain of the Books was awarded the second place in the "Best Library of NL 2012".
In addition, the project is nominated for the 2012 Dutch National Wood Award.
The small-town grayness, which has so far been unable to offer more than a postmodern pedestrian zone and an unusually ugly town hall behind whose white facade you would rather expect a dairy, is richer by a slightly contemporary architecture.
Above all, however, Spijkenisse now has the first public cultural building in the history of its existence.
The Long Journey to the Book
First impression: reader's Eldorado under the cheese hatch.
The middle of the mountain massif is run by the lift, but you will discover real spatial and reader passions only when climbing the topography on foot.
The glass-encated interior is bright and clear on all sides, the ailed cabinet floor and elegant street lanterns clearly expressing the atmosphere of the public square.
The urban environment is perfect.
You see park benches, a dog and boys and girls who play football.
And books, books, books everywhere.
"Normally there are shelves with books along the facade and in the middle there is a large dark space that is mostly unenmatable and impersonal," says Winy Maas.
We built the classic spatial configuration upside down and we put the space for the reader out from the inside.
The interior of the Mountain of the Books is skilfully used: on Wednesday there are offices, an online library, a chess club, an ecological centre and a home-techon.
A special delight are the black shelves of books, which are one wall-craying, one sill of the windowsill and at other times with the railing of the stairs.
The appearance, structure and smell are alien.
Over the unknown building material, even the swipple architects and civil engineers are twisting their heads.
"We wanted to work with recycled materials here," says Joop Trouborst, head of the project at the city's Spijkenisse municipality, when asked by Standard.
And so, in a frish farm, we came across a suitable agricultural waste product in a day.
For many years, in greenhouses and fields in the Netherlands, a millimeter fleece of synthetic matter has been used as a basis under the roots.
It is cheap and time-efficient.
The thin textiles last one, two seasons and then be ripe for being thrown into bulky waste.
For the library, the fleece - for the first time in such quantities - was pressed to boobs of a thickness of four centimetres.
By acting in the heat and pressure, the so-called Landbouwplastic (KLP) will be coloured in a dark, homogeneous and loaded material that smells a bit like a new car and a bit like a sporty shoes.
The 105 steps take you to the top.
At the end of the nearly 500-meter-long journey, you will be rewarded in the literary café not only by a fantastic view of the city, but also by Dutch croquettes and ficus in pots.
These take care of the atmosphere, but mainly the right humidity of the air in the literature's burns.
Grears for the new soul
"You probably wouldn't believe it, but this house is a showcase project in terms of ecology, despite many glass surfaces," says Trouborst.
It heats and cools with the Earth's heat.
Although the Mountain of the Books stands under the glass cover, the sun shines in only a short time, even on sunny days.
The wide glued wooden trusses, which stand perpendicular to the glazed facade, serve as shading and capture a large part of the sun's radiation.
The climate in the room is very pleasant.
The rest will be handled by fully automatic shutters.
Stefan Spermon, the initial skeptical of the IT business, has already visited the new library.
Lisette Verhaig was already there.
And also the teacher of traditional Chinese medicine, Cynthia Bogarde, who even describes Boekenberg as the "a re-awaited soul" of Spijkenisse.
The reason: each city dweller was invited to the opening a few weeks ago to donor a book from his personal fund.
It was intended to first fill the optical gaps in the still-unrefas-equipped library, which currently holds 70,000 pieces.
The concept worked.
The shelves are completely filled.
"There is nothing worse than a half-empty library," says architect Winy Maas.
"I think that, thanks to our invitation, every resident now has a particular relationship with the new house.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
Even if it's just for decoration.
This was the MVRDV in the royal discipline, which is called the creation of identity in the professional jargon.
Spijkenisse wrote the history of literature.
Be that as young and uneducated.
This is ultimately the starting point for identity.
Szabo: 'Germans must play a bigger role'
Germany abstained from voting in deciding to accept Palestine.
According to US-Europe-Europe expert Stephen Szabo, Berlin is teetering on the narrow edge of diplomacy.
Deutsche Welle: Germany first signalled earlier in the week that it would vote against the proposal for an observer status of Palestinians in the United Nations.
But then Berlin abstained.
What're?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelis did in Gaza.
Now, of course, Germany must be cautious because of its special relationship with Israel.
But at the same time, I don't think he's going to support the American position either.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence - without being too critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained when it came to establishing a no-fly zone.
This was eventually pushed through.
Is it difficult for Germany to take a clear position on major international issues?
Yes, it is.
The reason for this is that it is changing its foreign policy, away from a policy that was so-called US-run, towards German foreign policy.
The situation is all the more difficult because Europeans do not have a coherent and unified policy.
So the Germans are between two fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I think they are just settling in for their role, but they are on the road to a more "normal" foreign policy.
Foreign policy as they have in France or the UK.
What exactly does a "normal" foreign policy mean from a German point of view?
It shows readiness to take on national interests as well as positions that are independent of the positions of the US or European partners.
I think that German foreign policy is motivated by economic policy, i.e. by export and its relations with certain areas, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany's economic interests are, to some extent, different from the economic interests of other powers, and therefore Germany must protect its interests.
Have economic interests affected the attitude in the Middle East conflict and the vote in the UN?
First, Germany has large outlets in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf states.
It must therefore be cautious that it does not scare the public, but also the elites in the Arab countries.
That's a factor.
But I wouldn't want to as much as I attribute too much importance to it, it's not a completely one-sided relationship.
In any case, this plays a significant role in the German deliberations.
Has Germany's relations with the US been damaged when Germany abstained from voting in the case of both important decisions, such as the vote on Palestine?
I think there is a great understanding of the German position in Europe and even in the US.
That is why I do not think it was as dramatic a turning point as Libya.
Perhaps Germany will even earn some respect.
This signals that it must be regarded as an international player and his interests must be taken into account.
There are different views on the Palestinian initiative in Europe.
The US, by contrast, was clearly in favour of a veto.
Are there differences of opinion between the US and many European nations?
These differences have always existed as a result of American internal politics.
I think the Obama administration is probably in secret to a very good understanding of the European position.
But, as a result of the political situation there, he cannot, of course, take this position publicly.
I don't think the differences of opinion really are at all as big as they always seem.
If you look at the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, Obama is not at all very enthusiastic about Netanyahu's policies.
Isn't it difficult for Germany to reconcile its close relations with Israel and the US, on the one hand, and with the position of the most important partners in the EU on the other?
I think this is exactly what makes it difficult for the Germans.
Of course, it would be a little easier for the Germans if there were a coherent and unified European policy, which is not the case at the moment.
So they cannot be part of the wider line and must instead drive things forward from their own position.
That's what they do with the euro.
I believe that Germany will take the lead in the future and push Europe towards a European position.
This is not easy for Germany, of course, because of its relationship with Israel.
That was always a sensitive subject.
But I think it is clear to the Germans that they must play a more independent role.
Does Germany see itself as an important international player? Does he want to take on the main role?
Or is the leadership role still difficult for Germany?
Germany is still unaccustomed to this, it is still unpleasant, and for this country it is still difficult to play a bigger role for this country.
For example, when we look at the European crisis, every time Germany accepts a bigger role, anti-German sentiment arises.
That doesn't make it easy for the Germans.
It's actually an old problem: we don't want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
From this point of view, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the US.
It has to be acceptable to all sorts of neighbours and opinions, and that's not easy.
The influence of the US in European politics is now steadily decreasing, but the EU does not currently fill out this vacuum.
The Germans will just have to play a bigger role.
Even if they don't like it, they're uncomfortable and they'll make them even more unpopular - c'est la vie!

"Protection of brands" in China: when Puma and Armani are suddenly Chinese
Armani is a world-famous brand, the Polo Ralph Lauren as well.
But what is the Armani Polo?
Behind this lies a label that is officially registered in China, but has nothing to do with the original firm.
However, it enjoys protection until they are experienced by the brand's real owners.
Nor is it then clear whether they will get the rights.
"It is increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their brands in China," says Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer at the office of Taylor Wessing, which specializes in violations of protection rights violations in the Far East.
A new case lands on my desk every week.
Counterfeiters only need a few extra letters to sign up their brands.
The Gucci brand, for example, becomes Lu-Gucci and registers Prada-Kny instead of Prada.
In this way, German companies, such as the manufacturer of sportswear Puma, are also legally copied.
Pattloch opens a binder with stamp office records in Beijing.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company had a trade brand protected by the Zegna DF Puma. An artificial name that also parasites the Ermenegildo Zegna fashion house.
It is known that the Chinese are world champions in copying and intellectual property violations.
There are multi-story department stores in the big cities in which counterfeits are sold almost exclusively.
But the Pattloch cases are different. On the commission of their mandates, it is moving against Chinese companies officially receiving from the trademote the right to use the designation that is already sheltered elsewhere from the Stamps Office.
The Chinese call it "Bang Mingpai," the associated brand.
This word focuses on "Bang Dakuan."
This means women who hunt rich men.
The Chinese authorities are unaware of any guilt.
"It's the business, we have to fight it," Pattloch says.
"The brand is diluted, the exclusive position disappears, the image damage is enormous."
The financial losses and court costs of the affected industry run into the millions, especially for expensive sample products.
According to data from market research company CLSA, China, with a volume of €15 billion, is the third largest market for luxury goods and a market that is growing fastest.
However, the deletion of dubious records in the register of brands is difficult to achieve and it is at a cost.
The proceedings can stretch to nine years, with an uncertain outcome.
Pattloch tells of cases in which the court dismissed the lawsuits because the title was made after the long term "market reality."
When the plaintiff is unlucky, he has to pay the plagiarist because he has damaged his brand in China, says Pattloch.
Sometimes there's the law of the jungle.
The well-known cases also concern graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler lost a legal case against the manufacturer of construction machinery Sany, a company that recently took over the German maker of the concrete-micable Putzmeister pumps.
The Chinese are therefore still allowed to use an emblem that resembles the Mercedes star.
Geely, which bought the Volvo, originally used a blue-and-white logo that resembled a BMW. The dispute was settled, Geely had to change the logo.
Fashion product manufacturer Lacoste lost in China to forgeries from Hong Kong and Singapore, who turned the well-known crocodile in the opposite direction.
The Chinese authorities are unaware of any guilt.
The CTMO grades admit that there were deficiencies there in 2010 because of too few staff and premises.
But last year, the course of the workforce reportedly returned to normal from an emergency situation.
For example, the number of unprocessed SO proceedings fell by 22 percent.
57,000 of these cases were closed, up 75 percent from the previous year.
Nevertheless, there are still 81,500 complaints pending at the office.
Something to do against it is expensive
As is often the case in China, they are the impressive numbers.
Last year, the CTMO received more than 1.4 million brand protection applications, almost a third more than 2010.
This is a record and it means that China is leading the list of new applications worldwide for the 10th consecutive year.
This also applies to the number of all valid trademarks - a total of 5.5 million.
In 2011, 1.8 billion yuan were collected in fees.
In simple terms, this means that each sign-in costs on average €1280, yuan or €16.
The dispute is worth several times the case against it, as the case of the German family business Freudenberg shows.
This concern has been fighting the Chinese plagiarist for more than seven years.
The Germans did achieve the cancellation of its illegal production of imitated car parts.
However, the counterfeiter has secured Chinese rights to the Freudenberg brand.
We would negle itself, as the surnames cannot be protected in Germany, says Hanno Wentzler, chairman of the management of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The CTMO stamp office then also rejected the Munich firm's objection.
In the other two instances, while Freudenberg obtained the rights, the opponent continues to fight the dispute to this day.
You need to be very careful
The matter is now being heard in the Supreme Court.
Wentzler has the confidence that he will bring the matter to a good end and praise the professionalism of the courts.
But he also says, "The proceedings are extremely expensive and costing us a lot of time, money and nerves."
The internal costs cannot be quantified. In the company's archives, they even had to inspect the hundred-year-old files to provide evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg offered the opposing party in vain a "high six-seig sum in euros" to settle the dispute.
"That's how you see what this means to us," Wentzler says.
There is a risk that the danger from the Far East will also hit Europe.
And that's when the imitators there secure unprotected brands.
For example, one Chinese manufacturer wanted to sign up the Freudenberg for footwear and leather in Germany.
The group gave up this business area a long time ago, yet it was able to avert registration.
"You need to be very careful," Wentzler says.
He and the lawyer, Pattloch, advise German businesses to be very careful when trading with China.
It is not enough to rely on international trademote rights. Foreigners would rather have "everything that is in any way worth protecting, to apply in China," says Wentzler.
Otherwise, it could be much more expensive than registration.
Indeed: if Freudenberg succumbs to the brand's drama in the last act of its brand drama, then it will probably have to pay the opposing party's royalties for its own name, explains Wentzler.
Or we'll be pressured from the market in the disputed segment.
World AIDS Day: stomping, singing, helping
At Heidelberg, the Imbongi chorus is being tested - and in the Svazijsk, orphans are happy about it for their parents who died of AIDS.
The story of the connection, which surpasses much more than 8733 kilometres.
First there's the stamping: cowboy boots, basketball shoes, women's pumps, and men's loafers are looking for tact on the dance floor and find it quickly.
One-two-three-tone-tour.
Then the voices of the singers - the alto, bass, tenor and soprano - insist, and chase each other up.
29-year-old conductor Frete Hopf is almost raised from his textile shoes as he connects the voices with his suppleer wild gestures.
It's Monday night. At the Music Hall of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg, the Imbongi Choir is rehearsing a new song.
There were fifty singers and singers between the ages of 23 and 69, from a researcher of human genetics to a janitor.
"Om'Obani" is not an easy composition, each chorus voice has a different text and, more on top of that, a very foreign language - a zulu spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesoth, Malawi, Mozambique and parts of the Svazijsk.
Helping to self aid
Unaids, the United Nations AIDS Fighting Program, estimates that there are some 34 million people worldwide who are infected with HIV.
Of this, 23.5 million are in the south of Africa.
There are 245,000 orphans in the Svazijsk after their parents who died of AIDS.
HIV-positive is already more than 40 percent of the population.
For the 180 orphans of their parents who died of AIDS, in the village of Esitjeni, the association Voices for Africa found patrons in Germany.
70 of them attend a second-grade school.
For €15 or €20 a month, patronage can be taken over.
It guarates a child's tuition, a school uniform and one hot meal a day in the Gogo-centre.
Imbongi means "story-to-dog" in the zulu language, or "the one who ples out."
In gaseous bantu, no one can speak in this space, just sing.
He has been rehearsing the songs chorus in this foreign soft language for almost a decade, and occasionally also brings them back to where they originally come from: to the south of Africa.
At an aerial distance of 8,733 kilometres from Heidelberg, in the northeast of the Kingdom of the Union, is the village of Esitjeni, which is dependent on the bulk of the German congregation's voices.
Forty percent are infected
There are roughly 2,000 people living there, some still in plain clay or straw hut. A large proportion of them are children.
More than 300 of them no longer have parents, as they have succumbed to the HIV virus.
In Esitjen, you can see in a small way, the whole of the World Slander, the Someter, HIV in Insecvia: the highest life expectancy in the world, according to UNICEF.
The circumcision of the male forecorpion, which has been shown to halve the risk of the disease, does not accept the population.
More than forty percent of people in the Svazijsko carry the weakened immunity virus in themselves. It is no rarity that they die at less than 30 years.
This village was discovered by the congregation on a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005. Above all, however, the members of Imbongi saw many children on the streets who lacked not only parental care, but everything: food, clothing, education.
Without completed school education, they no longer stand a chance in a poor country.
At first, it was still a private deployment of individuals who, for a few euros a year, allowed the child to be sent to school and given him one hot meal a day.
However, a year later, a chorus of the "Voices for Africa" association was established, taking care of orphans from their parents who died of AIDS, almost professionally.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
Which are the most serious sexually transmitted diseases?
The bacterial SPI is due to syphilis, chlamydia and gonorl (gonorea).
Common viral SPI are HIV, human papilomaviruses, herpes genitalis or hepatitis.
Mukes and scabies belong to the parasitic SPI.
Who belongs to the group of the most affected?
Syphilis and gonorencise occur primarily in men who have sex with men.
The Robert Koch Institute assumes that at least four of all the syphilis cases reported in Germany are transmitted by sexual contacts between men.
In heterosexual adults, sexually transmitted diseases occur commonly are those of chlamydia infections, trichomonades, candleg's, and human papillomavi.
HIV is prevalent among heterosexual adults in the country, but about 20 percent of people newly infected with HIV are on this group.
Among adolescents, chlamydia infections occur significantly more frequently than in other population groups.
According to European surveys, three-quarters of all infections involve young people between the age of 15 to 25.
In addition, in our country, human papillomavi are often found among the teens.
How did the number of infections develop?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases must be reported.
The number of infected with syphilis, according to the Robert Koch Institute, the number of infected with more than doubled from 1697 in 2001 to 3698 diseases in 2011.
The number of people with new HIV infected has been decreasing since 2007.
In 2011, there were about 2700 cases.
That's about one-tenth less than the year before.
What symptoms do they draw to the venereal disease?
Infectious diseases can cause ulcers in the genital area, difficulty in urination, discharge, lower abdominal pain as well as blisters or warts.
However, they often do not cause any pain or other symptoms and will therefore remain unenreveed.
How can you protect yourself?
Dangers of the disease can be reduced by condoms, but do not offer 100% protection.
For the agents of sexually transmitted diseases can be partially passed on by impurity infection and narrow physical contact.
That is why experts recommend, especially in the case of frequent alternation of sexual partners, regular examinations.
In the case of early diagnosis, it is possible to cure most of the SPI and prevent later consequences.
Thanks to the patronage, charitable donations and, last but not least, the royalties the glee club makes singing all over Germany, some money is collected.
"In total, we have already sent around 200,000 euros to Esitjen," says the association's chairwoman, Annette Lennartz.
The money from Germany is managed in the village of Zodwa Dlamini itself, a confident woman who can assert herself.
It also takes care of orphaned children finding shelter, such as some of the grandmothers.
Gogo, as the zulu language is called old women, are a supportive of the village.
Some of them have taken in 14 orphans, have given them a roof over their heads and make sure the children come to school on time in uniform every day.
Children who no longer have anyone go to the shelter to Khanyisile, a lonely woman who is paid by the club as well as two cooks that cook for more than 200 hungry children a day.
In addition, "Voices for Africa" set up a sewing school, built two chicken coops, and, together with the American health organization, PSI, arranged for many people in the village to have an HIV test taken.
This is not a given. Although the disease is so obvious throughout the country, everyone is silent about it.
King with 14 wives
"AIDS is absolutely taboo," says Annette Lennartz, "because he's dealing with sexuality."
In fact, rather strange in a country where the king officially keeps 14 wives.
The last in-both monarch of black Africa, King Mswati III, is known as his unpleasant lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
This state-sanctioned way of life is also to blame, among other things, for the HIV virus to spread so rapidly in past decades.
But so are the many migrant workers who spread the virus around the country.
Annette Lennartz says that while condoms are free on every corner, "but no one uses them.
Culture is different - unprotected intercourse.'
To at least a little support for the cultural exchange, the Imbongi choir travels once every two years, together in the south of Africa, and sings songs full of grief, belligeness, confidence in the future and self-confidence of the blacks, which many in the southern tip of the black continent still know from the apartheid era.
A bus full of white people singing songs in the language of blacks - such an award brings not only the mood and joy, but has also already shed tears for many wild border soldiers.
The road always leads to Esitjen, where the singers visit the children over whom they have a patronage.
Although this village is hard to find on the maps, it is more than known in the Ezulweni River valley.
"Go to Esitjen, there's light," the people say.
And when you go back to Heidelberg, which is from here as the crow flies 8733 kilometres, to the stomping singers in the rehearsal room at Bergheimer Straße, you see that the light is shining here, too.
Messenger: NASA discovers ice on Mercury
The Messenger probe found evidence that there was ice on the planet Mercury.
The ice sheet could be as thick as 20 metres.
The U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has demonstrated the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although it is closest to the Sun, there is also frozen water, according to three studies published by the expert magazine "Science" on Thursday.
The Messenger probe has found evidence for the fact that there is an ice sheet in the area of this planet, which lies in a permanent shadow.
This is reportedly at least 30 centimetres and possibly even up to 20 metres thick.
This water appears to have come from the comets, or perhaps even the asteroids that crashed into Mercury.
But let's not link the discovery of ice to the existence of life on this planet, said the head of the scientists working on the Messenger probe, Sean Solomon.
The temperature in Mercury can reach as much as 426 degrees Celsius.
But the findings could help us explain how water and other basic elements of life have reached other regions of the solar system.
Probes, telescopes and small robots such as Phoenix, unobserved by Earthlings, take part in exploring the depths of space.

One of the largest and most sharp images of the Hubble telescope: the vortex galaxy
The films in the spiral galaxies become the real works of art, according to their colour.
The shot, released by the European Southern Observatory, depicts several thousand light-light-leaning Trifid nebula in the constellation of the Sagittarius.
The name Trifid comes from the Latin word "trifidus" (digbecled into three parts, triplicate), as the dark strips of dust divide the glowing heart of this stellar maternity hospital into three parts.
In the constellation of Hadonosh, astronomers photographed the pre-star of cosmic colreleases: 400 million light-years from Earth, the nuclei of two merging galaxies, and there must inevitably be a collision.

Anyone who doesn't like technical shortcuts can call it the nickname South Windrinder.
A photograph from the Hubble Space Telescope shows the Iris nebula cutout in the constellation of Ceffe.
This 1400 light-year-old fog is made up of dust-grincloth, which is ten to a hundred times smaller than the usual domestic dust.
This image was compiled from optical and X-rays of various telescopes.
It depicts a ring of black holes that is 430 million light-years from Earth.
This group of galaxies, called Arp 273, was recorded by the Hubble Space Telescope for NASA.
This larger spiral galaxy is called UGC by scientists in the 1810.
In this stellar nebula there is the brightest group of young stars of our Milky Way.
The cradle of stars gives rise to ever new additions.
Also, these stellar clouds, coupled with the Rosette nebula, are still born new young stars. They are 5,000 light-years from Earth.
In this brightly glowing galaxy with a small black hole, there is no dust, but only gas.
Scientists believe it was only created shortly after the Big Bang when it was mostly hydrogen throughout the universe.
Our Views of Space: the most important telescopes
The telescope was reportedly invented by Hans Lipperhey in 1608. Even before Galileo, Galileo, he used it to observe the stars a year later.
Since then, the mirrors of the optical telescopes have grown ever larger - and the views they convey are getting deeper and deeper.
It was the world's largest telescope for 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, the Hale Telescope at the Palomar Observatory near San Diego.
The mirror in this picture was five meters in diameter.
In the American Arizona stands the Large Binocular Telescope.
It allows a glimpse into space through two mirrors, each of which has a diameter of 8.4 metres.
The interior of the Gran Telescopio Canarias on one of the Canary Islands - La Palma is huge. Only the mirror measures 10.4 metres in diameter.
The Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented to save costs.
Yet its diameter is roughly eleven metres.
Inadvantage of the inexpensive of the inexpensive method of construction: the telescope is provided by a hook at a height angle, thus limiting its mobility.
The height angle is also fixated by the Hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas.
Its peculiar feature is the high amplification of the luminous flux.
This, despite the relatively small diameter of the mirror, is equal to the world's largest mirror telescopes.
Using a radio telescope in Arecibo (Portoriko), scientists in the universe are searching for extraterrestrial signals.
This radio telescope has a diameter of 305 metres.
With the "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI) - looking for an alien intelligence - any computer owner who makes his computing power available can help.
A view of the observation tower of the European Southern Observatory (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
It says the Very Large Telescope - and does honor to his name.
This telescope with a total of four mirrors can shine through the medium infrared spectrum.
The European extremely large telescope is also planned at the ESO Chile Observatory.
Its main mirror is to be full 42 metres and is to be composed of almost 1000 mirror elements.
But the images can be expected in 2018 at the earliest.
The two Keck telescopes on the Hawaiian Mauna Kea volcano were considered the largest in the world until 2007.
They offer two mirrors, each with a diameter of ten metres.
Keck's telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which, in addition to them, peers into space with the Subaru and IRTTF telescopes.
Also on Mauna Kea, a new giant telescope is to be created - with a 30-meter mirror diameter.
Here you can admire it in the picture.
But the most significant impressions of space are conveyed to us by the Hubble Space Telescope.
Footage of distant worlds has been provided to us since April 24, 1990.
The Kepler space telescope has been searching for extrasolar planets since March 2009 - especially those that are habitable.
On February 2, 2011, NASA announced that 1235 candidate planets had been detected since the start of the mission.
The image is documented with the last preparations before the launch of the Kepler space telescope.
The James Webb (JWST) space telescope will be launched into space on board the Ariane5 rocket as early as 2018.
The primary mirror of the space infrared telescope is 6.5 metres in diameter.
One of the telescopic tasks is to find the light of the first stars and galaxies after the Big Bang.
Scientists are based on the fact that there is ice at the southern pole of Mercury.
For this, however, there are no reliable data, as Messenger circles around this planet far closer to the North Pole.
The radar measurement had been showing for decades that there was ice on Mercury.
Thanks to the Messenger probe, which was launched in 2004 and is the first to orbit Mercury, scientists are now assured.
Drink butter a day and you'll live to be 168
In southern Azerbaijan, many people will live to be of a biblical age.

In southern Azerbaijan, many people will live to be of a biblical age.
There's even a longevity museum.
Finding tracks in a country where the 97-year-old people are still relatively young.
Riding the Mountains of Talyš can be called wildly romantic.
The minibus rumbllases along the road with many bendings along the densely forested hills, the predatory rivers and the plain farm buildings.
Everything is green and juicy, it almost seems like we're in the Schwarzwald.
However, this is the furthest south of Azerbaijan. The banque with Iran is only a few kilometres away.
Here lives the Caucasian ethnic group of Talysh, of which little is known, apart from the fact that he speaks Perk perfectly Persian and Azerbaijani and is living a very old age.
The final station is Lerik.
This town is boasted by an overly monumental architecture from Soviet times, which is somehow not fit for the picturesque mountain landscape.
Tourists from Europe are not coming here. Arrival from the Azerbaijani capital, Baku, is too difficult.
It takes eight hours for 323 kilometres because the road is only one-lane.
The fairy-tale riches that the land owed to by the oil in the Caspian Sea has not yet arrived in the country.
However, Pilata Fatulayev (48) is convinced that Lerik has the right to become a tourist attraction.
"Baku was made famous by the Eurovision Grand Prix in May - and we will have a festival of the oldest people in the world here next year," says Fatulajeva.
She's the director of the longevity museum, about the only one in the world.
Here, the lives of nearly eight dozen Talyšs from the surrounding area, who are over the age of a hundred, are documented. Fatulajeva is shown in black and white photo.
That's my grandfather, he was 120 years old.
At the age of 136, he still produced a child.
The disputed star of this museum, however, is the sheep shepherd Şirali Müslümov, who is believed to be 168 years old.
However, there is no birth certificate.
And given that the oldest person with papers was 122 years old, Müslümov's age seems extremely dubious.
"He was born in this area in 1805 and died in 1973," Fatulalayva explains.
This man was reportedly married three times and had 23 children. At the age of 136, he is said to have fathered a daughter.
So did Şirali Müslümov at his age be wrong by a few decades?
But the aged people in Central Asia was also heard by Rembrandt Scholz, the gerontologist at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock.
"Callistically, many people of old age live in some areas of China, in Japan or the Hunza Valley in Pakistan," says Scholz, "also in Sardinia, there are extremely many very old men."
However, due to the lack of documents, no scientific evidence of age can be given, especially when the registries are missing.
Every day a glass of melted butter
But the fact is that the people of the Lerik area live conspicuously to the biblical age conspicuously.
There are currently 20 people who are over the age of 100.
So why do so many aged people live here in the south?
The Azerbaijani guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains this with the special Talyš genes.
The director of the Fatulyev Museum, on the other hand, believes it is about nutrition.
However, the fact that the calorie diet of the Talysts, who love meat, bread and, above all, dairy products, and many of whom drink a glass of melted butter on a daily basis, is so healthy, is not exactly plausible from a bromatological point of view.
Or is it the original way of life that keeps the people young? In Cengemiran, a tiny settlement near the town of Lerik, is occupied by Rubaba Mirzajeva.
At 97, she is still relatively young at this latitude.
Mirzajeva, who claims to have 143 children, lives in a simple wooden house that is typical of the entire Caucasus region.
He sits on the ground with a butterscouphea that he wrench relentlessly.
There are eight people living under the roof under one roof, including one of Mirzajeva's sons and a daughter. Both are grandparents long ago.
There are also two young children bouncing around.
The kitchen is made for guests with tea, which is served in the typical "armadu" bellies.
Mirzajeva's white teeth form the perfect line, and beneath the scarf shears a long, dark blond brase that her son proudly reveals from us.
I always washed my hair with milk, so it didn't look like it and kept the color.
"I've never used shampoo either," Mirzajeva says.
Monthly retirement to live is enough
She ate only what came from her own court, tomatoes, potatoes, peas.
In all my life, I've never bought groceries at the supermarket for the last time.
Then he tells me about his husband, who was in the army.
The worst was in World War II.
But everything got better when the oar was taken over by the "beloved father" Gejdar Aliyev.
Propaganda sounds strange from an old woman's mouth.
But the cult that is made around the figure of the father of the nations who ruled his country as a dictator knows no bounds in Azerbaijan.
He was in power until 2003, then his son Ilham took over the oar.
At least, the old people in Azerbaijan are not in need.
Mirzajeva receives a monthly pension of 230 manat (approximately the same amount in euros). This is an amount of money for the local circumstances to live on.
And perhaps the long-reasoned son of Mirzajeva is right: "Okens of the age of us enjoy great respectability in our culture."
They live in the middle of a big family, they are loved, covered and happy.
If it's no reason to stay alive as long as possible
The term 'human rights' is absent from the constitution
The revolution returned to Cairo.
The disreincements of the demonstrations in Cairo revealed the country's deep ambivalence.
It is strongly debated about a future constitution based on Sharia law.
The Egyptian president spared no pathos.
We have to create a transition.
"And for us to succeed, I am responsible, to the people and to God," he said on state television.
His speech was for the entire nation, but primarily to the Christian Copts, the Liberals, the enlightened Muslims and the secular persons.
For all of them, still hopelessly quarrelling in the bewildered opposition, are afraid.
Fear of the "God's state" on the Nile at the mercy of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood.
Mohammed Morsi said, almost apologetically, that he had temporarily restricted the competences of the Constitutional Court and expanded his own to "save the revolution."
But what the 61-year-old engineer, who holds the title of doctor doctor at the U.S. University of Southern California, wants to do, is not clear about the Egyptians or the world.
Should the judiciary be stripped of power?
The 234 sections, hastily approved by the Islamist-dominated Constitutional Assembly in a 15-hour night marathon, are partly aroused by concern.
As in earlier constitutions, it is said in this proposal that the jurisdiction is based on the "cisels of Islamic law."
But what does "the principles" mean?
This was and is a matter of interpretation, and it is to be feated that the Islamists will use this vague formulation and the associated legal free space for a stricter interpretation of sharia.
At the very least, this illuminates the newly added section: In all Sharia matters, it is necessary to consult the University of al-Azhar, which is the most important Islamic institution in the country with great influence over the whole of Sunni Islam.
That may not be the case, but it may mean that the klérus will supervise the legislation, which would effectively result in the judiciary's withdrawal of his or her right.
There are many things to interpret in the draft constitution
The problem is also that the civil jurisdiction of the military courts is to be maintained.
These courts served under Mubarak's government to suppress the opposition.
After the fall of the dictatorship, up to 11,000 civilians were in military detention.
As the proposal states, the state should also protect "the right nature of the Egyptian family and promote its morality and values."
This is legally formulated in such an inaccurate way that, by this section, state institutions could even control the content of the arts and literature.
In intelligible speech, this means nothing more than censorship.
Indeed, no section in writing is defined by explicit equality for men and women.
But another paragraph prohibits the defamation or slander of the Prophet Muhammad and his envoy.
What remains unclear, however, is what is vorit and how it will be prosecuted.
It is equally dubious to the wording that "the insult to people" is forbidden.
In this case, is a cartoon of the president or a joke at the expense of law experts?
The matter of interpretation, as much more in this proposal, which Morsi will present for signature and, in his words, will be presented "very soon" to the Egyptians for the purpose of the popular vote.
"The revolution has returned"
For several weeks, the opposition has been forming against the odds of the Islamists.
Tens of thousands of people, in an unusual note, gathered in Tahrir Square in Cairo on Friday evening and promised to destroy the constitutional charter before it becomes effective.
"The revolution has returned and we will win," said Hamdín Sabbahi, who came in third place in the presidential election.
Nobel laureate and former director-general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed Baradej, said the draft constitution was "on the dustbin of history."
Through a short-lived news service, Twitter accused the supporter Morsi of seeking to "craw against democracy."
"If he announces a referendum, we will go to his palace and overthrow him," said opposition figure member Yasser Said.
"We are not tired yet, the blood of our brethren is not yet punished," Egyptian media quoted opposition politician Khala Ali as saying.
Several judges have announced that they do not want to oversee the referendum, making it invalid.
"The Koran is our Constitution"
The well-organized Muslim Brotherhood declared a boronstraction, but as a precaution not in Tahrir Square, but after a mass prayer on the other side of the Nile outside the University of Cairo.
It was attended by many veiled women and salafist supporters who called out: "The people demand the application of the God's law."
They called on Morsi: "Cut the country!" and assured, "The Koran is our Constitution."
A battle for sovereignty over the symbolic Tahrir Square, on which everything began, would probably provoke a similar civil war.
Morsi's supporters clearly did not want to take the risk.
The Muslim Brotherhood said both opponents and proponents of the draft constitution were vocal and clear.
Now is the time to let the people at the ballot box decide which direction the country is to go.
A majority is considered certain in favour of the Islamist proposal.
"The word 'human rights' is not found once'
The forced constitutional dispute, which should actually continue until February and integrate all social forces, is being pledcled by Habiz Abu Sa'a.
The 47-year-old human rights lawyer and chairman of the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights (EOHR) defended members of the Muslim Brotherhood when they were in jail for Mubarak or standing in court.
Not because he shared their ideology, but because human rights are indivisible to him.
For this he was beaten, convicted and imprisoned.
"And in the new constitution, the words 'human rights' are not even once now," he complains in an interview with "Welt am Sonntag."
Morsi's extension of power to all three of the state's power forces forced the lawyer to resign.
These measures are a scandalous guilt against the democratic rules of the game and will lead Egypt to a new dictatorship.
"Instead of strengthening civil society, the president effectively abolished it," Sa'da complains.
But without civil society organisations, democracy cannot work.
The Sa'da feels abandoned even by the international community, which is watching the struggle of ideological factions on the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
That could backfire.
The demonstrator in Tahrir Square warns: "You have formed a monster that you can no longer control."
Norwegian rafting: The most smelly fish in the world?
The five million people living in Norway enjoy one of the highest living standards not only in Europe, but also in the world.
Could the country's success's secret be linked to the local appetite for the extraordinarily smelly fish?
Take some over-the-cured cheeses.
Place them in the middle of a pile of dirty and wet football gear.
Leave it for a week.
That gives you a smell to the paralyse smell of the coffinisk, one of the biggest Norwegian delicatics.
I'm in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
There is snow, a beautiful view - and a pervasive smell hangs in the air.
The Rakfisk is salted trout ferrated in the water for up to a year - it depends on how much you want the fish to smell.
As it gets dark and cold, the Norwegians begin to gather here in Fagernes for a festival dedicated to this, as best to say it, the most subtlyat.
"You'll do it raw and then drink it with a glass of aquavit," says Havard Halvarsen, a local professional firefighter, but also the so-called "Rakfisk general" who is responsible for the festival's progress.
All around us, people eat small fish cubes and drink them with a large amount of alcohol.
"Some people are better off aquavit than raft," says Havard.
The drink can be beaten over.
I'll try a few pieces.
If a fish can avoid your nose, it's not that bad - it's a similar piece of sushi that's been on the long-stre due ride on the bus.
The cancer is a product of a very different time when Norway was in poverty, and because there were no refrigerators, the fish were digraded in airtight barrels of water and salt in the autumn.
Then, in the middle of winter, when they were well ferried, they pulled out and ate - the senses were no doubt blunted with alcohol.
Before only one generation, thousands of Nors were forced to leave their country and look for work, mostly emigrating to the United States.
Currently, the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants attracted by large amounts of work, high earnings and a large-scale care system.
The people of Sweden, an old rival who was much richer than Norway not long ago, are pouring into the country for work.
The raffle is viewed as something important, indispensable, if rather, a rather smell of the Norwegian past.
It is one of the more expensive dishes on the market.
Even if everything is expensive - a small glass of beer or a sandwich will cost you £9 ($14) a piece.
Norway is often in short for global news - and it seems to suit most of the population.
The name of Anders Breivik, a right-wing racist extremist who shot dead 77 men, women and children in the past year, is still mentioned here with relust.
Instead, the shooting is called the "evening of July 22."
Norwegians can hardly believe that in their peaceful country, one of them was capable of such brutality and murder.
Behind Norway's current wealth lies the growth of one of the world's largest oil and gas industries from the early 1970s.
"But oil is not the only reason we are doing so well," says our waitress Anna, who with her long blonde hair and her long blonde eyes and her long blue eyes, presenting a prototype of Nordic affluence with her long blonde eyes.
We are, as they say, considered people.
Her English, as is the English of most of the people here, is absolutely impeccable.
We're not getting involved, we don't like pomp.
Norway is very cautious about its oil richer - apart from a small percentage, most of the money from the sector is invested in a special fund designed for future generations.
When everyone else in the years leading to the global financial crash was throwing around the money they didn't have, the Norwegians had their strings tightly tightened on their little ones.
"As far as we can ski in winter and go on trips in the summer, we are happy," says Anna.
"And eat rafting," he adds with a carefree laugh.
I'm standing in the snow in line for something to eat - I've had enough of a raffle.
Such a moose burger is definitely different and it's beautifully juicy.
But in the evening, the fling fish is back.
The hotel I live in is one of many places where the rakhisk is served for dinner and where guests choose the best, or rather the most demanding fish for the smell.
They have a lioen with live television coverage in which the moderator with a bow tie is surrounded by raffo-crawled plates.
It's like the Eurovision singing competition.
"What score do you score for the best fish up there in the mountains, Thore-Juergen?"
"Here's our scoring, Havard."
There's applause and laughter.
A man falls from the chair, perhaps tired of aquavit.
Or maybe the fumes from all the fish.
Enrique Pena Nieto of Mexico to take a tough start
As Mexico's incoming president, Enrique Pena Nieto, is preparing to take office, Will Grant of the BBC is looking at the challenges he faces and the mixed expectations of his fellow citizens.
Traffic in Mexico City is currently particularly poor.
In the city, which is clogged even in the best of times, there were erected steel barriers closing several key routes to the capital and causing chaos on the roads.
However, the aim was not to prevent commuters from getting to work, but to prevent protesters from accessing parliament.
On Saturday, Mexico's new president, Enrique Pena Nieto, will receive the presidential sash and take over the nation's leadership.
Cheer in the challenging task.
Mexico did well economically at the time of the outgoing Felipe Calderon, but the country is in the clink of the drug war, which has already taken a victim to 60,000 lives in six years.
"My government has a great commitment to the Mexican people to reduce the violence," President Pena Nieto told US President Barack Obama in the Oval Office at the beginning of this week.
I will propose a new security strategy to enable us to achieve this objective.
Before he shook hands with the US president, President Pena Nieto gained political experience as the governor of his home state of Mexico.
The views on the new leader are also different in his old homeland, the populous and vast state surrounding the capital.
A straight man.
In the rural town of Valle del Bravo, for example, they remember him in a good way.
Citizens attribute it to the development of tourism in the resort and the construction of infrastructure.
You can now reach the city on one of the new highways that Pena Nieto had built. These highways are a huge improvement over the leaky and bumpy roads that were there before.
The boards with his name also hang on the wall of the modern sports center and the imposing interactive museum with the theme of climate change.
"We expect it to bring real and lasting change," says friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, state-run member for the party of President Pena Nieto, the Party of Institutionalised Revolution (PRI).
We particularly hope for the interesting and real changes in the area of security and the economy that our country so badly needs.
After an uninterrupted 81 years in power, the PRI was pushed out by Vicente Fox.
MP Olvera admits that after 12 years outside the presidential palace of Los Pinos, there is much to be expected of Enrique Pena Nieto within the party.
And he rejects the opposition's comments characterizing the new president as a man with no substantial content.
He is a very straightforward man, very interested in the country's excellent vision.
He's a great statesman, and most of all, he's a man who can listen.
But on the other side of the state, this is not the impression that has many people from its former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast with the paved streets of the Valle del Bravo cannot be more obvious.
Stucking under the highway overpasses, much resembles the suburbs of the capital of Mexico itself.
And the problems in the self-governing community are also persistent and urban.
At the beginning of this year, the military was called in to help manage drug gangs operating in neighborhoods, particularly acute is violence against women.
Only in the last two years, the bodies of dozens of murdered women have been dumped in desolate places next to the vast waste dump.
By the time Pena Nieto was governor, more than 1,000 women were murdered in the state of Mexico, far more than in the notoriously violent city of Ciudad Juarez - a place synonymous with the murders of innocent women.
At best, critics of Pena Nieto say he failed to adequately address the problem of the murder of women in office.
And, worse, their guidance is blamed for closing his eyes.
In the concrete house, typical of the dilapidated neighborhood, Irinea Buendio shows me a photograph of her late daughter Mariana Luna and suppresses crying.
According to the official version, Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
However, her family believes her partner murdered her.
"When I arrived at her house, it looked as if her body had been washed," recalls Mrs. Buendia.
There were signs of punching, and the posthumous stiffness had begun.
As her mother tells the story, Mariana stares down from the picture on the wall, next to the cross, on which is the only word: "Justice."
However, this is, as the family says, exactly what they were denied.
The state authorities treated me like I was an old gossip, a troublemaker and a whining.
They want you to just accept what they say and keep quiet.
"But that can't be right when there have been so many mistakes and omissions," he says.
The sheerp, which President Pena Nieto will receive on Saturday, is accompanied by great responsibility.
In the past six years, tens of thousands of families in Mexico have been hit by a violent crime, and the new president has promised to be his priority for the duration of his tenure.
"I hope he will be the same president as the governor," says the PRI MP Olvera at the Valle del Bravo.
But this is exactly what the families of the victims in Ciudad Neza most fear.
Bradley Manning didn't complain about mistreatment, military prosecutor says
The military prosecutor is trying to refute Bradley Manning's claim regarding the rough treatment in custody.
The hearing focuses on Manning's stay in military detention in Quantico, Virginia.
The defense wants the case to be dismissed on the basis of the rough treatment of Manning in prison.
The Private is charged with stealing thousands of secret documents.
The military prosecutor is trying to prove that Private Bradley Manning, who is accused of the biggest leak of secret material in U.S. history, has missed many of the possibilities of complaining about the rough treatment he allegedly suffered in military custody.
The military prosecutor has. Ashden Fein, in the cross-examination of Private Manning at the preliminary hearing in Ft. Maede, Maryland, claimed that the weekly visitors that Manning had with officers of the unit's nine months of ties in Qu Quantico, Virginia, did not show any complaints of mistreatment.
The cross-trial interviewed during the hearing carried out at the defence's suggestion to dismiss the case against Manning on the grounds of gross treatment at the time of the detention, which is in itself a sufficient punishment, took place a day after Manning testified that he had considered suicide in custody.
An Army Intelligence analyst arrested in June 2010 is charged with the theft of thousands of secret documents in his service in Iraq.
The material was then published online on WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks has never confirmed that Manning was the source of her information.
At Friday's hearing, the military prosecutor, Fein, and Manning passed through the forms that officers filled out after meeting with Manning at the Quantico detention center, where he was held in a high-security regime from July 2010 to April 2011.
The officers asked Manning questions and rehearsing his answers.
When Fein asked him about these forms on Friday, Manning admitted that he had rated the treatment of his guards as "excellent" and rated the overall treatment in the facility as "very professional."
The forms do not show any complaints about mistreatment, although the officers asked Manning directly about the way he was treated, Fein claimed.
Manning replied that he had expressed concerns about the various issues orally, and that the officers who had visited him had discussed these concerns with him and indicated that they would deal with them, but had not noticed these problems.
"They wrote down "no problems" (after discussing the concerns), and that didn't necessarily mean I didn't mention them," Manning said.
Judge Plk. Denise Lind also asked Manning why he had not complained about the treatment of his person in January 2011 in a meeting with a commission assessing suicidal ideations he had expressed in a form a few months earlier.
Manning replied that during that meeting, his intention to achieve a reduction in the "prevention of injury" mode.
The military said it had used the restrictive regime (one degree under the regime's supervision for the sake of suicide) to protect it and protect it.
"I wanted the guards in custody to know that I was okay and that I wanted to cancel this injury prevention regime... to enjoy an increased quality of life, as I saw," Manning said.
Manning testified on Thursday about his arrest in Iraq and being taken to Kuwait, where he was held for nearly two months before being transported to a detention center at the Marine Corps Base in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He said he considered suicide in Kuwait and once fainted there for heat reasons.
He said that the fact that he had not been allowed to know what would happen to him and what was happening in the surrounding world was very disheartening.
"My world has shrank only to the Arifjan base, to the cage," Manning said on Thursday.
I thought I was going to die in that cage.
Manning said that after arriving at Quantico, he spent most of the days (at least 21 hours, but often more than 23 hours) in a small cell with no company.
Manning said he was allowed only one mattress, a blanket, a pair of shoes, some clothes and glasses.
He said he was trying to walk because sleeping or just lying was against regulations during the day.
Manning said he was always sleeping with the light from the outside of the cell's eyes.
He said that if the guards could not see his face when he turned the other way in the night, he was woken up and had to turn back.
Manning's attorney filed a formal complaint about the treatment of Private Manning in January 2011.
Manning was transferred to the military prison at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, in April 2011.
On Friday, Judge Manning also asked about the charges he had made in Thursday's testimony, regarding the fact that after being forced to sleep one night in his cell at Quantico naked, he was also forced to stand naked in front of the guards and other fellow inmates in the morning's count.
Manning testified that he was not allowed to be counted to cover himself with his blanket.
At Friday's interrogation conducted by Judge Manning, he said that he had decided, on the orders of his guards, that he had a blanket that could be covered, but admitted that he had not been ordered to postpone.
On Thursday, Manning testified that he had been forced to sleep naked the night before because he tried to show the officer that he was not being dangerous.
Manning said he told the officer that he could use a belt from his underwear or his backstives to hurt himself, but he didn't.
Manning testified that his underwear, his underwear, his backstags and his glasses were removed from his cell that night.
His attorney hopes the judge will take into account his experience of imprisonment and that his sentence will be significantly reduced in the case of his convicts before the court-martial, the beginning of which is expected at the start of next year.
The defense said it plans to say that Manning will plead guilty in lower-ranking offences and that he will fight other charges because they are too extreme.
The hearing is scheduled for the start of the hearing this week, with the military prosecutor expected to defend the detention conditions as justified.
The Pentagon said the statement that Manning was held in accordance with regulations regarding all those arrested in maximum security detention.
The allegations against Manning include aiding and abetting the enemy, the illegal inflicting of the online release of the news paper, the transmission of information relating to national security and the theft of public property or records.
If he is charged on all counts, he can be sentenced to life in prison.
My Crisis of Mexican-American Identity
He says that many people have been forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of possibilities that are there.
Mexicans tend to blame those who left; they remind them of difficult times, he says.
Navarrette says the Mexican Americans are trapped between two worlds.
On my last trip to the capital of Mexico, I barely made my way through the crowd and arrived at the immigrant agenda area, where I encountered a problem.
The dartes pointed to one of the two fronts: one for "Mexicanos" ("Mexicans") and the other for "Extranjeros" ("Susans").
I stood there for a few seconds, not knowing where to go.
I grew up in central California and I've been called "Mexican" all my life.
It's an ethnic shorthand, just like my friends in Boston calling themselves "Iras" and my friends in New York refer to themselves as "Italy."
So later I ended up with the term "Mexican American."
But this was Mexico.
And in my grandfather's homeland, it was not necessary to use shortcuts.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish, well enough to handle both sides of the interview in that language.
However, I do not have a vocabulary of a native speaker, and I can't get rid of my American accent.
So I pulled out my American passport and queued up for "Extranjeros."
I was thinking about the moment when the newly elected Mexican president, Enrique Pena Nieto, visited President Obama at the White House this week.
The program had the usual issues to discuss when the leaders of the two countries met: immigration, drugs, and trade.
Pena Nieto also wanted to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, which is one of the reasons why Mexicans are as likely to stay in Mexico as they travel to the United States.
It wants to join with the United States and Canada to create a trade bloc in North America similar to the European Union.
And Pena Nieto promised to continue the Mexican war against the drug cartels, though he provided no details.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and full of hostile feelings.
Most Americans probably never thought of the fact that in 1848 the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leaders to rewrite half of Mexico's territory to the United States under threat of weapons.
But for Mexicans who think in the space of centuries, not minutes, the reminders are ubiquitous.
So a minute after a United States official says something just a little bit critical of Mexico, you'll hear complaints in the Mexican press and the elite about how Americans are interfering with their neighbor's sovereignty.
And the children of Montezuma will step out on the war trail.
And yet, for Mexico, the real challenge is the relationship to the more than 35 million Mexican Americans living in the United States.
You want to talk about hostile feelings?
There's a lot of them.
In Mexico, there are winners and losers, the people the country offers options, and others that don't.
The only reason so many people with Mexican roots live in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio, was that at some point in our family tree, there was a person, perhaps a parent or a grandparent who was denied an opportunity in Mexico and had to go north.
And more often than it would seem, this person was matching the profile - dark skin, weak education, origins from a poor village, etc.
We are their descendants and we are loyal to them.
Not to Mexico.
And even though we now live in the American dream, go to good schools and have a good job, we can never forget the fact that we are living an American dream, not a Mexican dream.
Sometimes our identity may be unclear, but our loyalty is not.
It is to the United States.
And beyond that, we are aware that many elite Mexicans belonging to the ruling class do not like us.
This feeling is mutual.
They see us as a reminder of humiliating defeat and view us as a menial race that is not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our ties to Mexico never strong enough.
Our existence, in their view, is only about failure.
If our families hadn't failed in Mexico, they would never have left it.
And we would not now find ourselves trapped behind a silk curtain, with a good life in the United States, but still with lost souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and legally travelled to the United States in her childhood, reminds me that there is tension between Mexicans and Mexican Americans because the Mexicans understand more who they are, and the Mexican Americans resent it.
Even though she is a citizen of the United States, she sees herself as part of two countries.
At the same time, many of the Mexican Americans I know do not feel part of either.
We love listening to Mexican groups, Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.
You get the best of both countries, but you don't have the roots in either.
In Mexico, we're viewed as Americans.
And in the United States, we're considered Mexicans.
And to make relations even more difficult, some Mexican leaders and part of the intelligentsia, as I learned on my trip, want to reconnect with the diaspora.
They want Mexican Americans to work for Mexico as "makeback ambassadors" and represent Mexican interests in the United States.
We should tell our fellow Americans how great it is to visit this country and pressure political leaders to consolidate relations with Mexico.
Well.
That's not going to happen.
Too many hostile feelings.
And thanks to income inequality and widespread corruption and drug violence, many of us are not sure that it is a great country.
I have a feeling it's up to you, amigos.
That's fair.
If at least some Mexicans are not prepared to forgive the United States for forgiveness of the way they treated Mexico a century ago, they must accept the fact that some Mexican Americans still feel resentful of the way in which their family members were treated in the considerably closer past.
Hmmm.
Maybe we're more "Mexicans" than I thought.
The Old Battles, the new Middle East
The end of fire between Israel and Hamas could still be an uncertain basis for peace.
Can there ever be a lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
Another round of bloodshed suggests that any such one is not happening is in vain.
Among the usual unnecessary conjecture about who started it, many of the buildings were turned into a wreck, killed by more than 140 Palestinians, mostly civilians, and six Israelis. And for the first time, rockets from Gaza were caught near Tel Aviv, the Israeli capital, and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But while the Israelis and Palestinians seem to be stuck in their long-ago conflict, the Middle East is changing all around them.
The Arab Spring has changed the old order, and the Palestinians and Israelis, like it or not, are captured in the region's chaos.
It may cause their fight to be even bloodier than ever.
However, there are reasons to think that this may interrupt their deadly stalemate.
A fire that is neither won nor lost.
At first glance, it seems that there are not many reasons to be optimistic at the moment.
Even if the cease-fire stopped closed on 21 November lasted, the fighting this week was reinforced by hawks on both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamic movement that has ruled Gaza since 2007, will claim to have forced the Israelis to retreat, even though Gaza has suffered defeat.
Despite the killing of several Hamas leaders and the closure of the 1.7 million Gaza people in one of the most delepcated and populous corners of the planet, Israel failed to destroy Hamas.
Indeed, Hamas is gaining influence in the West Bank, another piece of Palestine, currently controlled by its staunttback rivals from Fatah, the more moderate Palestinian faction.
Moreover, the leaders of Hamas may very well conclude that time is on their side.
Islamists have gained more influence across the Arab world, giving Hamas powerful and wealthy friends.
Turkey, the reunited regional power that was once Israel's closest Muslim ally, joined Hamas to the side, as did Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic countries in the Gulf.
Checking people from Hamas say that the Islamic crescent is being rounded around Israel, in the north of Lebanon, where Hezbollah's party/milica rules, through Syria, where rebels who are increasingly inclined to Islamism can depose Bashar al-Assad to Jordan, where the allies of Hamas threaten the king.
Above all, on the southern flank of Israel, the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood under President Mohamed Morsi in Egypt, by far the most populous and central Arab countries, has changed the balance in the region.
Hosni Mubarak, a secular despot who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, did not have time for Hamas.
The Brotherhood, on the other hand, is a cousin of Hamas, and its leaders are more impressionable public opinion.
In future diplomacy, Hamas may appear as a player who cannot be ruled out by Israel or America.
In contrast, Israeli hardliners will reach the opposite conclusions.
In military terminology, Hamas was put back in a crate.
Israel's Iron Gross Pomell missile system proved its worth, and many of the Hamas missiles were destroyed.
Israelis can sleep better - for a while.
In diplomatic terms, America is as steadfast as it has always been. Many European countries have also blamed Hamas for launching the final round of violence.
Above all, Israel prospered, especially under the leadership of Benjamin Netanyahu, the Prime Minister, who mostly ignored the peace process.
Even though rockets from Gaza have killed around 30 Israelis since 2004, there has been relatively calm in Israel since 2004, part of the wall that extends into the West Bank, the main part of what may one day be a Palestinian state, and it protects Jewish settlements that continue to grow despite their unlawfulness from international law.
Prime Minister Netanyahu, whose Likud party teamed up with the even more radical group led by Avigdor Lieberman at the start of the election campaign for the elections on 22 January, is in a good position.
Why pampampate those treasurous Palestinians by giving them their own state?
If they really ruled the West Bank, wouldn't they be launching missiles, like their compatriots in Gaza did?
It's better if we keep them behind that wall and hit them when they stick out their heads.
Perhaps the hardliners win, but the Arab Spring may change their calculations.
While Islamists who gain power in Egypt and other countries are not very fond of Israel, their main priority will be to deal with domestic problems.
Israel's defense spending is higher than the expenses of all of its four Arab neighbors combined.
Launching a new war with a local superpower will hardly help new Arab governments heal their economies.
The fact that President Morsi has worked with President Barack Obama to reach a cease-fire is a good sign and can mark the start of something new.
Israelis, too, should look at the situation in the long term.
At a time when the rest of the Arab world is becoming more democratic, denying the rights to the Palestinians are creating a self-determination of the powder keer that must one day explode in the areas occupied by Israel - as well as the bus that exploded in Tel Aviv last week.
Already at this time, repression is weakening democracy in the Jewish state, and demography is exacerbating this situation as the Arab population grows.
The bloody attacks against Gaza, held every few years to push back Hamas, will increasingly collect their diplomatic toll.
Both sides need incentives from the outside.
The answer is what the sensible people on both sides, most of the outside world and the following newspapers proclaim: two states where Israel cedes the territory for reasons of security.
In the short term, there is a little hope that stopping the fire will give the pressures from the outside at least a little more of an impact on the enforcement of the cause.
Egypt, which, together with Turkey and Qatar, must work to halt the supply of arms to Gaza, is in a better position than ever to persuade Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state founded on the 1967 border with the replacement of parts of the country and shared by Jerusalem.
The outside Arabs must also push for a match between Hamas and Fatah.
This would do more than the immediate offer of virtual state sovereignty at the UN to create a Palestinian state state state state.
President Obama also has a piece on how to get Israel to the negotiating table.
In his first term, he neglected to present his own peace plan.
Now, back in the White House, he seems equally reluctant to enter the process.
That's woefully short-sighted.
America has a vital interest in the stable Middle East.
This means a peaceful settlement between Israel and the Palestinians.
In Australia, laws on ugly cigarette packaging have come into force
The unsightly green boxes, which are the same for all tobacco brands, are poched by warnings for smokers and diseased body parts.
Australian laws on ugly packaging of tobacco and cigarettes, the first of its kind in the world, have come into force, and the brands' logos and colours have been replaced by general olive green packs with heinous pictures of diseased body parts and depictions of children and newborns, as a result of the smoking of their parents.
In addition to various health warnings and images, the only difference between boxes between boxes of tag names that are printed in the same small print are required from Saturday.
This is the strictest regimen in the world for tobacco packaging.
The Australian federal government argues that the aim is to deter young people from smoking by depriving the habit of stripping its appeal.
It relies on studies to show that if people don't start smoking until the age of 26, there's a 99% chance they'll never start smoking.
"Even with very young children, you can see that they understand the message that tobacco companies are trying to sell to them together with their product," says federal health secretary Tanya Plibersek, citing studies as saying, for example, that children associate the crown in the logo with the idea of being a princess.
While Australia has one of the lowest smokers' numbers in the world and the changes will have little impact on the profits of multinationals, other countries are considering introducing similar steps.
The tobacco industry lobbied hard against the introduction of these laws.
Tobacco companies have argued that the law will increase trading on the black market, leading to cheaper and more affordable cigarettes.
"This legislation will make serious unintentional consequences," says Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia.
Counterfeiters from China and Indonesia will bring in much more of these products, which will be sold on the streets of Australia.
Another claims that the laws have increased their business.
Sandra Ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family-owned company, said the demand for silicone cigarette packaging used to cover the disgusting packs, two months ago, when British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost their appeals on the laws to the Australian Supreme Court, increased from near-zero sales.
Ha said that Zico sold nearly 6,000 units to the wholesalers and expects new stocks.
It's a good deal for us.
As a possible hitch, experts cite the popularity of social media in the demographic group targeted at the plan.
After a series of Australian laws banning television advertising, sponsoring sporting events and demanding that most retailers hide cigarettes from a direct eye, tobacco marketing has moved online.
Australia has banned online advertising by local companies and websites, but cannot restrict foreign websites.
"If you are a marketing officer in the tobacco industry and you only have this little space left to promote your products, online space is an insurmountable place for you to be," says Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at the University of Sydney.
Ms Freeman noted an increase in the ratings of brands on social networks such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook, conducted by the "average Honza."
We have to ask, is he just a private citizen who really loves Marlboro cigarettes and took the trouble to create this video, or is that a marketing company involved?
British American Tobacco Australia claims that the industry has focused on how to handle the new regulations rather than marketing.
The sector has gone so far as to pay Ukraine, Honduras, and the Dominican Republic to challenge the new regulations - countries within the World Trade Organization claiming that trade is unjustly limited, despite the fact that none of the countries trade significantly with Australia.
The SOO decision is expected to be sent in mid-2013.
Minister Plibersek says the government has held talks with other governments considering similar packaging laws.
Canada was the first country to introduce mandatory warning photographs in 2001.
They have now expanded to more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
The stricter laws are being considered by the UK, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many smokers in Australia are resisting.
The pictures have no effect on me.
I just ignore them.
"You just pull out a cigarette and shove the pack back," says Victor El Hage, buying a box of a tumor in his mouth.
Frankly, there's only one reason for me to stop smoking, and that's my little daughter.
James Yu, who owns the King of the Pack in downtown Sydney, says that the uniform boxes make it harder for him to level the shelves.
"It took me one hour to unload the cargo, now it takes me four hours," Yu said.
"The government should just ban them completely, then we'd say, 'OK, it's over, we'll close the shop'," he said, and threw up his hands.
In a world of constant connectivity, it's not so bad to be bored
I spent an unexpected five hours at the airport on Thanks for the last Thanksgiving when our plane was in mechanical trouble and we had to wait for the next plane to be arrived.
So I had plenty of time to think about boredom.
I'm not gonna lie to you.
Waiting half a day at the airport for the next flight is pretty annoying, despite the distractions of books, magazines and iPhones (not to mention duty-free stores).
But some scientists and experts in childhood development are increasingly coming up with praise for boring.
They say it's good for us (and our children) to be bored sometimes.
It forces the brain to go into interesting directions, which can promote creativity.
And since most of us are constantly connected to a screen these days, we don't get a chance to enjoy the boredom.
So should we support boredom?
Yes.
And no.
But I'll get back to that.
First, like many people, I assumed that boredom was a relatively new phenomenon that occurred with the arrival of more free time.
But as Peter Toohey, a professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Canada in Calgary, who is the author of Boredom: A Lively History, says (Yale University Press, 2011).
"In fact, boredom has a long history," he said.
On the walls in Pompeii was found a Latin inscription concerning boredom, dating from the first century A.D.
And then there's also the question of how we define boredom.
The trouble is that it was defined and discussed in many different ways, said John D. Eastwood, a professor of psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada.
After seeing the research literature and leading the idea to the target group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined boredom as the experience of "I wanted to do something that would satisfy me, but I was unable to do."
Boredom differs from apathy by the fact that the person is not involved in anything, but would like to be.
He says there's no urge to do apathy.
He says the crux of boredom is "the disrupting of the attention process, coupled with a bad mood and a sense of slow-minding time."
Boring can be a lot of depression.
But Professor Eastwood said that while they can have a relationship with each other, bored people tend to see a problem like the environment or the world, while people who are depressed see the problem in themselves.
Sometimes we think we're bored, when we're just having trouble concentrating.
In his study "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention," which was published in the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science in September, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues pointed to an earlier experiment in which participants listened to a tape at which the person read a magazine article.
Some groups heard a loud and unrelated television program in the next room, others heard it so quietly that they barely noticed it, while the third group didn't hear it at all.
Those who heard the TV program quietly reported more boredom than the other two groups - they had difficulty concentrating, but they were uncertain about why and attributed these troubles to boredom.
When you try to focus on a difficult or intriguing task, disrupting attention can lead to boredom, said Mark J. Fenske, a neuroscience professor at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the study's authors.
On the other hand, when you're doing something boring, "like finding bad parts on a factory line, distracting music can help you don't get bored."
In fact, he said, we now know that the twisting and scribbelling, which is often seen as a sign of boredom, can in fact help to fight boredom and keep people physically more attentive.
"The research shows that children who are allowed to fidget will learn more and keep more information than those who are forced to sit still," Professor Fenske said.
We've all had boredom sometimes - a delay in my flight, a roaring speaker, a particularly lengthy film.
But some individuals have a better chance of getting bored than others.
To help measure boredom, scientists in the 1980s developed the "Stupan for the Flagability to Penibility" (Boredom Proneness Scale).
The scale includes questions such as: "Many of the things I have to do is repeated and are monotonous," and "I have so many interests that I don't have time to do them all.".
Using these scales, scientists have found that boys tend to be bored more often than girls, said Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, especially when it comes to the need to have more and different external stimulations.
Teenagers, however, are generally inert.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of human and social development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted nearly 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day.
He found that 32 percent of adolescents said they were bored at school and doing homework, while 23 percent said they were bored when they weren't at school.
On the other hand, 3 percent of parents said they were bored.
Professor Larson said he did not know whether the percentage of boredom would be higher or lower now, 21 years later.
But he said he knew that "addating is the ultimate time for boredom," which is largely due to the fact that children and young people are not given much control over what they want to do.
So back to my original question, "Is boring good for you?".
As the research shows, sometimes not, because in its extreme form, it can lead people to take absurd physical risks, play gambling or abuse addictive substances as a way to mitigate it.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers discussed the connection between boredom and creativity, said Professor Vodanovich, who had studied the problem for more than two decades.
"Boring is the brain's way of telling you that you should do something else," said Gary Marcus, a psychology professor at NYU.
But the brain doesn't always know the most appropriate thing to do.
If you're bored and use this energy to play guitar and cooking, it will make you happy.
But if you watch TV, it will only make you happy for a while, not in the long run.
So if your child is bored and you give him an iPad, he won't be bored anymore, but he won't learn how to entertain himself or self-cerate, said Professor Fenske.
And "this separate procedure is transferred from one situation to another," the professor said.
Your child will not only learn how to entertain themselves, but will gain greater control in other areas.
I don't think we really want to celebrate boredom.
But we should not be too critical of her either.
Rather, our goal should be to feel comfortable when we are out of the reach of the constant strumm of activity and technology.
Professor Eastwood agreed.
"We accuse her of the need to be bored even more, but boredom is a painful, restless desire to be associated with something meaningful," he said.
What people are actually looking for, he said, is a way to relax and enjoy your free time.
"In the environment in which we are constantly oversimilled," he said, "it's hard to find ways to entertain when the noise is turned off."
There is no handbook in Colorado regarding the new marijuana law
Nineteen-year-old Anthony Orozco, a college college student and a football player from southeastern Colorado, faces criminal charges for something that will soon be legal throughout the state - for holding several grams of marijuana and a pipe he used to smoke it.
Mr. Orozco said that one day in September he rode with several friends in Lamar, on the plains near the border with Kansas when he was stopped.
After the officer found marijuana in the car, Mr. Orozco was issued for a summons for drug possession and equipment for drug use - minor offences for which there is a $100 fine each - and a court date was set.
"They were being approached like criminals," said Mr. Orozco.
But is he a criminal?
In uncertain weeks after the Colorado vote on the legalization of small amounts of marijuana for recreational use, the answer to hundreds of smaller drug cases depends on the spot rather than on the right.
Hundreds of marijuana possession offences have already been dropped here and in the state of Washington, which approved similar measures.
The police department has stopped accusing adults at the age of 21 and over for holding a small amount that will be legally authorised after the law comes into force in the coming weeks.
But prosecutors in Colorado's more conservative districts said they would continue with existing marijuana cases, and still blamed people for holding.
At the same time, several towns from the outskirts of Denver to the western mountains are voting to prevent the opening of new, state-relected marijuana stores in their municipalities.
"This matter is evolving so fast that I don't know what's going to happen next," said Daniel J. Oates, the police chief in the city of Aurora, east of Denver.
The heads are also scratching with regulators in the state of Washington.
And they are looking for a guide to set up a licensing system for the cultivation, production, distribution and sale - all by December 1, 2013.
They say Colorado, for better or worse, is first ahead of most states in the regulation of marijuana, first for medical use and now recreational.
"Colorado has a more regulated market, so it will be a good leash," said Brian E. Smith, a spokesman for the Washington-based licensing board.
But, as Mr. Smith admitted, no place or system can do any more than suggest what might work.
"There is no real precedent to follow," he said.
The Washington law, the so-called I-502, takes effect on December 6, which also leaves a yearly vacuum during which there will not yet be a state licensing system, but a legal holding will.
And there are messy mechanical questions that must be resolved over the course of this period, such as how to balance the state's "corresponding access" to licensed marijuana with its ban on canning trade up to 330 metres from schools, parks, playgrounds or children's centers.
"It will be no longer difficult to place a licensed cannabis store than in urban areas, especially in the metropolitan area of Seattle," said Ben Livingston, a spokesman for the Center for Legal Cannabis, recently founded research groups.
On November 21, Aurora Police Chief Oates sent an e-mail to his officers in informing him that the city's prosecutor would no longer prosecute offences for possession of small amounts of marijuana for every citizen over the age of 21 and that the police would stop accusing people of these crimes.
Chief Oates said the police would enforce city laws regulating medical marijuana growers and would continue to prosecute drug traffickers and dealers.
In the Weld district of northern Colorado, District Attorney Ken Buck presents a stricter view.
After the vote, he said his office would continue to prosecute marijuana possession cases, mostly as a way to pressure users to seek treatment.
Currently, 119 people face charges of possession of 56 grams or less marijuana, although many of them face further charges.
"Our office is obliged to prosecute criminal offences that were criminal offences at the time they took place," Mr Buck said in his statement.
The response was also complicated in places like the country district of Mesa, where voters rejected the marijuana initiative.
Police in the Grand Junction, the district's largest city, no longer blame adults for holding a small number.
The district attorney, Pete Hautzinger, supports this decision, but has also decided not to fall for all ongoing hold cases.
"I don't think I'm wasting my time by continuing to enforce the law until it changes," he said.
Although 55 percent of Colorado's voters supported the measure, bringing recreational marijuana into the arms of the government and the legal system will never be easy.
And conflicting reactions across the state revealed, with this great state green experiment, a deep ambivalence among local officials.
For district prosecutors, this is a "cultural barrier," said Sean McAllister, a lawyer from Denver who represents the defendants of possession of marijuana, and a local spokesman for the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws.
"They have spent so much of their lives prosecuting people that they still can't really accept that it's legal," he said.
As the first states to treat small amounts of marijuana as alcohol, Colorado and Washington are on the way to the state with national test cases for legalizing the drug.
Defenders and state authorities are planning new frontiers for legalized sales, while also anxiously awaiting instructions from the federal government, which still plans to consider selling and cultivating marijuana as federal crimes.
Defenders of the legalization of marijuana are hoping to acquiesci the Justice Department.
Despite several arrests by medical-micarchas and patients who use it, which drew attention, the federal government mostly left the medical marijuana shops in Colorado, Washington, and 16 other states in operation.
While anti-drugs are unlikely to be knocking out the door to intercept a small bag of drugs, it is likely that they will resist allowing for state-regulated marijuana holidaying shops called for by the new laws, said Kevin A. Sabet, a former adviser on President Obama's administration's anti-drug policy.
Several Colorado cities don't wait for the federal administration.
Even before the election day, some local governments approved moratoriums for any new marijuana shops, though it will be a year or so before any shop can be opened.
Last week, the city of Montrose in the west of the state proposed a six-month ban and is likely to enter into force next week.
"We don't want to find ourselves in a position where we issue a license to someone and then get a big federal issue out of it," said Bob Nicholson, a member of the city council.
Our community voted against this amendment.
We are looking at what the municipality voted for, as opposed to what the state voted.
There are a lot of questions.
Petronella Wyatt: "I was forced to leave Oxford because I am a conservative."
For their opinions they are not only attacked by today's university students.
I don't remember ever dreaming of studying at the University of Oxford.
Both my father and my older brother studied at the university, which I thought was the world's greatest founding of knowledge, a modern, overtified Greek symposium motivating two pillars of civilization, free thought and tolerance.
And so far, in the late 1980s, within two weeks of my appointment at Worcester College, where I wanted to study history, packed my bags, and tilled into the first scandal of my life.
My father collapsed and cried.
My friends were confused.
The Evening Standard claimed that I had given up because I objected to the loveminers of the students in the next room.
The writer A. N. Wilson said cheerfully that I had left because I was forced to drink from batter cups.
The truth was less comical.
I ran away.
Yes, I escaped because I was the subject of systematic bullying and intimidation.
Not because of my rather bizarre name or the fact that I came from a private school.
I was persecuted for one reason, and in this cradle of the supposed enlightenment it was both bigoted and barbaric: my father, the late Woodrow Wyatt, was a senior adviser to Margaret Thatcher, and I was a supporter of the Conservative Party.
You may ask why I'm pulling it out now.
Simply because the latest reports suggest that a new generation of students to the right of the center suffers from similar persecution.
The institutionalized and growing hatred of conservative students at Oxford is so great that last week a group of these students sought equal protection of equal rights as gays, people with disabilities and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the younger years' association (JCR) at Corpus Christi College claim that, because of their political views, they are "often actively isolated, subjected to personal attacks and show that they are not welcome."
They are calling for a position to be established on the University Committee on Equal Opportunities to ensure that they are free to communicate their views.
Their situation was not helped by the recently released BBC Two documentary, Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right (Fairytou Country: Young, Intelligent and Right-wing) about the student's political affairs, which he described to the Conservatives as oddballs and neo-Nazis.
The show featured a graduate of Joe Cooke, former president of the Oxford University Conservative Association, who rode the Rolls-Royce, who wore a silver suit and wore a silver-headed club.
At other universities, conservative students say they are treated as "souty lambs" because of the introduction of higher tuition fees.
Luke Black, 20, a vice president of Nottingham University Conservative Association, told a Sunday newspaper that "left-wing influence in universities is growing.
People think we're like the Bullingdon Club without even getting together with us."
A 21-year-old history student at Corpus, Christi Samuel Roberts, behind the movement for greater protection, says such a climate is "unpleasant," while OUCA's 19-year-old elected president, Stephanie Cherill, says that JCR members' approach to people to the right of the center has been deteriorated.
"This poses a threat to the atmosphere of intellectual discussion, as well as for the well-being of the members' living conditions," he says.
During my first few weeks at Oxford, I was a minority of one member.
I joined in September 1986, 18-year-old and cripplingly shy.
Hatred of the Conservative Party was the most hulled.
A year earlier, the university had voted to refree to award an honorary degree to former former student Margaret Thatcher on the grounds of cuts in funding for higher education.
From the atmosphere, even the Stalinists would be shout with fear.
During the first few days of the opening week, when the new students meet with each other and with the professors, I was given a taste of the pate that was to come.
I have found that not only do professors silently approve of the needling of conservative pupils, but they are also in the appetite for it.
The timber-pand-mine-pawing industry was brought into the timber-paneled auditoriums' policies of the mining strike, privatisation and opposition to the government's sanctions against apartheid in South Africa.
My first lecture was to translate a French text from the 18th century to English, and I was not prepared for what followed.
"Ms. Wyatt," said Professor Harry Pitt (now the deceased), "please outrehect the first paragraph."
I was pretty stiff.
Professor Pitt, a little man with a face like a cake dough, was very bile.
"The Thatchers refuse to learn French, or are they just stupid?" he asked.
The other students giggled.
Tears were in my eyes.
"I suggest that you take some basic French lessons in your spare time, unless you are too busy with social affairs," Professor Pitt growled.
I went back to my room devastated.
At dinner at school, I sat alone when I felt a slight tap on the shoulder.
He was a sophomore, named James, who introduced himself as an OUCA member.
"I know who you are," he said kindly.
Unfortunately, it is.
Anyone suspected of conservatism is a target.
It's bad enough for me, but they know your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so it's gonna be even worse for you.
Most conservative freshmen pretend to be labouristi.
Later in the local pub, I cowardly tried to pretend.
I insisted on not agreeing with everything Thatcher said.
This trick proved unsuccessful.
A first-year student in philosophy, politics and economics, who (as ironically) went to Eton, said, "You are the daughter of a fascist pig."
You're infected.
The other students were notching with him.
I was sick, dirty.
"How do conservatives love each other?" one asked.
He's hinged on each other, right?
I felt the way that homosexuals must have felt before the liberal legislation of the 1960s.
Could I ever lead a normal life in Oxford?
Would I be forced to meet with like-minded people only after dark?
Would I have to turn into a Labour and suppress my natural tendencies?
Three years have developed before me as a purgatory of disregard for ignoring and isolation.
The only openly conservative professor was Norman Stone, a professor of modern history who was based on my college.
He was hated not only for being conservative, but also for being Margaret Thatcher's foreign policy adviser and one of those who made her speechew.
He was almost not there.
He hated the place for his parochiality and pettiness, and for his shift to the Marxist-deterministic view of history.
In 1997, he took up a post as professor at Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey.
"You will not be happy here," he told me.
I began commuting from Oxford to my parents' house in London, seeking refuge from my unbiased metropolitan friends and family.
I told my father I hated Oxford and why.
He couldn't believe it.
During his studies at Oxford in the 1940s, all political views were accepted.
"But it's the best place in the world," he said pathetically.
They wouldn't do that, not in the city's dream moods.
Even my communist friends have always had perfect manners.
His moist, his moist, his eyes were somer.
Try again.
I'm sure it's a prank.
I'd be heartbroken if you left.
Exhausted by frequent trips to London, my emotional resilience was deteriorating.
My friend, also a supporter of the Conservative Party, succumbed to the pressure and gave up his conviction.
The following week, during the course of the course, when another professor of history declared in absolute esteem that I was a "enemy of the people," I decided to do the same.
Even when I blushed with shame inside, I confessed to "the cubes brainwashing me" and called them "old fools."
The relief was only short-lived.
The nave in the coffin of my Oxford career was hammished by my father.
At the time, he wrote two columns for Murdoch's newspaper every week.
My door was locked.
I crouch inside and after five minutes my pursuers gave up.
When they left, I packed up my suitcase and caught the first train to London.
I never came back.
You may call me a snot-noodated weakling.
But no 18-year-old girl or boy should be the subject of such intimidation and venom in the educational institution.
But even more tragic is that it was Oxford, from which not only 14 Conservative prime ministers emerged, but which, to date, also hides behind the undeserved reputation of a place with equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance to fame"
On the occasion of the "Valentino: Master of Fashion" which opened this week in London, the ABC spoke to Nata Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisz and other famous Italian designer customers.
Somerset House, the ancient residence of Isabella I of England, is the only place in the British capital to host the Valentino Garavani exhibition.
The designer confirmed this at the opening of the celebratory retrospective "Valentino: a master of fashion" which represents more than 130 models of the top-of-the-line fashion created by his studio over the past 50 years.
"I adore this castle," he says with his unmistakable Italian accent.
This exhibition is the conclusion of a story in which "il signore" Garavani is the only protagonist who could not have been written without his honed clients.
Valentino had always felt enchanted by the rare and distant world of the aristocracy.
The first hall of the exhibition, which will run until 3 March, brims with private correspondence and photographs with the signatures of the most important nobles, from Princess Salima Aga Khan to the Greek princess Maria-Chantal and Margaret from England to Lord Snowdon.
Valentino exhibits these personal memories as a trophy for his social rise: from a simple tailor from the city of Voghera in the north of Italy to the idol of the international "bohemian elite."
To like the royal family is no bad thing.
"At least they don't put a cigarette stub in a great carpet like some gorgeous pop-music celebrities do," says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisz.
In the '60s and '70s, we both lived in the Alps and we were good friends.
Valentino is an impressive host and entertains guests in abundance and with elegance.
"We were all very pleased when we were invited to his cottage in Gstaad," explains the ex-wife of "Heini" Thyssen and a close friend of forgotten beauties like Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
"Valentino has always preferred elegance to fame.
And he's a star, too."
Valeria Mazz shows off Valentina
The charisma of the designer is not forgotten by the Argentine model Valeria Mazz.
'It's been many years since we went to his house for dinner after a parade in the Piazza di Spagna in Rome.
There were twenty of us, and between us were Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
In every little thing in his apartment, decoration, food, music, he was at all and felt his spirit.
He made all those invited feel important and loved," recalls the top model, who started working with him during the High Fashion Week of Paris.
"He will never go out of fashion because his designs are works of art," he concludes.
Parade of nobling
Gravani's life is not an obsession, but a truly reerum love.
He loves people with good manners and better titles and they love him.
One of the Somerset House galleries was converted into a distinctive seventy-metre-long passage that offers a roster exchange: the visitor turns into a model and marches through a passage to watch the "generity" of dreams worn by Valentine's masterpiece works as a dress chosen by Jackie Kennedy for her wedding to Aristotle Onassis, a costume worn by Monica Vitti in "Noci," or a wool and fur coat that belonged to the emperor Farah Diba.
The mannequins' audience shines names such as Sibilla of Luxembourg, Gloria of Thurn and Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria or Sophie of Austria.
Naty Abascal and designer in 2006
Many of these clients say that Valentino is the first to love, "it's impossible to forget about him."
"I remember it perfectly.
They were trousers, shirts, a "gillette" vest and a jacket from the autumn-winter collection from 1971-1972.
It was a gift he made for me," says Naty Abascal, one of the designer's muse.
"I give him priority over others for his femininity and great love for women because he underlines our beauty," adds the former Duchess of Feria.
"I really like the colors he uses, brighten up a lot and give a "spit" to the face.
The proportions are perfect.'
Even the princess and fashion icon Patricia della Giovampaola d'Arenberg can't forget how she wore Valentino for the first time.
Growing up and living in Italy, she wanted to be of age and have the opportunity to wear one of his evening dresses...
It eventually came to be in the late 1990s.
"I bought my first Valentin dress to mark the occasion of my cousin's castle, Prince Edouard de Ligne.
It was a red dress that wore a ruffled skirt, a gouled bodlict, and a hangerless top.
It was a dream that came true," says Rodriguo's widow d'Arenberg.
"Valentino is lax to fashion, his passion is timeless," explains the Italian aristocrat, whose life is unfurled between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess d'Arenberg has the designer's solemn dress "very carefully... because the dress is not just a dress, it's also a set of memories that they have in them."
"King" of fashion
The highlight of the exhibition at Somerset House is the Marie-Chantal Miller wedding dress from her wedding to Pavel Greek in 1995.
To create these silk ivory-colored dresses with sewn pearls, twelve types of different pineal and a four-and-a-half-metre-long siding, four months of work and 25 "inspire" (as the designer calls his seamstresses) were needed.
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the greatest authority of the specialized press, this dress represents the landmark of the ultimate fashion of the late 20th century, "the return of clients from high society."
Valentino dazzled over the years of the elitist "savoir-être" is now his best example.
Garavani as the Cavaliere di Gran Croce (Supreme Medal of Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commandeur de L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres and the Order of Honor of the Legion of Honor accumulate as many honours as any of the spouses of his clients.
"My attention has always been attracted to his choice, his peace, his neat, and his perfect appearance," the princess acknowledges d'Arenberg.
"Last time I saw him at a gala dinner at the Orsay Museum last month.
He was at the table with the Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, my great friend.
He was impeccable, time left no trace of him.'
When the princess says so...
The toughest craft in the world: sulfur porters in the Kawah Ijen volcano area
For four euros, the carriers in the Indonesian volcano area are gambling with their lives and hellos as they lay 70 kilos of sulfur down on steep stone trails.
There are people for whom their work is hell, and there are those who literally work in hell.
This is the case for Anta Wijay, one of the 400 miners who make a living conquering sulfur from the Kawah Ijen volcano in the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
Because of this, they have to fouk to the bottom of the crater every day, where the sulphur gases are leaking from the inside of the Earth and, when in contact with the air, it passes into a solid state.
After choping up large sulfur blocks, which together weigh up to 70 kilos, he carries them on the shoulders in two bamboo baskets along the steer stone trails.
To the top of the volcano, which toaster 2,386 metres, it is only 250 metres, but it takes the exhausted carriers to climb up at the turtle's pace, as they maintain their balance and carefully unthink their steps to avoid slipping and crashed into the abyss.
They know that any stumble might cost them their lives, as happened to a French tourist who crashed from the rocks of Kawah Ijen years ago.
Miners in Kawah Ijen earn five cents for every kilo of sulfur they extract
When they're up, they make their way past the tourists who photograph them as if they were monkeys in the circus, and wearily carry the heavy baskets to the weight the mining company has placed a little lower, at an altitude of 1850 meters.
It is PT Candi Ngrimbi, which has benefnited in the volcano since 1960 and has never paid its workers for more than 662 Indonesian rupees (five cents) per kilo of sulfur.
It is then sold for 10,000 rupees (83 cent) to the petrochemical industry, as this mineral has its place in everyday life and is used for the production of matches, fun pyrotechnics, cosmetics, dynamite and even whitening of sugar.
"Because 70 kilos are normally worn, we earn about 46,000 rupees (€3.8) for each trip," explains Anto, who usually makes it through three trips a day.
One trip takes him three hours and is devastated at the end, but he can earn 138,000 rupees (€11.5) per day.
While this seems to be a negligible amount for such an inhumane effort, it is three times what he would earn in the field.
"The daily wage for miners here is very high. For example, collecting coffee is paid for 15,000 rupees (€1.2) per day and the salary for a fortnight is two million rupees (€167)," explains the porter who previously worked on the tourist island of Bali as a bricklayer.
There his salary was 75,000 rupees (€6.2) per day, and the work was not so hard, but Anto and his family returned to Banyuwangi, a village near the volcano, for a serious reason, which is as convincing in Indonesia as the sulfur: "I married a young girl from Bali, who is Hindu, and I took her to Java to convert to Islam."
Anto has asthma, it's hard to breathe, coughs all the time, and his eyes are irritated by the toxic gases
At the age of 27, Anto risks living in the Kawah Ijen volcano three times a day, the sulfur of which has already begun to take its toll on it, despite having a face protected by a special mask and glasses.
He's got asthma, he's hard to breathe, he's coughing all the time, and his eyes are irritated by the toxic gases that escape from the volcano.
That's the price he has to pay to get his dream.
"I will work for two more years because I want to open a shop or study Spanish or French," he promises more than a decent English.
This likeable and intelligent young man, painstered in destiny, could be a tourist guide, a waiter or a hotel receptionist, and instead does the work of a carrier.
He shares a dirty wooden hut with other porters and gets up at two o'clock every day because the sulfur continues to rise at night and its distinctive yellow color turns blue and glow in the dark.
Despite the surrounding darkness, Anto's pharates to the crater, illuminating his journey with a small lantern that he has attached to his helmet and has bought it himself with his money.
About 400 porters carry on the shoulders of the sulfur baskets from the bottom of the crater
Although the company has high incomes, it has not mechanised the sulfur mining to cost savings, nor does it provide carriers working on their own and with such effort, no equipment.
In fact, they do not receive a share of the 30,000 rupees (€2.5) from the photography supplement, which, together with the 15,000 rupee ticket (€1.2.), is collected by the nature park keepers from tourists arriving to photograph the volcano and its human mules.
"This job is for cattle and not for the people," says Madrusin, a burly 42-year-old carrier who has worked at Kawah Ijen for three decades, since he left school.
He manages to lift up to 110 kilos and assures us that he will keep working "as long as possible" because he needs the money to educate his three sons between the ages of 18 and 10.
I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here because the volcano was my whole life
Although sulfur burns his throat and stings his eyes when the wind unexpectedly turns and tramples the miners in the dense foules that emerge from the volcano, the miners are so hard to say that none of them complains that they suffer from serious illnesses... but this is evident from their frequent respiratory problems, arthritis, knee pain and wounds to the shoulders caused by the weight of the baskets.
Unainik, who balances his basket on his back, can only load 50 kilos at the age of 53.
Every day he and his colleagues dig out 15 tons of sulfur in the volcano, which are then taken by the three trucks on the steep route between the thicket to the warehouse in Tamansari, 18 kilometres away.
"I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here because the volcano was my whole life," Unainik declares, opening a wide mouth in which several teeth are missing.
Of his five sons, the eldest, thirty-year-old, also makes his living by mining the sulfur.
Time passes, but the incessant misery of one of the world's most difficult crafts persists from generation to generation - the crafts performed by human mules in Kawah Iljen.
Singapore is looking for babies to save the economy
Singaporeans are tempted by not having children, careers, stress, and the cost of living and education.
"The people of Singapore need to grow."
I'm married and I'm a patriot, you're my wife and you're a patriot. let's fulfill our civic duty and we'll have a new life!
It may seem incredible that this slogan is part of a commercial for menthol candies, but still - or perhaps because of it - the video expanded en masse to YouTube in Singapore earlier this year.
These theorems are part of a rap that uses local innuendo type "we'll put the buckle in the oven" as a mockery of the birth rate in Singapore.
The advertising agency BBH, which created the video, hopes to highlight the problem in a witty way with this ad.
The agency's art director, Douglas Hamilton, says he wanted to use the influence of music to make people "the civic duty" come true.
"This is entirely an issue of the Internet, so it must have been fun and funny.
It is the biggest problem in this country.
We are the worst in the world in reproduction of our population, so we felt that this was a topic that we had to touch.
We knew the government was trying to do a lot of things like expanding phemomon perfume or organizing dating parties.
Many of these ideas might have been creative, but not entirely functional.
So we've thought about why not do the most creative possible thing, such as the composition of rap, to solve the problem."
1.2 children
Whoever doesn't take it too lightly is the Singaporean government.
They spend $1,300 a year to encourage citizens to have more children.
The government's marriage and family package provides up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave and allocates financial benefits.
But all these measures had little effect.
Singapore is a wealthy urban state with advanced technology in Southeast Asia, also known for its leaders' conservatism and strict social controls.
The birth rate in Singapore, with a view to stratification of the population, is currently 1.2 children per woman.
The last time the birth rate exceeded the birth rate, the rate of renewal, in 1976.
Why do Singaporeans have no more children?
Tan Wei Ming, director of the Department of Marriage and the Family Department of the National Office for Population says it's because of a "imagger education" and a "wider range of career opportunities."
"People have a wider range of options at their disposal when it comes to life's goals and priorities, it's not just a wedding and a family," he explains.
These changes in social norms have contributed to increasing the number of single people and the postponement of marriage and the procreation of children. The result is a reduction in the birth rate in Singapore.
While immigration policy made efforts to drastically increase the influx of immigrants as a measure against a decline in population, this has resentful among local residents.
Some Singaporean websites show undisguised xenophobia against many new immigrants, especially Chinese, who are criticised for maintaining low salaries and seeking to integrate.
The increase in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why the governing Singapore party recorded its worst election result since the start of independence last year.
After the election, there was an effort to address the problem with quotas and higher fees for foreign workers.
Unex's unexpected consequences
While the decline in the fertility rate has seen effects on national economic growth, tax revenues, health-care spending, and immigration policies, and there have also been some unexpected consequences for Singapore.
The government is trying to keep buildings of so many small houses.
For example, it began to influence the real estate business.
The Municipal Development Office has started to regulate the number of small apartments known as the "bass box" that can be built in certain urban areas.
These flats have an area of 46 square metres and have been a great success in sales.
Nevertheless, there is a fear that these apartments can support the bachelor's lifestyle and discourage developers from building large family homes.
But Lim Yew Soon, CEO of the property developer EL Developers, claims that their "bars-onbox" sells far faster than larger homes.
"They're more popular, by going through days to weeks faster than larger-area houses.
That's why they're much better for our cash flow."
However, it admits that the new standards set clearer rules for developers who were previously capped when they wanted to offer too many small houses in one project.
Too stressed
Singapore is a city-state.
Although these new rules could be aimed at increasing the nation's fertility rate, a conversation with the Singaporeans working in the financial district of the city centre suggests that they will not have much effect.
"People are still stressed, houses are expensive, as are education, so do many people postponed," says the young official.
"Theers have children.
But for me it is important to rely on my own money and time," says another, about 20-year-old.
Both men and women mention their careers, stress, and the cost of living and their education as reasons that prevent them from having children.
So whatever the government is trying to force the citizens to have children, it is the Singaporeans who have the last word on starting a family.
What is private offline is both private and online
Privacy.
According to the dictionary published by the Royal Spanish Academy, this is something that has a personal nature or "the area of private life that everyone has the right to protect against any breach."
What is privacy for a man under the age of 16?
How does he apply this definition in his daily life and on social networks?
Does he understand the dangers he is exposed to when he publishes on the internet matters he would certainly not have told anyone in a normal communication?
Journalists at elPeriódico interviewed five boys and girls between the ages of 10 and 15 who are frequent users of the Internet.
In four cases, the term privacy considered "something entirely of its own" on a personal level and a "user name and a slogan" if it was social networks.
"My biggest secret I wouldn't release," says 10-year-old Jorge, in an attempt to explain the importance of privacy in places like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has had accounts for two years.
"They're very secret secrets, my mom can know about them, but not the whole world," he claims.
"On FB I give nice pictures or pictures of us playing.
I'm also talking to friends there.
I wouldn't share a photo that wasn't mine, or a picture that would make someone mock the truth," he says.
This boy realizes that it is wrong to post obscene photographs, photographs of naked persons or photographs of crimes, or to write humiliating or rude comments.
Jorge says he knows all 35 friends he has on FB and his nine followers on Twitter.
Most are related.
Among them is the mother, who has the name and password of one of the accounts.
"I started an Twitter account to express my opinions and write interesting posts.
I don't know if anyone can answer me, I just put them there," he adds.
"Social networks are fun, I can talk to relatives who are far away or communicate quickly with friends," he says.
Without hesitation, he says he would never accept a request from an unknown person.
He wouldn't even care if someone recommended someone to the unknown.
The case of 14-year-old Jose is different.
This teenager owns accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask networks, and admits to the latest network that he does not know 20 people on his list of friends.
"I'm not worried about it because we have something in common, like music," he says.
According to this boy, none of them put him on anything, nor did he want him to have an address or phone number.
"If they urged me or required it from me, I would simply remove them from my account," he admits.
Jose signed up for Ask after reading the Twitter recommendation.
This boy is no stranger to experience with what is now called cyberbullying (cyberbullying).
"The friend's friend on the social networking site blackmailed.
They threatened him and demanded money.
He never learned who it was," he confirms.
The victim, according to Jose, did not get out of the account.
"She just activated her private mode."
Then he explains a series of steps to set the account safely.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would publish pictures of acquaintances in awkward or embarrassing situations.
"Of course I would do that if I minded or just wanted to.
Even though I know it's cyberbullying," he claims.
Key issues
Marielos Porras, an English teacher and a graduate in Education and Teaching, believes that, in order to navigate children and adolescents correctly in social networks, they must understand that the main objective of these networks is to inform.
He states that: "The Internet originated as a means of seeking information, but when social networks appeared, the rules of the game changed."
Marrielos Porras notes that academic Marc Prensky, a graduate of teaching at Yale University and the author of the article Digital Aggarg and digital immigrants, introduced these concepts to explain the phenomenon.
"Digital natives are children and young people who were born during the time of this technology.
We are the digital immigrants who have to teach them, yet we are still learning," he says.
He explains that it is a complex subject "because we ask them to discern what is appropriate to disseminate, publish and say, and what not, at an age when they are not yet mature for it."
Also, to be - as far as the surroundings are concerned - to be a will-be at a time when what they most desire is to be popular, to have thousands of friends and not to think about the consequences," he adds.
According to this specialist, the most effective way to show children and adolescents what privacy is to ask questions that make them think.
"To tell them not to do something doesn't work," he adds.
Next, Marrielos Porras lists some of the options: There are things you wouldn't tell a stranger, so why do you do it online?
Or: Would you like to see someone posting your picture the way you posted a friend's?
You know what the others are publishing about you?
When you tag the people in the pictures of the celebrations, did you ask these people permission?
And one more: Do they all need to know what you're doing?
The next point is to make them realise that they have to behave in the internet environment the same as they do outside of it.
It's the same rules.
"You follow respect, morality and other principles outside the internet, and you should be the same on social networks," he claims.
View
Estuardo Guardia, a university professor, a first-grade teacher and an educational adviser, explains the need for children's parents to carefully read the rules of social networks.
"If they understand every one of the boldness, they have a good basis to talk to their children about the consequences that setting up an online account can have.
For example, in terms of age or what is allowed to be shared or published," he says.
The Guardia is of the opinion that it is crucial to remind children of the traditional 'not to speak to strangers' rule.
The South American Summit Ends and the Lima Declaration Not Public
The Sixth Presidential Summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) held in Peru ended today without the Specation of Lima, which was announced and was reportedly signed by seven presidents present.
The eahead agency has repeatedly attempted to gain access to a document signed at the sixth meeting of the heads of state and government of Unasur, but representatives of the Foreign Ministry and the presidential office, who initially stipulated that they would publish the document after the summit, said it would be published later on the Peruvian government's website.
They also said the content was released by Peru's President Ollanta Humal in several short press releases.
Journalists had their access to information restricted throughout the summit.
During the meeting, a video of the presidential rally was transmitted in the press room without sound with the message "confidential meeting, sound transmission to be avoided."
A small amount of information available to journalists was provided to the press spokespers of some of the governments who were present, but not the Peruvian spokesman.
The only document published during the meeting was a list of attending presidents, which prompted the arode of hundreds of journalists from various national and international media who asked for more information.
Later, the Peruvian presidential office sent out an email to the media with a "freight statement" from the summit, but this is just a statement by President Humala, and not an official document that the summit concluded.
Last October, Peru hosted the third summit of the South American and Arab countries (América del Sur-Países Árabes, ASPA) and, even on this occasion, the originally promised Lima Declaration was not made public, although it was fervently required by the press.
The official ASPA website shows that the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities sought to ensure broadcasting for all journalists, but to completely prevent the flow of information.
The summit ended, among other things, with a joint commitment from Chile and Peru to the adoption of a judgment of the Hague Court of Justice, which is before the dispute over the border between the two countries.
President of Peru Ollanta Humala and President of Chile Sebastián Piñera met during a regional meeting and confirmed that they would respect the decision of the International Court of Justice in The Hague, which will begin hearing the dispute launched by Lima against Santiago on Monday, with a hearing of the two-party defence.
"We will undertheat and execute a judgment that will resolve the dispute we are hearing in this international court today," President Humala said with his Chilean counterpart.
"The Chil was, is and will be a country respecting international law, the peaceful resolution of disputes, conventions and international courts," Piñera said, greeting President Humal with a handshake at the flags of both countries.
The confirmation by the two presidents of the International Court of Justice that he would undergo a ruling was made public after Colombia's adopted the Bogota Pact this week, in which it submitted to the judgments of the International Court ruling on the maritime borders with Nicaragua, and Colombia considered the decision to be wholly flawed.
The summit was held without the participation of the presidents of Brazil (Dilma Rouseff), Venezuela (Hugo Chávez), Bolivia (Evo Morales) and Argentina (Cristina Kirchner).
Paraguay was expelled from Unasur in 2011 following the dismissal of then-President Fernando Lugo and did not attend the meeting.
Host President Ollanta Humala was tasked with opening the morning speeches and the end of the Lima summit shortly after noon.
The president read out the final document, informing that 16 agreements had been adopted and action had been planned for 31 projects between South American countries, with investment of $17 billion.
In addition to the agreements adopted, he mentioned that UNASUR member countries would take "important steps towards the goal of South American citizenship, for which residence agreements are extended."
He informed that actions were being supported to improve "cooperation in the fight against civil uncertainty and international organised crime, to improve the availability of medicines and the cheap internet in all corners of South America, and to joint and effective measures against the risks of natural disasters."
When Europe is in crisis, "the economic consolidation (Latin America) has no winning essence, but is intended to expand our productivity and show our nations a better future," Humala added.
"We have decided to prioritize a group of 31 symbolic projects that will improve transport links between different locations in South America, especially rural and border areas... to make our countries more closely connected and form new economic ties," the Peruvian president said in a reading speech.
He mentioned that five of these projects involved Peru and the transgent incoming axes of its territory from the coast to Brazil, and the other two related to a better link with Ecuador, but did not give any more details.
The final document also touched on the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process in this country will serve to return it to the Union of South American Nations," from which it is currently excluded.
Another of the issues highlighted by the summit needed to keep Latin America a prosperous and peaceful area that was whole and has good neighbourhood relations.
In this sense, Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos said before attending the regional meeting that he hoped to meet his Nicaraguan counterpart Daniel Ortega in Mexico on Saturday to hear with respect the International Court of Justice's judgment on the dispute over the maritime border dispute that is questioned by Bogotta.
"It is possible that I will meet with President Daniel Ortega tomorrow (Saturday)," Santos said.
"We will discuss all the solutions, none are excluded, nor the treaty with Nicaragua that would require negotiations with this country," he stressed.
"I hope to be able to tell President Ortega that we should conduct the negotiations in the most civilised and reckless possible form possible," Santos added.
Santos and Ortega will meet on Saturday in Mexico to attend the inauguration of the country's president, Enrique Peña Nue.
As part of the summit, the EU's defence ministers met tentatively to approve the Action Plan for 2013, which seeks to strengthen the dialogue and consensus on the field of defence.
UNASUR members include Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guiana, Suriname and Paraguay, although the latter is currently excluded.
Peru is the interim president of this regional bloc.
Rafael Correa: South America must learn integration from Europe
Ecuador's President Rafael Correa announced today that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal in which 'South America, in this case really, must be taught from Europe'.
Correa, who attended the 6th Presidential Summit of the South American Nations (Unasur) in Lima, said on state television, Perú, that the Europeans "kid in World War II" and in other conflicts, "but now they are practically one homeland."
In this sense, he defended the project to create South American citizenship, which member countries support for Unasur.
"It is necessary to achieve the free movement of citizens and workers within any of the South American countries that is already taking place between the members of the Andesso Community, but there are still areas of reactionary that want to bring us back to the past," he pointed out.
The Ecuadorian president has said, among other things, that he agrees to the redemption of the Organization of American States (OAS), on the condition that the influence of Anglo-Saxon states be reduced and those who signed the Human Rights Pact of San José will be taken into account.
"Those in the lead are never committed to anything, and we South Americans, on the other hand, sign it all.
It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Human Rights Commission is funded by the United States in Washington," he said, referring to political asylum granted by Ecuador WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.
President Correa confirmed that he did not regret this decision because he did not betray his principles, and respected his "deep democratic values and human rights."
He added that at the time "there were reasonable suspicions that Assange might be extradited to a third country, regardless of the ongoing process."
In addition, he criticised the Swedish judiciary, which asked him to submit to being questioned on Swedish territory for an alleged sexual offense, with "the Swedish legislation's own national legislation allowing for a video-conferencing call that could take place from the Ecuadorian Embassy in London."
Correa said there was a risk that Assange's physical and mental health would deteriorate.
"I haven't spoken to him since he's been in our embassy, but the ambassador has informed me that she has minor lung problems but nothing serious," the Ecuadorian head of state said.
"But he is in danger of deteriorating in his physical and mental state because he is locked in a small space with no possibility of moving in the fresh air.
That would affect everyone's health," he said.
President Correa noted that the solution to the asylum provided to Assange since June at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, on the basis of a permit allowing him to travel to Ecuador, is in the hands of the UK, Sweden and the European courts, and stressed that talks have taken place with London to resolve the imprisonment of the founder of WikiLeaks.
"We do not negotiate on human rights, we do not use such a word in this case, but there were ongoing interviews.
The solution to this problem is in the hands of the UK, Sweden and the European courts, because Assange's lawyer, Balthazar Garzón, is leading a series of proceedings at various European instances," he said.
He said that "if the UK issues a pass tomorrow, it will all be over."
And if Mr Assange's Sweden interviews at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London or Skype, as the legislation there allows for it without a problem and, as has already been done in other cases, the problem will be the end tomorrow.'
Correa used this situation to present himself as a defender of press freedom, clarifying that he was by no means of tolerance of "sub-standard, malicious intentions and lies that undermine freedom of expression."
The greatest enemies of the free press are not us, the underman and perverted politicians, but bad journalists in the service of profit, coercion and blackmail," he said.
From this perspective, he expressed his joy at the fact that neither such journalists, "neither the bankers, nor the hegemonic countries, nor the bourgeoisie, control Ecuador," and said that if he was re-elected, "he would continue to make changes conducted in the right way and in the right direction."
President Correa also supported the decision to maintain the veto further expressed by Paraguay regarding membership of the Unasur union until its next election, arguing that the whole "must be firm and not tolerate opportunism and putschism wrapped in legality" because it actually "destroyed the legitimacy of Paraguayan democracy."
In addition, the President of Ecuador's said he considered "as a perfectly appropriate" wish for his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, to negotiate with Nicaragua on the maritime borders between the two countries now, following the judgment of the International Court of Justice in The Hague, which ruled in favour of Nicaragua.
The judgment is not currently accepted.
"This is a problem between the South American and Central American countries.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome with the will to walk together.
They need to be assessed wide to be overcome and be able to go forward."
He also expressed his hope of settling the maritime border dispute before the same court between Peru and Chile, and expressed the view that "it is right for Latin America to seek out international instances if the two countries commit to accept a judgment, no matter how harsh."
In the context of the possibility of running for the next presidential election in Ecuador to run for a third mandate, he noted that he perceived the possibility "with great optimism and joy, although sometimes it is very difficult."
Correa said that if he loses the election in February 2013, he will retire from public life.
"Personally, I've never been interested in power, but such unjust situations as socially economic poverty in Ecuador can only be repaired by political power.
My political movement believed that it was I who guaranteed this likely victory, so we must accept this responsibility," he said.
"If I win, it would be my last presidential term, and then I would leave politics.
If we lose, I'm in for the same.
I have already made up my mind," he said.
Correa also mentioned a new medical treatment for Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez in Cuba.
"I've just spoken to Venezuelan Vice President Nicolás Maduro, who says that President Chávez left for a planned routine treatment and his return to Cuba was expected after the campaign ended.
This is not a relapse in the health of the president," he explained.
The head of the Ecuadorian state today attended the sixth summit of the heads of state and government of the Union of Southaman Nations (Unasur), which was concluded by calls for greater regional integration to maintain development, equality and security.
AIDS victims are now the result of a late diagnosis
Fabrizi was 21 years old when the result of his test was confirmed: HIV positive.
"It was as if a bolt of lightning hit me," he tells me, recalling the moment of truth, which the doctor tried to "slighten" but, apparently, without success.
The boy kept it a secret from his family.
He decided to take his own sickness to his shoulders and began to inquire about it, with such dedication that he had already celebrated his 43rd birthday.
It is undoubtedly one of the most hitherst patients of the HIV Unit at the Civil Hospital in Guadalajara (HCG), which he came to in 1994 after several battles with the disease.
Fabrizio has lived with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) since the age of 22, something unimaginable in the early 1990s, when there were a lot of doubt, few treatment options and a greater stigma.
At the time, even the director of the Clinic of the Mexican Institute of Social Security Institute (IMSS) did not say goodbye to him "because he had a cut-up."
Back then, having AIDS was synonymous with death.
Now it is possible to survive with this syndrome and fully live.
However, there are a lot of people who are unaware of their illness and only come when the virus caused the body to be devastated and the immune system has emitted them, and then they become victims of accidental infections.
31 years since AIDS, or at least from the first documented cases, "it has been a great success for the patient's life expectancy, who will begin treatment in a timely and appropriate manner, is exactly the same as for healthy people," said Jaime Andime Andrade Villanueva, head of the HIV Civil Hospital in Guadalajara Civil Hospital, noting that this information was confirmed in April this year in a prestigious scientific publication.
HIV/AIDS addenict and specialist Andrade Villanueva explained that scientists have come to the conclusion that since 2008 AIDS is not a death sentence, but that the duration of survival and full-fledged life depends on the degree of disability of the immune system of patients diagnosed with the disease, better off being those who do not use drugs: people with 200 CD4 cells can live up to 30 years and people with 500 CD4 cells to 50 years.
Simply put, this means that someone who is diagnosed with HIV at the age of 25 can, according to these findings, "at to live without problems until 75 years old," the doctor explained in an interview.
To highlight this progress, it is worth recalling that the average life expectancy of Mexicans is now 76 years.
Although the mortality rate has decreased significantly in recent years, and in the case of Mexico, the number of people who died of AIDS has fallen from 6,678 in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (UNAIDS's Joint Programbook for the United Nations Joint Programme for HIV/AIDS), it is also true that 60 percent of patients have died since AIDS was discovered, according to national statistics.
255 people died in the state of Jalisco alone in 2011 and so far in 187 this year. However, since 2005, universal access to antiretrovirals has been ensured.
- Why do people continue to die from the disease?
- "It seems to me that the problem is not in the possibilities of access to treatment.
That's how I see it, this is how it happens in our hospital.
For at least the last 12 years, we have not exhausted the supply of pharmaceuticals. The problem is that patients come at a very advanced stage because they do not know the state of the disease, or in the late stages of the disease."
Adds a convincing figure: "Nine out of ten patients come when an associated infection already occurs. The only thing to do is to be done in order to be able to make a greater impact on the overall mortality, the disease is to be diagnosed earlier, and therefore, we need to offer large-scale tests to identify the disease to all those who ask for it."
In his proposal, he agrees specialists and officials from the AIDS Prevention Council in the state of Jalisco, as well as patients such as Fabrizio, who came to have tests done at a private laboratory simply because his friend did it, and despite his low age, AIDS already erupted in him and also suffered from Kaposi's sarcoma, a cancer that is one of the usual complications.
"Everything changes when you know you have AIDS.
Some think they're going to die and they don't want to know anything else.
"If I'm going to die, I'd rather have a three-week trip," they say, but that's not my case.
Change was for the better, healthy, I exercise, I take the medication."
To this day, his parents only know that he suffered from cancer.
"I live a normal life like anyone.
I work, I have a lot of activities, I travel, I lead an active sex life, but responsibly, I look out for myself and the other person," says Fabrizio, who has accepted the call to share his experience with the daily MILENIO JALISCO to motivate those who are afraid with his testimony as part of World AIDS Day today.
"Let them have the tests done. If they've taken a risk, let them know as soon as possible, if they're HIV-positive, it's better, and if they've been diagnosed, no matter how aware they can live like anyone else if they're responsible."
This message of his summarizes the slogan of the Battle of AIDS this year.
Condoms behind the counter
There is a large gap among health programmes and ordinary citizens, said Ricardo Salazar, a guadalajar journalist who is researching information about the HIV virus.
And the biggest gaps are in prevention.
In the places dedicated to this task "it has actually been increased by the distribution of condoms, they used to give us one or two, today they give us packages and hundreds of condoms, which is very good, but there are still people who do not have access to condoms," he said.
Among the most susceptible to new diseases are adolescents.
"What do you want?" is the common question of irony and judging from social workers, school consultants, pharmacy staffers and medical staff who do to avoid teenagers, says the reporter.
He proposed to change this ineffective distribution. Let condoms not just be behind the shelves, but let the hundred be found in the dispensaries in the public toilets, in places where the young often go.
"It's not promiscuous support.
Nor is it about "paying for beer and a motel" as Governor Emilio González responded to the question of whether he would agree to distribute condoms in his district.
There is no suchsexuality. It is best to make condoms available to those who already lead sex life," he noted.
Key Numbers in the state of Jalisco
There were 13,435 cases (12,158 AIDS and 1,317 HIV cases).
This state of affairs in Mexico marks fourth place in new and identified cases of AIDS and 13th place in relation to HIV.
92% of the diseases are sexual, 6% blood route y 2% perinatal.
It is estimated that about 50,000 people can live with HIV, as there are four to five people in one registered case who are unaware of the disease.
The judgment approved by the U.S. Court of Appeal, which does not recognise the restructuring of Grupo Vitro's debt set by its bankruptcy in Mexico, gives a detrimental precedent for any national enterprise with branches in the neighbouring country and solvency problems.
So it seems that the restructuring procedures for firms that are allowed by Mexican law do not apply in the country of stripe and stars, despite international agreements.
The approval of the verdict delivered on June 15 last year by Judge Harlin Hash at the North Texas District Court of the North Texas in practice leaves Mexican companies in practice without defending against the possibility of confiscating their property on the other side of the river el Bravo.
However, the ruling opens the door to the main Mexican glass manufacturer to the U.S. Supreme Court, appealing against three irregularities.
As a preliminary point, while the judge of this case claims that creditors are to be governed by the United States Insolvency Act, the Fifth District Court of the Fifth District, based in New Orleans, says the main course of action is to be established by bankruptcy proceedings in Mexico.
First, this would point to the ignorance of international procedural cooperation in cases of insolvency of multinational enterprises.
In essence, a model law was created to this end, a model law for the unification of international trade law, which determines the American Law Institute as an arbitrator.
Secondly, the judgment provides that, without the vote of the branches from the internal company structure, where Vitro's debt to branches is recognised, the required majority would not be achieved to approve the restructuring.
However, this option is allowed by Mexican law.
The fact is that the Vitro case was not the first in which this scheme was adopted.
There are half a dozen examples like Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, for which the Federal Bankruptcy Institute was responsible for.
In addition, it is true that even after the members' votes were subtracted, the creditors - who were against Vitro in court in the United States, i.e. "supů" funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited - would not reach the majority.
They would reach about 45 percent to 37 in the vote.
This figure is not taken into account by the Court of Appeal.
From another point of view, the court blames Vitro for the difficult situation it has faced since 2008 - against the backdrop of a serious economic crisis that struck the United States.
Meanwhile, the family firm Gonzáleze Sady will file an appeal for reconsideration directly before the Court of Appeal to have the assessment carried out in full attendance, i.e. with the participation of five judges, because they initially voted only three.
If he fails here, he will seek a revision of the process by the higher instance, in this case the Supreme Court of the United States.
What is serious about the case is that the court omitted a document sent by the Mexican Government as an amicus curiae unit, in which Vitro's approach under the Insolvency Act is detailed, in which it is pointed out that the company has made it easier for itself to lean on the agreements signed by the two countries to confront the law with Chapter 15 of the United States Insolvency Act.
Moreover, it points out that the country has submitted to the principles of the United Nations Commission for International Trade, i.e. the rules for international insolvency cases that guarantee equality for debtors and creditors alike.
The impact on both sides: the punishment for both Vitro and the state.
Overall rating
Unnoticed, a criminal complaint by the Mexican aviation union polled on the table for several months against the former owner of Gastón Azcárrog, who had been accused of fraudulent conduct, and the vessel had already overflowed, according to the pilots' union.
The institute, headed by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau, has just filed a lawsuit against the National Banking Commission and the Securities Commission, which he accuses of obstruction of justice.
According to the Authority, the Audit Office systematically refused to report to the General Prosecutor's Office of the Republic of the transaction made by that entrepreneur, in which he selected 198 million pesos from the IXE fideicomis from F/589 on behalf of the Mexican Aviation Society.
The funds were most likely directed towards the purchase of shares in the Professional Hotel Management (Administrayer Profesional de Hoteles).
As is well known, Azcárraga Andrade is the majority shareholder of the Posadas hotel chain.
The siege of Dragon Marta
The Universidad de Caribe siteau de Caribe met over the weekend with a group of domestic and foreign environmentalists, academics, entrepreneurs, and ordinary citizens who approved the formation of the association, to prevent the opening of the Chinese Dragon Marta in Kankún.
We are speaking, as we know, a huge commercial and distribution centre with "a country with a large wall" focused on Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean, which would include a residential zone for employees from 150 companies at the bottom.
Earlier, the Canacintra (Cámara Nacional de la Industria de Transformación) was able to unify the governors of the southeastern zone to oppose a monumental site that would partly devastate protected areas and which represents the origin of all resistance to industry.
End of the matter with the ACTA
The Senate's request, which was not taken into account by the government, which required explanations of the conditions and circumstances under which the Mexican ambassador signed the Trade Against Counterfeiting Agreement in Japan, known as ACTA, was lost in topicality, according to the Mexican Institute of Industry and Lamb.
As is well known, this was despite the fact that the Board itself ruled out the possibility of treating it as a threat to the freedom of expression on social networks.
Homex in the long term
In an attempt to repay long-term debts and not to influence the short-term ones, the developer Homex is giving investment certificates worth 500 million pesos to the market.
This series is the first of four identical ones to offer interest repayment every 28 days.
It is born Competival
The merger of leading companies in information technology such as NYCE, e-Quálity and Kernet was born with a trade name Competival, an association to which will be the market for software services in Central and South America.
Investing in the business will exceed $1.5 billion.
Héctor "Hetin" Reyes: "Bassball was my life"
The basketball world-trestler Héctor "Hetin" Reyes has been associated with this hall sport for more than 60 years and has traveled the world through it.
Few people in Puerto Rico have as many memories of the history of local basketball as Héctor "Hetin" Reyes has.
Reyes was caught up in the 2008 wheelchair with a brain stroke, passionate about the sport for over the age of 60, whether as a younger category player, national basketball player BSN, owner and coach of the Vaqueros de Bayamón team in the National Basketball League, or the president of the Puerto Rico Basketball Federation.
"I have held a lot of roles in basketball during my life, including several simultaneous times, as when I was president of the BSN National League, the general manager of the national team and the chairman of the federation," Reyes recalled during a visit to Primera Hora's newspaper reporters at his home in Bayamon, home with Isabel for more than 50 years with Isabel.
"Basketball was my life."
Reyes is not exaggerating in his claim.
The walls of his house, which are almost all decorated with pictures and souvenirs from his long career, testify to that.
Bayamón in the Heart
With the greatest reach of all, he guards those who recall his stint at the Vaqueros ticket from the mid-1950s, where he was a player until 1982, when he also celebrated 15 years as co-owner or team owner.
"That was my best years, which I enjoyed the most, because I had the opportunity to participate in eight championships with the team los Vaqueros since 1967, whether as the owner, co-owner or coach.
It was a series of successful years, including five championships held from 1971 to 1975.
And then I said goodbye to one of the championships - in 1981, when Jerome Mincy made his BSN debut.
That's when the team was taken over by "Cuco" Ortiz, who was an excellent leader," said Reyes.
"I remember that Gene Bartow, who was previously a coach here and was at the Alabama University in Birmingham at the time, said to me, "I have a strap, a two-metre-long player for you.
You want it?"
And that was the start of Mincy, one of the best players Puerto Rico had ever had.
Bartow then recommended quarterback Raymond Gausse, who became a member of the team and one of our top scorers.
I remember he said that if Mincy brought Bayamon a victory in the Championship, he would then contribute to the next one.
He enjoyed the championship, when the Vaqueros draws played by Gausse, but only at a distance, having already served as president of the basketball federation in 1988.
At that time, he wanted to devote himself to his functions and enjoy Mincy's position in the national team.
"I remember the first time we beat the United States in the qualifying Olympic match in Mexico in 1989.
Then came the World Championships in 1990, where we finished fourth, but we should have had the bronze not if it wasn't for the Canadian referee who let us repeat the final throw," Reyes said.
Is the 1990 World Cup team the best national team you've ever seen?
He is among the best, as is the one who defeated the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympics.
But my favorite was the national team in the Pan American Games in Cuba in 1991, when we won the gold and we blew the United States team that was pretty much like the one that blew out our World Cup bronze.
That team had not only Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculina" (Ortiz), but there were also youngsters (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter, the León brothers (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who could not be on the team in 1990 due to a knee injury.
The team, which may not have had a perfect composition but managed to win us a gold medal and bring great joy, was the team from the Olympic qualifying in 1995 in Neuquén, Argentina.
With the players on the roster, such as "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and junior player Rolando Hourruitiner, who replaced the players eliminated due to a scuffle in the Mar de Plata Panamerican Games, we won the gold despite all the forecasts.
What was the Puerto Rico's best player?
That was, without any doubt, Piculin Ortiz.
His numbers from international tournaments are impressive.
None of Puerto Rico's achieved such results at this level as Piculín.
Not to mention his tenure in the various leagues where he played.
Who was the best Puerto Rican coach?
That's very hard.
We had a very good generation that includes Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau and Armandito Torres.
Of the young, I like the work of Leo Arill very much.
Which of your success in the federation do you consider to be the greatest?
That I was part of the most famous national team era from 1988 to 1995 and that in the early 1990s the national league BSN had to the national league in one season to 17 teams.
What'd you get to prove?
There were things I wanted to introduce as a breakdown of youth categories by region.
For example, the Ponce guys would only play in their area and compete with teams from other parts of the island only in the national play-offs.
Now the kids travel a lot and play too many matches, which is not necessary.
I also see the benefits in the compulsory certificates and courses for coaches, the assistants of the referees and the referees.
I'm glad.
What are you doing now?
I listen most to music, watch YouTube videos with music from my time, enjoy my grandchild and sometimes go to basketball games.
And, of course, I enjoy the company of my wife Isabel, who has always been by my side.
Actor Larry Hagman dies
Larry Hagman, who was born in Forth Worth, Texas, on September 21, 1931, became world-leading John Ross Ewing, better known as "J.R." in the television series Dallas, in which he embodied a man who acted recklessly and was insidious and manipulative.
Larry Hagman, whose role as the ferocious oil tycoon j.R. Ewing in the television series Dallas became a symbol of a llach in the 1980s, has died.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned this year as J.R. in the new Dallas series, died on Friday afternoon for complications associated with cancer-related complications, according to the family's official announcement, Associated Press.
"Larry returned to his beloved hometown of Dallas, where he played again the iconic role he liked best," his family said.
Larry's family and his closest friends were with him in Dallas for Thanksgiving.
"Linda Gray, who was a representative of his wife in both the original and the new series, was with Hagman the moment he died in Dallas Hospital," her agent, Jeffrey Lane, announced.
He brought joy to all he knew.
"He was creative, generous, funny, kind, kind and talented, and I'd be terribly fond of him.
He was unique and lived his life to the fullest," Linda Gray said in the announcement.
Hagman was diagnosed with liver cirrhosis in 1992, and he admitted to drinking a lot for years.
In 1995, a malignant tumor was found on his liver and Hagman underwent a transplant.
The years before the Dallas airing, Hagman made himself famous on television as a decent guy in the lightweight comedy I Dream of Jeannie aired by NBC from 1965 to 1970.
Here he played the character of Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life changes when he meets an attractive girl (jin), played by Barbara Eden, and takes her to her home to live together.
He was also the protagonist in two comedies that were broadcast only briefly, namely The Good Life (NBC, 1971-72) and Here We Go Again (ABC, 1973).
His appearances in the films included roles that were well received by the critics: The Group, Harry and Tonto and Primary Colors.
But it was Hangman's masterpiece in the form of the incredibly repulsive J.R., who took him to the starling peak.
CBS's drama series about the Ewings and other personalities around them aired from April 1978 to May 1991.
The promotional slogan "Who shot Djaeara?" which was supposed to raise expectations about a work of emotion, when Hangman's character is almost murdered, has caused not only a tremendous array of speculation from viewers around the world, but also risking millions of dollars in the Mottle Offices.
This also helped this episode to reach the ratings record.
The November episode of 1980, in which the response was revealed, was watched by an average of 41 million television viewers, making Dallas the second most-watched entertainment programme in history after the end of the 1985 MASH series, which was watched by 50 million viewers.
J.R. was shot at by his sister-in-law Kristin (and played by Mary Crosby).
Kristin and J.R. got pregnant, who then threatened to call her a prostitute if she didn't leave town. But there were others who had reason to attack him.
Hagman played Ewing, a greedy greedy-monger with a charismatic smile: a wry businessman and unfaithful husband who tried to get his wife, Sue Ellen (Linda Gray), who was an alcoholic, to be put in rehab.
"I know what I want J.R. to have a tombstone on the tombstone," Hagman said in 1988.
It should be: "Here lies the honorary citizen J.R. Ewing."
This is the only thing that didn't work out.
Victoria Principal, who played in the original series, remembered Hagman on Friday as someone who was "great on and out of the screen."
It is unforgettable and irreplaceable for the millions of admirers in the world and in the hearts of all of us who have been so lucky to know and love him.
Ten episodes of the new Dallas series aired to TNT a few months ago with great success.
"The shooting of five episodes of the second series has already been completed and the sixth one was just being filmed," the TV station reported.
Immediately after Hangman's death, there was no statement from Warner or TNT about how the series would proceed.
A native of Fort Worth, Texas, he was the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who starred in classic works such as South Pacific and Peter Pan.
Mary Martin was a very young girl when she gave birth to Larry, whose father was her husband, the lawyer Ben Hagman, in 1931.
In the early 1950s, Larry tried his luck on the theatrical scenes in New York and then served in the Air Force in England from 1952 to 1956.
There he met the young Swedish designer Maj Axelsson, whom he married.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and lived for a long time in Malibu, California, where many celebrities reside.
In 2001, he published the autobiographical book Hello Darlin': Tall: Tall: My Life.
"I didn't give in anything I knew could hurt anyone or harm them in any way," he told the Prensa Asociada news agency at the time.
After a liver transplant, he turned to promoting organ donation and volunteered at the hospital to help with timid patients.
"I advise them, I encourage them to give you the courage to meet with them when they have surgery and then," he said in 1996.
I'm trying to give them a comfort in the sense of 'don't worry, it'll be a bit awkward for a while, but you'll be healthy'.
He was also an anti-smoking activist and participated in various campaigns.
The course begins, examining the "end of the world"
Every week, students explore apocalyptic themes like nuclear warfare, zombies, viruses and bacteria, and global warming.
When the professor of religion, Stuart Charmé, decided to make this semester a course at the end of the world, he knew it was an irresistible lure: The end of the "long number" of the Mayan calendar, which is due to come on December 21, many people seized as evidence that the end of the world was coming.
But Charmé had no idea what awaited him in the next few months: Catastrophic Hurricane Sandy, the budget gap some call the "Dlur Armageddon," and the growing conflict that Israel is drawn to, a place in which, according to the theorists of the end of the world, the Apocalypse will begin.
"I didn't realize this was going to be the most ancalyptic semester he's ever been," Charmé told students at the University of Camden, New Jersey, this week.
When you discuss what's going on in the world today, like we have 30 days to go, it's a really good time.
And remember, the bad means good for the apocalyptically minded.
And he's not the only professor who offers courses on the "world end" this semester, which is theoretically the last in history.
At Temple University, Assistant Professor Barry Vacker is hosting a "Finitus, Culture and the End of the World" course.
Every week, students explore apocalyptic themes like nuclear warfare, zombies, viruses and bacteria, and global warming.
"We discuss why these ideas are expanding with time," he says, and as they offer hypothetical scenarios that govern certain human behavior.
For example, if nuclear material reaches the hands of terrorists, war can break out.
This month, students are analyzing films with apocalyptic themes and examining how they differ from real-life examples.
"I tried to inform students of what is possible, likely, believable and impossible," says Vacker.
On the main campus of the State University of Pennsylvania, Latin history professor Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an assistant professor of arts and anthropology, were brought together to stage a course with the simple title The End of the World.
"We don't include "2012" because we always count on the possibility of organizing a course again if the world doesn't end," said Restall.
Despite the "sending destruction," students must study, create projects and take final exams.
At Penn State, the final exam will be held on the eve of the Apocalypse, which gives students no choice but to work "unwit until the evening of the anticipated end of the world," Restall said.
The courses have become quite popular.
"He stretched into two hours," Restall said of his course for high-rar-an-emitting students who had signed up for the 35th.
Weeks and weeks before the start of the semester, we received e-mails asking if there was still a place.
Students themselves assure that the course is one of the most interesting.
"I find it fascinating to see what people do to comfort themselves," 23-year-old Bridgid Robinson, a student of religion and sociology at Haddonfield in New Jersey, said at Rutgers University in Camden.
And so, apocalyptic, secular, or religious sentences is just a matter of comfort or its absence.
Will Wekesa, a 25-year-old psychology and nursing student, said he'd seen all the apocalyptic films.
"I've never heard of an hour in which it could be taught," he said.
"I'm enjoying it."
But no interviewed student, let alone a professor, said he believed he was on the date of the end of December 21.
"Our first project was about the Mayan prediction and we will in some ways refute it," said Julie Zeglen, a 21-year-old senior student at Temple University of West Chester.
"Mayans have never predicted the end of the world; it's just a key point on the calendar," Restall said.
But he added that there is an apocalyptic anxiety in Western culture, reaching back several centuries, which people respond to changes in their surroundings with predictions of the end of the world.
The flour about this speculation has been caused by the internet.
"Elsewhere people don't think about it," he said.
This is the vast majority in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at La Salle University, who lectures in the Philippines this year, when asked if he knew about a "ending world" course there, he responded quickly.
"The Phippines are not at the end of the world," he wrote, indicating an exemption from the supreme office.
We have a pardon from the Pope.
Reptall noted that over the years, there had been talk of many days of the last trial, and said that if nothing happened on December 21, "people will immediately start thinking about the next date" or philosophize that December 21 was the start of the seven-year period at the end of which the world would perish.
The date will be taken lightly by students and professors alike.
Several said they intended to go to the "ending of the world" festivities.
"I'll probably call some of my friends to laugh together," explained Samira Ford, a 20-year-old communications student.
