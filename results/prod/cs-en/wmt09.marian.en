Prague Stock Exchange plummeting to the bottom at the end of trading
After a sharp slump in the morning, the Prague Stock Exchange corrected the losses.
Transactions with CEZ shares amounted to almost half of the daily daily trade.
The Prague Stock Exchange followed up its Monday slump right from the start of trading on Tuesday, falling by almost six percent.
This time, the decline is due to a drop in shares on Wall Street.
Here, too, the market reaction to the outcome of the U.S. House of Representatives vote is showing itself, which has refused to support a plan to stabilise the country's financial sector.
Share fall in Asia
Shares in Asia's stock exchanges suffered a dramatic fall on Tuesday, although the indexes eventually erased some of the losses during the day.
The Hang Seng stock exchange index in Hong Kong was off nearly four percent in the course of trading, but later erased some of its losses and the downturn reduced to around 2.5 percent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises index, which tracks the Chinese stock market movements in Hong Kong, fell 3.8 percent, while markets were closed in Shanghai.
Stocks on the Sydney stock market were down more than five percent, but eventually fell to 4.3 percent.
The Taiwan stock exchange fell 3.6 percent, according to the country's index.
"The timing of the rescue operation in the US is uncertain and will affect financial markets worldwide," noted the head of Hong Kong's monetary policy office, Joseph Yam.
Hong Kong, although part of China, sets monetary policy on its own, without depending on China's central bank.
Hong Kong's interest rates are at the same level as the United States.
According to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, US lawmakers should return to negotiations and approve the proposal to support the financial system.
Otherwise, he said, there is a risk that other countries will feel the effects.
Blood baths of American shares
The U.S. House of Representatives on Monday rejected a plan to support the financial system, which was to be spent up to $700 billion (nearly $12 trillion).
Lawmakers thus ignored President George Bush's call to support the plan.
According to Bush, the plan would address the root causes of the financial crisis and help stabilise the entire economy.
US stocks suffered a bloodbath on Monday, and major stock indexes recorded their biggest fall in more than 20 years.
The Dow Jones index fell by nearly seven percent, and a similar fall was last seen in 1987.
The index had been falling before the vote, but once it was revealed that the bill had failed in the House, the index was in free fall.
Congress concedes: US government may pump $700 billion into banks
The US Congress's top leaders and the government of President George W. Bush have agreed on a broader form of financial assistance agreement for the US financial system.
It will be voted on at the beginning of next week.
US lawmakers have made a breakthrough in talks to approve a rescue plan in the form of financial assistance for the US financial system of $700 billion (approximately $12 trillion).
However, it is not yet won.
Indeed, congressmen must complete some details of the agreement before they can release and vote on the final form of the law.
The support plan for the financial system will be discussed at the House of Representatives on Monday.
On Sunday, the chairman of the House Committee on Banking and Financial Services, Barney Frank, told Reuters.
The Senate said, the plan could probably be voted on on Wednesday at the earliest.
According to economists, the announcement that the rescue plan will be approved should be the first major psychological factor for a recovery in financial markets.
However, thereafter, it will be "slicensed" by the complexity of the mechanisms to help markets achieve in practice.
Paulson: The plan must be effective
"We've made great progress.
We have solved our differences of opinion on what the shape of the package to stabilise the market should look like," Democrat Nancy Pelosi told Bloomberg.
According to her, the final vote could be reached later on Sunday.
Representatives of lawmakers met with U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson on Sunday to give the final shape to the government fund.
This should buy back from financial corporation non-sale mortgage assets that pull financial firms into heavy losses and threaten the stability of the whole system.
"We are on the verge of a definitive plan agreement that will work and must also be effective in the market.
We need to continue the recovery plan, but I think we're there," Paulson said.
Signal for Asian trading
The global financial crisis is hitting stock markets, which are falling sharply.
According to the non-Ahada Democratic Senator Harry Reid, legislators are thus trying to reach a final agreement in Congress on Sunday.
Indeed, they want to reassure investors before trading in Asian financial markets, which are the first in the time zone, where Congress's decision could affect Monday's trading.
But it is not yet clear with certainty when the two chambers of the US Congress will vote on the bill, nor whether they cannot strangle the negotiations at the last minute on a problem.
Lawmakers hope it will be approved in the next few days.
However, the law will still undergo a number of changes.
The total amount to be aided by the system is to be divided into two parts.
The initial $350 billion is to be available as soon as possible, as requested by President George Bush.
But Congress may block the release of the remaining amount if it is under the impression that the program is not fulfilling its function, in a succession of an additional $100 billion and later a final $350 billion.
Bush praised the progress in negotiations
While the president may veto this decision, Congress may override his veto.
Despite these changes, however, the basic idea behind the program, which was to obtain funds to buy back bad mortgage securities, the value of which has fallen because hundreds of thousands of Americans are unable to repay their mortgages, has remained intact.
"We've worked out everything.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on the bill on Sunday and the Senate on Monday," said Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
US President Bush is also satisfied with the progress in the negotiations.
His spokesman, Tony Fratto, said that Bush was satisfied with Saturday's progress and appreciated "an embroar of the bajorous effort to stabilise our financial markets and protect our economy."
Restrictions of golden parachutes
Senate Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd, the head of negotiator, said lawmakers had agreed to a liability for the money program, protecting taxpayers from losses, closing concessions, timing the financing of the plan.
The new law is also intended to limit the so-called golden parachutes for the directors of the company participating in the programme and is setting up a committee to supervise the fund.
This should be run by the Treasury Department.
"We have worked very hard at this and have made great progress towards an agreement that will work and be useful for the market and for all Americans," said Paulson.
The plan also provides for help for homeowners who have trouble repaying.
The government should negotiate new repayments for the mortgages it will buy in order to reduce the monthly cost of instalments for borrowers and allow them to keep their houses.
Marek: Psychological help
The proposed plan is a good idea, according to Patria Finance's chief economist David Mark, but it will be very difficult to implement.
"And that's because it is not known by what mechanism and at what cost the problem assets will be purchased.
This will be decisive for how the financial sector and the government will split the losses between them," Marek told iHNed.cz this week.
Whether the plan will be approved now or at the start of next week is not all that important, according to Mark.
"Morse, it is more important that this week the conwrongresmen agree that they support the plan and that they will sanction it as soon as possible.
The psychological importance of the agreement on the fact that the approval will take place is the most important thing at the moment," Marek stressed.
The triumph of right-wing populists in Austria, with a combined 29 percent
The appreciable weakening of the two parties of the previous grand coalition and the significant strengthening of the right-wing populist parties were brought about by the early parliamentary elections in Austria on Sunday, according to the first preliminary results.
The Austrian People's Party (ÖVP) suffered particularly strong losses, with the position of the current president, Wilhelm Molterer, shaking gravely.
Conversely, the election leader of the Union for the Future of Austria (BZÖ), Carinthian Governor Jörg Haider is preparing a triumphant return to national politics.
According to preliminary results, the country's Social Democracy (SPÖ) remains the strongest party in the country, with 29.8 percent of the vote, but it loses 5.5 percent of the vote against the latest 2006 election.
Worse still, the ÖVP, which loses almost nine percent of the vote with 25.6 percent.
These are the worst results of both of these major parties in Austria's post-war history and, especially for the Peoples, who triggered the early elections, a literally disastrous result.
As recently as the beginning of July, when the ÖVP withdrew from the coalition, the People's Party had a significant lead in their preferences over the SPÖ.
But voters apparently punished them for letting the government fail.
Already in the first reactions to the results, speculation about the possible resignation of the party chairman and incumbent vice-chancellor Wilhelm Molterer.
Observers reckons that this could happen as early as Monday at a special meeting of the party's bureau.
Such a development would probably facilitate the path to the still most likely starting point from the election result, the renewal of the grand coalition of the SPÖ and the ÖVP.
However, given the strengthening of the two right-right populist parties - the Freedom Party (FPÖ), they received a preliminary 18 percent of the vote and the BZÖ eleven per cent of the vote - the Social Democrats also voiced concerns about the replay of the years in 1999, when the People's Party agreed with the populists (then the FPÖ was still united, and the BZÖ split from the BZÖ) in the joint government, which even raised sanctions from the European Union.
Haider is clearly betting on this development, having already said he was ready to work with any party and anticipate a return to Vienna for national politics.
The Green Party was still in the parliament, but it lost easily and fell among the Austrian political parties from third to fifth.
Neither of the other parties apparently surpassed the 4% threshold and made it to parliament.
A knife-edion fight: MP3 players against mobile phones.
We will advise you how to choose
While almost every mobile can play MP3 files, no MP3 player can make the phone call.
This makes it clear that it is better to buy just a phone.
Still, there are enough reasons to get a stand-alone player.
The choice depends entirely on the manner of use and the claims of the future owner.
It's probably hard to get a top-of-the-line, expensive record player to listen to the latest album Maxim Turbulenc.
On the one hand, such music products on LP records do not work and, in a qualitative point of view, there is no objective reason for this.
However, if you are at least tired of vinyl with art rock, jazz or blues on your shelves, you are probably at least dreaming of such a gramophone.
It's the same with the music on the road, that is, the music compressed, in simple terms - with music in MP3.
Here, too, there are price and quality categories.
For some, it may be unacceptable to spend eight thousand crowns on a player, just as a Pink Floyd fan is unlikely to bite the headphones for twenty crowns from the market.
Two extremes, with enough room to everyone.
The selection is wide.
It also decides the battery life
Some top-of-the-line music players can do much more than just play music, but what most of the phones can do.
No current device is as universal as the phone.
Alongside the primary functions, phone calls and texting, he can play music and video, record both, have a better one, the worse camera and maybe he can even navigate.
And taking into account smartphones and commuters, you'll also have a small computer in your pocket.
It's a little miracle, no refrigerator can grill, and no TV is photographing anything.
The versatility of mobile also brings drawbacks.
The more features you use on your mobile, the sooner the indicator on the display sends you to the charger.
And playing music is one of the biggest energy eaters.
Few mobile phones can play music for more than ten or twelve hours, usually much less.
In this respect, music players (specifically the simplest) are significantly more powerful.
For cheap mobiles, therefore, expect them not to play for more than a few hours.
If you call for it here and there again, get one more charger for work to be sure - this also applies to the more expensive devices.
You won't have this problem with MP3 players, even the worse ones last at least 9 hours of uninterrupted single-charged operation.
Another problem arises when recording music to your mobile.
Unfortunately, only a limited portion of the devices has a universal USB connector, and not every one can be directly connected to a computer without special software.
Of course, music can be uploaded directly to the memory card, but few card readers can handle the miniature memory cards used in mobile phones without reduction.
For players, with some exceptions (iPod), you do not need any special software.
Just fill the device with music via USB from the computer.
Most mobile and players already create a music library by themselves in line with the name of the artist, album title, genre or user reviews.
Some devices only display the tree structure of directories in the same way as the Windows Explorer, and some do both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smartphones with the operating system).
Players are easier to operate, mobile phones are more good at
When choosing a particular device, be particularly interested in the battery life, memory capacity, quality and sound output type and, of course, the comfort of the control.
If you are primarily a backdrop to music and if you only listen to it every day briefly on the tram, you only need any mobile phone that plays MP3.
Which is what almost any mobile phone can do.
You don't even have to watch much about what music formats your mobile or player can do.
MP3 can handle them all, and the vast majority of the music that reaches you will be in this format.
It is one of the most widely used and, in addition to it, the vast majority of devices can also master music in the WMA format.
Less occurs AAC (format used by Apple and its iPods).
Better mobiles also allow, for example, online music to be purchased.
Just visit the relevant operator's (or other provider) pages via the mobile internet and purchase the song or album.
This service could already be a strong argument for acquiring a music mobile.
Unfortunately, the operators' offer is poor and is usually limited to speed-tap-hanged radio hits.
Prices are also not the lowest.
However, it is generally assumed that it is this method of selling music (beit via GSM, internet or wireless internet) that this is the future upstarting the music industry.
Mobile most people carry around with each other at all times.
Whenever you want to listen to something, you find your mobile phone in your pocket, while the MP3 player lies forgotten at home.
However, it still depends on whether you always always carry headphones or at least wired hands-free.
If not, you can use an integrated speaker that almost every mobile phone has, but only a minimum of MP3 players.
Perhaps the biggest advantage of music mobile will be the price for many.
The cheapest ones normally cost under three thousand.
For three and four thousand crowns, you will already get a very decent walkman.
However, you will be usually limited to the absence of output to regular headphones.
The best and, technically, the most equipped phones, even with a 3.5 mm slar for regular headphones, cost up to fifteen thousand.
The advantage of players, among other things, is easy to operate.
The simplest - not necessarily the cheapest (see our selection) - players can be controlled by really everyone.
The minimal functionality, the similarity of the controls with the previously common cassette player or perhaps the gramophone is obvious.
There is no risk of collision in the form of an accidentally switched on mobile internet and then a giant account for data transfer.
What machine to reach
Even the cheapest mobiles (e.g. the Vodafone 527) usually have a slot for interchangeable memory cards (M2, microSD, etc.).
Even with the card, you can fit into two thousand crowns.
But beware.
Only 2 GB of maximum capacity is supported for basic models.
Only the most expensive ones can handle 8 GB of memory.
If you already have a mobile and want to buy a cheap MP3 player, reach for Cowon, Creativa, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or iriver.
Depending on the capacity (max. 2 GB), you do not have to spend more than £1,100.
If you are one of the more demanding listeners, should you rather reach for specialized mobile phones - Walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsungs).
These devices have separate control buttons for MP3 and the comfort of the operator is thus close to a stand-alone MP3 player.
The furthest is in the Sony Ericsson field, whose Walkman-series' phones have the same user interface as the self-sold MP3 players.
The same service and in the same price category up to four thousand crowns, but with a larger memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and battery life (truly 15 hours, up to 35 hours at the most), MP3 players will be taken away from the above-mentioned brands.
The first virtual operator will arrive in the Czech Republic this year.
Maybe
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is quite mature and our operators offer virtually all services as their partners in Western Europe.
Yet we are missing something here - a virtual operator that would make the classic ones cheaper.
He may not miss long.
We have written about the fact that Czech operators are among the most expensive in Europe at all, on Mobil.cz.
Indeed, this was confirmed by ČTÚ, which pointed out that the price of SMS is higher in our country than in the rest of the Union.
Following the European Commission's latest steps in the field of regulating roaming charges, this may be a paradoxical situation - for some customers of Czech mobile operators, SMS from abroad will be cheaper than at home.
How is it possible that prices in the Czech Republic are holding so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, there is no competition that really wants to get into a fight.
It may sound paradoxical, we have three mobile networks and penetrating to over 100%.
Mobile operators, on the other hand, like to be glad to say that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
In this, the chairman of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Authority (ČTÚ), Pavel Dvořák, often chipper, who has commented several times in the past that there is no place for another operator in the Czech Republic.
It is probably true that a classic operator with its own network does not seem to have much chance (after all, it would be hard to find frequencies anymore).
But there is another option - a virtual operator.
The entry of virtual operators into the mobile market brought about a significant price reduction, to which even classical operators then had to respond.
At the same time, before the entry of the pike like Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile, there were similar voices in the UK as in the UK.
But it turns out that the place for such operators is and can be really successful.
After all, we don't have to go too far for examples.
In February this year, we informed you about the launch of the virtual operator Mobilking in Poland.
In just half a year, the operator has managed to recruit more than 100,000 customers and become the country's fifth largest operator.
At the same time, the financial group Penta, which owns U:fona in the Czech Republic, is behind Mobilking.
The advantage of virtual operators is the ability to focus on a much more specific target group.
Indeed, they need far fewer customers to function effectively than a classic operator.
They do not entail the relatively high cost of the construction, operation and maintenance of the mobile network.
In the world, virtual operators tend to profile themselves as low-cost - offering cheap calls and SMS, but this is often counterbalanced by a shortfare service offer.
For example, Tesco Mobile in the UK offers SMS at least half as much cheaper as its competitors.
But, as the example of Mobile being Mobile was in Poland, the bet on the novel target audience can also be a pretty good move.
This operator focuses specifically on men.
"Carcise guys choose Mobilking - an operator they like and can trust," says David Seibertz CEO Mobile Entertainment Company, operating this virtual operator.
It is difficult to say if a similar concept could be caught up in our country.
Vodafone's press spokesperson Miroslav Čepický doubts: "The Czech market is relatively small for the segmental approach on which most virtual operators are based.
In addition, it is relatively saturated in terms of service offerings."
No chance in the Czech Republic, say mobile operators
But it seems almost certain that if there is a virtual mobile operator in the Czech Republic, it will not be Mobilking.
"We are talking about the expansion of this successful project, but in the Czech Republic the negotiations do not look too hopeful.
Rather, the Mobilking will be launched in other countries of our region," Jana Studničková, press spokesperson for the Penta financial group, told Mobil.cz in a telephone interview.
It has thus confirmed toil that the existing mobile operators in the Czech Republic are certainly not in favour of this idea.
Rather the opposite, they are trying to do everything they can to ensure that no potential competitor is created.
The interest in launching a virtual mobile operator has not been fabled for a long time by GTS Novera, which would like to take the next step to become a real competitor to Telefónica O2 in the corporate customer field.
"We have a great interest in offering not only fixed but mobile telecommunications services to our customers.
And the sooner, the better.
We have repeatedly discussed this possibility with all Czech mobile operators.
With some of them, we have already managed to move forward in the negotiations," says the group's press spokesperson, Pavel Kaidl.
So maybe there's a look on better days.
From the unofficial information, it seems that the first virtual operator should be looking forward to perhaps by the end of the year.
For now, however, its creation is accompanied by an impenetrable wall of silence.
"At the moment, we do not believe that there is room for the creation of a fully-fledged virtual operator on the Czech market.
The Czech market is very specific to other markets.
So far, no subject has approached us with a comprehensive and serious project in this area," Vlastimil Sršeň from the press department of Telefónica O2 said in his comments to Mobil.cz.
The specificity of the Czech market is also invoked by other operators.
T-Mobil's press spokesperson Martina Kemrová adds in a rare agreement with O2's comments: "We have not yet recorded any viable and mutually beneficial business project on which it would be possible to further build."
He adds: "It is difficult for a virtual operator to appear in the T-Mobile network by the end of the year.
At this point, we'd have to have a specific agreement on the table to think about this short term."
Vodafone is more likely to focus its attention on meeting the requirements of its own 3G licence.
Miroslav Čepický says: "By negotiations with potential virtual operators, we are open, especially in the area of burden and infrastructure sharing.
This is what we consider to be the most beneficial in terms of customers.
Vodafone's main strategy in this area is to find a partner to build a shared network for fast mobile internet."
Responsible authorities - with operators one hand
The approach of mobile operators is easy to understand, the entry of another operator would mean an increase in competition, leading to a fall in prices and thus a decline in their profits.
So why make the take-up easier for such a competitor?
The fact that when operators are at a point, they can pull together, is also evidenced by the tussle over the formation of the U:fona.
Perhaps the most pressure towards ČTÚ came at the time of the creation of U:fona from T-Mobile.
This is evidenced by publicly available information from the ČTÚ website.
But now it is U:fon who is useful as an argument for not letting the virtual operator in.
Martina Kemrová commented: "The competitive mobile market environment was recently exacerbated by the entry of a fourth mobile operator into the market.
Given the nature of the mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is obvious that the entry of another player would make high demands on him and, above all, his services."
However, given this approach by mobile operators, the sheer disinterest of the Czech regulators is a heating disinterest.
This is not just about the attitude of ČTÚ, which unfortunately does not have the power to intervene in competition in the Czech Republic - unlike the UK and other developed countries.
These are exclusively owned by the Office for the Protection of Competition (ÚOHS).
But he took his typical stance on the whole issue.
"A virtual operator's access to the mobile market would be possible after a contract between the mobile operator and the virtual operator to lease the necessary infrastructure were concluded.
No such contract has been concluded so far, as the offer of potential bidders was probably not interesting enough for the classical operators," Kristián Chalupa of the External Relations Department of the Office said in response to our inquiry.
The comments thus formulated will not be surprised by the representatives of the operators.
From an office to represent the interests of consumers and, among other things, to ensure that no one is to use their market position, it is more than a poem.
Especially when Kristián Chalupa adds: "Abroad, where virtual operators normally operate, we can see that their entry into the market has contributed to lower prices for mobile telephone services."
But apparently the pressure to function properly in the market environment and the decline in prices are not among the interests of the OBR.
In fact, the shocking thing about the case is the touching tingling of the three mobile operators, which stems from their reactions.
The question of whether this is really just a coincidence is entirely self-eminite.
Like the exact same price of petrol at petrol stations, it is surely just a coincidence and a tough competition.
"The Office did not find signs of anti-competitive conduct on this matter and therefore has no reason to intervene in any way.
None of the operators has a dominant position and therefore has no adequate increased responsibility for its market conduct.
The necessary tools for opening the mobile market for virtual operators are most likely missing from the telecommunications regulator," Chalupa said in his comments.
The interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of the many points of contention.
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets carried out by ČTÚ, according to which telecommunications is the only market in terms of competition.
In such a market, of course, none of the Czech operators have a dominant position.
But some legal experts offer a different perspective - the consent of the network operator is always needed to create a virtual operator.
And the mobile operator - quite logically, has a monopoly on its network.
So in a segment, it necessarily has to be dominant.
But even if we did not allow this argument, it should be minimally cautionary tale for the OBR that the three mobile operators are doing strikingly similarly.
At the same time, complaints from a number of interested parties (including the aforementioned GTS Novera) show that they face very similar obstacles when dealing with all operators.
The uproar of the responsibility at ČTÚ is then a rather common trick in telecommunications, with which the OHS hands off the matter.
We've met him in a few similar cases.
Unfortunately, until the recently adopted amendment to the Telecommunications Act, the extension of ČTÚ's powers to the field of competition in telecommunications failed to enforce, although a number of experts promised to improve the situation.
The representatives of the OHS must know this more than well, but apparently their interests are elsewhere.
It's all the while no one's looking
At the same time, the functioning of some pseudo-ovturtour operators, of which there are several in Czech mobile networks, remains unnoticed.
They are companies that issue their own price lists of mobile telephony services, but they are only partially public.
They are usually companies engaged in multilevel marketing.
The likes of Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others offer their own mobile phone services.
The price statements of these firms usually reach only the elect.
The charm lies in the fact that the company acts as a classic corporate customer to the operator, who orders a large number of SIM cards.
As a major customer, they will then receive special price (and other) offers.
The problem is that the terms and conditions of all Czech mobile operators forbale forbumbor such.
"If there were cases of which you are referring to, it could be a violation of the contractual terms that we would deal with and could result in the termination of cooperation with the company," Martina Kemrová replied to our question on the problem.
But it is quite unlikely that such activity would not be brought to accountable people from mobile operators.
Especially in the case of the three companies mentioned, there may be thousands of customers.
None of the operators is opending to do so.
They make significant profits from the activities of these firms, and yet - unlike the actual virtual operators - they do not threaten them with their own official marketing.
Miroslav Čepický draws attention to possible problems: "The law allows for similar speculation, however, the services of these companies are used by only a negligible percentage of customers.
In addition, they must accept that the SIM card on their phone is not in their name, so they cannot dispose of it fully as regular customers of mobile operators."
But that is what should be at least strange to ČTÚ.
In addition, another question is being raised for the OBR.
If mobile operators turn a blind eye to a similar procedure, why are they blocking the creation of a virtual operator?
It should be added that the OBR has relatively strong powers to expose such activity, and if it does not want to, it does not have to be content with the operators' explanation that they have no idea about this and their terms of trade prohibit it.
When we will not be the most expensive
As the text has already been mentioned several times in the text, the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market has brought about a noticeable drop in prices for services.
At the same time, in virtually all countries where virtual operators were created, classical operators sought to hinder their creation more or less.
The arguments used by them were virtually identical - too small, or perhaps too saturated, service quality problems, etc.
But it was in the developed countries that the regulators intervened at these moments, defending not the interests of mobile operators, but of their customers.
Whether by formal measures or informal pressure, they then achieved the fact that the first virtual operator was created and others packed on it.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulators are tossing the case around like a hot potato.
We cannot escape the impression from our experience that ambiguity in competencies is more than suited to them in these cases.
But let's not throw a gun in the toil.
If the behind-the-scenes information is correct and the virtual operator will really appear in our country soon, the Czech mobile market may be moving again.
If one of the operators admitted the creation of a virtual mobile operator, it will be difficult for the OBR to remain inert for refusing (discrimination) to other candidates.
And we might stop calling for more than in the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Choose the best
Listen to the four performances of the new version of the Czech national anthem.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek ceremonially presented new recordings of the state's national anthem Where My Home on the occasion of Czech Statehood.
The anthem was newly recorded by the orchestra of the National Theatre under the direction of Jiří Bělohlávka.
There are four versions available - with male or female solo singing, choral form and instrumental wording.
The singing was taken in by Kateřina Kněžínková and Adam Plachetka.
The authors of the anthem's modifications are Otakar Jeremiáš and Jaroslav Krček.
You can listen to all four versions on iHNed.cz.
Bělohlávek considers the Czech national song to be one of the most beautiful anthems.
Spearka has previously told Czech Radio that he deliberately chose to sing solo variants for the singing of the singers with young representative voices, which are distinctive and popular.
"From the beginning, I tried to make sure that they both, and then, at the choir, that they have a clear diction, that the text is well understood, to be judged," he said.
The Czech national anthem will celebrate its 175th anniversary next year.
The song Where My Home was first performed on the boards of the Estates Theatre in 1834 in the original Czech play Fidlovaček by Josef Kajetán Tyl, accompanied by music by František Škroup.
She gained popularity and people spontaneously embraced it.
The first verse of the song, after the creation of Czechoslovakia in 1918, became a natural part of the national anthem.
One of the seven national symbols remained after the creation of the independent Czech Republic.
What the "new" anthem is
Prague's public transport will also be on the chip for the first time on Wednesday
Wednesday, October 1, 2008, will go down in the history of the Prague Transport Company as the date on which the first passengers who will have an electronic coupon in their pocket instead of a paper ticket will take over.
This can be purchased at this point by roughly 100,000 people who own an Opencard.
Passengers can buy a 30-day and 90-day and annual coupon (which will apply from 1 January 2009 and have to be uploaded to their chip card in the Information and Workplaces of the Transport Company at the Muzeum, Můstek, Nádraží Holešovice, Anděl, Roztyly, Letňany, Kobylisy, Rajská zahrada, Kačerov and Luka.
Coupons can also be bought over the internet on the Transport Company's website www.dpp.cz since yesterday.
The service was used by over four hundred customers by the afternoon.
Those who start using the online store can definitely forget about the outpost windows at the metro stations, where they still have to regularly stand in long queues for paper tickets.
They buy the coupon over the internet and upload it to their Opencard in one of the 13 branches of the Municipal Library.
"In these places, passengers have a counter with trained service to help those interested with internet purchases and also uploaded a purchased coupon to their card," said project spokesman Martin Opatrný.
In addition to libraries, it will also be possible to upload electronic coupons to Opencard in self-service machines, which are mounted in several metro vestibules.
What do machines like that look like?
They are red, they resemble ticket markers and passengers may have already noticed them at the Roztyly, Budějovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská metro stations.
"There are now five of them in the city, but there should be eighty by the end of the year," Cautious said.
The coupon checks the driver's seat
The operation of the vending machines that will start operating tomorrow is simple.
Just put the Opencard chip card in them and the previously paid coupon will be uploaded to it.
Electronic coupons from tomorrow are valid not only in the capital, but also in its surroundings.
That is, on suburban trains and bus lines with the number 300 to 499, which mainly travel to the capital by residents of Central Bohemian municipalities.
"On the trains placed in the Prague Integrated Transport, the conductors are equipped with card readers to determine the time and band validity of coupons," explained ticket check Filip Drápal from the organization Ropid, which assembles the timetables of the Prague public transport.
Suburban buses have card readers built into the driver's ticket office.
When boarding, it is therefore necessary not only to show the chip card to the driver, but it is also necessary to attach the Opencard to the designated place on the side of the ticket office.
This will check the validity of the uploaded coupons.
"If a passenger needs to verify the validity of the uploaded coupons, there is nothing easier than to ask the driver for this information," Drápal said.
Passengers who do not take commuter buses and will not remember when their coupon expires can go back to the self-service machines, where the coupons are recorded on the card.
Here, the validity of their documents will be displayed on the device's display.
Sudetenland wanted a referendum after the US
In 1945, the Sudeten Germans asked for the inclusion of the Sumava in the United States.
This follows from a letter that is stored in the collections of the South Bohemian Scientific Library.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we want to live at least under the patronage of the United States of America.
With such a wish, some groups of Sudeten Germans were reportedly turning to the President of the United States in 1945.
This is the follow-up, among other things, from a letter preserved in a private archive and is now kept in the collections of the South Bohemian Scientific Library.
The Germans from Český Krumlov are asking in a letter from the US president not to allow the return of the "Sumava country" - taken by Hitler on the basis of the Munich Agreement - back to Czechoslovakia.
"We have understood the situation correctly and want to be really sure of the words that the American troops come to German territory not as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators," the letter, signed in the words "People to whom the fate of Sumava is at his heart" reads.
Because joining Czechoslovakia supposedly gives the Sudeten Germans hope only of brutality, recklessness, misunderstanding, oppression and slavery, the authors of the letter to the US president to take over the Protectorate for the current and eternity over the Shumava.
"We cannot believe that, regardless of the opinion of a quarter of a million people, you would admit this territory to a state to us a foreign state who oppresses and refutes minorities and nothing, has contributed nothing to the Allies' victory," the letter reads.
The reason why the authors cannot sign is allegedly the fear of the vindictiveness of the "Czech oppressors."
If the US president were to doubt the sentenced to the Germans of Sumava, it was enough for him to hold a referendum in the Šumava County country about whether its people wanted to become part of the US or live under the patronage of the United States.
Although the text of the letter may sound a little naive in today's knowledge of post-war history, according to some witnesses, it appropriately illustrates the expectations of the Sudeten Germans at the time.
Although the Czech Germans had to at least suspect that this would be about their expulsion from the republic, few of them even admitted such a possibility.
Some expected the United States and the UK to negotiate a kind of autonomy for the Sudetenland.
Others believed they would simply stay in Czechoslovakia.
This is also confirmed by the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in České Budějovice.
He was during the war as a Budweiser German deployed to the Navy in the Baltic.
When he was captured at the end of the war by the British and placed in a prison camp in Holstein, dozens of other Czech Germans went to him to teach them Czech.
"They believed that when they came home, they would need Czech," Chalupa said.
None of the German prisoners living in Czechoslovakia before the war, according to him, counted on the fact that he would be relegated from the republic on the basis of the Beneš decrees.
You don't think - you'll pay!
Emotional campaign to attack drivers
The most expensive event focused on road safety in Czech history.
Even so, one could characterize the emotional media campaign that the Ministry of Transport intends to launch on Wednesday.
The office of Minister Aleš Řebíček promises from her that he will discourage the driver from behaving at the wheel.
The $150 million campaign will appear on television, radio, the cinema, on the internet, as well as on the flyers.
It should deter the driver from driving fast and alcohol at the wheel.
And also reminded them to strap in before they leave.
He wants to reach into conscience primarily for young drivers, bikers, pedestrians and, last but not least, professional drivers.
And what will appear in the spots?
Especially human stories that attack the emotions.
And this is evidenced by the "bloody" slogan of the entire campaign:
You don't think - you'll pay!
The word "doesn't you think" is written in capital letters on the license plate.
And in a pool of blood, the word "pay" is.
This is to symbolize that one can pay with one's life in a moment's inattention.
Viewers will be "scariat" by the spots until 2010.
The ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in Anglo-Saxon countries, where pictures with drastic pictures of accident victims can normally be seen.
It promises to reduce the accident rate and the number of deaths on Czech roads.
The Spots were prepared by the Euro RSCG.
Sugar and whip on the driver
"The driver's system is subject to a sugar and whip system.
Sugar for them is that when they go to a red light, for example, they save time.
The whip is the threat of a fine or an accident.
Drivers must be reminded of the risk," says Martin Kořán, a traffic psychologist at the Na Homolce hospital.
And that's why information campaigns are needed in the press and especially negative ads, the psychologist says.
Already less effective, he says, are the boards that alert drivers to the dangers.
"If a static table is installed warning of danger, it will probably soon blend in with the surroundings and drivers will not attend to it," Kořán pointed out.
Olmert would return almost all occupied territories in exchange for peace
The president of Israel's interim government, Ehud Olmert, spoke in favour of returning virtually all territories occupied in 1967, including Pre-Jordan, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, in exchange for peace with the Palestinians and Syria.
He did so in an interview published by the daily Jediot Achronot on Monday.
"We must come to an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it will be necessary to return almost all (occupied) territories, if not all of them," Olmert told the daily.
"We will leave a certain percentage of these territories, but we will have to give the Palestinians a similar percentage (the territory of Israel) because without it there will be no peace," he added.
He admitted that the possible return would also include East Jerusalem.
"Whoever wants security in Jerusalem and, in particular, does not want tractors or bulldozers to run over his legs, as it did for one of my best friends, will have to give up part of Jerusalem," Olmert noted, referring to the two July attacks in the city in which several people were killed and dozens of people injured.
According to the prime minister, it will be necessary to find "special solutions for the Temple Mount, the sacred and historic places" that lie within the Old City.
"Whoever wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty over the entire city will have to integrate 270 000 Arabs.
That won't work," he stressed further.
The departure from the Golan Heights
Olmert also spoke in favour of Israel's departure from the Golan Heights, which he said was an essential condition for concluding a peace agreement with Syria.
But that would also require some effort from Damascus.
"I am not suggesting to make peace with Syria only on the basis of leaving the Golan," he cautioned.
"The Syraneans know what they'll have to give up to win the Golan.
They will have to give up their current relationship with Iran; they will have to give up their relationship with the (Shabi Movement) Hezbollah; they will have to give up the sustained support provided by the terrorism (Shabit Movement) of Hamas, (terrorist networks) of Al-Qaeda and jihadan wars in Iraq," the prime minister clarified.
Schwarzenberg: Relationships with India can cool
If the problem with Czech scientists who have been indicted in India for illegally collecting beetles could not be solved, according to Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg, there would be some cooling of Czech-Indic relations.
The minister made the comments in New York City after meeting today with his Indian counterpart, Pranáb Mukherdj.
"If this had not been resolved, then yes, then there would have been some cooling," he said after the meeting, which took place on the Czech initiative.
Mukherje said after the hearing that the executive could be too difficult to intervene in court matters.
However, he said that in the case of Petr Švácha, who was acquitted and fined, the central government could negotiate with the local government in Darjžiling, whose jurisdiction the matter falls under.
"His problem could be solved," the minister said.
For Emil Kucera, sentenced to three years in prison, according to Mukherjeje, it would be best for him to appeal to a higher instance.
He can then apply for bail and wait for the sentence to be free, he explained.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner made the same comments at the hearing.
"He recommends an appeal to a higher court, then it would be possible to pardonor it," the head of Czech diplomacy said.
The only way for a Czech party to enter the matter is to provide the convicted with "competent legal support," the Indian minister said.
At the same time, he said the Indian side was already providing such assistance to them.
"We have the highest interest in maintaining the best relations with India, which have a long tradition.
Indians also recognize it," Schwarzenberg said.
At the same time, as he told the Czech Press Agency, he stressed in front of his partner that the Czech Republic attaches great importance to the problem of Czech entomologists.
"We really consider it a profound mistake of the imprisonment and indictment of these Czech scientists," he said.
The minister avoided answering the question of whether he had received a promise to deal with things from the Indian party.
"I've made quite a few promises," he said only.
Questions after the accident: Are the stewards on the bus illegal?
The law doesn't know them, you can't walk on a long-distance bus
In the wake of the tragic accident involving a Student Agency bus near Padua, Italy, the question arose as to whether the stewards and passengers could move on the bus while driving.
"If we would like to strictly and formally comply with the law, the activities of the steward is in breach of the Road Traffic Act," says Transport Ministry spokesman Karel Hanzelka.
The accident, which was killed by a 22-year-old stewardess last week, was apparently caused by the driver of the lorry who crossed the bus's path.
Unfortunately, the girl was sitting next to the driver, in the least safe place in the car, though she has two more seats reserved.
However, the bus can crash or brake hard, even as the steward delivers coffee or newspapers.
The role is played by whether the bus is equipped with standing room, according to the technical licence.
If the bus is not homologated, the passenger must sit.
The Student Agency long-distance buses do not have standing seats; Aktuálně.cz was confirmed by the company's director, Radim Jančura.
"This was the department and I dealt with this and at first did not allow the movement of passengers.
Eventually, they called it off and came to the conclusion that passengers were allowed to go to the toilet while driving if they had their seat," he said.
The law does not know the steward
"There is no clear legal interpretation of the role of a steward - no legislation addresses this role.
However, no legislation does not even prohibit the carrier from providing services.
The Road Traffic Act only knows the term of the conductor of the vehicle; it does not define its rights and obligations," adds Hansel, a spokesperson for the less unequivocal.
On the contrary, the director of the Road Vehicle Traffic Department of the Ministry of Transport, Josef Pokorný, believes that the issue is adequately treated by the law.
"It depends on whether the bus is allowed in the homologation of standing room.
That's the end of it," he says.
Buses are divided into urban spaces, where there are room spaces for standing and limited speed, interurban with seats for higher-freed standing seats and at a long-distance without standing places with the maximum speed limit and seats equipped with seat belts.
Like a plane, says expert
BESIP's transport safety expert Jaroslav Hořín, on the move of the stewards on board the bus, does not see a major problem.
"There are not many dangers in the smooth ride, the situation can be compared to the service on the airplanes.
It's not even here for the turbulence to come and the flight attendant can hit his head."
"However, should the bus brake sharply, of course, the laws of physics apply.
Just like on the city bus or the tram.
The safety of the stewards must be addressed by the carrier with internal regulations," he says, also saying, from the legal point of view, the issue is unresolved.
Jančura is willing to cancel services
Student Agency offers the stewards' services as the sole bus carrier.
He emploises two hundred of them.
The director does not consider their profession to be at risk either after the accident.
"But as soon as I get the impression that the stewards' profession is risky, I'll cancel them.
Coffee and newspapers can be given to passengers on boarding.
It would also save costs," he says.
As an interest in safety, the absence of stewards in his cars was the director of Asians, Alexei Litvin, who operates a fraction of the lines compared to SA, the absence of stewards in his cars.
"We don't have stewards, we've been up against that from the start.
Sooner or later it will end in some fatal accident," he told Týden.cz less than a year ago.
There was an immense tragedy
The accident of a regular service to Naples was killed by a young stewardess from Plzeň, who had worked for the company for two years.
The Slovenian truck probably swued without using a rudder from the breakdown lane and blocked the bus's path.
His driver tried to avoid the maneuver with a violent manoeuvre, but hit him with the right front.
That two places reserved for the stewards' rest would be sold out, Jančura refuses.
"These seats cannot be booked for long-distance connections, they are blocked."
The company intends to sue the truck driver.
With the compensation of the girl's family, the agency will not wait for the court's sentence, but he also expects financial compensation from the culprit.
Adjustment of the law?
In the neunder't reach
The clarification of the movement of the stewards on board the bus could be brought about by a bill being worked on by the Ministry of Transport's 30-member expert group for over a year.
"There was no concrete conclusion, of course.
Buses don't even care too much, it's more like a point system, the maximum speed on the motorway and the use of mobile phone while driving," says expert Hořín.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activities of the stewards to be something that would fundamentally endanger the safety of passengers," concludes Hanzelka, a spokesperson for bus safety, noting that the control of bus safety is under the authority of the police and labour safety authorities.
Czech Courts fight for seabed
It will approach the wall map of the wall map, showing Australia and the adjacent marine areas.
He is not interested in the continent, however, but a small point lost in the blue of the ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia, and with it the adjacent seabed.
The area is as big as the continent itself," says Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who belongs to the 30-member team of staff of the United Nations Ocean and Law Affairs of the Law of the Sea.
His boss, the division's director, the Czech lawyer, Václav Mikulka, follows the interpretation and occasionally completes.
There's a work drive and enthusiasm.
The sea bottom hides a hitherto little-known world, rich in natural resources.
There is a search to be found of oil, ores and other mineral resources, but also still-unknown living organisms that carry the key to, say, developing a cancer drug.
Dno larger than land
The coastal states today began to bid in vigorously for the new underwater territories.
According to the UN Convention, they are exercising their rights agreed in 1982 in Montego Bay, Jamaica.
It is mainly an area of the so-called continental shelf, which often extends up to a few hundred kilometres from the coast of the country.
It is under the Convention entitled to all the resources of the continental shelf.
"In simple terms, behind the continental shelf is that part of the seabed and its bedrock, which is a natural continuation of the continent under the sea.
It is reaching beyond the coastal sea, often beyond the two-hundred-homá nautní mil border of the so-called exclusive economic zone," explains Mikulka.
The request submitted by the country to the Commission for the delimitation of the external borders of the continental shelf must be accompanied by a comprehensive scientific and technical and technical documentation based on many costly surveys and measurements.
It is the result of a number of years of preparatory work.
"One of our tasks is to provide legal and technical assistance to the Commission.
The Commission has so far dealt for five applications, namely Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
Only the latter three countries have succeeded so far," Mikulka adds.
The world's response was recently the success of Australia, which was the first to substantially expand its undersea holdings.
But he also won New Zealand - the area of the seabed that the commission admitted to him last week is about 1.6 million square kilometers, roughly six times the size of the state itself.
Both countries invested millions of dollars in the survey.
The profit that will go to them from using the seabed in the future will be, as they sorely so, as they promise.
Other states will submit their applications in turn.
They can do so until they did so within a decade of ratifying the "Stego Bay excuse."
Where the continental shelf ends, the ocean bottom area, declared "common heritage of mankind" is established by the Covenant.
Here no state has an exclusive status.
The right of extraction in this area is granted by the Convention by an international institution established.
"But the lore is no Klondajk," director Mikulka says on the pitch, noting that his "unitem areas are legally clearly defined and their regime contractually enshrined."
Czechs in the Pacific
Part of the seabed now belongs to the Czech Republic.
They are sharing them with other states of the former Eastern Bloc as part of the joint organization "Interoceanmetal."
It was granted in 1991 under the Convention, as did the investors of a few other states, the status of a so-called "speat-offer."
It is authorized to mine in the ClarionClipperton zone in the Pacific Ocean, located between Mexico, the Hawaii Islands and Kiribati.
The investor-examplar-examit area is slightly larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The bottom is rugged, it's a kind of underwater replica of the Tatras.
"There, to be mined on an area with a total area of 75,000 square kilometres.
The area is a rich deposit of polymetallic concretes containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese," says another lawyer, Ind Pakshi Rajan.
The Macedonian division worker Rober Sandev brings to the demonstration one such concretou.
It resembles a small potato, or, with a little imagination, a mythical sheershell that, according to legend, revived the Golem.
The Hope of Düsseldorf is Frankfurt
The big words are not labí in the letter from the board of directors of WestLB to the employees of this bank.
The merger of the Düsseldorf Mastorurk Deka-Bank units will create "the central institution of the financial group of savings banks for the capital market trade," we will read in a letter that became public on Monday.
According to the letter, WestLB will bring a "field of competencies" providing long-term returns into this transaction.
And, he said, such a merger could be a decisive impetus for further association in the provincial bank sector.
Such texts are made when the board wants to demonstrate the ability to act in a troubled period.
The unstable WestLB is still under considerable pressure.
Not only by the European Commission, but also by the Federal Office for the Supervision of Financial Services, whose communication to the Provincial Government in North Rhine-Westphalia that it is time to find a solution for the future is still fresh.
Nevertheless, the connection between Deka-Bank, which the savings bank customers know about for its investment funds, and WestLB, whatever the kind it may be, has been talked about for a long time - even on the Frankfurt side.
The head of Deka-Bank, Franz Waas, at the presentation of his six-month financial results at the end of August, let it be known that he did not see the point in the merger of his banking house from Mainzer Landstraße with one of the country's banks, such as Helaba or WestLB.
However, the board of directors of Deka-Bank, which is backed by one half of the Landesbank and from the other by the savings banks, has commissioned the board of directors to conduct talks with the WestLB on joint business activities.
This could be business in the capital market or part of them.
However, the talks have only just begun, the financiers say.
Deka-Bank, which is one of the more important employers in the financial market in Frankfurt with its 3,000 employees, is not discussed for the first time in the context of consolidation in the savings sector.
In 2003, it looked as if Deka-Bank's merger with the Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz and the Helaba Bank.
In the end, there was nothing of this triple-folk.
Shortly after the merger's plans became public, the Hessen provincial government spoke out against the participation of Helaba Bank.
The two remaining banking houses did not come together either.
Instead, the Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz was acquired by the Landesbank Baden-Württemberg of Stuttgart.
Despite the yet to be repeatedly speculated about the merger of Deka-Bank with the Landesbanks.
Recently, however, Günther Merl, the chairman of Helaba, the chairman of the board of directors of Helaba, commented on the speculation about the merger of his financial house with others.
However, it seems to be making a clear sense of the belief that the convergence of the various banking houses of the public-sector sector is a must.
Now, after the provincial elections in Bavaria, BayernLB's union with Landesbank Baden-Württemberg could begin to be the first to be looming.
That's not the good news for Helaba.
Should the pressure for further mergers increase, it is gradually losing potential partners for such a merger.
It would play only second fiddle in the south, even though it has faced a financial crisis significantly better so far than the banking houses in Munich and Stuttgart.
Connections with WestLB, for its part, was banned earlier in the year by the Sancellor Banks' Hessen-Thüringen Union, which has an eight-fifty stake in Helaba.
This would be the only way to consider the Nord LB.
But geostrategic considerations of this kind are only one party to the problem.
On the other hand, it is a question of how much the business models of individual institutions are tuning in together.
In June, Merl said that the decisive issue of the business model should be ensured by the future competitiveness of the Landesbanks, the German Association of Savings Banks and the Zar's Banks has not yet answered.
Everything could also end with the distribution of WestLB, which, of course, no one wants in this institution.
That is why the local board of directors' letter is also talking about trying to make a "complex solution" for the entire banking house.
Whether and how it will be possible to connect with the connection of the individual components with Deka-Bank will be revealed by time.
The second weekend of Oktoberfest is known as the 'weekend with the Italians'
This is the first time for Elena, the third or fourth time for Luca.
But this time, Elena would be there as his girlfriend, and so things would be different, she says.
Behind them, at the five-litre Kaiser barrel, there is a stronger bearded one, and two hundred tourists at Oktoberfest demonstrate how deep the notes can give up on his throat.
Elena Luca slap first and then kisses him.
They came to Verona from Bologna.
From here, from the bus parking lot next to Puorta Nuova station, there will be four buses with the designation "destinazione Monaco, festa della birra" at 23.45 this evening, the expected arrival of 6.30.
The three buses are mainly occupied by Italians, with only Brazilians riding on one bus.
In one corner of the parking lot, these South Americans are already singing with their flag, having already celebrated at night.
And out loud, says Marco Guarda, this is not for the Italians.
Marco, wearing a long coat with a fka imitation fur and glasses with wide silver frames, the three buses belong.
He has been riding with them for five years at Oktoberfest, hosting three expeditions this year alone.
At night there, during the day between the beer stalls, at 10:30 p.m. to leave back.
Overnight would mean unnecessary costs, says Marco.
The trip costs 75 euros, including a welcome toast to the Kaiser beer, brewed exactly under the Bavarian Law on the Purity of Beer, Health Insurance and the German-speaking guide - Marco went to a language course in Frankfurt.
Buses go out into the night, after the autostrada in the direction of "Brennero."
Beer is not filed, not yet.
The bus quickly silt, the passengers are asleep.
They do well, they'll need their strength.
It is being built in Brixen and Holzkirchen, where a lot of other buses with Italian license plates are taking one more break on the number 8 motorway just before Munich.
When Marc's group finally arrives at a parking lot near Theresienwiese at 6:30 a.m. as scheduled, there are already about 50 more buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others are being collected, Marco has her last speech, explains the attack plan.
One: Put on a yellow cap.
On it, it says "Oktoberfest" on the left, next to the internet address of Marc's travel agency: "conoscersiviaggiando.it".
Two: "When the door to the beer tent opens, run!" calls Marco to the morning air.
"Go!" Go and sit in the back of the tent.
"Not forward, lest you get in the way, and not all the yellow caps on the same benches, spread out across the space!"
Maz costs 8 euros, 25 cents.
And don't forget the tip.
"Let's show the metcourtes that we're behaving.
As soon as you leave your seats, they're gone!'
Three: "Today at 10:30 p.m. today, be here again!" Do you understand?
And up to Wiesn, a space with the beer tents.
Along the way, one member of the group is hinged on yellow caps such as tree, signs signs and even an election poster of one of the big Bavarian parties.
You need to prepare to retreat.
As a "weekend with Italians" he is known for the second weekend of Oktoberfest.
Precision figures for the number of visitors are not available; they are talking about the fifty thousand who set off on the journey through the Alps and fall into the beer tents, ten per cent of all visitors are said to have arrived from Italy this weekend.
The Munich Police's Rows will be reinforced by seven police officers from the South Tyrol, Italian volunteers will support the Bavarian Red Cross, which leads the national statistics in which Italians take the first place in front of the British (about 60 interventions) and the Austrians (about 80) with approximately 200 medical treatments.
The Hofbräu tent is especially popular with the Italians.
The sleepless nights for the creditors of the Hypo Real Estate
As recently as last week, Federal Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück stressed that the German banking system was relatively stable.
Good that the politician used the word "relatively" and the fact that the German banking sector will not be spared the spared the crisis.
For that one came up the previous weekend.
The Dax index of the monitored financial house specializing in real estate financing Hypo Real Estate (HRE) will receive a loan from a consortium of German banks to protect against turbulence in the markets.
A person familiar with the situation told Reuters on Monday that the credit assistance in question would go up to 35 billion euros.
Hypo Real Estate (HRE) will only have to pay the interest on the amount actually drawn.
The money is said to come from both private and public banks.
In the background are the losses of the subsidiary of Depfa.
This state financier, according to a newspaper report, has been extremely refinanced for long-term projects for which he lent money, which is no longer possible now due to distrust in the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank's reserve shrunk by 95% to 2.37 million euro and the equity share of equity slightly decreased from 1.6 to 1.45 per cent.
Current revenues and net revenues from financial trades fell to zero compared to last year, revenues from the increased value of receivables and certain securities, as well as the cancellation of reserves for credit trading, fell by more than 70 per cent to €5 million.
Only thanks to the higher returns on compensation for subsequent settlement costs in the restructuring of the former Depfa Group and the interest refund under the Tax Code and for brokering trade for the group businesses, the 16% decrease still moderate on the revenue side.
The former state financier, after his privatisation in 1990, was burned on mortgages for sole traders, which were then set aside from the service portfolio and further led by Aareal Bank.
Because there was too little profit in classical state funding, Depfa was more involved in infrastructure projects and in financing joint projects by private investors and the state (Private-Public-Partnership), and diversified internationally.
Hypo Real Estate must now write something off the value of its subsidiary, and these depreciation will have a "cougher material effect" on the calculation of the group's profits and losses, as some have been vaguely heard.
The fact is, there won't be a dividend.
It has already been cut back by two-thirds for 2007.
Since taking over of Def, the Hypo Real Estate has been a major financier for state and infrastructure projects.
Stronger than other institutes, it depends on refinancing in the interbank market because it has no customer deposits.
After the collapse of the US investment bank Lehman Brothers, a spring of interbank loans practically dried up two weeks ago as banks guard the liquidity.
Hypo Real Estate needs short-term funding for part of the Depfa loan portfolio - around 50 billion euros - for a portion of the loan portfolio.
According to the Hypo Real Estate, the financial need of the group is covered by this loan for the foreseeable future, and the firm is protected "before the influence of international money markets at the moment of a largely incompetent function."
Other sources have been told that this money has secured refinancing by the end of 2009.
HRE Chairman Georg Funke, on the other hand, said that the Hypo Real Estate Group would not have to use the money markets in the foreseeable future.
The Federal Bank and the Federal Institute for the Supervision of Financial Services (BaFin) assume that the competitiveness of the Hypo Real Estate group on the market is now assured.
That is what the bank's shareholders and creditors hope for.
But given the dynamics and elusiveness of the crisis, there is probably no certainty.
It is not even entirely impossible that the loan would not need to be used up in full.
However, the opposite cannot be ruled out.
After the bank appears to have faced insolvency late on Sunday in the afternoon, the rescue is unable to calm the passion, even a preliminary one.
The share price plummeted 75 percent to 3.30 euros.
On the contrary, bond rates were well held.
While preferential debts have barely been made, secondary bond rates are being lost more significantly.
This is particularly the case for the bonds of the former subsidiary company Württemberg Hypo and logically the bonds with the maturity after 2009.
The Hypo-Real-Est's ties originally looked like an alternative investment opportunity for speculators, but their stability, after a significant sharpening of the banking crisis and the crisis of the institute itself, which brought it to the company by taking over the Depf, must be understood as a view to the stability of the international financial system.
As long as emission banks, governments and less affected commercial banks are willing to support the system, it is possible to count on the reimbursement of securities within their due period.
But it may also happen that almost no one is dared hope for at the moment - the financial crisis will be over for the next 15 months.
However, given the reports coming at the same time as this partial nationalized probability bordering on certainty, it has now become mere legitimate hope.
This, especially to long-term creditors, is likely to be prepared by a series of sleepless nights, when they will decide whether to relinquish their commitments.
Short-drunk investors can use the marginal line at least to create a loss transfer from previous accounting periods to later-year exchange rate yields for the purpose of the future payment of the capital gains tax.
German special deployment units were in the freeing of the hostages
The Egyptian government has asked for help from Germany in dealing with the hostage crisis - the experts arrived.
When the situation escalated, the special forces were ready, but the deployment did not take place.
More details of the circumstances of the liberation of eleven in Egypt of the kidnapped European tourists are gradually becoming public.
The rescue effort was indirectly involved in the rescue effort, according to data from the ministries of defence and interior.
According to the ministries, both Federal Army experts and the German police counter-terrorism group, the GSG9 squadron of the Federal Police, the Federal Criminal Office, as well as the logistics experts from the Technical Assistance Service (Technisches Hilfswerk) were at the site of the liberation.
However, according to another statement from the spokesmen of both ministries on Monday afternoon, there was no need for the German forces, because the kidnappers let their prisoners go and fled when they recognized signs of forcible liberation.
The Egyptian government is said to have accepted the aid offered by Germany as a support force for action on the ground.
"Fortunately, that didn't happen," said one of the spokesmen of the Interior Ministry.
The attackers kidnapped a group of travelers made up of five Germans, five Italians, one Romanian, as well as eight of their Egyptian guides on 19 September in the south of Egypt.
After being kidnapped in a desert region in the south of Egypt, hostages were moved in the border territories between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the kidnappers remained unclear until the last moment, as well as the details of the acquittal or possible payment of the ransom.
At present, the rescued are all right in Cairo.
Minister Steinmeier said the release of the hostages was under the care of the German embassy.
He did not comment for the details of his release.
There is no information available in Berlin as to when the rescued will return to Germany.
According to the "Bild" newspaper, all five tourists should, even with special forces, leave by one of the Airbus of the German Air Force and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
Sylvana and the secret of the bento box
When 16-year-old Sylvana Hiltrop is to present her first day at a secondary school in Tacibana, the girls start to chuckle: the German is a total "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knows this word from the mang. On her new exchange blog, she tells of Japan.
"The first day in Japan.
Sir, I was nervous.
I was already out of my way to school my way.
I live on the edge of Tokyo in the direction of Kawasaki and take the train to the middle in Tacibana for 40 minutes.
I had to find the trip myself, luckily I didn't get lost.
It seems that the start of teaching in Tachibana is not given as strictly as it is in our home country in Lower Saxony.
Students start meeting after eight o'clock and twenty minutes before nine the short sit-down with the teacher, the so-called 'home room' begins.
But before the class started, I was supposed to introduce myself.
I'm not the kind of person who likes to talk in front of people, let alone 40 students in front of the class.
Having not yet had a school uniform, I wore an old skirt to my host's mom, plus a blouse, blue knee soars, and black leather shoes.
So dressed like this, I stood in front of the bench and tried to pronounce everything correctly: 'Sajonara Wo she be Sylvana...' - my name is Sylvana, I come from Germany and it's my birthday in a week's time.
At that point, I was so glad that I started learning the language two years ago.
All 31 girls in the class were rued, giggled and waved, and I could still hear the word 'kawaii'.
I already knew that from my manges.
It belongs to the basic vocabulary of Japanese girls' survival and means 'cute, sweet'.
Then I quickly entered my place.
The girl next to me smiled quite wide, considering it an honor that a foreign student should have been sitting next to her.
The rest of the class was relatively calm, but when the gong came in, it literally filled me in.
They spoke in one's the other and giggled and asked me about the possible and the impossible - and yet it's really hard to understand Japanese English.
At the interval, they all unpacked their bento.
My host mum made me a lunchbox for me, too - and that's different from boring German snacks.
I had rice with herbs, little sausages, a cucka and algae salad, fruit and a kind of fish in the tofu baton.
I usually have no idea what exactly I'm eating here in Japan.
These things look strange and taste quite new.
What's certain is that everything is really good.
Well, except for the salt-laden plums, br!
Benta at Japanese schools is not just a lunch.
Sometimes it happens that a girl gives the boy a handmade bento, which in this case is particularly artistically groomed, and hopes to get to know the boy closer to a snack during the break.
I read about that in my mango comics.
I wonder if I'll see this place, too.
'Why Japan?' my friends asked me when I told them I wanted to go to school in Tokyo for a year.
Then I always said:
'Cause I'm just fascinated by it."
After all, I've been prefers to read mangoes for years.
And to get these comic books and their culture to understand, I started learning a little bit Japanese once.
So I knew I'd have to come here one day.
Because I also have a soft spot for tradition, customs and customs.
And they're highly valued here.
On the one hand, Japan is the countries of the latest technologies and trends, on the other, it is rigorous, disciplined and traditional.
And since everything is so well organized, I've never felt lost here before, even though Tokyo is the biggest city I've ever seen.'
U.S. House of Representatives Rejects Rescue Package
The first chamber of the US Congress let in a narrow majority fall a $700 billion bailout package for financial markets.
The Dow Jones index suddenly plummeted.
By a rate of 206 to 227 votes, the U.S. House of Representatives rejected the government's financial market bailout package.
Despite all the calls from US President George W. Bush and the leading politicians of both sides, a majority has not been found for a program that is expected to ease the turmoil in financial markets.
The dramatic event was desperately trying to convince critics of the $700 billion package.
Barney Frank, one of the Democratic negotiators, called on the MP to give his consent before the vote, though, as he put it, the plan was not popular.
"It's hard to get political recognition for avoiding something that hasn't happened at all," he acknowledged.
Even during the vote, the Dow Jones fell by more than six per cent, or 600 points.
This was due to investors' fears that the state rescue package could be forfeited.
Shortly before the end of the vote, the value of the index rose to fall steeply after the announcement of the package's shipwreck.
Experts are now counting on more serious turbulence in international financial markets.
In order for the program to enter into force, the approval of both the House of Representatives and the Senate is needed.
Even rats have feelings
When a rat or a cockroar is running away from danger, does that mean they also feel fear?
Neurologist Joseph LeDoux is convinced that many animals also have feelings.
But how could it be to verify whether they feel the same thing when they behave in the same way as we do?
The online magazine "Edge" has been published for several years by posts by well-known scientists.
SPIEGEL ONLINE in its series presents the selected answers to the question "What do you think is true without you being able to prove it?"
I believe that animals have feelings and other states of consciousness without me or anyone else being able to prove it when we can't even prove that other people have consciousness.
But in this case, we can at least hope, because all human brains have the same basic configuration.
However, once we start to address another kind and open up questions of perception or general consciousness, we enter the unmorpheous terrain because the hardware does not match.
When a rat gets into danger, he does the same thing as many other animals: she will pretend to be dead, flee or attack.
Humans behave in the same way, from which some scientists conclude on comparable subjective experiences.
I don't believe in that, however.
Two aspects of the brain structure make it difficult to transfer our subjective experience to experiencing animals.
This is both because the circuits associated with human consciousness almost always involve the side prefrontal cortex (because of its share of short-term memory and performance or management functions).
This vast area is significantly more developed in humans than other primates, and other creatures seem to be completely absent.
At least for those aspects of our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal cortex, among them the knowledge of who we are, and the ability to plan and make decisions, there is a reason to believe that one differs even from other primates.
Another dramatic peculiarity could be concealed by a man's linguistic nature: because so much of his perception is linked to language, it is often said that consciousness depends on him.
In this case, we could expel the animals.
But even if the consciousness of the tongue didn't matter, surely the language would have affected it, so that the animal consciousness, however constructed it is, would probably distinguish it from most of our consciousness.
It is therefore difficult to see what the consciousness of other animals may look like.
When, as something indoor and subjective, it is neither measured nor, for the sake of special hardware, analysed on the basis of our own experience, the exploration of it puts us in front of great problems.
Most of my outlet refers to the content of conscious experience, but there is also another aspect of consciousness that should be more scientifically accessible.
It would be possible to examine the processes in the consciousness of the animals regardless of their content, and this is exactly what is happening in the short-term memory studies of primates, especially in the example of visualisation.
But this approach, addressed by Christof Koch and Francis Crick, focuses more on the neural correlates of consciousness than causal mechanisms: both may be identical, but they may not be either.
Interestingly, this approach also stresses the importance of a non-flagre cortex for the realisation of visualisation.
What does that mean for feelings?
I deduce them from the fact that an emotional system, such as the fear system, is activated in the brain conscious of its own activity.
What we refer to as "fear" is therefore the mental state in which we find ourselves when the activity of the defense system of the localized brain (or its consequences, such as bodily reactions) uses the operating memory.
Viewed from this angle, the feelings are closely intertwined with those areas of the kortex that are characterized by primates, and especially by humans.
In the connection with linguistic naturalness, a subtle graduation of perception arises, because by means of words and grammar, we can distinguish and categorize states in order to add them to others alongside themselves.
By contrast, for example, Antonio Damasio believes that feelings arise from more primitive activities in the cortex and brain stem areas of physical feelings, like Jaak Pankseep, which, however, is more focused on the brain stem.
Since this network has not changed much during the course of human evolution, it might well be a part of the feelings perceived by multiple animal houses.
In theory, I cannot oppose it, but I find this uncred.
Pankseep argues that what seems to us to be fear in rats and humans is probably felt by both organisms in the same way: But how is it possible to verify, says Pankseep, whether rats and people feel the same thing when they behave in the same way?
The cockrole is fleeing from the dangers - does he feel fear, too?
From my point of view, the mere similarity of behaviour cannot prove the coincility of experiencing.
It is true that the neural comparison moves us on: rats and humans have similar brain tribes, while cockroaches and the brain.
But is the brain stem responsible for the feelings?
And even if it were possible to prove it in a person: how would we like to prove it with rats?
I believe that rats and other mammals, perhaps even cockroaches (who knows?), have feelings.
But I really don't know how to prove it.
And because their feelings are probably fundamentally different from ours (because human consciousness rests on special circuits and on the tongue), I prefer to examine emotional behavior rather than emotional perception of rats.
In any case, in this case, we can see progress at the neural level if we measure the same for rats and humans.
As with rats I do not rehear and experience the language and the consciousness, nor do I see any feelings, I don't know if they exist.
It is possible to think this is short-sighted, but I move forward rather than rushear repeatedly against the wall.
I'm a practical emotionalist.
UEFA President Platini: Sentence by pardon for Poland and Ukraine
Acting Prime Minister Ivan Vasuynyk said preparations would soon be run directly by the president and the prime minister.
"The government sees UEFA's decision in Bordeaux as evidence of confidence in Ukraine and its ability to organise the European Championships together with Poland," Vasuynyk said.
"But it is not an amnesty for our country.
Work has only just started, and there's still a lot to do in both countries."
In the early fulfilment of the construction timetable or the redevelopment of stadiums, streets, hotels and airports, the two hosts are lagging behind.
It is even possible that the number of stadiums for the European Championships will be reduced from eight to six.
"We can't waste our time.
We must now work as quickly as possible," said the chairman of the Ukrainian union, Grigory Surkis.
"UEFA will keep following us."
An even more radical move was agreed in Poland.
The leadership of the Polish PZPN was dismissed by the National Olympic Committee after numerous scandals and replaced by independent administrator Robert Zawlocki.
The committee met at the request of the Minister of Sport, Mirosław Drzewiecki.
He said there is "a serious danger that the PZPN will not be able to act according to the rules," Drzewiecki told the Polish press PAP.
"We have assured UEFA President Michel Platini by letter that this step will not suffer from the preparation for the 2012 European Championships."
Several teams from the first league were doomed to a forced descent last season due to manipulation, in the end it had to be even hastily moved the start of the league.
Travel agents record rising numbers of bookings
It looks like the winter will be good for German tourism entrepreneurs:
According to one study, the trip bookings for the next months increased significantly in terms of the previous year - even more than 30 percent for the winter season.
Despite weak economic growth, the Germans' appetite for travel remains uncured.
For winter season bookings, travel agents recorded a 31 percent increase in turnover compared to the same period last year, as the German Travel Association (Deutscher Reiseverband, DRV) said on Monday in Berlin.
According to a survey by the GfK market survey institute, increased bookings are already available for the autumn months.
The reversal was thus about eleven percent higher in October compared to 2007.
The basis for these results are the figures of the GfK, which annually evaluates the booking data from 1200 German travel agents and interpolates them to the overall market.
Included in this result were bookings of tours, which took place until the end of August 2008.
Due to the weak exchange rate of the dollar, trips to the US are mainly in demand, DRV said.
For these trips, the addition of bookings makes about one-third.
In addition, the Germans are particularly desirable targets for Spain, Turkey and Greece, as well as domestic waters.
In particular, the organised tours are on course, said DRV chairman Klaus Laepple.
In view of the rising expenditure of energy and food, the cost is "is easier for the client to be countable than for individually organised holidays."
Laepple explained that money can be saved by consumers, among other things, by using discounts for early booking or all-inclusive offers.
Even in the summer months, the number of bookings was said to be very good, so a higher turnover will be recorded again compared to the previous year - although according to another study the number of Germans who made some travel has decreased compared to the previous year.
Outraged Dennis Quaid strikes back
She wanted to advertise a new film, spoke in an interview about private matters - and now she has trouble with her ex: Hollywood star Meg Ryan referred to her former Dennis Quaid as a matrimizor marriage.
He's furious and strikes back.
The belated Rose War of the Rose of the former couple Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: seven years after the divorce, these two Hollywood actors are in a nasty dispute - in the public eye.
In an interview with the American magazine InStyle, Meg Ryan first commented on the reasons for the collapse of her marriage: "The days have been unfaithful to me for a long time, and that was very painful."
She said she only learned of the scale of the fraud after the divorce.
The impetus for this mental striptease was Ryan's PR's work for her new film, "The Women" - the story of a broken marriage.
Dennis Quaid's reaction to his presentation as an unfaithful husband was distinctive: It's "crazy," the 54-year-old actor told the New York Daily News that "Meg repeatedly chews down the history of our relationship and edits it."
Moreover, it is "political" that the joint 16-year-old son Jack once again "reiterates to the pain and radical changes that divorce for every child."
While Ryan has lived alone since the divorce, Quaid is married again and recently became the father of the twins.
He concludes his reflections on the sagging as follows: "My life goes on anyway.
I consider it a happy one to have an amazing family that is doing great."
Fare and hotel prices fall
In the first half of 2008, flights and accommodation in Europe were cheaper than in the previous year.
In Germany, according to one current study, flights were even cheaper by as much as 50 percent.
Flights and hotel accommodation have become cheaper again - this is the result of a study by the American Express travel and financial services provider.
The company analysed its bookings data from the first half of 2008 and found a significant decline in the second quarter after the rise in prices in the first quarter of the second.
After prices on the hotel market had risen for several years, accommodation in many places had already become cheaper.
Prices in 41 of the 48 European cities surveyed for averaged 6.9% in January to March compared to 2007.
However, prices were already 3.6 percent lower from April to June than in the previous year.
The trend was most eye-on in Paris and Rome, where passengers had to pay 30 to 37 percent less than in the previous year.
American Express sees the cause of this trend as a weak dollar exchange rate, which has caused the "lead appetite for American tourists to travel."
The drop in hotel prices was also more affected by financial centres than industrial centres, such as Hannover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In this Norwegian city, hotel prices, by their rise of 26.3 percent, even set a European record.
Ticket prices also showed an even upward trend in the first quarter:
Due to the increase in kerosine, passengers in the Economy class had to pay an average of 7.1 percent more than in 2007, with fuel-intensive long-haem flights even up to 29.2 percent more expensive.
From April to June, fares in the Economy class fell by an average of 12.5 percent compared to the previous quarter, but the changes were considerably less pronounced in the Business and First-Class classes.
In Germany, prices plummeted even more sharply than in other European countries:
They grew 11.9 percent from January to March, down 23.6 percent in the second quarter.
On German domestic flights, according to the cited study, prices fell by half.
One of the reasons for this price fall is slowing economic growth, the company explains.
Demand in many segments of the air transport market is uncertain.
On the other hand, there is increased competitive pressure because of the Open Skies agreement, which has liberalised air traffic between the US and Europe.
The tense situation is the cancellation of unprofitable flights by air carriers, as well as the high number of airlines that filed for bankruptcy in the first half of 2008 - 24 airlines in Europe alone.
HSV beats Gladbach 1-0
Thanks to one goal and simple methods, the Hamburger SV is at the top of the table.
In Borussia, Luhukay continues to fail to form a functioning eleven.
Written by Kristoffer Klein - to enlarge the failed landing for representative Marko Marino.
This player from Gladbach did not join the game until late and failed with a punched ball onto the post.
His report was precision-formed, and it came from his mouth convincingly.
He simply knew he was right.
"We need a second goal," hissed Hermann Rieger in the hallway to the Hamburg Arena's booths.
Not much was happening in the catacombs, the break between the halftime ended and most people were back in their seats.
Rieger has been a HSV physiotherapist for nearly three decades and enjoys more respect than many of the momentary actor.
And so his plea was also heard in the responsible place.
Assistant coach Cornelius Jol nodded and raised his thumb as a sign of the match.
Cornelius is the brother of Hamburg head coach Martin Jol.
His order was probably the same: here with the second goal!
The execution did not take place.
"Emc was all the niche here today," Marcell Jansen later admitted.
Even Bastian Reinhardt would have been "wanter relaxed."
The 1-0 (1-0) Hamburgen Petrić (11th) gents the header and the circumstances that the very weak Gladbashans could not harm the weak Hamburgers.
"It was a dirty victory," Martin Jol summarized.
The Hamburger SV will celebrate 121 years of its existence this Monday.
Viewers thus celebrated themselves on Saturday afternoon, the blue skies above the arena and a live updated table on a video wall in which their team was listed as the premier.
It's a birthday without a big party.
"We know how to evaluate it," said Marcell Jansen.
He suspects that the interim table result symbolizes the unplicatability of the league rather than the dominance of its HSV.
The team with the late arrival of new players - the Brazilians Neves and Silva, the goalkeeper Petrić and the FC Bayern, won, are slowly located, but they are not able to shovel yet.
"We need more feeling and more dribbling," Jol said emphatically.
My First Oktoberfest
Endlessly repeated ash, tuple beer, and prominent men in costumes from well-known designers.
First time in a beer meadow.
Susanne Kronzucker and I don't really have much in common.
She's a blonde, a TV presenter, and shears a tailor-made costume.
I have dark hair, I'm a student, and my dress is secondhand.
But one thing connects us: we're not even three minutes in a beer meadow, and we're already being pounced by photographers and swiftly filling up with memory cards - I'm flattered, it's my first time at Oktoberfest.
This is how you can make friends.
It seems my cheap costume has served its purpose.
I'm here as a tourist and I live north of the sausage equator, and so my feeling of comfort in the costume was rather limited.
But right after arriving at Theresienwiese, everything is better than it seemed.
Almost everyone is wearing female costume or leather trousers; no one is looking at disgusted or embarrassingly offended - everything is perfectly normal.
Strange views at the chocolate-covered banana stall are all my apron.
One Munich woman points out to me that I was wrongly tied up with it: "You are free, in the middle of a virgin, entered on the right, widowed at the back."
I'll throw the bow from the back to the left.
"All right," he says, and laughs.
Others don't deal with the sublium flirting techniques as much, and wear simple felt hats with the words "To drunk to get dressed!" and stick out on the bystanders' naked buttocks.
A young man with such exhibitionist tendencies is called Bob, he's from England, and he came to Oktoberfest for the first time.
He feels "gorgeous," with an extended "óóóo."
This is what he tells me after relieving himself of a drunk wip.
Right next to one of those hydrants that everyone thinks are trash bins.
Bob is therefore one of the dreaded "Wildbieslers," as it is called in public in public to the free urinating people.
The rest of the happiness to get rid of alcohol in this way.
Around 8 p.m., they run around the area where Oktoberfest is held, in droves of medics who have to take care of the poor drinkers.
Paramedics always appear in flocks - four of them wear a covered stretcher from tent to tent.
They work like most visitors to the beer meadow: empty there, full back again.
Who lies under the tarp of this coffin of bean of beudil is not visible.
"So te, which y-e can't go on," one of the medics calls me in response to my question and disappears into the crowd.
After the defeat in the vote
Fear is spreading on Wall Street.
Initial reports of the sinking of the rescue package caused the Dow Jones to drop by as much as 700 points.
That was the biggest point loss in one day in its history.
Later, Dow gained weight again.
Around 8:30 p.m., this world's most important stock market barometer showed a 5% drop to 10,579 units.
The Nasdaq technology exchange was at 1548 points at more than seven percent.
The worst was the worst in Dow at the moment, with American Express losing almost 14 percent, and Bank of America with a loss of around 12 percent.
None of the titles could strengthen.
Shares in Goldman Sachs lost nearly ten percent.
Just a few days ago, the company's big-investor, Warren Buffett, had a stake in the company.
As part of the rescue plan, funds are to be made available for the purchase of so-called rotten mortgage papers.
However, the entire amount is not to be paid at once, but in several stages.
In return, the state is to receive the stock opt-up for financial companies, which could be reimbursed in the favourable exchange rate development, thus reducing the burden on the state budget.
Stock odds in Europe are falling steeply
Billion-dollar aid to banks in Europe and the US is not flawed for investors.
The sharecroind price of the large German bank, Hypo Real Estate, is heavily down and is withdrawing the Dax index.
The US Dow Jones is losing ground despite a planned state bail-outs of the financial market.
The Spectacular exchange rate losses of Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank have plunged the German stock index (Dax) well into the red.
Shares in the Munich Real Estate financier lost up to three quarters of its value despite the Federal Government's and private banks' rescue, with Commerzbank losing more than 20 percent.
Dax clearly slipped below the psychologically important 6000 score mark and scored 5,839 points with a minus of 3.7 percent.
Worldwide, stock markets went to the knees.
In New York, a trading day on Wall Street began with significant losses.
Investors fear that a $700 billion US government rescue package would not have to be enough to revive events in financial markets.
The Dow lost 334 points or 3.3 percent in its first trading hour, and is at 10,809.25 points.
The U.S. House of Representatives is scheduled to vote on the rescue plan, with the Senate allowing a say in October 1.
Other European stock exchanges were only one way: in London, the FTSE initially weakened by 3.2 percent, while the CAC-40 lost 2.9 percent in Paris.
In Asia, Japan's leading index, the Nikkei, fell 1.26 percent to 11,743.61 units after initial gains.
In Hong Kong, the Hang-Seng index fell 2.1 percent to 18,286.90 points.
In India, the head-on Sensex index lost 506.43 points or 3.9 percent, and trading ended at 12,595.75.
In MDAx they lost shares in Arcandor shares after the announcement of the share capital increase.
Private bank Sal. Oppenheim has subscribed to 23 million new shares.
In addition, the commercial and tourist concern announced that it would not sell the shares in Thomas Cook.
Dark matter affects the flight of space probes
For years, scientists have been unaware of fuming with one mysterious phenomenon: dark matter affects the speed of space probes during the so-called swing-by maneuver.
Experts fear that the general theory of relativity of Albert Einstein's relativity might not be quite right.
For nearly 18 years, the space probe "Ulysses" flew through space.
The fuel lines, which will soon freeze, are now at risk of dying of the cold.
For years, a mysterious phenomenon has been a matter of confusion among scientists - the anomaly of the gravity slingsoncound.
A gravity slingsch is a aerial maneuver of space probes, in which they acquire additional momentum in the gravitational field of a space body, such as Earth.
This allows the probes to save a lot of fuel.
The European-American research probe Cassini-Huygens used this physical trick as well as the solar probe Ulysses.
But what the scientist has said for years in this case in wonder: the flying bodies are not acting 100 percent in the way that a good old-tical law would expect.
On the contrary, there are irregularities in speed.
The probes unexpectedly accelerate or slow down.
So far, physicists have not been able to explain this effect.
He was baptiseed by the anomalies of the gravity slingshopper.
Several experts fear that perhaps even the general theory of relativity by Albert Einstein, which describes the attraction of matter by curvature of space, might not be entirely correct.
American physicist Stephen Adler of the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton remains convinced that Einstein was not wrong, and tries to explain the gravitational-glag anomaly using the so-called dark matter, the presence of which was discovered in the universe by astronomers.
"The answer for this anomaly could be dark matter, which could also be very close to the Earth," he writes.
The existence of dark matter has only been known to space for space for about a decade.
It is based on an obviously gravitational pull, the effect of which on other cosmic bodies can be observed.
It, on the other hand, is completely invisible, which means that it does not broadcast or reflect any electromagnetic radiation, just visible light.
According to the scientists' calculations, this dark matter is a good fifth of the total masses of the universe.
In Egypt, kidnapped tourists are at large
After ten days in the hands of their kidnappers, the kidnapped tourists are back at large, according to a note from the Italian foreign minister in Egypt.
The kidnappers from Sudan demanded a ransom of several million euros.
In the shootout before release, they said, six of the kidnappers were killed.
In the south of Egypt, five Germans were abducted.
The ransom negotiations are already underway.
The Germans have repeatedly become targets of the kidnappers.
WELT ONLINE brings you the most important cases.
European tourists' introduction to the Sahara appears to be free.
This was reported in the same as Egyptian state television, the Arab television station Al-Arabiy and the Italian media.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release, according to reports by the Italian television station Sky TG 24: "Our fellow citizens and other hostages have been freed.
We are now verifying their health," Frattini said.
According to a report by Egyptian state television, five Germans, five Italians and one Romanian, as well as their eight Egyptian guides are in order and well.
All 19 participants in the expedition to the desert are already believed to be on their way to Cairo.
The witnessing of the shoot-out before the release of the hostages remains unclear: according to the Egyptian security officer, the kidnappers were ready to end the kidnapping before the Sudanese army surprisingly killed the six hijackers.
"The problem has been solved.
They agreed to the ransom," the quoted worker said.
He said, "it was just a question of taking the hostage," when "this surprise" came suddenly.
Sudanese soldiers shot dead six hijackers in a border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt on Sunday, and two of them were captured.
The kidnappers demanded a ransom of six million euros from Germany; the money was to be handed over by the German wife of one of the hostages.
The daily "El Masri El Jom" reported, citing one of the German intermediaries, that the release of the hostage was being delayed because the kidnappers were worried about their safety.
According to this report, the kidnappers wanted to release female hostages after paying the ransom.
The men were to be held until the hijackers had a safe escape route.
The German Embassy in Cairo declined to comment on the report.
Police release name of accident victim
The name of a 63-year-old woman who died in hospital after being hit by a car in Essex has been released.
The accident at Shenfield Road in Brentwood on Friday afternoon affected Carole Paulson of the Chelmsford Road there.
She was taken to Queen's Hospital in Romford, but later died.
After the accident, a 51-year-old man was detained on suspicion of reckless driving.
He's already been released on police bail.
Abuse by stepfather "lead to suicide"
The years-long abuse by his stepfather led the woman to kill herself, she said in court.
After pleading guilty to eight sexual harassment cases, Michael Trerise, 57, from Stithians of the Cesat, Cornwall, was sentenced to six years.
The Truro Crown Court heard that he had regularly bound his step-dead daughter, Stephanie Randle, when she was between the age of five and seven.
"I feel responsible for her death," Treris wrote in a confession.
The court also told that Ms. Randle killed herself at her home in Mutley, Plymouth, on April 1, 2007, at the age of 34.
When she lived in Coventry as a child, Trerise was tied up and blindfolded by her eyes and subsequently sexually abused while her mother worked in a pub.
Treris divorced his wife in the 1980s and returned to Cornwall.
His stepdaughter went to Plymouth.
However, it was said in court that Miss Randle, who spent the bulk of her time as a volunteer for the National Trust, was persecuted by the spectre of abuse that had been committed to her twice a week.
Prosecutor Ramsey Quaife said in court that in 2006 they called friends of Miss Randle, who was also very much involved in surfing and cycling, that she was "emotionally dead" and that she "relipped to life."
In April 2007, her real father, Terrance Randle, found her dead in her flat in Plymouth.
She's sued for choked to have a plastic bag.
The story facedown of his daughter's stepfather, who wrote a confession that ended with the words: "I binded her and bound her eyes.
"I didn't use it.
I feel responsible for her death."
Judge Christopher Elwen told Treris, "You're an extremely strange fetishist, and it must have been horrible for your sacrifice to be only seven years old.
"This unpleasant story ends with the victim taking her own life.
Even more terrible is the fact that if she had not done so, the matter would probably not have reached court at all."
"I would particularly like to highlight the consequences that, according to Stephani's parents, your crime has had on their daughter over the years," he added.
"Aofan otherwise she would probably be a promising, successful, happy young woman."
The official who lost the data will be charged
The BBC has learned that a government official who left top-secret documents on the train in June will be charged under the State Secrets Act.
The man in question left two top-secret documents on the train to Waterloo at the time he was temporarily assigned to the Ministry of Defence.
The documents were placed in the hands of the BBC before they were handed over to the police.
It is the least serious offense against the aforementioned law, and there is no indication of criminal intent.
The BBC's Defence Affairs correspondent, Frank Gardner, said such a move would be surprising to many in Whitehall.
"They probably thought the matter was being handled internally between the Ministry and the Cabinet Office," he said.
A staff member who may not be appointed is charged under Section 8.1 of the Act in question, a clause dealing with the protection of information.
The Crown Prosecutor recommended the Metropolitan Police indict the official on the very sensitive nature of his work in the Joint Intelligence Committee.
The documents he had forgotten contained secret analyses of Al-Qaeda and the capabilities of the Iraqi security forces.
He was informed of the decision on Monday morning and was moved from home to an unknown location.
Cooperative credit unions face B&B debt
British co-leavers may have to deal with more than £80 million in debt after the bailout of Bradford & Bingley Bank.
The government has provided £14 billion to deposit protection for the deposit of 2.6 million clients at Bradford & Bingley.
The interest of this loan will be repaid by all firms taking client deposits, including 59 credit unions.
The Director General of the Association of Credit Blades (BSA), Adrian Coles, said it was "fat." that the credit unions and their members must pay.
The $18 billion debt will eventually be paid for the rescued Bradford & Bingley mortgages.
But the interest rate that is accumulated in the meantime will be repaid each year by all 700 financial firms that take client deposits.
Fund The BBC's cash service compensation plan confirmed that all 59 credit unions are included in this issue.
It is humbling that these institutions, which behaved judiciously... must now pay off some of the accounts of those institutions that were not nearly so considerate
Adrian Coles, BA
He said that each firm should pay proportionally to the deposits it held, and that the backers were to pay about 18% of the price.
The Treasury estimates that the interest on the debt will rise to £450 million in 2009.
This means that the credit unions will have to find £81 million to repay the interest from the first year.
Adrian Coles, CEO of the Co-Salconteic Co-Banking Association, told the BBC that he believed it was not fair.
"It is humiliating that those institutions that behaved judiciously during the boom in the housing market now have to pay off some of the accounts of those institutions that were not nearly as judicious."
According to the BSA, no credit union has fallen since they appeared in 1945.
"We will have to examine all aspects of this matter over the next few weeks to see what are the possibilities to protect the credit unions and their members from an account that might be relevant," Cole added.
The interest due in 2009 covers seven months from the end of this September to the end of March this year.
In 2010, it will be up to the repayment of interest for the whole year and that could be almost twice as much.
As credit unmissions are shareholder-based creditors, this account will eventually be paid by their members through higher fees or lower interest rates in their accounts.
Turkish diplomatic horse expands
Long before Turkey began to seek to join the European Union, European powers longed to penetrate deep into the Turkish locks.
On the east bank of the Bosphorus, perhaps only twenty paces in Asia, one of the best monuments of this failed imperial ambition stands.
The Hydarpaša railway station was designed by two German architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu in the neo-Renaissance style.
That's what the tourist guides tell you.
The building sits a cicatched at the end of the platforms with a tower on each corner of the front, at a glance indistinguishable from some provincial German town hall.
Stone is dirty.
The whole structure is slowly falling apart.
But once you get inside the vaulted cash register, one can no longer have a doubt about the size of the establishment of which it was the westernmost gateway of the station.
The station was opened in August 1908 by the German consortium of Anatolian-Guydad corporation.
Germany, which was involved in the game of empires late, intended to implement its ambitions to take over the Middle East through the help of this railroad, which was to lead to Damascus, Baghdad and beyond, the territory that is now Saudi Arabia.
But the German imperial ambitions collapsed during the First World War.
Their tracks were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his irregular units.
Relative isolation from surrounding territories, created by the frozen boundaries of the Cold War, is gone
British and colonial forces advanced from Egypt, displaced the Turks and their German allies from Palestine and Syria.
And there were bad news for Hydarpasha station.
In 1917, the explosion of the an al.munition train destroyed its elaborate roof.
Turkish sources say it was sabotage.
Since then, it has gradually crumbled and history has been circumvented.
But today, this gateway to Anatolia and farther east serves - at least symbolically - to highlight the widening hornes of Turkish diplomacy.
The ruling Justice and Development Party - the AKP - has created a whole new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation from the surrounding territories, created by the frozen boundaries of the Cold War, is over.
A new policy is now being applied - Turkey is engaged.
It is remarkable that the Turkish government has good relations with Israel and Syria, with the Palestinian factions of Hamas and Fath, with Iraq and Iran, and, of course, with the European Union and the United States.
In order to review the parameters of this new policy, I boarded a night train to the Turkish capital, Ankara, where I was to meet one of the AKP's leading foreign policy experts, the Turkish MEP Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning - about ten and a half hours later - after a bumpy ride on the tracks that recalled the old-fashioned rhythms of the well-known documentary Night's Post, I arrived in the Turkish capital, designed as a new city for a secular state that wants to turn its back on its Ottoman's past.
But the AKP, with its well-known Islamist roots, represents a shift in the paradigms of the Turkish consensus.
It aroused suspicion in the west, especially in Washington.
The taxi brought me to the main AKP tent, the ultra-modern stone and metal building, deliberately built on the developing suburbs, surrounded by half-built shopping houses and power-shrings, where medium-sized managers in commercial suits - men and women alike - meet to make early morning shops.
Suat Kiniklioglu could well be a center-right politician from nearly every other European political party.
The jacket, the tie, I'm sure he had a Blackberry, too.
"The goal of the party's foreign policy is to reintegrate Turkey to its immediate surroundings.
The Cold War was an anomaly," he told me.
Turkey has been cut off from its zámezí.
Today, they must look east and west at the same time.
It was no choice.
It must have done both.
"But surely the moment will come," I asked, "when will Turkey have to make a decision?"
"Turkey," he said, "it was not to be that a decision-making made."
He then stressed what almost everyone I spoke to here said almost from memory: Turkish relations not only with the Middle East, but also with the Caucasus and the surroundings of the Black Sea, are equally to the benefit of Europe and the United States as Turkey.
With Turkey on board, it seems that Europe as a whole can, metaphorically put, take these tracks to the east of Asia and the Middle East.
Back at Hydarpasha Station, after another mostly sleepless night, I thought of the two German gentlemen Herr Ritter and Herr Conu who watched this building be built a century ago.
How they would be surprised if they found out that European ambitions in the Middle East could now, in a substantial part, be in Turkish hands.
And as I waited at the port for the ferry back through the Bosphorus, I remembered that in those days, Turkey was called the 'sick man of Europe'.
So, at least then, there was little doubt about which continent would be entitled to this fascinating country.
Milk up by fivep in a litre
The people in Jersey may have to pay more for the milk.
The Jersey Dairy has announced that it will increase the wholesale price of its milk by five pc per litre from Monday.
This is the second price increase this year, after a two-priced hike in February, and it comes after research conducted by a consultancy.
Retailers are to decide for themselves whether they want to reflect the hike in customer prices.
Before the February increase, the wholesale price of Jersey's milk was last changed in 2002.
Bail for Bangladeshi ex-PM rejected
A Bangladeshi court has rejected former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina Vajidova's request to be released on bail, which means that if she returns to her homeland, she may be arrested.
Her lawyers said the court refused to release her on bail in connection with the charge that she had been blackmailed by extortion over fifty million taka ($797,700) when she was prime minister.
The case is one of several allegations of corruption against it.
Khalida Zijá, a longtime political rival to Sheikh Hasina, was released on bail earlier this month.
Sheikh Hasina is to return to Bangladesh within the next few weeks, but her party, the People's League (Awami League), has demanded that the local army-held government first give her complete freedom.
The letterters say that while she was released on her word of honor to be able to undergo a medical procedure abroad, it is not clear, according to the conditions of her release, whether she will remain at large when she returns to Bangladesh.
Her lawyers say she will now appeal the High Court's order to the Supreme Court.
"The High Court rejected Sheikh Hasina's request for bail, saying he did not need bail when he is already undergoing examinations released abroad for a solemn declaration," said her lawyer, Rafique-ul Huq.
"We will appeal to the High Court order."
Her lawyers said she needed bail to return to the country from abroad to prepare for the December election.
A senior People's League official said Sheikh Hasín was to return home after October 17.
She was detained last year after the military-held interim government took power, but was released from prison in June to allow for medical intervention abroad.
Both Sheikh Hasina and Khalla Ziaya have both dismissed all the charges against each other.
Fear of polio vaccination in Afghanistan
According to the United Nations, nearly 200,000 children have not taken part in a recent blanket armored vaccination for violence associated with the Taliban.
The UN last week conducted vaccination in six provinces.
However, she says she could not have reached children in the south in parts of Helmand and Kandahar for safety reasons.
A UN spokesman said that this happened despite the Taliban's promises that it would not attack or prevent them from underwkeeping thousands of vaccinatory workers.
BSkyB loses ITV lawsuit
BSkyB lost a court case to review the Commission's decision by ordering the firm to reduce its stake in the competing broadcaster ITV.
The Competition Competition Tribunal, BSkyB, ordered that it reduce its stake in ITV from 17.9% below 7.5%.
The Commission previously stated that BSkyB's share had been thwarted by the competition and gave the company a disproportionate influence on ITV.
BSkyB bought the stake in a deal that prevented NTL, now renamed Virginia, from being named for Virginia, to buy ITV in 2006.
In April 2007, the Fair Trading Authority announced that BSkyB's acquisition of a stake in ITV had given rise to doubt the independence of ITV and called on the Competition Commission to open an investigation.
Virgin consortium chief Sir Richard Branson, consumer organisation and regulator Ofcom were all against the purchase.
BSkyB argued that the forced reduction in its stake in ITV was unreasonable and disproportionate as a solution - primarily because BSkyB had previously said she was willing to relinquish her voting rights.
A new investigation into the affair of American attorneys
The U.S. Attorney General has appointed a special plaintiff to examine the release of nine U.S. attorneys in 2006.
The draw came in a situation where the report on the affair by the Chief Justice inspector criticized the activities of government officials.
The report criticized White House officials, lawmaker and former Attorney General Alberto Gonzals.
The investigation was spraysen by fears that the attorneys had been removed for political reasons.
Special Prosecutor Nora Dannehy will now investigate whether the officials questioned interrogated to investigators during the investigation lied to the investigators in order to obstruct justice.
Inspector General Glenn Fine said in the report: "The allegations, including the potential criminal conduct, have not been fully investigated or explained."
The appointment of a special prosecutor with the power to force witnesses to testify was one of his key recommendations.
The dispute began when the U.S. Department of Justice stripped nine U.S. attorneys of their office in December 2006.
At the time, the ministry said the attorneys had been fired because of their poor performances.
However, it was later revealed that the dismissed attorneys were no worse rated than many of their colleagues, leading many observers to conclude that the redundancies were motivated politically.
Some of the attorneys were involved in the prosecution of high-ranking Republican deputies and senators, while others refused to investigate the allegations of deception against the Democrats.
American attorneys are investigating and conducting lawsuits in court cases for the government.
They may be released at any time but shall not be removed for political reasons.
The then head of the Ministry of Justice, Minister Alberto Gonzales, came under fire for the redundancies and eventually resigned.
A number of other Justice Department officials have also resigned.
The Inspector General's report was very critical of Gonzales' role in the affair, saying he bore "main responsibility" for the layoffs, of "abdwable" from his leadership position and "recommended not to engage in the action."
Other officials, including former senior Bushov adviser Karl Rove, have been criticized for not cooperating in the investigation.
Meat Loaf's ghone will be honoured
Rock star Meat Loaf will receive one of the Q Awards for her epic anthem, Bat Out Of Hell.
The singer, who will be attending a ceremony in London for his special gold prize, said he had been "honored" with the recognition.
The song, which lasts for nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title track of Meat Loaf's 1977 hit album.
The nomination for this year is led by Coldplay, which has been shortlisted in four categories.
Paul Rees, the chief editor of Q Magazine, said, "There are some songs that stand over such things as time and genre, and Bat Out Of Hell is certainly one of them."
The song, written by Jim Steinman, needed the big vocals provided by Meat Loaf.
It began the instrumental part, which took almost two minutes.
The song was released in Britain in 1979 as a single and reached the highest in 15th place.
But Meat Loaf's album Bat Out Of Hell was in the charts for about nine years, and sold more than forty million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf - real name Marvin Lee Aday - has suffered from health problems in recent years, and was operated on in 2003 for irregular heart rhythm after collapsing on stage.
In 2007, acute laryngitis forced him to cancel concerts.
It was later revealed that he had a cyst on his vocal cords.
Obscure streets, often forgotten and perhaps soon for sale
New York City has thousands of roads, streets, highways and other roads, some famous, some only utilitarian.
But even many taxi-veteran and longtime locals have difficulty finding the Extra Place, mostly because they've never heard of it.
This little alley is in the East Village district and leads north from First Street - without making it to Second Street - between the Bowers and Second Avenue.
With a width of about ten and a length of forty meters, it is more like a dusty passage than a traffic loroury.
There are no street signs.
In a regular atlas, it's virtually invisible.
Nevertheless, the aisle has an aisle of admirer.
For example, Avalon Bay, the developer of the recently built luxury buildings on First Street.
He wants to redistravate Extra Place and create a cleaner passage to the shops and boutiques to be opened in the new buildings.
Other admirers are longtime neighbours who say they were enchanted by the shortened alley simply because it was one of the last vestiges from before the block was refined.
But the city's Office for the Protection and Development of the Instruction, which has the street in its power, has no interest in sticking to it.
At a meeting of the Municipal Community Land Committee, representatives of the Municipal Authority and Avalon Bay outlined a plan to buy the street.
However, according to Suzan Stetzer, the district manager of the Municipal Community 3, the committee favours the possibility of the street remaining in the hands of the city and has requested a new plan to be submitted next month.
"The city already owns very few land, and we'd like Extra Place to be held," she said.
"Cons proposed for the correction and administration could be made by Avalon, but we also want to guarantee public accessibility."
Avalon Bay announced a few months ago that it wanted to redesigned the small street and install seating seats, several of which would be used by the café, which the developer expects to be interested in renting the premises.
The idea that Avalon Bay could buy the street was first published at a meeting this month.
Michele de Milly, Avalon Bay's spokeswoman, said that although the company wanted to use the street, he did not necessarily want to own it.
"The main intention of Avalon Bay is to repair this rustled aisle and make it a beautiful place for the public," she said, adding that the sale had been proposed by the city.
Seth Donlin, a spokesman for the Office for the Conservation of the Development, said the city had indeed wanted to sell the street, noting that his office's job was to develop the property rather than to manage it.
Compared to its more colorful neighbor, Bowery, Extra Place, it has left a shallow mark in history.
Some people think the street got its name in 1802 when Philip Minthorne's large farm was divided among several of his children and no one made a claim to the narrow strip of the country.
The rear door of the CBGB, a punk rock monument that closed in 2006, led to Extra Place, and the alley is perhaps best known as the backdrop of a photograph on the cover of the band's album "Rocket to Russia."
"The place was amazing," says Danny Fields, the Ramones' manager who took the photo in November 1976.
"It was full of garbage, torn clothing and chunks of barrels, posters, leaves, and ropes."
Some locals, including bloggers who write about refining the East Village district, oppose the idea of selling Extra Place and claiming that the public piece of public property, albeit meager, should remain public.
Others see Extra Place as a rarity - an almost unchanged piece of the city, which should be left as it is.
Jeremiah Moss, who writes a blog named Jeremiah's Junger-Fighting New York (with the subtitle "The Book of the Wors' Clamps: a bitterly nostalgic view of the city in the process of extinction"), posted part of the story of the Extra Place from the Speaking of the City column, which appeared in The New Yorker in 1952.
The author of the article, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a narrow cul-de-sac, dark and day-old and bounded by rusty iron doors of warehouses and hammered windows where a week-old newspaper is run in the grocery store."
With a few exceptions, the aisle looked exactly the same one in the evening.
The rat ran across the culp-death of a street close to the door that once led to the CBGB, where the expensive clothing store now stands.
There was graffiti on the walls, and next to a fresh batch of the disbanded newspaper lay an empty beer bottle.
A few passers-by said they rarely thought at Extra Place, but suggested that a boost might come in handy.
Fields, on the other hand, said he thought some people underestimate the aisle's impressiveness in its current state.
"The best years of my life," he said, "it's been dark, wet and disgusting in places."
Debate on bilingvalita: immersion in English
In this edition of the section Focused on Education, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi will discuss the candidates' position on bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, an academic in California and director of education at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is co-authored "Horchhhmad than you think: why the middle class needs to choose schools."
Effectively appealing to Hispanic voters is a tricky business.
Barack Obama's educational agenda only proves this.
The Obama campaign observes that "Afro-American and Hispanic students are significantly less likely to graduate than white pupils," which is true.
To combat such performance differences, Obama's educational agenda promotes, among other things, "transitional bilingual education" for those who are just learning English.
But the question for Barack Obama is whether his commitment to bilingual education, which emphasizes the use of languages other than English, is not stronger than his interest in reducing performance differences.
Consider, for example, the Sixth Street Prep, a charter primary school in Los Angeles County East.
Pupils of this school are, in the vast majority of cases, Hispanics from low-income families.
More than a third of the students, many of whom have only recently arrived, are only learning English.
Even so, in the state's math tests in 2008, an astonishing 100 per cent of fourth-grade pupils reached the highest level.
Almost the equally amazing ninety-three percent of fourth-grade pupils reached the highest level in state tests from the English language and literature.
This incredible achievement was achieved by a different method than that preferred by Obama.
Sixth Street emphasizes control and practice, constant assessment of abilities and access without excuses.
Further, and this is what Obama should note, according to Linda Mikels, the director of Sixth Street, the school's teaching approach for those who are just learning English, is "full immersion."
The immersion in English highlights the almost privileged use of English in teaching.
Ms. Mikels, who is against bilingual education, told me, "We had tremendous success with a brand-new Mexico student - after twelve months, you'd go into the classroom and not know which one it is."
"It works," she said, "it works for us."
Would Obama would take the school as a role model for the school, what should other schools with large shares of Hispanic and English-edchary pupils look like?
The results the school is up to be made of the answer to this question should take the obvious, but the educational agenda of his own party (the National Education Association is a long-standing proponent of bilingual education) and his own consistent support for bilingual education is unclear to the pretense of Obama's answer.
While Obama agrees that immigrants should be taught in English, he recently trivialized the matter when he said that people should stop worrying about "only English" laws.
Instead, "you should make sure your children speak Spanish," he said.
If Obama really wishes to erase the performance gap, he should think carefully about the educational patterns that work, rather than mock them and trivialize them.
Oil plummeting due to renewed economic concerns
Oil prices fell sharply on Monday on fears that even a US plan to rescu the financial markets might not revive the economy.
Prices for term-market in oil fell in the morning trading of the New York Commodity Exchange by as much as 7 percent to $99q8 per barrel.
Since last Monday, prices have fallen by more than $20 a barrel.
In the past two weeks, commodity markets have been shaken by the financial unrest on Wall Street, as well as a pair of powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After reaching a high of $145.29 per barrel in July, prices fell to almost $90 a barrel this month earlier, then the financial market's tremendous uncertainties jumped back on the wave of financial market uncertainty.
The anxiety gripped investors again on Monday, even after the Congress Bureau announced that it had reached an agreement over the weekend for the biggest bailout plan in history.
This report was overshadowed by the fresh fears that the financial crisis was far from the end.
In the latest episode of the advancing decomposition, the government announced that Citigroup would buy the banking section of Wachovia Corporation.
Meanwhile, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourgian governments have partially nationalated the European financial conglomerate, Fortis.
Barclays Capital analysts said the frantic weekend negotiations that led to the plan to save the economy "found in a market mood are showing themselves incapable of reviving the mood of the market."
As the economic situation deteriorates, demand for commodities, including oil, is expected to fall.
"Search for global stock markets, interest rates and exchange rates have become severely insecure," Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a report to investors.
"We believe the commodities will not be able to escape the disease.
From a commodity perspective, our biggest concern is the extent to which the American virus will spread worldwide and especially to China."
The bank's analysts have cut back on their expectations for next year, with oil consumption falling due to slower growth in the economy, and downgraded its oil price forecasts for 2009 by about 20%.
Wild Ride in the second quarter broke the team's record
Having spent more in the Jets for the last eight seasons than anyone else, defenseman Shaun Ellis thought he'd seen it all before.
Then, on Sunday, he watched the development of the second quarter, in which the Jets turned a scoreless play into a spanking drive.
"I've never seen anything like it," Ellis said.
The second quarter began after the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals equalled their torch-tour with their torted game to the gloomy clouds above.
Then quarterback Brett Favre sent out Laveranues' 12-yard dropdown sprint to make a 12-yard slidown sprint, heralting perfectly in the afternoon in which their progressive collaborations moved miles ahead.
Favre sent out the Colesse in that quarter for two more touchdowns, including the one in which the cornerback fell, and the next 10 seconds before the halfway point of the game.
"It wasn't extraordinary," Favre said of all his passes to Coles.
"He's a hell of a good player.
We've been very good to communicate, whatever people think."
While Favre and Coles were in the woods, the defense attacked quarterback Cardinals Kurt Warner.
Cornerback Darearelle Revis caught a stray throw and returned it to a touchdown 32 yards.
Safety Eric Smith picked up another pass and intercepted it.
Linebacker David Bowens forced Warner into fumbles.
The last loss of the ball, the fumble that the Bowens forced, was perhaps the best ever.
The Cardinals came to the ball 10 seconds into the game, and after the Jets got the ball back, Jay Feely kicked a 20-yard goal from the field, giving a 34-0 lead.
That's the most the Jets have ever gotten in one quarter.
Jets coach Eric Mangini, when he was asked to describe the madness, said, "A second quarter or third quarter?"
When he was told that both - the Jets allowed 21 points in the third quarter without an answer - Mangini said, "I can tell you that I enjoyed the second quarter much more than the third.
It scored many points in a short space of time."
Rested by Gebreselassie improved his world record
Haile Gebreselassie of Ethiopia again showed why many consider him the best long-distance runner ever, when he broke his own world record in the Berlin marathon on Sunday and became the first person to run a 26.2-mile race in under two hours and four minutes.
With a victory on a pleasantly flat track at 2:03:59 to overcure by 27 seconds of his previous time of 2:04:26, which he ran in Berlin last year.
Gebreselassie, who is 35, set the 26th world record for his career, which is truly incredibly wide - breaking the world record or at least being the world champion at all distances from the metric mile to the marathon.
Last month, Gebreselassie skipped the Olympic marathon in Beijing because he was - perhaps too alarmed in retrospect - that the polluted air would irritate his asthma problems.
Instead, he promised to run in Berlin.
In almost perfect conditions - sunny and 48 degrees at the start, 55 degrees at the finish - the Gebreselassie won on Sunday with a lightning-distnitial diameter of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile.
What the track runners like Gebreselassie and Paul Tergat from Kenya have focused on longer runs have dropped the marathon record by more than two minutes in the past decade, since Ronaldo da Costa of Brazil won in Berlin at 2:06:05 in 1998.
After Sunday's victory, Gebreselassie told reporters that he had cramps in his calf's back two weeks ago and missed a week of practice.
The break was evidently more likely to wake him up than delay.
"I'm so happy," Gebreselassie told reporters.
"Everything was perfect.
I started again a week ago and I was a little bit of a doubt today, but everything was fine."
He was also criticized - mainly in Kenya, the East African rival of Ethiopia - because he was said to be over-plan planning his races, generally avoiding the world's marathon top, relying on conductors as if it were a track race, and setting world records above the sense of the competition.
But this criticism can hardly reduce Gebreselassie's enormous running quality.
Maintained at a pace of four Kenya, Gebreselassie reached the half at 1:02:04.
After the conductors dropped the willows, Gebreselassie was constantly chased by two elite Kenyan runners James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi.
A little earlier than three miles from the finish, Gebreselassie took his last time and ran away from Kwambai, who then ran in second place at 2:05:36 to improve his personal best by almost five minutes.
Kamathi finished third at 2:07:48.
In the women's race, the seventh fastest time in history completed the only fastest time in history 2:19:19, Irina Mikititnková, a native of Kazakhstan who is now a citizen of Germany.
The record time of 2:15:25 is held by Paula Radcliff of the UK.
The 36-year-old Mikitěnko surprisingly won the London Marathon 2:24-144 in the London Marathon last spring.
She missed the Beijing Games because of something that was described as a back injury but recovered and won in Berlin and improved her personal best by almost five minutes in the third marathon she had ever run.
She ran the race cleverly and thoughtfully: she let the four Ethiopian and Kenyan cross-country skaters escape into a big lead, and then dragged them down after about 18 1⁄2 miles.
Askale Tafa Magarsa of Ethiopia came second in 2:21:31 and Helene Kiprop of Kenya finished third in time 2:25:01.
The pride and obstacles to the life of blacks in a separate city
Hidden among the rafting amusement parks of the larger Orlando, a few miles from all shining, loud and vast, lies a quiet city in which the pride and difficulty of African-American life comes to life.
Eatonville, the first completely black city to be incorporated into the state and where Zora Neale Hurston spent her childhood, is no longer as simple as she described it in 1935: "a city of five lakes, three crocet playgrounds, three hundred brown skins, three hundred good swimmers, a shortage of quows, two schools and no prisons."
Now it's a pilgrimage site.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee came to the annual Easter Easter Edmonton Zora! to compliment Hurston, the most famous female writer of the Harlem Renaissance.
The city she described remains sidelined, even though she made it a tourist stop by including him in a Florida-born tourist guide created by the Federal Writers project from the economic crisis.
She is still as independent, dignified, and private as she was in the 1930s, when Hurston wrote that rural blacks in Florida often resisted and did not share their true feelings with a white man who "white knows about us that he doesn't even know what he's missing."
Even today, in the year when the black presidential candidate, Senator Barack Obama, calls for an open debate on races, many of the residents here remain cautious about the views of the foreign.
"We pay great attention to how our story is told," says 59-year-old Hortense Jones, who has lived here since birth and is a member of the city's oldest parish.
"It must be right."
Eatonville has long been characterized as a paradox of triumph and exertion.
It is both a historical model of the black rise and the community of nearly 2,400 people, where the poverty rate is double the national average.
It is a centre of literature, but also an oybeat example of Southern rural black culture - sometimes despised, sometimes praised - that arose from American slavery.
It is not too surprising that the residents here are both proud as well as conservationists.
And the concern about the Eatonville idea really began with Zora, which is the only way Hurston is called here.
She presented her hometown to the world through heartfelt books full of dlight as "Mules and Men (Muly and Men)" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937).
Five paragraphs of the Florida tourist guide changed the city a short distance to Route 17, which runs through the often passed-down center of Florida, in the dais on the stage of black history and human drama.
With the vigour of a big drum in life and in literature, Hurston led the reader into the store of the first mayor of Inston, Mayor of First Mayor Joe Clarke, and then turned to more personal places.
"Octern the roadside the left," she wrote, "is a white brown-tuned modern national school with well-maintained backyards and playgrounds that Howard Miller always takes care of, even if he can't read or write much."
She also mentioned the widow's new husband, Dash, and wrote that Lee Glenn "sell drinks of all kinds and anything that fits into a one-hour hotel."
So, in just a few hundred words, Hurston linked Eatonville to self-government, but also to illiteracy, reinstabbating and sex.
This was obviously not the typical publisher Fodor's.
In fact, it wasn't a portrait that everyone would appreciate.
"Zora said it as it was," says ninety-year-old Ella Dinkins, one of the Johnsons' glee club, who made Hurston immortal by quoting men who sang dirty songs about their beauty.
"Some people didn't like it," she added.
Hurston is still remembered here as a chipper-based eccentric, which she often returned after her family moved to Jacksonville, Florida.
Seventy-seventy-seventy-severed Augustus Franklin remembers that for the most part, when she came to town, arriving unannounced in a huge Chevrolet, smoking and wearing trousers in a city that is still proud of her dignified dress.
Most of the population was fascinated, Franklin said, but many were sneer.
"People have always been happy to see Zora," Franklin said.
But, he added, swinging in a chair on the back terrace overlooking Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was most likely baptized, "it's never been for too long."
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were removed from the press.
Eatonville, along with the rest of the world, seemed to have forgotten her.
Although she was once a literary star, a contemporary of Langston Hughes and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in an unmarked grave in Fort Pierce, Florida, where she had lived.
There were no major mourners or big public readings in Eatonville.
"I don't think they understood its significance for the world or its legacy at all," said Valerie Boyd, author of the Hurston biography "Wrapped in Rainbows (Crapped in the Rainbows)" published in 2003.
The change came in the 1980s.
Orange County county officials wanted to use the city to stretch the city's five-lane highway instead of Kennedy Boulevard, a local two-lane main road.
The spraming of Orlando has already pushed the Interstate No 4 through the western edge of the city.
The proposal came at a time when Eatonville was still coming out of a difficult historical period.
Forced integration, along with other things, ended the relatively idyllic isolation of the community.
In the 1950s, the struggle to mix races brought hatred to the threshold of the community.
"At the time, a bunch of white boys, they came in and threw oranges and stuff at the people who were on the side," Franklin said.
"In fact, we had a lady who was killed.
They threw a watermelon out of the car."
In a 1955 letter to The Orlando Sentinel, Hurston questioned the Supreme Court's request for forced integration, and said of his decision in the Brown case against the Education Chamber that he was "insults rather than celebrating for my race."
Residents now claim that the desegregation of schools, although positive in some areas, reduced cohesion in Eatonville and undermined the courage of the local youth.
"The Blacksmash children were used to hugs - I remember - you hugged your teacher in the morning, you hugged your teacher in the evening," said N. Y. Nathiri, Ella Dinkins' daughter and executive director of the nonprofit group Preserve the Eatonville Community.
This lasted until the teachers and pupils came from the same place, she added.
"You're not hugging your white teacher because your white teacher - I mean, there's a cultural barrier," Ms. Nathiri said.
Nevertheless, civil rights have helped create a space for many more of Zora Neale Hurston - black writers, actors and artists who, like her, have risen above prejudice with reckless self-confidence and quotes such as "How anyone can deny the pleasure of my presence!
I don't understand."
In 1975, Alice Walker travelled to the unmarked grave of Hurston and began to fight to revive her reputation.
Five years later, a bookstore's hicculated biography of Hurston by Robert E. Hemenway came to the bookshop's bookshop, who re-enclamed her into the American canon.
The project with the highway arrived just as Eatonville's most famous daughter found the ramp lights again.
The Hurston's former neighbors now regarded her as a saviors.
To show what the state of ruin with its highway, the community began planning the Hurston Festival in 1988.
Thousands of fans arrived at the inauguration event two years later, and each January many are returning to the celebration.
The state backed away from the motorway proposal after several years.
"The five streams of the highway resurrected, you'd say it's detonated, real civic pride," Nathiri said.
Boyd said it more simply, "Zora saved Eatonville."
Victory over the motorway project helped change the city's image.
Outsims like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who began attending the church in 1993, began appearing in greater numbers, and residents began to rethro-evaluate the past.
Eatonville joined the National Historical Register in 1998.
The new one-story library (named after Hurston, of course) was opened in 2006 at the asphalted and beautified Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville remains a Florida anomaly: just six miles from downtown Orlando, it can sometimes act as a backwater alley in the summer rain, as small as when it was founded with only 27 black families in the 1880s.
(Today, 90 percent black.)
Strangers who come to find the story and the meaning of Eatonville are still often treated with caution.
Permission for most interviews is to have in advance and certain things - such as murals in the oldest Eysonville church, painted by white people and depicted by black people in the fields - are not allowed to be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Jones, the courageous, self-assured teacher who likes a deep red, still fear that their isolated community will not be properly understood.
And even as the Hurston festival got bigger, domestic pride has also increased.
Young people in particular tend to see Eatonville as Hurston saw her entire race: beautiful, with problems, and not better, not worse and equally proud, creative, hard-working, foolish, foolish, and varied, and varied as other American races and ethnicities.
The voice of Franklin's nephew, Edwin Harvey, 18-year-old, echoes a sincere love for the community as he plans to return to Eatonville after college to work in the local government or the police, who she says would take some help.
And even the younger ones, such as the 11-year-old twins from the Alondro Winter Park and the Alexia Kenon, they seem to have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
"Most people, if they just come through here, think, 'Hm, this town is nothing against the others,' " Alondra Kenon said recently after the church on Sunday.
"But if you really stop and look at history for a while, it's a very nice city."
Here in New York, we all speak fluently financially
At first glance, nothing has changed here.
If the tourists in Manhattan had stayed away from newsstands and the gigantic TV screens in Times Square, they wouldn't have realized they were standing in the middle of a storm.
They would never have guessed that in the glass-encreel of the offices above their heads, bankers and managers of investment funds monopolizing New York, the worst "bad day in the office" since the 1929 crisis, is on the back of the day.
The boutians are still rattling with metal carts down the sidewalks and transfer muffin baking trays to breakfast meetings.
Hispanics still move between the towers and wear, like human mules, the fifties of the scattered shirts that hang from the scales on their backs.
The office rats are still in line for their morning bagel at the street food stalls, and it's still impossible to get a yellow cab on a weekday on a weekday.
It didn't look like a crisis at all until I decided, with all the talk of pessimism, to set up a savings account on Thursday afternoon.
Even though I timed this task to take cover with a late-evening sesta at my local JP Morgan Chase branch, there were already about twenty people waiting in the queue.
Not in front of the cash-in out the cash windows to pick up or deposit cash, but in front of the counter where older clients order check books, tourists ask for directions to the Macy's convenience store, and new customers set up bills.
Most of the people before me, I learned from Starr, my "licensed personal banker," came for the same reason I did.
However, compared to me, they had already collected their savings from the smaller banks in the places from where they came from, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania or Staten Island.
They have raised money from the so-called thrifts (a little similar to the building societies), the monetary associations and the types of savings banks whose branches operate in only one state, and claim to take care of their customers as a family.
In the past year, 15 such banks have quietly failed.
A few days ago, Washington Mutual, a $327 billion in assets, went bankrupt to bankruptcy, and as the New Yorkers were returning home for the weekend on Friday night, another bank, Wachovia, with assets worth $440 billion, tried to catch a rescue buyer.
Employees of the offices and shops who stood in front of me and were afraid of another collapse were moving their cash to a bank that is seen as a safe haven and that makes most of the rescues on Wall Street.
Ordinary New Yorkers have learned fluent financially in the last week.
A woman at my local Chinese supermarket spoke on the phone and commented on Lehman Borthers, that bankrupt bank, and to her extinct senior executive, Dick Fuld, with such familiarity, as if she were jubilating about a lazy colleague.
And Lyn, a uniformed-and-fifty-year-old homeowel of my tenet, changed the subject of our ordinary conversation - Brad, Angelina or my food delivery.
After my visit to the bank, she said to me, "I now have my savings in the money market funds.
I've moved it, I won't risk it.'
Memorial Lives: Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes: As a Guildford musical director since 1962, Vernon "Tod" Handley (an unenforgivist, 11 September) was in charge of the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and Choir.
As part of the district's music plan, he founded a year on this by the excellent choir of young Proteus.
He was supposed to be under 21, but by the time the Proteus sang for the last time in 1979, there were almost 30 of us - we just refused to give up the choir.
The name "Proteus" (mythological shapeship in shape) represented the choir's willingness and ability to embark on any music presented to him - whether madrigals or Messiaen, either alone or with the entire orchestra.
The musical adaptability created by such a young choir was often astonishing, always exciting, all thanks to the inspiration of the one man and the enthusiasm for the music that remained completely unchanged throughout.
How often did Tod just tell us not to "let music speak for ourselves."
He said, "The director knows what he wants.
It's all in the music.
Sing it, then! "
His baton technique was crystal clear and precise, but neither dictatorial nor florid.
Wherever the musical standard was, he always raised it.
John Frayn Turner writes in :
If a conductor was to be knighted, it was Vernon Handley.
I knew him well in two decades, when he conducted the Guildford Philharominsky from 1962 to 1982.
Over the last 40 years or so, I've reviewed more than 100 of his concerts, and I can honestly say that I've never been disappointed in any of them - and I've been inspired many times.
Tod Handley had this great combination of size and personal modesty.
He hated conductors who, in his words, simply "drawed one or two soaked-in stones around the world."
Many of us will miss him.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
Your obituary for William Woodruff (September 25) claims that he "rephoned to the economic history of Oxford in 1946, and in 1950 he became a researcher at Houblon-Norman... while also studying for BSc, MA and PhD."
This is based on the author's rem remark in the Beyond Nab End, but it's not accurate.
From 1946 to 1953 he taught economic history at the University of Nottingham, and at that time he finished his dissertation on the British rubber industry, led by Professor J. D. Chambers, and subsequently published in 1958 as a publication by the British Rubber Industry.
He actually spent the years 1950-51 in America as a researcher at Houblon-Norman and the summer of 1952 at the Illinois, Harvard and New York University.
In 1953, he finally left Nottingham and went to Illinois.
It is not known why Woodruff has passed this part of his career.
Muslim graves desecrated after Austrian right-wing break
Heinz-Christian Strache, on the left, from Austria's right-wing Freedom Party and Filip Dewinter of Belgium's right-wing Vlaams Belang party, is attending a rally that presented the "Cities Against Islamization" in Antwerp on Thursday, January 17, 2008, to the "Cities Against Islamization."
They carry signs similar to the signlets that show mosques crossed out by the red line.
Police accuse right-wing extremists of desecration of a Muslim cemetery in Austria over the same weekend in which the extreme right-wing parties made huge gains in the general election.
Over 90 graves in the cemetery in the town of Traun, near Linz, were heavily damaged sometime between Friday evening and this morning, and police believe it was an organized event.
The culprits spray-painled Jewish symbols on some of the graves, such as David's star, but detectives believe it may have been an attempt to disguise the motives of extremists led by hatred of Muslim immigrants.
It is unclear whether this incident was linked in any way to the election.
A spokesman for the Islamic community here said they were "deeply shocked" by reports of the desecration that comes as the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan approaches.
Meanwhile, Austria is entering the round of its own soul search for its own after swinging to the right in yesterday's parliamentary elections.
The two far-right parties, which together won more than 30 percent of the vote, the Freedom Party and the Union for the Future of Austria, conducted a vehemently anti-immigration campaign, and some of their slogans were condemned by critics as xenophobic.
Heinz-Christian Strache, chairman of the Freedom Party, which won over 18 percent of the vote, protested against headscarves and burqa in the campaign, and even expressed his opposition to the foods in which a relationship to Islam is perceived.
At his last meeting with voters in Vienna, he spoke of a "European brotherhood" to prevent the rise of Islam.
Both sides are trying to ban the construction of mosques and minarets, arguing that they are the political symbols of the ongoing Islamization of Austria and Europe.
The polls and analyses carried out immediately after the election, which put the extreme right on the position of the country's strongest political bloc, suggest that this change was mainly due to young voters worrying about their future in the European Union.
Gary Glitter not allowed to go on a trip across the border
Gary Glitter, a glamrock star who was convicted of sexually abusing children, was banned from the court to travel to France and Spain.
Officials imposed this six-month ban on Glitter after informing monitoring authorities that he planned to travel via France to Spain.
Kent police were approved for travel ban last Thursday after handing officials evidence of Glitter's past child abuse convictions.
Glitter, real name Paul Gadd, did not attend the hearing at the Ashford-lower Crown Penal Court, but was represented by Corker Binning lawyers.
A spokesman for the judicial service said: "On Thursday, September 25, at Ashford's lowest criminal court, the Centail Police requested a regulation to prevent Mr Paul Gadd from crossing the border into France and Spain until 25 March.
Paul Gadd did not attend in person.'
The 64-year-old Glitter informed the authorities that he wished to travel abroad, as required by a sexual assault record.
He must notify the authorities if he wants to travel abroad for more than three days.
He must also hand over the scheduled departure date to the police a week in advance.
If he failed to inform the authorities, he could be sentenced to five years.
Kent police have announced that they will not hear individual cases of Glitter's possible trips around the district.
A spokeswoman for the Kent police said: "The Kent Police will do whatever is necessary to protect children in this country or abroad.
From our point of view, it is easier to see someone who stays in Britain, because we have large-scale systems that handle potential dangers more effectively.
Protecting the people of Kent is the top priority for the Kent police, and we are working carefully to monitor the behavior of the recorded sexual assailants in order to minimise any danger to the public."
Glitter returned to Britain last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for abusing two girls aged 10 and 11.
When he was released, he flew to Bangkok to join a flight to London.
But he said he was not feeling well and refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities did not let him pass through the passport check and eventually flew to Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities also refused to allow him to enter, and he flew back to Bangkok, where Thai police and immigration officials insisted on his return to Britain.
On August 22, he finally arrived at Heathrow Terminal 3 and remained there while his attorney, David Corker, went to Uxbridge's lowest criminal court in West London, while at the same time Scotland Yard successfully requested an order requiring him to register as a sexual attacker.
Glitter was previously imprisoned in the UK for four months for possessing child pornography.
A homeorous source from the Home Office said that Jacqui Smith, the Home Secretary, was calm and glad that Glitter had been prevented from travelling to France and Spain.
"To capture the real character, I take the master's picture off the scene." Günther Bauer - photographer
No heels, no ruffled or costumes.
Only the essences of the great masters of flamenco, disconnected from the focus on interpretation - just to get the relaxed expression of a man or a woman.
On the one hand, an artist.
On the other - man.
It will not be out of the out-of-coupe, in those moments away from the audience - a close gesture, a glimpse of the sight, or the passionate hand glamorous, can be seen in those moments because they are not about to appear on the scene.
German Günther Bauer alternates in the "Flamenco-people" theatrical performance with singers, dancers and guitarists with the lesser-known face of the masters.
With this intention, the photographer assemblies a unique flamenco iconography from different backgrounds.
The exhibition, which takes place as part of the programme Month of Flamenco Photograph (Mes de la Photographers Flamenco), "reflects the ever-growing international meaning of flamenco," says the author, explaining that "Flamenco-people" "may be any people, but when you look at the photographs, you will find that these are not typical pictures of artists on the scene.
These people portrayed "on the street" are artists capable of transfering passion, sadness, joy to the scene... and to completely captivate the audience.
To capture the personality of these artists, it is not necessary to take pictures on stage.
He wear his personality and character inside.
I was interested in creating a relaxed atmosphere that would allow me to capture the personality of the flamenco giants.
Enchanted by the "Cante de las Minas" festival, Bauer began a long journey in 1997 to portrait of flamenco singers, guitarists and dancers on a board camera.
These are portraits that, thanks to a selection of the camera and material, resemble a classic photo.
The application of different stylistic means is at odds with the film's classic basis and bestows on it with its current spirit, an idea that, according to Bauer himself, mirrors flamenco: "Music with very traditional roots, but which continues to surprise and evolve."
What tees off the audience is not the work of the dance itself, the singing or the play, but the personality and character of the artist.
The search for the moment when we encounter the most essential, the spirit that appears in the way of perception, being and experiencing, was and is a constant of the work presented during these days in the gallery El Fotómata.
This selection of nearly seventy-seamed artists is shaped by well-known flamenco characters such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales and Vicente Amigo, among others.
The project has become a kind of an anthology of flamenco and will soon receive a book edition that will include the exhibited portraits.
The passion for portrait led Bauer to the idea of repeating the idea of "SportARTproject" ("SportARTproject" on the idea of repeating the "SportARTproject" pair of sportsmen's ideas for the idea of repeating the "SportARTproject" of the sports veteran."
Although their concept is different from "Flamenco-people" that "take people, get to know them and have the opportunity to enter their lives for a moment, longer or just short - that's my passion.
I think the portrait is the most difficult genre in photography.
One encounters or encounters people, personalities who sometimes don't even know, or only give them a few minutes for a photo shoot.
Despite the circumstances of the like, as a photographer, I always try to realize my ideas."
A collection of contemporary flamenco portraits called "Flamenco-people" is on display at the El Fotómata Gallery in de la Mata 20 street parallel to the Alameda de Hércules, and can be visited until October 16.
Vargas Llosa admitted that the novel he writes was "trouper"
It takes place in an environment he does not yet know and tells of the events of the unknown to him, yet Mario Vargas Llosa intends to successfully implement his new project - he is currently working on a novel, whose main character is Roger Casemant, an Irish nationalist who has lived for twenty years in the Congo and also traveled to the Amazon.
The Eternal favourite of the Nobel Prize in Literature confessed at the Hay Festival Segovia at the Hay Festival Segovia that the project that currently employs him "is audacious," and that "everything suggests that I should not write" this novel.
"If I had any sense, I wouldn't do it, but I will do it and I believe I will finish it one day," he concluded at the festival's contribution to the exchange of ideas, ideas and words, which he saw in the city of an aqueduct over the four days in the city of an aqueduct of around a hundred writers, historians and journalists and thousands of other people.
The author of the novel "City and the Dogs" was one of the main characters in the third edition of the Word Festival and fulfilled expectations.
Vargas Llosa, who won the Hay Festival Award for the Most Popular Writer - the old edition of Dickens's "Our mutual friend" - filled the Juan Bravo Theatre to the last place.
With Félix Romeo, who introduced him, he had a resigned audience in front of him, with an hour of time passed like water - a Peruvian with an astonishing accuracy and a good deal of humor, recalled how, from the original "incredible adventure" of "the joy of a passionate reader" and from "to live more than what I have lived" gave birth to a literary mission; as he supersed the "lack of inspiration" by writing "disciplined," carefully saves text, correcting and rewriting; or influencing his writing by Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alexander Dumas, and what a "requirity" are the basic.
The Hispano-American novelist admitted that there is "no way" to find out if and to what extent books can change life, "but I refuse to believe that literature is just fun, a fleeting experience" - pointed out by Vargas Llosa, saying that he said it "acts to people" and "make them out of lineage," and called on the writers to "displave frivolity" and "take responsibility for themselves" of their mission.
Due to climatology, he loses the festival in Pozoblancu - a lacking of the spear
The spear performance, which concludes with the festivities in Pozoblanco, was cancelled yesterday morning after the performers' announcement was confirmed that the surface of the square was not in good condition.
That's why the company, along with Fermín Bohórquez, Pabloem Hermosa de Mendoza and Leonard Hernández, decided to cancel the bullfights.
The unfavourable weather conditions have plagued the festivities for a long time, with two of the three celebrations that could not take place.
On Saturday, the rain prevented the course of the second planned bullfighting.
During these, the formation of José Luis Moreno, Curro Díaz and Juan Bautista was to be built for the bulls in the arena at Castilblanc.
This was only celebrated on Fridays.
The winner was Daniel Luque, who cut off three ears and was brought to the shoulders by the reward for a dynamic and aesthetic and aesthetic-quality performance.
On the same afternoon, Alejandro Talavante exchanged two shots with spear for greetings and one ear, which was brought to him by the open-airing arena rather than the bullfighter's art.
Worse still, El Juli, who walked through the bullring's Los Llanos arena, ungreedy.
In the second round of toil without a breather, he received harsh criticism from most of the audience.
They went check-up in Álava in a van with 2,000 kilograms of hashish
Ten to five.
Road control of Ertzaintza in the district of Armiñón (Ala).
Members stop two people riding in a van and they are speeding away.
The cargo, more than two tonnes of hashish, is not to be stopped.
According to a report by the Department of the Interior of the Basque Government, members chased them and detained them from one of the people riding in the van, a man aged 38, who was identified as A.A.J.
The detainee was charged with drug smuggling and falsifying state documents.
The incident occurred when several Traffic Unit officers conducted a roadside inspection at the N-1 in what is where it passes through the border of the Armiñón district.
They were going to stop the van for the purpose of checking, but the driver disobeyed the instructions, accelerated sharply, and drove off.
The officers immediately began to chase the car until the vehicle pulled up to the side of the road a few miles away, at which point the two passengers jumped out and fled to the woodland.
Members of Ertzaintzy eventually caught up with one of them and confiscated 2,178 kilograms of hashish, which the suspects were transporting, as revealed during a search of the Iveco Daily van.
The rear of the vehicle was loaded with hashish bales, which were subsequently taken to other police departments for detailed expert and weighing the drug.
In addition, police have determined that the license plate is "squalted" and disagreed with the data provided in the delivery documents, the detainee was therefore also charged with falsifying state documents.
Ertzaintza continues to search for the second suspect, who, as already mentioned, managed to escape to finally determine the origin of the seized drug.
The detainee of A.A.J., 28, was taken to the police department to process the appropriate formalities before proceeding with a further investigation later.
Actress Heather Locklear detained for driving under the influence of medication
Actress Heather Locklear, the popular Amanda of Melrose Place, was detained in Santa Barbara this weekend for driving under the influence of medication.
A witness saw her perform unusual maneuvers while trying to drive out of the Montecito parking lot, a California Road Patrol spokesperson told People.
The witness clarified that around 4:30 p.m. Locklear "went on the gas, drove forward and backwards in a noisy roar, trying to get out of the parking space - running over her sunglasses several times as she backed down."
The witness, who did not seem to recognize the actress at first, saw Locklear moments after stopping at a nearby highway and getting out of the vehicle.
This person also alerted the emergency services because "wort feared for Locklear's life."
When a police patrol arrived at the scene, they found the actress inside the vehicle, which partially blocked the roadway.
"She looked disoriented," so the members took her to a specialized drug and alcohol center to submit to the test.
According to a police spokeswoman, the actress cooperated and excessive amounts of alcohol were immediately out of the question, yet "We believe that Locklear was under the influence of some drugs, which was evident to the officers at first glance."
Locklear was detained on suspicion of driving under the influence of the effects of an unspecified substance and was taken into custody around 7 p.m., although she was released a few hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear returned from a treatment clinic to recover from anxiety and depression.
Llamazares urges the Andalusian IU association to exercise its powers in the Silva case
The U IU chief and MEP, Gaspar Llamazares, told the General Courton that a final decision in the case of the former councillor of the Youth and Sport City Hall in Seville, Manucola Silva, who resigned from office last week after being accused of dealing for the benefit of his family, would be dependent on the party's regional association.
"I am too federalist for this, it is up to the Andalusian organization to exercise its powers," Llamazares suggested of the negotiations the party will have to proceed with in relation to a former member of the Sevilla City Council.
However, the IU chief insisted that in the case of the illegal conduct committed by Silva, "transparency" is absolutely necessary: "The U has always fought to make such matters as transparent as possible."
He also stressed that the party has a "strict code of ethics for all public functions."
"May Blood" ('Sangre de mayo'), an epic bet by Garcia
In "The May May de mayo," in the film "The May de mayo), which was inspired by Benito Pérez Galdós's Episodes from the national past, revives the Spanish's famous uprising against the French - the most ambitious film in his filmography with a budget of around €15 million.
In this way, the film-maker wanted to "store the architects of the characters' and analysis of the company" he always admired in the work of the famous novelist, he explained today, along with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría, during the presentation of the film in front of an extensive team of performers.
May's blood with a metre of over two and a half hours will be released in theaters this Friday, with a more than four-hour series for Telemadrid television in the future.
As a great admirer of Galdós' literary work, José Luis Garci claims to have fulfilled a "children's dream" by making this film, which is due to Esperanza Aguirre, who commissioned him to make a film for the two-egad anniversary of Madrid three years ago on the Autonomous Province of Madrid, he accepted the offer, saying that the plot would be based on the Epizods of the National Past.
The 15 million budget, to which the Madrid province contributed completely, means for Garci's "a unique opportunity" to create an environment with backdrops and costumes matching the image of "the crigging Spain, which was mistaken in the leader for whom he could fight - the struggle for independence led under the reign of Ferdinand VII to the decline and backwardness of the country," he said.
But the director regrets that he cannot count on the financial support given to the films The Sad Wing (Ala Triste) or Goya's Ghosts - almost double the May Blood - so he could not make some scenes from a script signed at the same time by Horatace Valcárcelo, with whom he works for almost the entire film career.
The director of the film "Start Again" (Volver a empezar) works as he is normally accustomed to - to the scene, along with the actors with whom he usually rehearsals before filming and who he does not choose by casting, because it seems "magnifying" and also believes that "part of the director's profession, it is, among other things, to go to theatres and cinemas and so learn what is happening in the craft he engages in the craft he deals with."
Many of the actors he selected for the May Blood appear in front of his camera for the umpteenth time, such as Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Garcia, with four Oscar nominations, one of whom he won, is of the opinion that none of the three candidates representing Spain this year before the Hollywood Academy, May's Blood, the Seven Tables of the French Bilire and the last selected Blind Sunflowers, does not represent the younger generation of the Spanish film scene, but claims that "it is yet to emerge."
For this film, Garci does not expect any awards.
"At first you think you work for what happens after that, but then you realize that you only work for the profit, so you submit to make one more extra film," explains Garci, with a career over 30 years of directing.
Isabel Bayón revives the spiritual legacy of Sevilla dancer Tórtola Valencia
The Seville flamenco dancer will pay tribute to another Sevilla dancer.
Carmen Tórtola Valencia, from the father of Catalan (Florenç Tórtola Ferrer) and mother of Andalusanka (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in the Triana district, and when she was three years old, she and her family moved to London.
She danced modern dance and focused on oriental dances.
She lived a life of passion, pioneering female emancipation like Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf, or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist and a vegetarian and fought to abolish the corset that made it impossible for women to move freely.
The life of this woman, influenced by the dance and aesthetic revolution of interwar Europe, was enchanted by Isabel Bayón.
"I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa, and she suggested this character to me - it seemed incredible."
According to the dancer, "I'm not about telling her life, it's about grasping the soul.
The name of her dance performances reminded me of the rhythms of flamenco.
So the "twent's butterfly" evoked me to me a guajir or a "det of snake's dance" some tango.
Her dancing was sensual and they told me that my dance also fits this aesthetic," he claims.
The show counts on the involvement of two exceptional personalities: with Miguel Poveda, who will sing to Isabel in one performance just as she did in the "Open Doors" (La puerta abierta), and with the teacher of the dance, Matilde Coral, who made an exception and agreed to cooperate with her former pupil.
"Matilde represents the older Tórtol, a mature figure.
I'm happy she's accepted the offer to participate in my project, and it's a great honor for me."
The performance also includes the music and guitars of Jesús Torres and Paca Arriaga, the singing of Miguel Ortega, el Pulgy and Moi de Morón; drums El Pajar, the viola of Rafa El Viola and the collaboration of actor Juanfra Juárez, "who plays the role of an eternal guide to this kind of female artists, who are prima donnams with everything, and who are always in love with them."
The work also takes into account the life of this woman, which took place for its time in such far-dimon-successful places as India, the United States or Russia, as well as across Europe, because she usually resided in London.
"I wanted to remind her because I think she was one of those women who have a huge influence at some time, but today no one knows her and appreciates her even less," says Bayón.
The show starts at 8:30 p.m. at the Lope de Vegy Theatre.
J. Vicente Resino at the Faculty of Arts
"I recommend the exhibition of José Vicente Resina's "Flamenco and Life" because his documentary black-and-white photographs are amazing.
They attrapped me with the simplicity and powerful charge with which it affects the audience, and the consideration and respect for the photographers.
An exhibition that shows many a feeling.
The Resin can capture magical moments."
The book "The Daily Married" closes with the trienele
The launch of the first illustrated edition of the "Freshly Married Daily" at Saint Stephen's Church (New York), where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in March 1916, is part of a program coordinated by the Cultural Council of the Autonomous Andalusian Government to celebrate the "Trienále Zenobie and Juan Ramón" (2006-2008), held to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the Nobel Prize in Literature and the Anniversary of Their Death.
"Trienle Zenobie and Juan Ramón" is coming to an end with the new release of this work, an international congress to be held in New York, the repair of the Nobel Museum House and the traveling exhibition "Juan Ramón Jiménez: The Sunbeat of the Sun," which was opened in May of this year, and should be moved to New York, and, after it has bypassed by various Andalusian provinces, it is planned to move to New York at the time of the congress.
The Cultural Council of the Autonomous Andalusian Government also commissioned eight hundred copies of the "Summan's Daily Married" adapted by Pedro Taberner and illustrated by Jacob Pérez-Encisis to continue to spread awareness of the personality and work of one of the most sultic Andalusian poets.
America without Paul Newman doesn't like it so much
"Sometimes God makes perfect people.
Paul Newman was one of them."
These are the words of actress Sally Field, who collaborated with him on "No evil intent" and, under the weight of the knowledge that Newman had left, reveals his plight of abandoned American cinema and all of America.
Look how it took them a while to get Oskar.
And that he had been retired since 2007.
And that he was known to be gravely ill.
He was a man for everyone, though.
"Sometimes you can't express what you're feeling in any way, and I've now lost a great friend," Robert Redford said tearfully, "my life and my lands have been better because of it."
No one was afraid of being ridiculous or exaggerate.
The father of the film and the country died at a particularly dark time of fear of terrorists and financial markets, at a time when American self-esteem is at the bottom, when the reasons for pride are desperately sought.
When the times are harsh and the people without virtue, and only a handful of those who are worth admiring - there is no need to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
For all, he embodied the almost platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was an official opponent of Richard Nixon and a champion of lost and won cases, from the Anti-Related Drug Addiction Foundation based on the honor of the firstborn son, who died of overdosing, to his own brand of home food and organic food.
A complete treasure for a country that has been taken to get away from the suicidal eating culture.
A stormy wave of admiration flooded Hollywood, regardless of nationality or nationality.
The last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, stated that it was not one man who died, but a whole era.
Another Englishman, Oscar-winner for directing Sam Mendes, said working with Newman was the highlight of his career without exaggeration.
The evil boy of Australia, Russell Crowe, dared to call Newman his greatest source of inspiration.
"The fox has set a pretty high bar for all of us," says George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who nowadays has the courage to try to live like the lives of Paul Newman - prides himself on honesty and leads a serious private life far from the cameras.
This is always not easy in today's media jungle, sometimes even possible.
But luckily, such people are, and Paul Newman is their role model.
He divorced once, and since then he has been married for fifty years with Joanne Woodward, to whom he was loyal, though he certainly had more than enough opportunities not to be.
"Why would I go out for a hamburger when I have a filet at home?" he liked to joke.
Let him be accompanied by pride in heaven that there is a marvel of the judging between his daughters and admirers on earth - it is not very common in America.
It is said that "of all the great roles he embodied were the most proud of the role of a devoted husband, a loving father, a willing grandfather and a dedicated philanthropist."
Imperfect races of Olympic Madrid
Yes, many of us are eager for the Olympics to be held in Madrid, and after the failed 2012 it will be possible 2016.
But I ask: are we ready?
If we're going to be in last night's race, I'm saying: no!
He was referred to as a perfect race, and in my judgment he was the worst I'd ever been on.
Such a bunch of nonsense that right away, if it came to the evaluation and I was the examiner, it would be clearly inadequate.
But let's look at it from the start, one at a time.
Nonsense starts with the pick-up of the racing number, for which you have to go first.
That doesn't seem bad to me, but when you go there, let them give them everything (including a chip to prevent overcrowding of the runway).
Oh, no.
Here you had to first pick up the number (first nonsense, go there only for that) and (after standing the proper queue) - what a surprise! - they only had a T-shirt of size S (the second nonsense, because I need the size of the XL).
Where are we living?
Did they decide to buy only small T-shirts because of the crisis, because it's less of a substance and they're cheaper?
Okay, of course, those are the little things compared to what happened on the day of the race.
In addition to the fact that it had to go for the chip very soon and the queue lasted for over 15 minutes, he had to hand himself over to the backpack there.
Over 35 minutes took the waiting time, which is something incomprehensible at the race where 11,000 people are expected.
So, as expected, the race started and we haven't put down our backpacks yet, and when we did, it was much worse with the pick-up.
In addition, the wait was extended by 40 minutes by the rain, leading to general rebel and attacking the cabin.
I believe that 500 of us will have bronchitis tomorrow and some like me will not be able to have the right time in the evaluation of the results because of the chip they gave me and which, I assume, did not correctly record for my start time.
Of course, if someone had asked me about a perfect race, this one would not have occurred to me.
And so I think we will have to dream of a well-prepared Olympic city.
Microsoft is looking for a receptionist (virtual)
At the MIT New Technology Conference, Microsoft demonstrated further developments in the new image recognition system and human interaction in the way of artificial intelligence - not very intelligent, but capable of performing basic tasks like summoning a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, a messenger to move around the company's premises) and perceive what he hears in the interview.
With the camera and the system that recognizes shapes and faces, this "recepening" can find out how many people are in the room, who are - even remember what they are wearing - and listen to and understand the keywords of their conversations.
He can also sort out the presenting groups by the conversational groups.
In a demonstration video, the receptionist records a third person and understands that she does not belong to the group that talks to her, and that she is not an employee of the company.
He asks her if she's going to see someone, and tells her he'll be attending to it in a moment.
All without the blue screen of death.
Treaking.
But that, of course, is the music of the future.
Now the company has more important things to do, such as a new version of the Windows operating system.
There was a lot of talk this week about a change in Microsoft's strategy.
Windows 7 will be lighter and not have as many associated programs.
Steve Ballmer had discovered that if computers had only the most necessary, no-therence of commercial uselessness, they'd be five times more efficient - man, Steve, they'd be cheaper.
Discover as thunder when you consider that Microsoft's version version adds new features and other "extra" to Windows.
Changing the course would be a worthy act.
Microsoft is right, the operating system is slowly losing its meaning, and so on is the software.
When Google Chrome appeared on the network, I became one of those who leaned toward the theory that this was Google's first move to a competitive contest with Windows.
Many have rightly pointed out that the browser is not an operating system.
The operating system will always be necessary because it is a necessary layer to communicate between the hardware and the software.
She has the same function as your wife or your husband when you have to say something to the mother-in-law.
That's true.
It never disappears, but it is necessary to think of the "death" of the operating system, not as an absolute truth, but of relative truth.
What Ballmer said this week confirms this idea.
People are paying less and less attention to the operating system and, conversely, to a more internet browser.
The computer is turned on to launch Firefox or Explorer - or Chrome - and we spend more time on the internet every day than around the windows.
What is the use of half of the applications that accompany the system?
Less is more.
And Windows 7 must be less, much less than Vista.
Less heavy, less loaded, less complex.
Microsoft is now keen to offer its online services and finally become an alternative to Google.
They desperately need it, and here's a small example.
I took this photo at a break room for Microsoft employees in Redmond at the beginning of the month.
There was a poster on the beverage machine that begs them to use their search tools: "Your search. Our future."
In 2006, an independent study showed that 66% of Microsoft employees used Google to search the Internet.
Last week, by the way, the delay in the new version of Windows Mobile 7 was confirmed.
It will not come at the beginning of 2009, but at the end, so let's count with 2010 instead.
At Microsoft, they will certainly try to launch Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 together.
The phone is becoming more and more computer.
With Android and iPhone already on the market, they will have to pay dearly for the delay.
Le Fabuleux Marcel
Pablo Picasso wore it to the Côte d'Azur, Leonardo di Caprio shone in one of Edward Zwick's "Blood Diamond" in Edward Zwick, as well as Al Pacino in Francis Ford Coppola's "Godfather," and is part of the uniform of the muscular gay community.
And if we want to embark on the list of his life roles, we can dive in the image of a typical, pointed moustache muscle that lifts weights in a nomadic circus.
Basically, it's no more than a typical cotton men's undercurrent, fitting and sleeveless.
The English speakers call him 'tank', but le Fabuleux Marcel from Brussels excel at all the others.
First, for his neck-and-tuming name - although he is popularly called 'Marcel' - which is related to sport, because, as the legend tells me, it was named after the boxer Marcel Cerdan, the lover of the singer Edith Piaf.
'Marcel' excels above the other quality cotton, unisex by edic, distinguishing the label and (almost unforgetable) Belgian flag, which have the models of the most-maothmatic tins as a detail at the neck.
And beware, because the Belgian firm is not only specialising on the tank tops.
It also includes college sweatshirts, retro boxers, cashmine sweaters, cotton pants, navy T-shirts, children's outfits, mini shorts...
Thoughtful stunts for comfortable underwear.
Although it's a shame to be just underwear.
They're too beautiful.
Honda hits for the second time with its bestseller
In the month of November, Honda will launch a second-generation Jazz.
If the predecessor of this single-space vehicle already had considerable space, it now offers an even more spacious interior.
This is joined by improved engines that increase the comfort of the ride and allow for greater fuel savings.
Evolution rather than revolution.
Such is the second generation Honda Jazz.
Although aesthetically, the lines of the new Jazza are very similar to the previous model, there have been many changes to this single-seat car.
It should be mentioned, for example, in innovative design, a new platform, larger dimensions and new engines.
Before we explore the new model, it should be noted that the new Jazz comes on the market six years after the launch of the first generation.
That's why the first thing we notice is that Honda needed a shorter period to rejuveni this model than other manufacturers.
Although the Jazz is a lesser-known model in Europe, it has become a phenomenon in other markets.
This is the case for Japan, the country where the Jazz was the best-selling car in 2002, as well as during this year's 2008 year.
It has been in Japan that nearly a million units have been sold since the launch of the Honda Jazz.
The second market became the old continent, with approximately half a million units sold in six years.
Honda, however, aims to boost sales in its category for the new Jazz.
Thus, while in 2007 the Japanese company sold a total of 83,000 Honda Jazz units, in 2009 estimates are projected to be 100,000 cars, which would mean an increase of 17% in the European market.
As far as the Spanish market is concerned, Honda has sold a total of 8,000 Jazz units since 2002, representing 6.7% of Honda's total sales in Spain.
As for the new generation of Jazz, the Spanish branch's management expects to sell 2,000 units for the whole year.
It is the arrival of the new Jazza that will make it possible for Honda to significantly ease the decline in sales in Spain.
The company's management thus de facto expects the year to be concluded with a total of 22,000 units sold, which is 4,000 fewer than in 2007 and a 16% drop.
Despite this increase in sales, Honda increased its share of the Spanish market to 1.8%, compared to 1.6% from last year.
In 2010, the Japanese firm expects to reach 2%.
To achieve this share, Honda is relying on the success of its next new model.
It is the Honda Insight, a five-door compact-size hybrid with a length of 4.37 metres, from which the Japanese company promises to sell around 200,000 a year worldwide.
As far as markets are concerned, the Japanese manufacturer estimates that 50% of Insight will be sold in the United States, while the remaining percentages will be shared between the old continent and Japan.
The launch of Honda Insight is expected to launch in the first months of next year as it is presented to the public in Valencia in January.
Compared to the first generation, the new Jazz has increased all dimensions.
Its length increased to 3.9 metres (by five centimetres more), a width of 1.69 metres (two centimetres more) and a wheelbase to 2.5 metres, which means an extension of five centimetres.
The height, on the other hand, has not changed and is still 1.52 metres.
The larger dimensions were also enlarged by the interior space.
This advantage was achieved both by using a new platform and by stowing a fuel tank in the middle of the car, which had already been used at the previous Honda Jazz.
Also, the luggage capacity - which has a double bottom system - increased to 399 litres, 19 litres more than the volume of the first-generation luggage compartment.
It should be noted that these dimensions occur with the 1.4 engine version, as the luggage capacity at the Honda Jazz 1.2 is 379 litres.
Another improvement, in addition to external features - such as rear LED lights or the possibility of equipment with a glass panoramic roof - is easier to access the rear seats.
The doors leading to the second row of seats allow an angle of opening of 80 degrees, compared to the first Jazz.
For the second-generation Honda Jazz, the engines are new.
At the outset, this small model will be offered with two 1.2 and 1.4-litre petrol engines.
Both engines use i-VTEC technology that allows lower consumption, lower carbon dioxide emissions and provides excellent improvements to the propulsion system at the same time as high torque in full engine speed.
The first 1.2-litre engine has a power output of 90 horsepower at 6,000 rpm with a maximum torque of 114 Nm at 4,900 rpm.
This engine - which had a 2.3-litre consumption of the previous generation of the Jazz 78 horsepower - has a consumption of 5.3 litres and a 125 grams of CO2 emissions.
Compared to the previous engine, which reached 83 horsepower for the previous generation, the current one will reach 100.
The 100-horsepower Honda Jazz 1.4 has a combined consumption of 5.4 litres and an emission of 128 grams of CO2.
"I want to be a young mother. Whoever bes the father doesn't care."
The tremendous resemblance to her sister did not prevent her from developing her own personality.
Mónica Cruz, though of small builds, is a life-filled woman.
The Cruz sisters are now taking their new tenure in fashion very seriously.
For Mónic, this means a lot more than just lending some pretty, famous girls their name.
In Paris, she attended a graduation event held by Mango at its new headquarters, as well as the announcement of the most important fashion awards that the Spanish company sponsors.
She is both cordial and shy and will win you up close.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I came to present a new collection, which my sister Penélope and I designed for Mango for this year's autumn-winter season, and at the same time attended the announcement of the second edition of the "Mango Fashion Awards" and the Opera dinner in honor of Valentin.
So it was a challenging but also exciting day.
What is your new collection for Mango, for which you have been working for the fourth season, based on?
I and my sister love films from the '50s and '60s, and we drew a lot of stimuli from them.
I also love to wander around the city and watch women walk dressed, how they combine and layer their clothes, I do that very often.
You're a dancer, an actress, a designer, a very versatile woman, right?
I think so, but after all, everything is connected and has many connections.
I'd enjoyed my clothes when I was a little girl, I still wanted to go to my grandmother's house, go through my aunt's closets and look at her clothes.
That was a sensation, almost better than going to the pilgrimage.
Then when I became a dancer, I always tried to take care of the way I wore to the dress.
You know, we dancers pride ourselves on how we're groomed to feel comfortable in our classes and rehearsals looking in the mirror.
And as an actress, when they give you a costume, that's when you actually break into the character.
So it's all connected, but with a lot of respect for the designers and the professionalism.
You recently, 30, hit you in a crisis?
Nope.
I feel better than I've ever felt before, I enjoy 300.
I find that the woman is already done, has experience and she saves her life with fewer mistakes.
The biological clock doesn't scare me.
I've done what I want to do, and that gives me great inner happiness.
So you're thinking of being a mother or not?
Of course, I know I'm going to be a mother because my body demands it, and besides, I want to be a young mom, I don't want to miss it.
As for my father, I'm not worried about that.
But one thing I know for a fact is, I will give my child a feeling of happiness and raise him with great affection.
As for the film, you're in for a few premieres of the films you made last year.
That's right, and I'm looking forward to coming to the cinema.
I come from the theatrical world, and so I am very impatient and restless, I want everything now and so obviously I can't.
I look forward to the premiere of "La última hora" and "En busca de la tumba de Cristo".
Let's see how you like...
A few days ago, you had your premiere on the catwalk alongside Naomi Campbell, didn't you?
Well, don't say that.
It's not like I'm going to step up on the pier as a model.
I was merely called by Naomi Campbell, whom I have known for a long time, and invited me to London to attend a fundraising parade for her organization "Women for a Better Life," and the clothes we were showing off - I also selected two models from our collection for Mango - was auctioned off and the proceeds were handed over to this Naomina NGO.
People don't know that Naomi has such a good heart.
There's a lot of things to talk about her, and I know her, can tell you that many of them aren't true.
Besides, I'll stick to the good he's involved in.
She asked me to perform for charity, but if she asks me to do a handstand, I'll do it, too.
For the benefit of the Third World women, I will do what it takes.
"Auto bee" prevents precipitation
To advance the development of anti-mon-air accident technologies, Nissan was this time inspired in nature, specifically with bees.
This Japanese company has created a robot that takes to model the flying of bees, thus preventing collisions.
This is the Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C, which represents the first step in precipitation prevention technologies.
Engineers at the Center for Technical Advances Nissan Motor Co. developed the robot in collaboration with the Centre for Progress in the scientific and technology research of the prestigious Japanese University of Tokyo.
According to Kazuhir Doi, Director General of Public Relations for Technology, R&D of the Brand, BR23C is presented as an extension of Nissan's four zones of Nissan's security shield.
The robot is tasked with strengthening the ability to prevent precipitation in cars of this brand.
During the flight, each bee creates its own oval-shaped personal space, which is very similar to the Nissan safety shield.
The most important, however, are the folded bee's eyes, which are able to be seen in all directions at an angle of more than 300 degrees, which makes it possible to fly in its personal space without stopping.
In creating this visual feature, the engineers designed what they called the Laser Range Finder.
It records obstacles that are located up to two metres within a 180-degree radius of the BR23C, calculate the distance of the object and sends out the signal to the on-board microprocessor, which immediately converts it to a collision warning.
"The moment the obstacle is recorded, the robot mimics the beehive movements and immediately changes the direction by turning the wheels into the right or even larger angle to prevent the collision.
The biggest difference from any existing system is that all evasive maneuvers are perfectly instinctive.
If this were not the case, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobile Laboratory and Chief Engineer of the project.
The robot, unlike bees, cannot move upwards and downwards or diagonally, its movement is limited to two dimensions and the direction that is made possible by rotating its wheels, but not in an infinite number of directions and capabilities as for bees.
Nissan therefore used the rotation function in addition to acceleration and slowing down to prevent the robot from colliding.
"The device only needs to process the information every few seconds and act according to this data.
It does not require the preservation of information or logical intuitions from previous manoeuvres, which allows it to function without interruption with only two dozen kB of memory.
This may come as a surprise to you, but with memory, we don't talk about the gig or the mega."
This is the first step in the development of new technologies for immediate precipitation prevention, a technology for which Nissan predicts to be used in serial cars in a decade.
The robot uses lithium polymer batteries that are lighter and last longer than lithium-ion.
Another possible future use of this technology could be to build the unit into the GPS satellite navigation system, which would take the driver to its destination, avoiding obstacles on the road.
Drivers repeatedly caught with alcohol in their blood will have to install "alcolock"
The Ministry of the Interior is demanding that a driver with three administrative penalties for drunk driving must have to install a system in his car to prevent him from getting the car started drunk or if he is not in a breath.
The proposal became known in June of this year and is now included in the annual report of the Supreme Prosecutor's Office, according to which it is a pilot project that will take one year.
Its aim is to return the driver behind the wheel, so drivers will also have to complete a course for the commute re-education.
In addition to the National Transportation Safety Authority, the Directorate-General for Transport (DGT) and the Foundation of the Technological Institute for the Safety of Automobile Safety (FITSA) will also participate in this experience.
According to statistics, between 30 and 75% of the car drivers accused more than once to be behind the wheel in this state, are behind the wheel again.
Alcolock should prevent this as it is a system connected to a vehicle that measures the alcohol level in the exhaled air and prevents the car from being started if the driver is not innoid before or if it is recorded above the permitted concentration of alcohol.
Its price exceeds EUR 1 000 and the culprit himself would have to pay for it.
A study conducted in this sense in the US in 2007 showed that for vehicles equipped with this equipment, offences had decreased by 65 % during the first year of the introduction.
Spain is expected to save the lives of 115 people every year.
The measure is limited to administrative penalties for two reasons: for this behaviour to be dealt with before it is a criminal offence.
And to help its implementation, as the legislation can be implemented in the usual way, but the necessary legislation of the criminal provisions requires an amendment to the law.
The device is not yet available on the Spanish market in any sales version, although it has already been installed in some industrial and public service vehicles.
Just tomorrow, Congress of Deputies will vote on the PSOE (Spanish Workers' Socialist Party) proposal, recommending to install this system on school buses, as is the case in France.
In Mexico and without "peeptoes"
With British precision, at 5:40 p.m., as it said in the program, a Spanish Air Force aircraft landed in the presidential hangar at Benita Juárez Airport in México D. F. in which the Prince and Princess of Asturias arrived.
The sun was now setting, but its rays still forced their eyes to be clogged with their hands to see the successor pair ascendin from the plane.
Below the steps stood the Spanish ambassador and other officials.
A few hours ago, I asked a taxi driver on the street if he knew that the Spanish prince and the princess were coming to the state visit.
Yeah, well, that's great, you're not going to be able to get people to the airport at that time... she's from here or what...
No, no, sir, she's Spanish, but she lived here for a few years.
Yeah, all right...
But the Mexican press knows who the Prince and Princess of Asturias are and how important their visit is.
Many people are waiting in a hangar at the airport close to the red carpet and a military cordon that consists of 27 naval soldiers ready to fire a salvo of honour.
The prince appears with a smile on her lips in a navy-brown suit, and the princess, very sparingly dressed and with her hair flowing, has no her usual "peeptoes," apparently reported to her that there is a risk of a thunderstorm in D.F.
Before they go to the hall where the official delegations are waiting, they smile at the photographers and cashed in.
A Mexican TV reporter is waiting at the door of the hotel where they will be staying, one of the city's four largest, chatty TV reporters.
Enjoy your fear before you take out your mortgage
It must be acknowledged that the US Treasury Department, in addition to having enough capital to distribute injections, is not labíat.
In the face of the crisis, and to prevent Americans from taking risky mortgages from banks with dubious solvency, it has created a popular-eduit "Bad Credit Hotel" game online.
Or "Hotel of Bad Lenders"... or a confused hotel.
The hotel, and its receptionists in particular, look grim to think once, twice or three times about whether it was the time to apply for credit.
Above all, where to ask, which is probably her intention.
The fact is that the game contains useful information, albeit not very detailed.
It is a site suitable for young people rather than a space for the whole public.
And what happens when the game ends?
Inside the hotel, a dream room appears.
At least something, because you'd better not talk about buying a house...
The best subsidised fashion price
There's probably no more suitable place in the world to announce the fashion award than Paris, and it's probably not more exquisite to the designer and the bonafide than Valentino.
Mango has just announced the second edition of the El Botón-Mango Fashion Awards to enable the international presentation of new fashion talents.
The price is subsidised by the sum of EUR 300 000.
Belgian Sandrina Fasolio, the winner of her first year, yesterday looked at her designs in the Manga window on Paris's Haussmann Boulevard number 54 and was almost weeping with emotion.
To be sure, it is the second largest deal of this company in Europe and has just been opened on an area of 1,335 square metres.
The largest is in London.
Many events, along with the desire to thank the designer, Valentin, for taking the presidency of the competition jury, have caused us to have dinner in the Paris Opera Garnier in Paris.
The Mango firm's solemnly decorated preschermen table looked a little more amazing next to Chagall's most glorious works.
Nati, who had given no light of her heartbroken grating because of her brother's recent death, wore the gown of the brand and the ELAH jewels over which he held his breath, and hung on to his son Luis - a nearly two-meter-tall dandy - accompanied Valentin at the head of the table at dinner in his honor.
Andik, the chief executive and owner of Mango, took up the welcome and, as a true gentleman, he and Baron Rothschild were left without a jacket, as they were both offered to two ladies.
Mónic Cruz, who arrived at the store in her own-designed - trousers and a shirt and changed into a long, sexy dress for dinner, was touched by the Opera Walk at the Opera, accompanied by Goyi Toledo, showed us the ballet room, and, remembering other times, she grabbed one of the bars and hinted at "grandpa."
Inés Sastre did not linger for a tour of the palace's secondary buildings, but showed us pictures of her son on her mobile phone before she left.
The next morning we could enjoy the presence of Olivier Martínez - another young man riding a motorcycle - and John Travolta, who had come to the Intercontinental Hotel in Paris with his own sheets and towels and asked in advance that no smells were used in his rooms.
Stars under the star Parisian sky.
Oh là là, c'est la vie.
1001 - anti-stress number
Not 1000, but a thousand plus one way to forget the chaotic and frantic everyday life.
To make matters worse, they are all summarised in one book that will bring to the bookstore relaxation on 30 September.
The alarm rings at 7 o'clock every morning as a penalty, but even worse is to imagine yourself absorbed in the hurried rhythm that brings contemporary life.
The office is called the voltage and the computer is back pain.
Stress is a 21st century sickness.
But there are neither one nor two methods to combat the daily exhaustion and the problems of disconnects from the world of work.
No, the number is no bigger than 1001.
Outside of yoghtey positions, classical massages and "spa" therapies on her book's website, Susannah Marriott collected entire "menu" of options, adapted to the tastes and time possibilities of each individual.
The counter-storey book is called "1001 Mode Relaxation" and will bring peace to the bookstore thanks to Pearson Alhambra and DK.
If one considers that it is not possible to achieve peace in areas such as work or personal relationships, the "miller" denies this view.
In addition, it offers other techniques to be in touch with nature or 100% natural recipes that contribute to relaxation.
If your veins are no longer in the veins of adrenaline, which restores the balance in the body, and stress has become a problem, it is time to sit down on the couch, turn off and concentrate on reading.
Talking from sleeping
Some of the kids talk at night.
I don't mean the ones who wake up and tell us briskly about what happened the day before, but the children who talk while they sleep.
The first time happens, it may be a halt to you, but it's actually insignificant.
This is a harmless sleep disorder called somnilokia.
It is quite common, especially in children and adolescents.
I'm sure more than one of you said he'd spoken in his sleep at night.
This phenomenon can occur very sporadically (for example, once in a lifetold for high fevers), or with greater regularity (every day, once a week, once a week, once every few months...), the next day the child remembers nothing.
There is not just one reason to explain her arrival.
It is often associated with other sleep disorders, such as nightmares, night-time furs, enuresis nocturna (night bed-wetting) or sleepwalking, but this may not be the case.
As previously mentioned, it can often be accompanied by very high fevers, stressful or heated situations.
In any case, this is a little explored phenomenon.
The intensity with which it appears is also different.
A child can speak in a calm voice, say individual words, whisper, or just the opposite (creams, cries, long speecech...).
In cases where it manifests with great force, it would be advisable to observe and consult a specialist to see if he or she has a problem that causes him great anxiety and manifests himself in this way.
We have said that this is a harmless disorder, so it is not treated only if it is associated with another sleep disorder that can be treated (for example, if it is associated with apnea syndrome or permanent stress).
What we can do, however, is that we will bear in mind a few very simple preventive measures, such as:
Trying not to upset the child too much before he goes to bed.
So to find calm games and avoid scary or somewhat violent TV programs or series.
For very nervous children and those who can be freed up, it is possible to use relaxing techniques to help them get some inner peace.
This will allow the child to sleep more peacely.
When somnilokvie shows up, try to keep calm.
Remind you that she is harmless to the child, and that she will remember nothing of what happened the next day.
Useful councils
Don't be him.
It's pointless because he's not conscious and you're interrupting his sleep.
Even when he speaks, he sleeps, and thus rests.
Remember that if you dream of suffering a lot of times in a row, it would be advisable to turn to the advice or find out what causes such anxiety in the child.
If it is understood what he says (which is not so common), avoid the temptation to interrogate him and pull information out of him.
It won't do any good, because when he's asleep, he's not conscious to organize her thoughts.
Plus, you may hear what he says, but you don't know what he's dreaming about, and therefore why he's saying it, so be very careful how you interpret the information and what conclusions you're coming to.
Never tell a child that you can ask him about his secret at night.
Not even fun.
This causes great anxiety.
Don't worry about it, it's not a bad thing, it's just an episode that only takes a few minutes.
Illhaeusern... finally
Illhaeusern finally found his way to victory again after a long, leaning period.
Without playing a particularly big match, the Yellow-blacks created more chances and were able to convert one of them victoriously.
The game did not have a fast pace during this encounter in which the attackers were hard to enforce.
After the captain's first attempt, the hosts Kauffmann, who narrowly missed the link with a long-distance shot, Illhaeern was getting easy to the upper hand and first Fonderflick from the distance, then Hirne through the air, Romain on the long leg or also Diebold gradually came to irritate Dannemarie's defense.
The opponent, on the other hand, built a defensive wall in the halfway point, leaving only the agile Riahi at the tip of the attack.
The start of the second half proved decisive, first thanks to two chances for Dannemarie with the names Riahi and Temporale, then after opening the scoring for the Illhaeern, which was taken care of by the Marais, well-placed for processing the ball reflected after the previous Diebold's attempt (53').
However, the Illhaeusernu goalkeeper did not enjoy the joy for a long time, after about twelve minutes he was forced to return to the locker room, leaving his teammates in a downs.
Dannemarie, however, was unable to benefit from it, and the eleven of Illhaeern, who withdrew just a little to "catch" the defence, had no longer caused any major trouble, except for the very last seconds of the match, when the ball flew very close to the crossbar after much confusion.
Sarkozy goes to the angry fishermen
Before flying to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy takes a detour through Brittany.
To counter a demonstration of the strength of fishermen who severely disrupted the accessibility of several Breton and Normandy ports on Monday, the French president decided to head to the port of Guilvinec in Finistère on Tuesday morning to meet their leaders.
The latter promised to be adopted "in a constructive spirit" and hope to "come up with concrete proposals."
The presidential visit comes at the same time as the General Assembly of the "crisis committee" created by the Breton fishermen to obtain measures against the sharp rise in diesel prices, which peaked at an average of 1.14 euros per litre.
According to Elysee Palace spokesman David Martinon, the president will "talk to them about solutions that can be imagined in an effort to help their firms regain competitiveness and better safeguard the conditions of employment and disburse the sailors."
Nicolas Sarkozy is expected to fishermen with intransigence.
On Tuesday morning, they performed an operation to "mad-morka" (surgery of slow-moving vehicles) in the departments of Morbihan and Calvados, causing nearly 10km constipation.
Recreational port in Quiberon was also blocked, but services in the direction of Belle-île were not interrupted.
The Quiberon Peninsula has been put into operation by a filtration dam.
The sailors proved their resolve back to Monday, when right at dawn they were burning tires and pallets in front of the propellants of the ports and Lorient, while demonstrations were taking place in Concarneau and Saint-Brieuc.
The movement spread to other ports on the Atlantic coast and the l Manche canal, as to the Sables d'Olonne in Vendée, where traolores in the harbor remained, or to Le Havre, where about twenty vessels blocked the operation of merchant ships.
Fishermen from Turballe and Croisic in the Loire-Atlantique area stopped the blockade of the important Total refinery in Donges during the evening.
Those of Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait until the ministry's meeting on Wednesday before they would eventually decide to act.
In Guilvinec, the "crisis committee" is to decide on Tuesday how to continue the path and attendance at the upcoming meeting at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
However, some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by the leaders of the state's fisheries department, which did not support their movement.
"The strike will continue" as "the fishermen will not let go of anything" and "want to come to Paris," said Liliane Cariou, chair of the fisheries department at Lorient.
Occupational fishermen who do not pay tax on diesel currently pay around 50 cents a litre, but reckons that the ship's profitability threshold is reached only when diesel is under €0.30 per litre.
Paul Newman the grand
The unforgettable "Butche Cassidy and Kid" has died in the aftermath of cancer at the age of 83, at his home in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clintons, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford, and Sam Mendes bowed to the film's legend and politically committed actor Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer maintains its delivery conditions for 2008
The Brazilian aircraft manufacturer is relying on the delivery of 215 aircraft this year, despite the threat of recession hovering over the world economy.
The fourth aircraft designer in the world, Embraer, maintains its delivery prepositions for 2008 with 215 delivered devices, confirmed its president, Fredrico Fleury Curado.
In the first half of the year the manufacturer supplied 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian designer expects a lot from the Chinese market, in particular he is particularly aware of the range of his aircraft from 30 to 120 seats.
To date, Embraer has supplied Chinese clients with 41 devices in the space of eight years.
AIG is said to be considering transfer of 15% of its assets
The American International Group, insurer who was leenched over the water by the US cash authorities, is considering cing to forward more than 15% of its assets to repay the $85 billion given to it as a backup, reports Sunday's edition of the Financial Times.
AIG is ready to investigate the sale of most of its activities outside of international life insurance and pension activities in the United States, the daily, specifies, citing sources close to the ongoing negotiations.
The AIG board of directors, according to the FT, met during the evening on Sunday to examine the eventual ceding.
It was not possible to obtain any confirmation statement from the AIG.
The assets that AIG intends to get rid of include his aviation leasing fiver International Lease Financial Corp., its 59% participation in the Transatlantic Holdings insurance reinsurance provider, as well as its portfolio of real estate and private equity investments, adds to FT.
No final decision on these referrals has yet been taken, the FT continues.
AIG must swiftly raise cash to repay the $85 billion loan provided by the Federal Reserve Bank with the risk of the US authorities seized 80% of its capital, thereby also dilute the appropriate ratio of the current shareholder.
Analysis of the historic Morning Meeting Meeting
The New York Stock Exchange recorded a historic decline on Monday after the House of Representatives rejected Paulson's plan to rescue the banks: Dow Jones lost 6.98%, an unprecedented loss of an approaching 800-point, and a Nasdaq of 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) fell 777.68 points to 10,365.45 points.
The biggest point drop to date in its history (by 684.81 points) was recorded on September 17, 2001, the day of the resumption of trade following the 9/11 terrorist attacks.
The Nasdaq index with the predominant technology component lost, according to definitive data after the closing of trading, 199.61 points and stabilised at 1 983.73, and the extended Standard & Poor's 500 index fell by 8.81% (i.e. 106.85 points) to 1 106.55.
Harvested since the start of the session, Wall Street has literally fallen for the unexpected rejection of the plan to rescue the banks by the House of Representatives, a plan to make it possible to find a little stability in the markets again.
228 votes against and 205 for the representatives refused to provide the Secretary of State Treasury, Henry Paulson, with the means he had asked for.
Nearly two Republicans out of three rejected his plan.
"This is a bad signal to the market that sees that Congress is unable to accept a plan," says Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
"It shows how much the market relied on this plan," she added, expressing concerns that the project adopted in a few days would not be "too late."
"If this project is indeed doomed (...), the relay will be handed over to the Fed (America's Central Bank) and other central banks to avert the crisis, which would further strengthen lending conditions," pointed out Brian Bethune, the head economist at Global Insight.
And, with an emphasis on the urgency of the situation, Piegza pointed out that "every new day brings about the downfall of a financial institution."
After Friday's collapse of Washington Mutual, authorities orchestrated the purchase of the Wachovia bank's banking activities by its rival, Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis has suddenly taken a turnar, requiring urgent intervention in favour of banks in the UK, the Benelux, Iceland and Germany, suggesting that markets are not "just facing a US crisis, but a world crisis," the FTN Financial analyst added.
The bond market has risen strongly.
Yield from the cash voucher for 10 years fell to 3.632% compared to 3.827% on Friday night, yield to 30 years to 4.161% compared to 4.357% the day before.
Morgan Stanley opens its capital to MUFG
Banking house Morgan Stanley reported that the Mitsubishi Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), the largest Japanese bank, is entering its centre, to spend $9 billion to raise 21% of its capital. The reception of this report was accompanied by a significant drop in its exchange rate.
A week after they revealed their preliminary agreement, both banks explained that the MUFG intended to buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley's regular shares at a single price of $25.25, a total total of $3 billion.
The agreed price is 19 % lower than the book value of the securities as of 31 August.
MUFG is investing an additional $6 billion to raise convertible securities that will give it a 10% return and whose exchange price is $31.25.
Morgan Stanley specified that the entire operation would take place on the basis of an average single price of $29, or 28% below its current rate.
Morgan Stanley's stock still lost 6.79% and reached $23.07 around $57, Greenwich time.
"This strategic merger represents an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley's transition to a banking holding status," explained John Mack, the CEO of the US group.
The new statute was adopted by Morgan Stanley last week, which is intended to enable him to de-esply his activities, but it also places it under the supervision of the Federal Reserve Bank.
His merger with the MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis is forcing the biggest aces from Wall Street to take a far more cautious approach than before.
Conditions presented on Monday show, among other things, that the deal has been amended over the last few days: last Monday, Morgan only announced that he would sell up to 20% of its shares to the Japanese for about $8.5 billion.
"A week ago we thought," Tošihide Mizuno, MUFG's CEO, explained in Tokyo, "that our participation will consist exclusively of regular shares.
However, in view of the current situation of economics and the market, we wanted to keep the risks to a minimum and also to cover ourselves."
Based on the weighted average price, MUFG will pay 7% less than their book value for the Morgan Stanley securities.
And the operation will result in a reduction in the stock's earnings by about 20%.
The agreement assumes that the MUFG will be able to convert half of its preferential securities to ordinary equities in a year if the latter are exchanged for a certain period of time at a price of 50% above the exchange price, i.e. at around $47.
Morgan Stanley assures that the capital brought by MUFG will enable it to take advantage of investment opportunities, strengthen its balance sheet and increase its cash.
However, a spokesperson for the group declined to provide detailed information on the strategic projects of the two new allies.
After the investment of MUFG, Morgan Stanley should boast about 15% of the Tier One's payability ratio, one of the best in the sector.
Morgan clarified that he had "wontigitly" his record since the end of August.
Recent weeks have been challenging for the group, as its stock exchange rate has plummeted by half, while insurance costs against the risk of non-payment associated with debt have soared.
These costs took the opposite turn on Monday, but remained high, around 12%.
Last week, Goldman Sachs, the only other "surviving" of Wall Street's major investment bank after the collapse of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers, and the purchase of Merrill Lynch, announced that it had raised $15 billion, in part from Berkshire Hathaway, the Warren Buffett Group.
Rafael Correa on Monday in Quito.
Re-clare the republic around the socialism of the XXI century.
Such is the joint project of Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, Bolivian Eva Morales and Ecuadoror Rafael Correy.
Last Sunday, the third named put to the vote, following the example of his counterparts and friends, a draft of the new Constitution.
And his mission is accomplished, as 64% of the electorate, according to the official results covering 80% of the vote, voted "yes" in the referendum.
According to these results, "No" received 28%, 7% of the votes were invalid and 0.7% of the ballots were empty.
To be adopted, the draft of the Constitution had to receive half of the votes plus one.
Two polls conducted at the exit of polling stations and the count of the NGO predicted a clear "yes" victory on Sunday, setting them to the range of 63% to 70%.
Indeed, Rafael Correa demanded to win his draft Constitution during the night of Sunday to Monday.
"The congrest won on the whole line," he assured, congratulating the Ecuadorors at the Guayaquil Governor's headquarters, 280 kilometres southwest of Quito.
It goes without saying that Rafael Correa received a congratulatory congratulations from Chávez and Morales, but also from his Chilean counterpart, Michelle Bachelet.
The vote, which according to the observation mission of the Organization of the States of America (OEA), took place peacefully, concerned a text on 444 points building by the "new socialism" promoted by the president.
The draft Constitution affirms the state's power over economics by reserving to it the "planning of the development" of a country living mainly from diesel mining by foreign companies and from the foreign exchange sent by its emigrants.
The proposal, sponsored by Correa, which was elected in 2006, also extends the powers of the head of state, which will be able to carry out two consecutive four-year mandates and will be able to dissolve the House.
Correa has already announced that he will use this power to run for a new mandate in February 2009.
Among other things, the Constitution consolidates the principle of free health and education, which the president began to implement in a country of 13.9 million people, where 50% of the population lives below the poverty line.
Finally, it also envisages a ban on the presence of foreign troops, ending the agreement between Washington and Quit to use the Ecuadorian base as the starting point of US anti-drug operations.
Obama wins on points in the first televised duel
After Friday's first debate between the two candidates at the White House, the second debate was followed by the task of finding out which of the pair, John McCain and Barack Obama, won.
The command tents of the Republican and Democrats' campaign in the Republican and Democrats were not surprised when both announced their victory in a televised duel watched by a third of American families.
Political analyst David Gergen believes that John McCain's performance, as polite as he was, was not "brilliant enough" to allow him to stop him, five weeks before the presidential election, a drop in the polls.
The Gallup Institute, whose poll released Saturday on Saturday gives Obama a five-point lead (49% against 44% for McCain), reckons that the Democrat is the one who won the duo.
Among the undecided voters who just matter, Obama is the winner for 39% of respondents, while, according to a CBS poll, 25% attribute the victory to McCain.
Obama should be able to confirm his leadership on Thursday with the anticipated good performance of his fellow nominee, Joseph Biden, during the first and the only public debate with his opponent, Sarah Palin.
"It would be a mistake to underestimate her.
She's gifted," Bill Clinton nevertheless pointed out over the weekend.
The 70-year-old McCain consistently highlighted his undeniable experience in the field of foreign policy, while also emphasizing the "naivity" of his opponent's "nails" on the issues that formed the heart of the first encounter.
"It seems that Senator Obama did not understand that..." was the repeated accusation.
"I don't think Senator Obama has the experience and knowledge enough to become president," he also assured.
In such an offensive spirit, the Republican TV spots have been carried in this way since yesterday.
Obama, on the other hand, stressed that it represented the future.
He did not frose his head and proved brief and precise.
He highlighted his ability to take the right decisions and restore the good reputation of the United States in the world.
"McCain still misunderstood, while Obama did," the Democratic spot replied over the weekend, accusing the Republican of not sufficiently taking into account the impact of the crisis on the "goal American."
"During the 90-minute debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you," Obama said yesterday in front of the 20,000 people gathered at the North Carolina Pre-Corvocation Meeting in heavy rain.
He has not even uttered words like the "middle-class" or "working." Financial decay clearly favours Obama, whom Americans see as more of a more doable to save the economy on the sidelines of the abyss.
"There could be a decisive turnar over next week," the influential Democratic senator Charles Schumer estimated yesterday.
Democratic representative Rahm Emanuel, a former member of the Clinton administration, compared Obama's "economic foresight" to the one Bill Clinton had during the financial crisis of 1998.
For the Democratic nominee, the current scourge is "the final verdict of an eight-year bad economic policy, as operated by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain."
The Illinois senator reaffirmed that despite the unexpected leaps of Wall Street, he should be able to cut taxes on 95% of Americans, and also pointed out that the implementation of the country's eventual energy independence by promoting renewable energy sources is its number one priority, along with the introduction of the health insurance system.
McCain, for his part, plans to build a fleet with 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
The two candidates cautiously avoided questions about the $700 billion (€470 billion) financial aid plan, which was received by Congress last night and which is highly unpopular.
"What about you, did you notice that there were any elections in Minsk?"
Young people and opponents of the regime demonstrated in the main square of the Belarusian capital on Sunday evening to reject the results of the parliamentary elections in advance.
Several hundred Belarusians gathered on Sunday evening immediately after the closure of polling stations in Minsk's main square to protest the irregularity of the elections to parliament.
Although no results have been announced so far, many young people have come to demonstrate against President Lukashenko's regime: "dictator, resignation."
Some admit that they didn't even go to the polls: "What would it be for them to do with my voice anyway, whatever they want," says one young man.
They do not believe that this regime, which has been warmed to foreign observers to resume negotiations with the European Union, would be prepared to turn towards democracy.
Sanctions, including the visa ban for 40 Belarusian leaders and the freezing of certain assets, could be lifted if the election is considered to be clean by the observers.
According to the opposition, this was not the case.
"We were kept away from the electoral commissions and our observers were not allowed to participate in the vote count," complained Yuri Potemkin, spokesman for the Union of Democratic Forces, of a diverse grouping of twelve parties.
"This is a cosmetic change," stresses Alexander Milinkievich, a former opposition candidate in the 2006 presidential election and a leading figure in the pro-European movement, "as important is who is counting the votes, and with us it is executive power.
If any opposition MPs make it to parliament, it will be by being appointed and not elected.
However, their entry into parliament may mean space on television, meetings in the regions and bills."
The opposition therefore feels obliged to participate in the political functioning because "it is necessary to start a dialogue with the European Union.
For if our economy, deeply in debt in Russia, is affected by the crisis and we do not reform, we are in danger of becoming a protectorate of Russia.
But we want to be independent."
The opposition is concerned that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which has followed the election, not declare the elections valid.
It stresses that turnout appears to be too high and that the general introduction of early voting (26% of the voters in Minsk) has opened the way for all sorts of manipulations.
"What about you, did you notice that there were any elections?" asks the social-democratic leader, Alexander Kozulin, one of the last two political prisoners released in August of this year.
"There wasn't a foot in the polling stations.
And there will be a maximum of five opposition MPs in parliament, the ones who are most comfortable with the regime."
The night's silence was again pitted to the October square.
On television, President Lukashenko and members of the Central Election Commission congratulate each other on their success.
19 hostages were freed in Chad
The Egyptian commando raiders were attacked by the kidnapper of eleven hikers and their eight-man escort who were captured ten days earlier.
They're in Cairo.
Eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian guides, who were held captive in the desert for ten days, were fed alive and well on Monday to the Egyptian capital.
During the morning, they were freed by an Egyptian commando in Chad.
The hostages flew in at about 15.30, apparently in good form, aboard a special aircraft to the al-Maza military base, closely adjacent to Cairo International Airport.
They were immediately taken without a chance to comment on the press, on board the helicopter at the hospital in Maadi, the outskirts of the residential district of Cairo, to be subjected to medical examinations.
"They are quite healthy" and "the February no ransom has been paid," the Egyptian minister, turizom Zohejr Garrana, said on the airport's transit runway.
Since his capture on September 19, during a safari in a four-wheel-drive vehicle at the foot of Mount Uanat, on the borders of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, a group of hostages have been dragged from one hiding place to the other by 35 unknown hijackers.
The group includes 11 tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian - as well as eight Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, one border guard at the Aegyptous agency director, the safari organizer.
A senior official in Egypt's security forces suggested that the 30 members of the special forces who approached the site on board the two helicopters had set off on the slogan during the night just before dawn.
"There was a shootout, half the kidnappers were killed and the others fled," said the source, who wished to remain anonymous.
He suggested that a total of 150 members of the Egyptian special forces from the "lightse" unit were sent to Sudan, where they received the support of German and Italian commandos.
The head of Italian diplomacy, Franco Frattini, mentioned from Belgrade, where he is currently located, about the role played by the secret agents and the components of the Italian special forces.
"We must acknowledge that we have achieved this result through the professionalism and efficiency of the people of our secret services, the special forces," he said without further elaboration.
He also denied that a ransom was paid.
On the eve, the Sudanese army said it had intercepted a four-wheel-drive vehicle on the watch, with the hijackers killing six, including the Chief of the Cth, and arresting two.
The army claimed to have been linked to a group of rebels in Darfur, the Movement for the Liberation of Sudan - Unity (SLA-U), which the movement immediately rejected.
Letters - The quiet majority of the Ministry of Culture
The debate about the financing of culture fills the pages of the newspaper with headlines and is the subject of the current election campaign.
All the better.
However, one area of our cultural life is still neglected.
Who will rise up to be laundered with the pitiful sums provided by the small museums, the archives, the archaeological digs, and the national sites that are dying of hunger?
Which politician dares to remind the federal government that it is negleating its monuments and its historic buildings?
That in Quebec, as in Canada, do we not have laws that really protect our cultural heritage?
Did you know that the French government will donate three and a half million euros to restor the Chatrones of Chinon in the Loire Valley?
In our American neighbours, it is written in the Constitution that the protection of cultural heritage is part of the culture of Americans and that this heritage is to be protected by all citizens, all elected representatives and all regional organisations, in cooperation.
In Quebec, a federation of Quebec- History Society, at least 40,000 volunteers, grouped to 211 companies for the history, monuments, archives and genealogy, strive to uncover history, preserving a pile of private archives and protecting archaeological remains for a few small ones.
Often, it is these companies who are the watchdogs of our monuments that are rinded by hopeless protest when promoters and leaders release their bulldozers onto old stones and forgotten cemeteries.
When will we finally see a grandstand for history and monuments?
Interview - Blood, which is again certain
Héma-Québec celebrated his tenth anniversary yesterday, and his president, Dr. Francine Décary, was rightly rejoicing, as Héma-Québec became one of the world's most reliable and efficient blood suppliers.
Above all, it has regained the public's trust, which was seriously shaken after the contaminated blood scandal in the 1980s and 1990s.
As is widely known, the state-owned blood reserve administered by the Canadian Red Cross transfusion Department was contaminated with the immune deficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus during the 1980s.
In view of this drama and a wave of public reign, the Canadian Government launched a public investigation in February 1994, presided over by Judge Horace Krever, which was intended to explain the circumstances that led to such a tragedy and to formulate a recommendation that such a disaster should not be repeated.
While Judge Krever delayed handing over the report, some of the provinces set up a committee to plan a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélinea Committee stood up for this role.
After the Gélineau and Krever reports, two suppliers were set up in Canada: Héma-Québec, which was to be farmed by Quebec, and the Canadian bloodstream to supply all provinces and both territories.
"When Héma-Québec began his activities in 1998, barely 38% of people still had confidence in the Quebec blood system," recalls Dr. Décary.
"The situation was disheartening.
By sustained efforts to increase the safety of blood products and constant work in this area over the coming years, we have regained public confidence," he says, adding, proudly that in early 2008 Héma-Québeku, nearly 94% of the québean population had already trusted.
Dr. Décary, however, does not lose sight of "trust is something very fragile."
Since its founding on 28 September 1998, Héma-Québec has applied the principle of prudence.
"At that time, we have seen many cases of human form of mad cow disease occurring in Europe, a new variant of a disease called Creutzfeldt-Jakob's disease," says the woman who has led the company since its founding in 1998.
"And we had no idea whether this disease could spread through the blood.
We were therefore based on one of the basic recommendations of the Krever and Gélineau report, according to which, when we do not know and when the spread of a serious illness is at stake, in this case the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which is characterised by the degeneration of the brain inevitably leading to death, the precaution must be taken.
In April 1999, we therefore rejected blood from people who have been in the UK for more than a month since 1980.
A few years ago, it was safely proven that the disease was transmitted through the blood.
This episode has shown us that it made sense to adhere to the precaution principle."
In 1999, a much more accurate technique for detecting the HIV virus appeared on the market: tests with the use of nucleic acid (NAT) that allow the presence of the virus itself to be detected directly in the donor blood, and not the presence of the antibodies on which the tests were based were used before.
NAT tests have made it possible to shorten the deaf period that occurs between the patient's infection and the moment when the first viruses can be detected by our blood techniques, the specialist explains.
We were able to shorten this period to less than a week.
We have, in essence, reduced the risk that some donors might be infected without even knowing it and without us being able to figure out.
These improvements have made it possible to significantly reduce the risk of obtaining AIDS through a blood transfusion.
The risk of getting blood from contaminated with HIV is now exposed to one person in 12 million.
"In other words, this means that by the time someone gets infected with HIV, you will need to distribute 12 million blood products.
Since Héma-Québec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 blood products each year, it will take 24 years before the first case of HIV transmission occurs via a blood product.
I believe that today we can get or prescribe the blood transfusion necessary for recovery in absolute peace," says the head of Héma-Québek's management.
"The challenge for the next decade is to maintain the safety of our products.
We never know what a disease-causing element may appear in the system.
Just last year, the chikungunya virus appeared on the island of Réunion, which, like the West Nile virus, is transmitted to the blood by the stab of insects.
It is necessary to be cautious at all times," continues Dr. Décaryová, stressing that in addition to the safety supply, Héma-Québec must also factor in the supply sufficient.
"The needs are growing because the population is aging.
As a result of more aggressive cancer treatment, patients often need a new dose of red blood cells or platelet.
The ageing of the population also has implications for the blood donor network, which on average consists of only 3% of the Québeans allowed to donor."
Any healthy person at least 18 years old, corresponding to the admissibility criteria, but can only donate blood once every 56 days, that is to say, six times a year.
14% of people offering blood are not accepted on average because they are carriers of AIDS or malaria, for example, and if they have visited the country where the swamp fever is rampaging, are excluded for one year.
"With these 3%, we can maintain a state that meets the needs of hospitals.
Weaknesses are very rare.
However, members of the donor network need to be supplemented proportionally to how they age and can no longer donate blood.
However, convincing people to give blood is difficult, especially to be able to hold and encourage them to become regular donors.
Life is so unbridled today that we rarely find an hour to donate blood," says Francine Décary.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Héma-Québec supplies not only blood products, but also human tissue, such as bone transplants, heart valves, eyeballs and skin, which is almost exclusively used for large burns.
These tissues are analysed, processed and frozen before they are stored with Héma-Québek, which also manages the only public bank of blood from the umbilical cord in Quebec.
The umbilical cord, which was previously considered biomedical waste, abounds in blood-rich stem cells that can be used to treat serious diseases such as leukemia.
"A few weeks ago, we celebrated the deposit of our 1,000th sample of blood from the umbilical cord to the bank and we expect to take over a thousand a year.
Early next year, we should start offering them for transplants," says Dr. Décaryová, who describes the blood collection program from the umbilical cord as very popular.
"Some moms are disappointed that they don't have access to it," because Héma-Québec doesn't have the resources to offer this comprehensive and expensive program to all hospitals in Québek.
Football - Impact in the semi-finals
Impact Montréal was in the Saputo Stadium yesterday during the second and decisive match of the quarter-final played on the total number of goals, qualified for the semi-final of the first division of the USL first division, with a 3-1 victory (4-3) over the Sounders of the Seattle.
The midfielder Antonio Ribeiro scored the decisive goal in the 90th minute of the game.
After a two-way goalless first half, midfielder David Testo and Rocco Plancentino scored the remaining two goals for the Montreal formation.
Roger Levesque was the only one who could cope with Matt Jordan in favor of the Sounders.
Recall that on Friday, during the first of the two matches of the quarter-finals, the Impact of the Starfire Complex in the Tukwile suburb of Seattle suffered a 2-1 defeat.
Impact will measure his strength in the semifinals with Whitecaps of Vancouver.
On Saturday night in Minnnesota, the Thunder levelled the deficit in the home game 3-1 and eventually won 4-3, but Whitecaps still advanced to the semifinal round with a total of 5-4 goals.
The Impact should face Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but details of the series of matches will not be confirmed until today.
Briefly - Kovalev's winning goal
The first attacking trio of Canadien is ready to start the season.
A unit consisting of Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrey Kosticin cheered an attack to win Canadia 3-2 on separate raids at the Centre Bell last night.
Kosticin, the biggest star of the clash, scored a goal, Plekanec collected two assists, and Kovalev scored one pass in this fourth consecutive victory in three-tone preseason games.
Kovalev secured the victory by scoring the only goal during the stand-alone raids.
"I'm not ready yet," the Russian said.
"I need one more fight to feel good."
'He tried to handle too much in the first period,' Guy Carbonneau observed.
"But I think he appreciated the end of the match.
He had a nice applause."
Charest bets north
The PM does not rule out calling for early elections before the end of the year
Right after the end of the Liberal Party Congress (Parti the Suiter), Jean Charest moved to Jean-Talon in Quebec, where the new health minister, Yves Bolduc (left) is running in today's by-elections.
"Distake off the limits of our last great northern border": this is the long-term ambition presented by Jean Charest yesterday in a visually engaging manner at the end of the Liberal Party's congress of the Quebec in Lévis, but without giving details.
During his speech, images were projected behind his back in a kind of picture grinder.
On the three giant canvases, a loop ran with remarkable pictures of hydroelectric dams, down, Quebec from the perspective of "Google Maps", maps, etc.
Generous means, much like in the pre-election period.
Indeed, at the press conference, the prime minister refused to rule out calling for early elections in the fall, even though he pointed out that he had a very busy schedule.
The "Plan North" forms the fourth dimension of the "vision" that the prime minister intends for Quebec, a vision of the "new economic space" that includes the workforce agreement with France, the Convention between Canada and Europe and the Ontario Agreement.
Despite the fact that the opening of the North - the northern territory on the 49th parallel - the prime minister has recently often mentioned in his statements, it has never been the subject of a presentation.
However, the prime minister confined himself to explaining why the North represented "the guise with huge potential," but he did not give a deadline, investment levels, or a clear priority in future projects.
At the very most, he mentioned several approaches to points that could be further elaborated: hydroelectric power stations in particular, the forest, but above all, the mining sector, buoyed by the growth of emerging countries and the restoration of public infrastructures.
The North, according to the Charesto's list, contains "nikl, zinek, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and even diamonds."
This 'a territory twice the size of France's is with us', 'is in Quebec.
And he's not just with us, he's in us," he pointed out, as if to show that he was invoking a certain national founding myth.
Quebec was built to a large extent in relation to the North, highlighting the Prime Minister: the hunt for gold in Abitiba, Quebec engineering, James Bay.
"It's ours, it's our future," he added, after he paused theatrically to view the huge map behind him.
The North, 70% of the territory of Quebec, includes a part of Labrador that Québec has always demanded, the prime minister clarified during a press conference.
"This is a traditional position repeated by all the previous governments.
There is one boundary line that has not long been adopted by the Convention, and if the opportunity arises, in the name of the government, I will recapture this position," he suggested.
Otherwise, "it is also necessary to rethink our vision of the North in the context of climate change," he said, speaking of the north-west transition, which will open year-round as a result of the melting of glaciers.
In this new geopolitical context, the prime minister believes that taking the territory is becoming a duty.
What about the inhabitants of the territory, the indigenous peoples and the Inuit?
The prime minister said that the Quebec government would be very attentive to them and that the project would be of use to them, especially to the young.
Two former ministers from two different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (a former Pistonian MP from Ungava), have already begun negotiations with about 30 communities.
The work was launched by the interministerial committee chaired by Benoît Pelletier, and in which Julie Bouletová (Transport and Natural Resources) is in an important position.
The Prime Minister does not rule out a major meeting, "not necessarily a summit," but a moment when a common vision is 'reveiled out'.
The development of the North should, moreover, take place in accordance with the principles of sustainable development.
Plan North will be "aally designed, structured and environmentally friendly," he promised.
Jean Charest described this "visa" as a seamlessly follow-up to the vision of the liberal prime ministers who preceded it.
"Just as the Liberals who preceded us, we have changed our mindset to turn the challenges into new opportunities for growth and development."
Indeed, this was one of the still-rock themes of the weekend, which was launched on Friday with a large cocktail highlighting the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage's appointment as party leader.
One of the adopted resolutions proposes to rechristen the Beauharnois headquarters of the Adélard-Godbout Dam.
"From Godbout founded Hydro-Québec, to Lesage, who performed the Peaceful Revolution and Nationalisation of Water, to Bourassu, who created James's Bay, our party was able to shape the future," Jean Charest said.
At the press conference, he referred to another authority, this time conservative, on John Diefenbaker's "Roads to the North" program, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
When it was the turn of the Eastmain1a-Ruper dam hydroelectric plant, Charest stressed that its launch was planned for 2012.
"I say this between us, but I plan to be there," he confided to his membership base, sparking a round of applause.
The same prime minister who said in April that there would be no elections in 2008, and doubtless in 2009, did not rule out the possibility of calling an election in the autumn of this year, as was allowed by law.
However, he stressed that his program was packed, especially with a federal council mission in China and the Quebec-New York summit.
The weekend congress gave the Liberal leader a platform for some nationalist resolutions, especially certain "exchanges to the Constitution" that went very smoothly: the PLQ (Liberal Quebec Party) particularly calls for recognition of the "specificity of Québek" in the Constitution.
He also wished that Quebec would appoint a portion of the members of the Canadian Broadcasting Council for Radio and Television, who would have a veto on a veto in the event of the decisions taken in Quebec.
On the part of the opposition, the North Plan was sceptically adopted in its main features.
The head of the PQ (Parti Quebecois) Pauline Marois has once again pulled out the North Development Politics of Quebec, which was launched by the Landry government in 2001.
According to her, when the Liberal government came to power in 2003, it renerses the fulfilment of this policy.
If she were to hold on to her, "we would be further along today," Marois remarked alongside her candidate in Jean-Talon (where the election is taking place today) Françoise Mercure.
ADQ said it would support the adoption of Plan North in the government.
"However, we wish it was not just a spectacle," explained Sébastien Proulx, the leader representing Mario Dumont, who is returning from the holidays today.
Letters - A disrespectful land
It was Vic Toews, the ex-minister of "justice" (O irony) in Harper's cabinet, who in the summer of last year took the liberty of telling himself that he represented a "hanba" for Canada.
In this way, to disinherit a woman who has waged a relentless fight for justice and who deserves all our admiration, says a great deal about the Prime Minister's surroundings and about Stephen Harper himself.
We have before us a government that, as the only one of the Western countries involved, did not take back to the homeland of its national, locked up in the Guantánamo concentration camp.
A re-entit who takes into account at all that, at the time of the acts he is being accused of having taken place, Omar Khadr was a teenage adolescent.
The only government that, despite Canada's signing the Geneva Convention, is denying its word and leaving it to rot in the inhumane conditions of a child soldier.
The only one who relies on a parody of justice to assess the defendant's guilt.
Recall that UNICEF, Amnesty international, and the Canadian Attorneys Association in particular advocates advocating the repatriation of Omar Khadr in order to see a fair trial in Canada.
The same government turns a blind eye to torture: it cares little about the fact that this young man is now psychologically destroyed, no doubt permanently, after so many years of torment.
We don't realize that, but we are witnessing the creeping erosion of our rights, our freedom and our "democracy," the words Harper is flaunting so much and which sounds so hollow from his mouth.
The time has come for no longer to exist: it is possible to torture a Canadian citizen, to treat him to the miste, to imprison him at the discretion of the head of the hitherto minority government (as it will be after October 14...).
Many voters believe they will find rescue in a party that proclaims the Vacy, the Law, and the Order: they do not see that this government has renised what created the reputation and seriousness of our country.
Shame is, Mr. Toews, in this renunciation, and not elsewhere.
Nuts - Orwellian discourse by Barrick Gold
In its September 17 edition, Le Devoir published a letter to Patrick J. Garver, executive vice president of the Canadian Mining Company Barrick Gold.
With Orwellian logic, he confirms that the world's largest gold producer has begun the prosecution of three authors and a poor libel publishing house in order to trigger a "transparent public debate" and is demanding six million of them.
If it is true that judges are independent and impartial, they do not judge truthfulness, especially in the case of prosecution for libel, but by law.
It is no surprise that Garver is completely oreening to the point of distinction.
Or is it for Barrick Gold the best way to have a public debate to bankrupt anyone who would dare to defend the opposite position?
Whatever the outcome of the process, the author and publisher of the book Noir Canada (Black Canada) will be forced to spend respectable sums to be prepared to defend themselves and fight in a highly unbalanced fight with an army of attorneys supported by the almost off-clad pockets of mining company.
Moreover, the tactics in these unbalanced struggles often consist in the deft of the defendants in order to enforce conciliation proceedings that will be fentled by the opposing party and, moreover, by anyone who dares to dedicate himself to the matter.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, it should have presented its view to public opinion.
Contrary to what is happening in several countries where Barrick Gold operates, Canada's debate under normal circumstances consists in exchanging ideas, rather than baton blows.
The Mining Society was therefore not enough to open its books, its documentation, and to establish a real debate through a newspaper, media, publications and funding of independent science teams that could shed light on the matter.
Barrick Gold, however, does not seem to have any confidence in public opinion and rejects petitions and letters in support of the authors of the book Noir Canada.
Perhaps Garver could explain how he can demand a "public debate" while scorp for the views of the same public?
This word in the vice-president's world seems to refer to only bourced attorneys, and not all Canadians; that is a rather narrowed concept of the term.
In a democracy, even the nute-talers have the right to speak.
Barrick Gold does not understand - or does not want to understand - that the public, who supports the authors and publishers of Noir Canada, does so primarily because it rejects the brutal ways of the mining company.
The public is ready to hear Barrick and consider the matter, but on the basis of a civilised exchange of arguments, not in what many perceive as a prosecution in which the defendant's mouth is to be clogged (in the framework of its prosecution of the "public debate" Barrick, by the way, has just given an official notice to the authors of Noir Canada to officially inform them that they should stop using the term...).
Aside from the surreal speech of Garver, the prosecution initiated by Barrick Gold is a direct attack on the university's freedom of research and the search for truth that is essential for any democratic society.
Overall, it denies the right to quote credible sources and to a debate about the facts and interpretations that itself form the basis of intellectual activity.
If it is impossible in a country like Canada to study and discuss topics that the rich firms of this world do not like without expose ourselves to repeated prosecution, who else will be able to do so?
If Barrick Gold had really wanted a public and transparent debate, it could have been created if it had followed the scientific norms used by the authors of Noir Canada.
He has the right to answer.
The university environment to which we belong has long been able to manage debates and disagreements and resolve conflicts.
Barrick Gold's overreaction lawsuit clearly shows that, despite what it claims, it has no appetite for a transparent debate.
This is a loss for the university world, as it is for the public debate in Canada, and it is time for governments to introduce measures to limit such a type of wrongful prosecution.
Operations to save Wall Street - Democrats and Republicans understand each other
Yesterday, the Bush administration and the leaders of Congress, both Republicans and Democrats, finally reached an agreement on the biggest economic bailout plan since the Great Crisis of the 1930s.
A new version of the plan to use US$700 billion to hinder the financial crisis that has been roaming Wall Street for months has yet to be approved by both houses of Congress.
In particular, it envisages: better control of its applications, new mechanisms to ensure the repayment of public money imposed, new arrangements for capturing the number of homes seized for defaults, as well as the right to monitor the level of wages paid to executives of rescued firms.
US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, Speaker of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi and Republican officials at the negotiating table, Senator Judd Gregg, announced the good news a few minutes after midnight yesterday, following the end of the two-day negotiation marathon.
"We have made great progress and come to an agreement that will be effective in the markets," said Bush administration official, Henry Paulson.
"Eeverything has been done to ensure that the real economy and ordinary Americans are safe from the crisis currently taking place on Wall Street," the Democrat explained.
"That's a crucial point: if we don't do it, the trauma, the chaos, and disruption of Americans' daily lives will be enormous," said Republican Judd Gregg.
Over the past few hours, the negotiations have taken to the utmost momentum for fear of the effect of further failure on the investor's mood.
The designated time limit was to open the markets this morning.
The two candidates for the US president were later invited to the negotiations, and both were more likely to comment on the deal, but without negating their dissatisfaction with the need to resort to such an extreme solution.
Democratic Senator Barack Obama has added to the addition of the agreement on some of the measures, in particular the aim of which is to enable the owners of residence to remain, and the wage measures for leading working state-rescued firms.
"When we ask taxpayers to take special measures because of the irresponsibility of some people, there is nothing to congratulate themselves.
However, these measures are necessary," he explained on the TV's waves.
His Republican opponent, John McCain, who was questioned by another station on whether to vote for the proposed plan, replied, "I'd like to see the details, but I hope so."
"The rough features I have read [suphe] show that it is something that we will all have to digest and use to move on.
Choosing inaction is simply unacceptable," he said.
The $700blar billion plan aims to buy back doubtful claims and risky and non-sale assets of US financial institutions with taxpayers' money.
The plan comes after a 14-month crisis sparked by the bursting of the housing bubble, which first led to the collapse of risky mortgage loans (subprimes), then transferred to other, more widespread forms of credit (PCAA) and resulted in a cash freeze and the decomposition of banks and financial institutions.
The collapse of last week's first draft agreement was due to Republican members.
Ever since the Democrats agreed to the government's guarantee for some of the "toxic" assets of the troubles of companies, but not to buy them, there is a belief that the impasse is aunting arode.
In an effort to approximate conflicting views in Congress, a measure has been added to the government to introduce new fees to help it get its deposit back if, as a result of the program, it has to take losses for five years.
The new plan envisages a first amount of $250 billion to add an additional $100 billion if the president deems it necessary.
The next $350 billion bill's next should be approved by Congress in a new vote.
In exchange for his help, Washington will acquire stakes in rescued firms that will pay him dividends in the event of a profit and which he will be able to resell when it is over.
The federal government will be able to delay the seizure procedures of the loans related to the loans covered by the plan, as well as setting limits on the level of valuation and compensation paid to the executives of the affected firms.
The plan's architect would like to vote in the House of Representatives today and in the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite all the efforts made, it is not yet certain that their plan will be green.
Yesterday, the vote in both the Republican camp as well as in the Democratic camp continued to rise against the project.
"It's very obvious that Washington can't hear you," said Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the House Finance Commission, addressing voters.
"Yes, we have a serious financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But earning money in the taxpayers is not the solution."
Democratic representative Brad Sherman, the moderator of a group of congressmen nicknamed the "Skeptics's "Skeptics's "Speaker" is presented differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
"The forty-hundred esteemed economics professors, among them three Nobel laureates, wrote to us: we ask Congress not to rush too much and to examine the path of the journey to take," he said yesterday.
At the same time, it was reaffirmed in Europe that this crisis was a world crisis.
Following the end of the extraordinary meeting at the end of the extraordinary meeting the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalisation of the Fortis banking group for €11.2 billion ($16.3 billion).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg became necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas announced that it was withdrawing from the purchase of its competitor, who is on the verge of collapse since it lost 2 billion euros ($2.9 billion) as a result of a crisis in risky real estate loans in the United States.
Fortis employs 85,000 people, is one of Europe's top 20 largest banks and the top ten insurers.
"We will not lose this money," Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos said yesterday.
"In return, we get the right to vote in the bank and influence.
And that's what savers and households in these uncertain times can appreciate."
So far, on the other side of the Channel, the British government has launched the nationalisation of another bank affected by the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government was to take over all existing loans from Bradford and Bringley, of which more than $41 billion ($75.5 billion) were loans to buy real estate.
According to its announcement yesterday, the Spanish bank Santander will buy the branches and accounts of the British bank's clients.
Bradford and Bringley will be the second bank after Northern Rock, which the British government must nationalize since the start of the financial crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of a socially committed icon
His beauty, with azeu's eyes, had long been his trump card, according to others, a weakness.
Did this American actor get off with a charming d narcissism smile?
Yes and no.
The shyness, sensitivity and relentless talent inherent to him also distined him from the force category that begets the true stars.
However, what a long shot he was!
Paul Newman died on Friday at the age of 83, at his ranch in Connecticut as a result of lung cancer, and remains one of the last icons of the hefty years of American cinema.
Less spectacular than Brando, to whom he was similar and for a long time he had been a rival to his film screen, Newman was a more cautious actor, certainly a more fragile but also an apostle of freedom and the disintegration of dramatic conventes.
Mixed blood often breeds beautiful children.
Born in Ohio in 1925, his father was a German Jew and a mother of a Hungarian.
These European roots were born one of the famous faces of the American dream.
Without an exaggerated ego, which is the last sign of quality.
Having seen this whole country in love with self-entitled mana, a fighter in the Pacific War, injured in a battle who studied acting at Yale in the early 1950s, then attended New York's Actor's Studio and celebrated a triumph in the theater, on television and soon in film.
The same man who fought for civil rights was also a racing driver who placed second at the 24-hour race at Le Mans in 1979, and a sexual symbol, despite having been a model couple with actress Joanne Woodwarde since 1958.
With it, the shatters of this hidden, discreet, socially engaged star leave, allergic to the fuss of their own show-business, which will always remain mysterious to some extent.
A decent man, in the noblest of the word.
Paul Newman's departure this weekend has made the film's lovers dizzy, while his big roles compete with each other on the black screen of memories.
After it, he paraded for more than half a century of ever-changing American seventh art.
The charming cowboy of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), who revisits his voluptuous wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in the Cat on the Heated Roof, a 1958 adaptation of Tennessee Williams.
From the less distant past (1990), we recall his sensitive Mr. Bridge, disturbed at an advanced age by marriage that has not lived up to all expectations.
So many more Pauls Newmans have gone down in history.
Boxer Rocky Graziano, a cunny, violent, unforgettable delinquent from the Somebody Up There Likes Me, Robert Wis, a role for James Dean, taken after his death, which made Newman's acquaintance in 1956.
A sympathetic gangster in the absolutely brilliant The Sting (Sunit), the Oscar for Best Film in 1973.
The bitter and vengeful pond-humble poclau player in Robert Rossen's astonishing The Hustler (1961), portraying the same character in Martin Scorsese's The Color of Money, which will bring him the only Oscar of seven nominations in 1987.
This face traveling the ages, that was him.
And him again.
In his career, various epochs compete.
The young know him, thanks largely to the cult Slap Shot of George Roy Hill (1977), from the role of Reggie Dunlop, an unconventional hockey coach.
Fans reunited with him in 1994 at The Hudsucker Proxy Brothers Coen.
He then tied his career as the godfather of the Irish mafia in Road to Perdition by Sam Mendes in 2003.
Unlike a few movie legends that left the trade quite early on, Newman stayed in the business for a long time, though he denounced Hollywood with his gollies, flamboyance, and concessions.
French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier, not humorless, regarded him "the live call of underplaying," judging that he pushed too hard in his performances.
For the beautiful Paul Newman, to whom the roles came as a dosser, the profession was not always so gentle.
But he played first lovers less often than outsiders: neurotic, alcoholics, crooks, and desperate people whose declines and rebellions reflected in his perfect features.
As director, Newman revealed the little-known pages of his shy sensitivity.
His 1968 film Rachel, Rachel (on the novel of Canadian Margaret Laurence), starring his wife Joanne Woodward, is given a sensitive female portrait full of melancholy.
To his son Scott, whom he lost due to an overdose, he dedicated his 1986 film Harry and Son, a work of shame and sadness.
In the torrent of honours Newman's received yesterday, his great friend and former comrade-in-arms Robert Redford (played together in The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) said saddened, "His presence made my life and the country better."
The great-twiseness, the love of life, such are the main qualities of a deceased actor.
Aside from his legendary career, a great champion of civil rights, ecology, an independent film, an opponent of the decline of Hollywood, also leave.
We used to see his likeness on bottles of wine vinegar, sauces, biscuits and other foods, which we might find rather tasteless, though it was a gag at first.
However, the proceeds from the sale went to his Hard- Childhood Foundation.
Newman, rather than be lulled by fame, has been involved in society until the last minute.
He left a letter to his five daughters containing the following sentences: "Every time and to the end your father was grateful to his happy planet.
It was an honor to be here."
And it was an honor for us to be able to follow the career of a life as a prescient and magnanimous American artist.
And besides, after all, a model citizen.
What was produced in the Zuschlag & Co. invoice factory?
Soon, on October 8, the trial will begin in the criminal proceedings against Yesandi Zuschlag and his associates.
The politician and his associates are charged, among other crimes, including forgery of documents, of fraud committed in a long-term and systematically criminal organisation, as a result of which the resulting extra significant damage was caused.
According to the prosecution, they used the money received in public tenders for their own purposes and often evidenced the performance of the tasks with fictitious invoices.
The money from the state and the municipalities - a total of approximately 65 million forints - went partly to the coffers of Fiatal Baloldal, partly to the pockets of individuals.
The method, which was also reported by the Bureau of Investigation, was that the money received in the public tenders had been levied on the basis of invoices for which there was no real consideration, and never received the association's commitments.
According to the indictment, a large portion of the invoices were fake.
The forms for these invoices came from the Józsefváros market, the round stamps were made in Kiskunhalasi.
The names in which companies are to be produced by invoice was decided, among other things, on a circular tour along the north bank of Balaton, to which he sent to István Lados János Zuschlag.
According to his statement, the former was to look for guesthouses and restaurants.
In them, he applied for bills for his consumption, according to the model of which the invoices submitted in the context of the public tenders tenders listed by, among others, the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs, the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs and the Samoo Governing of the Capital, respectively, were produced.
The invoices were mostly exhibited by István Lados with his partner Andras Őrim, who, according to our information, most often wrote the reports needed to obtain subsidies.
On his "studo tour," Lados spotted a beer hall.
According to the two invoices issued by Zuschlag and his associates in 2003, this hospitality establishment provided catering for a 90-member group from the Biztos Pont association.
So many people, however, according to the company manager's claims, would not suddenly fit into this facility.
Similarly, the invoice issued by the summer of 2002 to the foundation entitled Jobb Jövőért, later Együtt and Harmadik Évezredért, was swarmed with formal and content errors.
The guesthouse in Badacsonytomai had only three rooms, more than ten people could not sleep in it one night, yet one hundred and thirty guests were shown on the invoice.
However, fillers of the form of a rich fantasy made the case even when they referred to documents of a company also devoted to the hospitality - Pigal s. r. o., in the accounts of which, according to the information provided to the prosecutor's office, the documents in the name Jobb Jövőért and Hoppá did not even be included.
The company's head, Győző Farkas, said for hvg.hu that when he was summoned to the prosecution and showed him the invoices, he immediately knew that they were fake documents.
"The name of our business and our tax number were on the stamp in the wrong place."
As he added, apart from the formalities, the fact that they had accommodated a hundred people according to the invoice, they had only eleven rooms that did not have as much capacity.
In addition, the invoice was also shown to be catering, while their restaurant has not been working for a long time.
The outrageful invoicing manufacturers were not convinced that the Budapest travel agency was only organizing foreign trips, and the invoice with the cash payment invoice, which was also not a match for the company's invoicing practice, they foolishly said as a service to arrange a trip to Hungary.
In addition, as the investigation revealed in the course of the investigation, they also stated in the document VAT, although the organisation of travel to countries outside the European Union was released from VAT.
On the four documents issued by the Jobb Jövőért Foundation by Hotel Révfülöp s. r. o. disagreed, among other things, the amount of VAT. The company's activities are not covered by the listed 25 per cent but 15 per cent VAT, in addition, the hotel's employees issued only printed invoices, but the invoice produced was written by hand.
In addition, they spoiled the "pubers" invoice by, for example, saying at one of the firms, as revealed by the prosecution's investigation, such as the activity of road transport carried out by the company, which was not held on investment advice.
That the invoices issued to the Egyptütt and Harmadik Évezredért and the XXI associations. The Századi Kulturális Egyesület and Biztos Pont were false, was also billed because of the formal deviations - the non-matched invoice format and the false stamp.
As in the case of Ravenna k. s. or the Kunfehértó Sports Camp, whose officials denied that they had issued the invoices.
For example, the forgeries did not even notice that HIB s.r.o. from Nyíregyházy was in liquidation at the time (2001), when a group from the Fiatal Városért association was eating at it, which is why, according to our information, the company's liquidation commissioner also denied that he had issued the paper.
The invoices were deliberately exhibited
The second set of invoices is made up of those who knew to issue a fictitious invoice.
The Esély Budapestért Foundation issued the bills for about four million forints for Harmadik Évezredért at the request of Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjú Szocialisták.
The head of the Collab s. r. o. company was prompted, according to the indictment, by one of the accused Ludovic Györfi to issue a fictitious account.
Zuschlag and his associates also worked with Biogate s. r. o, currently in liquidation, which in 2003 supplied Jobb Jövőért and the Atlasz and Vörösfenyő with invoices worth some five million forints, for which there was no real economic activity.
Nor the movement of money, because the invoices created were later canceled, which the organizations have already forgotten to put in their documents.
Another group of invoice firms includes those that had ties to the defendants.
Thus, for example, Iván Kubatov was the commissioned representative of the Ukrainian managing director of Delta Trió s. r. o., a fuel trading company and motor vehicles, based in Budapest, but on which the company is not to be found.
The company issued several invoices for the sale of IT worth approximately 18 million forints in October, November and December 2005.
According to the data found by the investigation, these invoices were purchased by the Kiskunhalas company Cash Investment s. r. o., which was in liquidation since 14 September 2005.
The company's manager was a man from Romania, to whom Iván Kubatov was to hand over the company's charter in 2002-2005.
As we know, during the investigation, Kubatov admitted that he had issued invoices to the Atlasz, Hoppá and the Foundation of Együtt and Harmadik Évezredért and accepted their consideration himself.
In a pronunch, at the request of Iván Kubatov, the companies of Fa-Bani Jos Faipari s.r.o. and Jos-Investment k. s. were founded by the Romanian bricklayers.
In fact, neither of the companies worked, according to the defendant, because they were not given a job.
Nevertheless, the businesses were of good for him, as at the request of the co-accused lawyer Zsolt Szente, who also prepared their founding documents, he issued invoices to Atlasz and Y-Generáció linked to Zuschlag.
On behalf of the firms Investment, Delta Trio, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade, Kubatov gave the organizations a total of 15 invoices worth 14.2 million forints.
The prosecutor's office decided that Kubatov had come in at 10 percent of the sums on the invoices and VAT.
To issue fictitious invoices, this time for the selection process for Biztos Pont, the man also used Szi-Beri k. t.
In January 2006, Y-Generáció and Szövetség and Modern Magyarország.rt submitted proposals for the Miahlye Táncsicse (TMA) Foundation for the public tender.
They received 500,000 forintech each, but did not make the sums for the targets set out in the proposals.
To make it out, TMA submitted five fictitious invoices from Works Team s. r. o.
These invoices were, after all, found during a search at the office of Árpad Kemecsei at the Ministry of Education.
During the trial, some of the defendants are likely to describe the course of invoice production, as she has already done in the prosecutor's.
It may be interesting if the main defendant, János Zuschlag, decides to reveal everything.
His testimony to date is not very detailed, and although he has promised several times that he will interpret everything at a close, he has not yet done so.
The question is whether it is in his interest - in exchange for paying for a large part of the damage, fifty million forints, perhaps the Socialists have made a deal with him, and Zus will take the fall for it.
Indeed, he may have been even offended so far, as his requests to ease the conditions of detention, namely to be placed in house arrest, have remained unheard in the short while.
While the perpetrators of the economic offences, who have done much more damage that they have not yet paid for, are free to walk or at least wait for the end of their trial in their homes, he does not have that option.
The psychology of trumping: why are we spending more money?
At auctions, customers are willing to spend more money, overestimate the goods.
The neurological and economic foundations of this well-known - and seemingly irrational - behavior have been uncovered by researchers in the field of neurology and economics at the University of New York.
According to their study, published in the journal Science, people don't want to lag behind in the eBay auction-type competition, so they'd rather pay too high a price.
The research was used by an experimental auction to map out the scheme of this "gate" in the nervous system.
One group of volunteers ghanded, the other group participated in the mock auction, while using the functional magnetic resonance imaging method (fMRI) to examine the active areas of the brains of the experimental people.
In both games, the participants could have won the money, but in the game at the auction, an important element of which is to outmath to overwhere, the whole found under the cerebral cortex, called striatum, began to work intensively in the loss.
In addition to many other functions, this brain area plays a role in the "self-refining" mechanism of the nervous system.
The unscrewing of the price is therefore possible, according to the researchers, to be explained by the aim of avoiding the stric-troiding reaction of the striat.
To shore up their theory, members of the research team conducted a financial cross-sectional survey from economists.
Under different conditions, three groups were bidding against one partner.
The control group was simply told what the real value of the product was, and they made bets.
In addition, members of the next group were promised that if they emerged victorious, they would receive an extra $15 as a reward.
The third group, on the other hand, received $15 before the auction, but in the event of a loss its members lost that money as well.
The difference between the two groups, then, was all about one being emphasized by a win and a loss for the other.
Members of the group playing "anti-protest" were, however, willing to go higher than in a control and "winning" group, which confirms the neurologists' hypothesis.
"These results cannot be derived from any pre-existing economic theory.
These have until now explained the phenomena observable at auctions with the joisin of victory and the avoidance of risk.
It was the neurological imaging methods that helped us resolve the contradiction between these two theories so that we have now come to a third explanation," stated Andrew Schotter, a professor at the University of Economics at the University of Economics.
Hepatitis: when to see a doctor?
Approximately half a billion people worldwide suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C infection, while in Hungary this chronic liver disease is listed as the main causes of death.
The number of domestic cases of hepatitis infection is estimated at one hundred thousand, but only 7,000 of them are treated. The cause of this is that the sufferers often do not know they are infected.
The name hepatitis is the aggregate naming of infectious liver damage caused by various viruses.
There are many similarities in their symptoms, with liver and jaundice inflammation, but the agents of the disease and the diseases they cause differ from each other.
Hepatitis viruss are spreading in two main causes, depending on the disease,: hepatitis A and E digestive system (for example, in-infected food, water), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses of blood and bodily fluids (sperm, ash, saliva).
In any case, travelers should be protected by vaccination against A and B, the vaccine does not exist against the C virus.
Symptoms of hepatitis A occur two to three weeks after taking the infected meal, usually accompanied by nausea, weakness, abdomination, urges to vomit.
Then, jaundice, a lightened stool is formed on the skin and the whale of the eye and the whale of the eye, and darkening the urine. The treatment can take up to two to three weeks.
Every year, a million people die worldwide from a more serious type of the disease, liver cancer and liver cirrhosis caused by hepatitis B.
The main cause is that an estimated one in ten of the infected is treated with medication.
hepatitis C can also have very serious consequences: if not treated, it can lead to liver cirrhosis or liver cancer.
Most of the infected are not even aware of their illness, the disease's agents are destroying liver cells insidiously, and so the first symptoms come in many cases in 20-30 years.
Therefore, early prevention, regular depotage, is very important.
In three groups, the disease occurs a lot more often than on average: among people who had a blood transfusion before 1991, between drug users, and a tattoo among people.
Currently, the projected global number of individuals infected with the chronic hepatitis C virus is 200 million.
As the disease can already be demonstrated by a routine laboratory examination, a person should contact their general practitioner if they record any sign of unknown origin.
When detected early, the disease is treatable, the virus can be removed from the body to prevent contagion and prevent cancer from occurring.
September 30 is the world day of hepatitis, which was organised by the organisations representing the sick for the first time in 2004.
It aims to draw attention to chronic liver inflammation caused by these viruses, the causes of its origin and the importance of early detection of the disease.
Benelux's nationalis d's dugout part of Fortis Bank
The Benelux states will be helped by Fortis, Belgium's-Dutch Bank, which was the first in Europe to get into trouble over the spreading effect of the US mortgage market crisis, by partial nationalism: the three countries will support the money and insurance institute, which also has a capital participation in Hungary, with €11.2 billion.
This was agreed at the highest level by the Belgian, Luxembourg and Dutch governments, with the participation of the President of the European Central Bank and the European Commissioner for Competition.
Fortis is the first in the euro area to be in a major crisis in the crisis of international financial markets, spreading in the waves for more than a year, and the decisions taken on this issue could be considered as precedents from some point of view.
In the sense of the decision, which was born on Sunday night, all three states will buy almost half (49 per cent) of the bank's assets.
The bank will sell some of its capital holdings with absolute certainty, especially - mainly insurance - activities purchased last year from Dutch bank ABN Amro.
Shares in Fortis began to plummet as early as last week, with serious signs of a crisis already appearing at the institute in the second half of the week.
But analysts agree that the bank, with its 85,000 employees, is too big to let it go bankrupt.
The company's securities fell by 12 percent on Friday alone, to a 14-year low.
Since January, the value of the shares has fallen by more than two-thirds.
Given the current share prices, the group's total market share capital is around €14 billion, but this is unrealistic, according to the company's leaders.
Indeed, the company's management blames Fortis's collapse of the overseas market uncertainty surrounding the adoption of the US package's plan worth $700 billion.
By Monday, the stock had risen slightly.
On Friday, the new CEO, Filip Dierckx, was appointed to head the bank.
The Cashmorlain Institute was also looking for private buyers, but no one has yet come forward with a more serious offer.
The Belgian government had previously announced that investors did not have to worry, they would not lose their money.
Panic has not yet broken out among the bank's clients and the branches have not been taken by storm.
In Hungary, Fortis Bank has a separate branch and has also bought up several leasing firms.
Who believes in God, doesn't it hurt so much?
According to the results of recent research, faith in God works as a kind of analgesic that could ease the death of the already Catholic martyrs.
Scientists at the University of Oxford conducted an interesting experiment, examining how a belief in the god of pain influences a person, the British Telegraph reported.
As part of a rather bizarre survey, they subjected 12 Catholic believers and the same number of atheists to electric shocks, while all of them observed a painting depicting the Virgin Mary.
According to the results, the Catholic faithful were able to rule out much of the pain.
The technique closely examining the human brain has also shown that Catholics were able to activate the part of their brain that is responsible for pain control.
The research is the first of a series of research, which is attended by scientists, philosophers and theologians from different parts of the university, alongside academics.
Exactly the test was done by attaching a sparkling instrument to the test subject's left hand, which was making electric shocks.
Researchers asked the participants of the experiment to stare at two paintings: Sassoferrat's Virgin Mary from the 17th century and the Lady with the Vocarius Leonardo da Vinci, painted in the 15th century.
The authors of the research hoped that the view of the Virgin Mary would provoke a certain state of piety among the faithful, while da Vinci's painting was chosen because it was not very different from the first and they were reassuring.
The experimental subjects spent half an hour in the MRI scanner and during this time received 20 electroshock parts in four consecutive parts, while separately following the painting with a religious or general theme.
The Catholics said that the sight of the Virgin Mary felt "fate" as if they had been "themed" and "reinforced, peace fulfilled."
Watching the religious-themed image, they felt 12 percent less pain than they did when they had Leonardo's work in front of them.
Psychologist Miguel Farias, who also participated in the research, believes that a similar effect can be achieved by any strongly impressive image even in atheists, just a photograph to be found.
"We would have to find an image that they will perceive very positively, from the position of the mother or father," the psychologist said.
The Anglican Bishop Tom Wright welcomed the results of the research.
"Practicating faith should change and, in many cases, change our personality," Wright added.
After such brilliant results, it is only a question of what effect it would have to be on regulating the pain of the faithful if they showed them a Madonna by Leonardo or a painter of a similar calibre.
Would the view of the quality of the Virgin Mary mean achieving even better results?
You're what you're gonna share
On its tenth birthday, Google can say that people can find it in their pockets at least as well as they can in the sky over their heads; they know where they were on vacation, what expert examinations they attend, and what they care about.
But according to Eric Schmidt, one of the company's bosses, that's still not enough.
However, when it comes to sceptics making a parallel with the Orwellian dark vision, they are not exactly clear at the very essence of the 2.0.
Eric Schmidt recently commented to the Financial Times that Google's main goal is to collect even more personal data about users, which is necessary to enable Google's founders to stick to their original intention, which was, "Let's keep all the information in the world!"
According to the interviewed Google official, the company, even after ten years of world-flag work, is only at the beginning to work with all the information.
Asked what would happen in five years' time, Schmidt said he would like to see Google's "what am I supposed to do tomorrow?" or "what would be a good job for me?" - but the software won't be able to answer such seemingly simple questions until they know enough about users.
Not all Internet users know well that the searches are accurately captured during the internet search as well as from which IP address they were searched and to which pages the candidates moved after the search.
For example, thanks to Personalized Search, launched two years ago, users can keep a history of their surfing, can look back at what they were looking for and what they click on, which then generates finds adapted much more directly to them in the long run - the same logic will also be based on service services, through which the system will offer us products and services based on previously stated and retained preferences.
What if my data is used against me, what if someone looks at what I'm dealing with? - asks users who are afraid when looking at Google's data monopoly.
In most cases, the extent of the potential power represented by the company is more formidable, with anti-reactions not giving the Internet users an awareness of guilt, fear of punishment, the desire for freedom, or even a rebellion against power.
However, it is a confirmed fact that all the searched terms are not only captured, but can also be issued to a third party in justified cases, in such legal cases the personal rights of internet users are not protected.
The most famous example of recent times was perhaps a coordinated action against Brazilian paedophiles, during which Google provided the Brazilian government with information that allowed the identification of pedophiles from the Orkut community site, set up through it.
But online users who worry about personality rights could still be relieved in May when the firm, hand-in-hand with the EFF's e- Rights Protection Organization, successfully proved its truth in its dispute with the FBI: so Google must not be forced by any article of the Constitution to provide any information secretly requested by the FBI in the future.
(At the same time, the federal government successfully fought out nearly fifty thousand web addresses and a thousand searched terms, which it obtained, citing the reinforcement of the years-old Child Protection Act, but still failed to get lists of wanted items for individual users, or full lists of websites and keywords, including a period of two months.)
The Google's point of question is thus rather contradictory: it is whiped by those who fear to provide their personal data, because they feel that their intimate realm and private life will be caused to their harm by starting to use Google's services, and they are fled up against it with the revolt of the kind of conservative image-owned multinational firms.
And so far, the American geek culture and its wild offshoot, grouping around enthusiastic computer fans, activists, and users, appearing in many countries, sees it as a new generation of bigfire, "corporation, what's going on now," unlike his rival Microsoft, considered the world's conqueror of Windows, however they both fight for the same goals.
This may be due to the fact that Google, unlike Microsoft, does not require its users to be identified and wants them to with no money for its apps; an open, free, and constantly fresh source of information, and a package of programs, feels much more affordable, more youthful, "cool-fright" than the practice of an official software giant.
However, this may also be due to the fact that geeks understand exactly the very problematic relationship of the Internet and personality rights that has brought with it one of the most shiny keywords of recent years: web 2.0.
Indeed, the Web 2.0 is about nothing more than cooperation, about deliberately keeping tracks behind and using the communication channels at our disposal, and although their range is different for each, the point remains the same: we show up.
The average young person can keep a profile on several community sites from Facebook to Xang, which they can easily link to other services, such as Twitter or the last.fm app, recording the music he's listened to, all of which can then be connected to navigation systems such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm, in addition, he can write a blog on which his latest photo galleries, which will be automatically posted to Flickr or Picas.
In doing so, we can read about a lot of specimen cases from which he comes to light: a friend, looking at the floods of pictures of their friends-gone, it is easy to find out who her sham friend spent the evening with, or the company can fire his worker just because he recites his sincere opinion on his blog about the senior management: one thing is certain, the notion of private life has been completely reassessed today.
The one who lives life is made up of what he shows himself, so we could define the basic thesis behind the behavior of today's youth.
And anyone who wants to conceal something, or at least avoid a google monopoly, has the option (starting with Scroogle, for example, which uses Google's search system, but deliberately leaves no traces).
For example, a large number of people are not deliberately registered on the community site to prevent them from being found. Google's online applications from a text editor to a photo editor and the news portal can be replaced with alternative versions that are not connected to giant server parks and which do not set us up with the highest quality possible profile.
Public opinion is not very secretly awaiting when Google will show the teeth.
The company, with its current value of $156 billion, is worth more than IBM ($140 billion), Intel ($142 billion) or Coca Cola ($110 billion), advertising space AdWords/AdSense is threatened by investment by advertising agencies, and services implemented at an ever-accelerating rate are making life seriously more difficult for not only Microsoft, but also to numerous other software designers.
Critical observers, however, also find counterpoints that are unsettling: for example, the senior management has completely rejected workers' protests after it has doubled the fee for the company's kindergarten, the arbitrarily frequent daily catering of employees, according to the company's management, all of which is lost, but all of this is lost in addition to the fact that Google bowed to the Chinese government in 2006 and filters out any find that contrary to good taste or interests of the Chinese regime.
One of the company's internal rules is that it never advertises new services in advance, only when they can be used, but what is certain is that the expected problems of the months and years to come can wander the world in new places: while some believe that Google's project on scanning and archiving books and magazines takes on such proportions that the company will soon be dealing with the US Supreme Court, others are terrified of its Health system, in which we can build a complete health profile with previous findings, doctors and problems.
The fact that Google compiles a genetic database can then serve as a good source material for subsequent generations of science writers, the famous novel by Cory Doctorow "Scroogled" describes with Orwellian reminiscences the future, in which one can only be discflagrably approached with Google data.
The two-time assassin from the O-air was helped to remove the tracks of two teenagers
Two juveniles were interviewed by police in the case of the double murder in Ózdu, according to the reasonable suspicion of helping to remove the traces of this crime, a spokesman for the High Police Headquarters Borsod said on Tuesday.
Those who were suspected have confessed to the activities of which they were suspected and are currently charged with aiding and abetting a crime.
The two teenagers, according to MTI information, two girls are being prosecuted at large.
The committing of the crime is punishable by imprisonment for up to 5 years.
The suspect in the double murder of the Oder, a 23-year-old man here, was taken into provisional custody on Sunday.
He is suspected of the crime of pre-planned multiple murders for selfish reasons.
During the investigation, it emerged that the 23-year-old was owed a larger sum to the 53-year-old.
The suspect did not want to repay his debt, so he lured his creditor to a facility in the OW on Wednesday, where he killed a man first and then his 9-year-old daughter.
According to the MTI's information, the young man was preparing for the crime in advance, as evidenced by the fact that he committed the murder by a gun hidden at the scene of the crime.
The weapon and the circumstances of its use are examined by the police with the involvement of experts.
Warsaw Stock Exchange makes offer to buy Prague Stock Exchange
Two hundred million euros - approximately five billion Czech crowns - were offered by the Warsaw Stock Exchange to buy a 100% block of shares in the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, chairman of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed the offer made by the Polish side despite the fact that the Czechs had previously excluded the Warsaw Stock Exchange from the Warsaw Stock Exchange from the range of possible new owners of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason is that the owner of the Warsaw Stock Exchange is the state.
99 per cent of the shares are in the hands of the Polish state, which wishes to sell 60 percent of the securities in a few months.
As the Czech economic daily E15, the offer of Poles is the highest amount offered by bidders for the Prague Stock Exchange so far.
According to the Czech newspaper, the Vienna Stock Exchange, the transatlantic stock exchange Nasdaq, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and Deutsche Börse have so far submitted a bid.
The head of the Prague Stock Exchange, Petr Koblic, commented last week that the Warsaw Stock Exchange would be the worst new owner of all bidders, and did not rule out that this could lead to the demise of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
The value of the Prague Stock Exchange is estimated by stock market experts at 5-10 billion.
Under the shareholders' agreement, around 90 per cent of the shares could be sold off.
The biggest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is the investment bank Patria Finance, with an approximately 25 percent share, followed by Česká spořitelna with 14.7 and Tiger Holding Four S. a r. a.l. with 13.5 percent.
About the Financial Crisis in the View of the European Leisons
In their comments on Tuesday about the deepening international financial crisis, Europe's leading papers are already reminiscent of "a second of 9/11.
For the global financial disaster, we can thank the American president, the accusations are being brought about by Rome's La Repubblica. The president was not even able to rally his own party in support of that hastily spliced bill to correct this desperate situation...
Instead of the new Pearl Harbor, who was reminiscent of billionaire and investor Warren Buffett, we might be more likely to talk about the second 9/11.
Also, part of the Madrid press sees the culprit in Washington.
In the view of El Mundo, the world economy has brought the world economy to the brink of political leadership there.
The danger of the collapse of the US financial system continues to grow, for which the whole world will ultimately pay.
While the Bush plan was not perfect, there is a danger after the congressional vote that Washington will not offer a political tool to address the crisis.
The world economy is in the air - just as one of the greatest changes in the history of capitalism is underway.
The threat can no longer be neglected, the Geneva daily Tages-Anzeiger points out.
Individual states can still throw a lifeswing financial institution ring a lifesaving circle, and taxpayers can save them from a sophomoric.
But if other banks collapse like the dominoes, then neither the funds nor other improvisations will be enough.
In the long term, the Member States of the European Union need to move on through their national egoism and unify control over fragmented financial markets.
On Monday alone, the post-monating financial institutions received more than €100 billion, recalls Vienna's Der Standard, according to which fears that, like the Americans, European taxpayers will have to dig deep into their pockets in the face of dealing with the crisis, are increasingly real.
The European Union has not been seriously addressed in the crisis that is tsunami through the old continent.
"Paramedics" don't have to wave hundreds of billions of euros right away, but it would be a good idea if they set a firm one in which case it is prudent to reach for taxpayers' money to avoid even more damage.
Intelligent car imitates bumblebee flight
What would be the best method of developing technologies capable of preventing collision, if not imitations, of obstacle detectors occurring in the world of nature?
For example, bees.
The initial strategic idea of the surprise project, presented at the CEATEC trade fair in Japan, was given to Nissan's engineers by bumblebees. It was about how to build a new generation of systems that prevent collision.
In collaboration with the Tokyo University, Nissan designed a biomimetic robotic management system of the BR323C type, a robotized minicar that is equipped with bee properties, with the ultimate aim of helping to create a system that can eliminate all collisions.
"During the flight, each bee creates its own oval-shaped personal space, which is actually very similar to our safety protective packaging," explained Kazuhiro Doi, CEO of the brand for technology PR and R&D, at the exhibition.
Composite eyes play an important role, allowing bees to bee in all directions at the field of view of more than 300 degrees.
To copy the function of the composite eye, the engineers reached for the idea of a laser range.
This identifies the obstacles up to 2 metres in front of the BR23C in the field of view of 180 degrees, calculate their distance and sends the on-board microprocessor a signal that immediately transforms into a collision-movie operation.
The obstacle is caught in a split second, then begins to imitate the bee's movements and turn the wheels to the extent needed to prevent the collision immediately changes direction.
Unlike any existing system, this folding maneuver takes place in an absolutely instinctive way.
"If that were not the case, the robotic car would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid the obstacles," explains Toishyuki Ando, head of the Mobility Laboratory and the Robotic Car Project.
It must respond instinctively and immediately, as this technology suits the most vulnerable and innermost layer of the safety protective cover within which the collision is currently considered inevitable.
The process must be reflected in what the bee is doing to avoid other bees.
This process must not take longer than the blink of an eye.
However, unlike bees, this movement cannot be directed up, downwards or diagonally, it can only be two-dimensional and only in the direction in which the wheels can be turned.
Instead of the endless options offered to the bees when avoiding, only the possibility of rotating movement, acceleration and slowing were applied to the robotic car.
The BR23C uses lithium-polymer batteries that are lighter and have a higher energy density, which means they have a longer service life than the lithium-ion variants.
According to Ando, the important is the instinctive, intelligent response, not the ability to process, much less data storage.
This mechanism must only be processed and responded to a few incoming signals per second.
There is no need for him to store and respond using an intuitive logic based on data from previous manoeuvres, so he is constantly using only a memory of a few kilobytes.
It does not need memorabilia with giga- or megaabyte capacity.
This is the first step to develop instant evasive technology, which Nissan estimates could reach for the mass-produced cars in a decade.
Another possibility of application may be a link to the GPS satellite navigation system, which, after avoiding obstacles, would lead the motorist to the specified final destination.
The gurve-up expensive child already has a name
The $700 billion Rescue Economy Package Act, to be divided into several instalments and aimed at buying back the banks' shodlo-quality loans, is already in writing.
Half of the amount will be used in the first round.
After further negotiations, which ended after midnight on Saturday in US Eastern Time, congressional officials reached an agreement in a few days-long debate on a rescue package worth a total of $700 billion, Reuters reported.
"We have made significant progress," said Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic Speaker of the House of Representatives, according to which only the drafting of the agreement remains.
The compromise on the package was also supported by both presidential candidates Barack Obama and John McCain.
Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said of the compromise result: "The programme will work and will be effective, but further action is needed."
The written form of the package was released before the Asian markets opened on Sunday at 8pm Washington time (at 2 a.m. Central European Time on Monday), but did not cause any special rise in the stock markets.
The draft law hearing in the name of the Emergency Economic Stabilisation Act 2008 to be set up by the program will be voted on first by the House of Representatives, then the Senate's turn will be the turn of the Senate.
President George W. Bush spoke with Pelosi on Saturday evening, then news of the deal was also welcomed to the White House.
"We are satisfied with the progress made at night, and we are very much appreciated by both sides' efforts to stabilise our financial markets and protect our economy," White House spokesman Tony Fratto said.
Indeed, the program differs from the Bush administration's original proposal, which was supposed to be about spending a full $700 billion in mortgage-backed low-quality securities at the same time.
It is now possible to spend a maximum of half of 700 billion in the first around the first, so that the $250 billion will be used immediately after the matter is expected to be decided by Congress on Monday, and the Treasury Department will purchase for them the securities secured by mortgages, which are rated as of poor quality, the fate of the remaining $100 billion will then depend on the President's decision.
The programme will be audived by a special choir, which will also include the chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank.
The spending of the second half of the $700 billion will depend on Congress's next decision.
The Ministry of Finance can apply a combined tactic within the meaning of the law: it can simultaneously buy out poor quality loans, mortgages and securities secured by mortgages, or other "single" loans.
The buyout can take place both in the auctions and directly, the ministry's competent representatives said.
The legal standard will allow the firms concerned to participate in an insurance scheme in which the Treasury will provide them with a guarantee for funds presenting cause for concern, for which the company will then pay the price corresponding to the amount of the expected damage.
As Henry Paulson said, the law provides the necessary resources to spend up to $700 billion to meet the urgent requirements of the US financial system, whether it be a large-scale purchase of bad funds, their insurance, or preventing the systemic risk associated with the collapse of one of the major financial institutions.
"We will take the necessary steps to be ready to implement the law as soon as it is signed," he added.
On the contrary, bank chiefs who have run into trouble and are waiting for the state's help can count on the government to lower their severance package - which is simply called a "golden parachute" in overseas slang.
Their payouts will be reduced only in certain cases, in addition to these restrictions will depend on the method of assistance provided by the Ministry.
Basically, the restriction means that if the Ministry buys as part of the auction, the golden parachutes will be placed on the tax surcharge if the fallen bank managers are not sent straight to retirement.
In the case of a direct redemption of low-quality loans, the government will aggressively take the swiour in order to avoid excessive money for the management.
It should be added that the existing gold parachute contracts will not change, the restriction only applies to new ones, which is to be a further stimulus to participate in the programme.
"This is the first case in American history to have a statutory cap on the remuneration of CEOs," said the House Financial Services Committee's chairman, Democrat Barney Frank.
In addition, the State will have a right to acquire a stake in the programme in the banks participating in the scheme, thus reducing the risk of taxpayers, as once the economy and the rescued bank are on their feet, they can also profit from that transaction.
The draft plan includes that in the next five years, the president must submit to Congress a proposal to show to Congress how the expected financial sector losses can be returned to taxpayers.
Of course, there were also voices on both sides expressing doubts about the plan.
"This is not what the American citizens asked us to do, because this is not what taxpayer dollars will protect," said California Republican Congressman Darrell Issa.
His fellow Ohio's democratic colleague, Mary Captur, reckons that the adoption of the provision was urged by those responsible for the Wall Street collapse.
Industrial prices continued to rise
Domestic sales prices in the industry increased by 0.1 percent in August 2008 due to the previous month, up 12.9 percent compared to August 2007, the Central Bureau of Statistics reported.
The export sales prices in the industry were up by 1.1 percent compared to July 2008, down 3.9 percent year-on-year.
As a cause of changes in domestic and export prices, production prices were up 0.7 percent compared to the previous month, up by 3.2 percent year-on-year.
Domestic sales prices in the industry rose only minimally, by 0.1 percent, given the previous month.
Domestic sales prices in the manufacturing sectors also increased slightly compared to July, by 0.1 percent.
The biggest price increase was in August 2008 in the leather and footwear sectors (2.8 per cent), mainly due to the month-on-month price increase in the production of satellic and saddlery products by 4.6 per cent and 2.5 per cent respectively.
The higher price level of plastic and chemical raw materials caused a significant monthly increase in prices in the chemical materials and product sectors (1.6 percent).
The price cuts were in the oil processing sector (1.4 per cent), the production of electric machinery and appliances (0.9 per cent), as well as - to a minimal extent - in the woodworking sector (0.1 per cent).
Prices in the field of paper production and publishing and printing activities have not changed.
In other sectors of the manufacturing industry, we measured price increases in the range of 0.2 - 0.9 per cent.
In the electricity, gas and water distribution sector, which is of a heavy weight in domestic industry sales, prices rose by 0.3 percent in August, mainly due to the ongoing impact of the officially established gas price increase taking place from 1 July.
In a 12-month comparison of domestic sales in individual sectors of manufacturing, prices rose the most in the technical oil processing sector (32.4 percent).
In the metalworking production sector, it was possible to observe 13.2 per cent, in the production of food products, beverages and tobacco products, which have a decisive weight, an 11 per cent price increase.
Priced decreased in the textile and textile product production sectors (2.5 per cent) and the production of electrical machinery and appliances (0.3 per cent).
In other sectors of the manufacturing industry, the rate of price growth was between 0.6 and 9.1 percent.
Overall, prices in the manufacturing industry rose by 10.2 percent over the past year.
Prices in the electricity, gas and water distribution sectors surpassed prices from the previous year by 18.7 percent.
In terms of division by sector focus, domestic sales were shown in the highest monthly price increase (0.7 per cent) in the domestic sales in the sectors involved in the production of tangible assets.
In the consumer goods sectors, prices rose by 0.3 per cent, in the energy-recessing and further-reprocessing sectors, prices were unchanged in the previous month.
The biggest price increase due to the same month of the previous year could be seen in processing and further processing-processing energy in August 2008 (16.8 per cent).
In the consumer goods industries, we measured a price increase of 6.8 percent, while for tangible assets we have seen prices fall by 1.4 percent.
The export sales prices of industrial products as measured in forints increased by 1.1 percent in August compared to the previous month, down 3.9 percent in the 12-month comparison.
Our domestic currency weakened by 1.7 percent in one month due to the euro, then 7.1 percent relative to the euro, up 7.5 percent relative to the euro compared to August 2007 and 15.9 percent relative to the dollar.
By the next year, no visa to the United States?
According to Kingy Göncz, there is a great hope that the US-Hungarian visa-free agreement will come into force around January 12, the Minister of Foreign Affairs has spoken about this in Chicago before the leaders of the local Hungarian community.
In her view, "it's almost everything now matters if an electronic system of permitting journeys and inspections, or controls, is built in time overseas."
At the same time, she pointed out that there would be no entry permit as part of the new system, but tourists would have to register before they leave.
The representative of Hungarian diplomacy is continuing negotiations in Washington as of today.
He will meet with Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Condoleezza Rice, who will hand over the Central Cross with the star of the Order of Merit on the Hungarian Republic and conduct interviews with foreign policy advisors to Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama and Republican John McCain.
Barack Obama and McCain are all in favor of bailing out banks
Barack Obama and John McCain, the presidential candidates of both major US parties, consistently assured the government's $700 billion bail-outs package on Sunday, but there are also politicians demanding the resignation of the Chancellor of the Exchequer.
After a marathon of several days of negotiation by Congress and administration officials, it was announced in the early hours of Sunday morning: a basic agreement was reached on the bank rescue package.
The financial package, which aims to translate the Wall Street crisis and the frozen credit market, has become a central issue in the presidential campaign.
Both Obama and McCain have consistently described themselves as more suitable from both candidates to lead the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the most recent surveys, at the same time as economic issues came to the forefront, Obama won some of the advantage again, and McCain's lead, which secured Sarah Palin's vice-president's post after the Republican convention, was dissipated.
Obama expressed hope at a pre-election rally in Detroit on Sunday that the $700 billion package bill would be quickly adopted by Congress.
He stressed that the proposal contained passages on consumer protection, which it also supports.
"We must act now, responsibly (...) to your places, your jobs, the whole industry, the stability of the whole economy, the stability of the whole economy is in danger," he said in front of the 35,000-strong crowd.
He did not miss the opportunity to call McCain's ideas about the economy outdated.
In an interview given to the ABC television station, McCain said: "It will be a little hinged at all (...) but doing nothing is just a possible way."
As the Republican senator said, the draft features the establishment of a commission supervising the Treasury Secretary and a cut-schequiry for the top officials he insisted on.
Obama told CBS that McCain had no major role in the negotiations; he himself was in daily contact with the minister.
Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi said on Sunday that the House of Representatives would vote on the bill perhaps as early as Monday.
List of printing of the German language field
The right-wing camp is intact, only the voters inside it have become more confident - so it analyses the weak CSU's weak result in Bavaria Der Spiegel.
The Haiders are ready to govern Austria to prevent a red-and-black coalition.
Der Spiegel (spiegel.de)
In the online edition of the left-wing German news magazine, Franz Walter discusses in his article "The Moravian Revolution eats his father" the causes of the CSU's dramatic defeat.
According to a well-known political scientist, the erosion of the CSU began a long time before the sad Beckstein-Huber duo took over.
For decades, the Christian Socialists have been rebuilding Bavaria - and it is these modern citizens who are now turning away from them.
The rotation of the period is a problem for all of Christian democracy, and thus to Angela Merkel.
The debacle was not entirely surprising for the CSU, but on Saturday the process that could be assumed to be almost exactly ten years ended: an undisputed hegemony of one of the state's-partys ended.
Already a decade ago, in 1998, CSU landed at 47.7 percent, for the first time since the 1950s below the 50 percent threshold.
This was repeated three years ago at the 2005 Bundestag elections, in the period so often commemorated by Stoiber.
The cause is the modernisation that the CSU has consistently carried out in this country, which is being used to it by its parents.
Sociologists have been predicting this for 40 years, but they have made a very mistaken pace. Seclarization, educational outcomes, the resettlement of Germans from the east and from the north in the emerging regions of Bavaria, however, could not have been without consequence in the fidelity of the voters of the CSU.
Modernisation is linked to the growth of options, which has its visible political implications.
The right-wing camp is intact, with only the voters inside it becoming more confident, more critical, more head-on.
It is also clear that in recent weeks, the CSU has been the most distant from the classical civic classics; the people of the liberal profession, the tradesmen, the individuals with the graduation and the university's education.
This has already shrunk to CSU support below 40 percent.
Die Presse (diepresse.com)
The conservative Vienna daily, in its article entitled "Who, with whom? The chairmen of the parties are reticent about the Coalition's confusing question," devotes the confused domestic political situation to the result of the Austrian elections.
The SPÖ wishes to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The ÖVP forbins the SPÖ's interference in its internal affairs.
The BZÖ appears open to all negotiations, the Greens do not want to negotiate a coalition yet.
The election is over, now it all revolves around the Coalition; in a debate held on public television, the party chairmen did not get a lot of insight into their cards.
SPÖ President Werner Faymann confirmed that he wishes to negotiate with the ÖVP.
And the SPÖ wants to show that cooperation between the two sides is certainly possible - in some Länder and in social partnership it exists.
The question of whether he could imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current chairman of the ÖVP, as vice-chancellor, was left open to Faymann.
As he put it, the Schüssel-Molterer course was outvoted at any rate.
Repeating this is out of the question.
Molterer responded to the red offerings with caution.
As he said, cooperation will certainly not be successful if Faymann tries to meddle in the internal affairs of the ÖVP.
Whether his party chooses the opposition or joins the coalition is still completely open in the party, these issues need to be discussed decisively within the ÖVP.
The President of the BZÖ, Jörg Haider, appeared again open in all directions.
"To prevent the Red-Black Coalition, we are ready to take on government responsibility," said Haider.
Járóková: A vicious cycle of poverty and segregation must be breached
In Paris today, the European Summit of Equality hosted by France, the current presiding state of the European Union, began in Paris.
As one of the main speakers of the professional conversation in her message addressed to the plenary, Lívia Járóková, as one of the main speakers, has turned to segregation in education, as one of the most serious injustices affecting Romani children, as well as the most serious obstacle to their application.
He opened the summit - on behalf of the French Presidency - on behalf of the French Presidency - by the Minister of Finance and Social Affairs, and Vladimír Špidla, European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
For the year, they sat among the invited representatives of governments, European social partners, the most important European rights organisations and civil associations active in the field of equal opportunities.
According to the press office of the group of MEPs, Fidesz Járóková pointed out that, in addition to the discrimination that occurs in the recruitment of the workforce, the Roma are forced out of the European labour market mainly through their low education.
"The vast majority of young Roma do not have a secondary education and, as a result of poor quality of primary education, only a tiny proportion of them can achieve a higher level of education."
Járóková further stressed that education as a basic human right has a key role to play in the application of other human rights.
Investing in the early education of Roma children can mean strengthening the economy of the Member States of the European Union.
According to the MP, it is necessary to confirm the consciousness of these connections in the broadest circles - among both Roma and non-Romani children.
Indeed, the sooner a Romani student starts school, the better chances of becoming a productive member of the labor force market; they contribute to the national budget through income taxes and excise duties.
"Romans are the right to have their citizenship of the European Union need to ensure the right to a quality education and to guarantee the elimination of their poor quality and separate education," said Lívia Járóková.
According to the MEP, the European Union's cohesion, with an emphasis on the aim and the negotiations, is needed to immediately speed up the processes of the desegregation of schools, which is of paramount importance for this, the right observance of both existing and planned anti-discrimination regulations is of paramount importance.
"It is necessary to break the vicious circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment, it is necessary to give Romani children the possibilities given by the democratic space in order to participate as full-time citizens in the future of Europe," Járóková demanded.
For everyone, as a sign of the 'European Year of Equal Opportunities', is guaranteed the European Equality Summit's goal, held annually since last year's meeting in Berlin, to provide a separate forum to achieve the objectives of equality and the elimination of discrimination, set out at European and national level.
Fox in the chicken coop
Life and health insurance companies in America, based on people's drug purchase data, often dismiss the possibility of entering into an insurance contract with a candidate.
Data protection experts fear that the data market will become out of controllable.
'There is a data protection programme which binds the use of prescribing data for medication in any case to the permission of the person concerned.
It must be in the hands of someone independent, otherwise we entrust the kerník to the fox," the Washington Post quotes Richard Dick, the author of the prescribing program, as saying.
Insurance companies make premiums and amounts paid in the event of claims dependent on the health of the candidates, and if the risk is assessed as too large, the insurance will not even conclude with it.
Previously, they sent in question for medical examinations and concluded the contract only when they knew their results.
Ten years ago, Dick devised a much cheaper procedure: based on the identification number, the customer easily discovers from the pharmacy's medication the subject has been bought for the past year and a half, from which he deducts the program himself from the condition of the condition and what his health is.
For example, if he regularly buys large amounts of cholesterol-reduction drugs, this refers to the fact that he has a virtually uncontrollably high blood fat level, which immediately puts him in the higher-risk category.
There are several versions of the program in circulation, some determining the risk coefficient at the same time, so the insurance company has almost no work left to do in addition to the paperwork, although minor difficulties arise.
The drawbacks is that many medicines can be used for several purposes, some compounds are, for example, usable against migraine or hot flushes, but are also effective against depression.
These pose, from the point of view of commercial insurance companies, a major risk-enhancing factor, whereas the former is not a factor.
Special companies have been created for the purpose of requesting and processing the data and before they would have obtained the necessary information from the pharmacies, asking the patient's permission.
They are now being forced to do so by the authorities, even if they have not been punished for their negligence to date.
Some companies have recently also been processing the results of laboratory examinations that link to the data on the drugs used, which allows them to provide an even more accurate picture of the patients' health.
More and more companies have access to the data, at the same time as controlling their use will become more and more difficult.
There is a special health data protection law, but its effectiveness applies only to health service providers and insurance companies.
A bill that will give authorities the power to inspect businesses specialising in providing data is before Congress.
Richard Dick acknowledges that this is not enough: so he developed his program to be linked to the explicit consent of the person concerned.
Another thing is that the person's permission can hardly be denied, otherwise the insurance companies will not conclude a contract with him.
So the hens are, after all, somewhat dependent on the fox's goodwill.
CSU: Temporary pardon
The fate of the serving duo Huber-Beckstein will be decided at the end of October
Despite the shameful election debacle, the heads have not yet fallen, with the debate on personal issues being pushed to the top of the Bavarian CSU by the top.
Party leader Erwin Huber and the country's Prime Minister Günther Beckstein can still stay in their seats, the question is when this pardon will last.
The fate of the tandem, which suffered a disastrous 17 percent loss of votes, will be decided by the last weekend of October's extraordinary congress of the party.
In any case, the members of the highly criticized duo have been told that they will not be able to cling with all their strength in their posts.
They attempted to reassure the enraged members of the faction and base, who, due to the loss of an absolute majority, demanded a day after the "Houshra Tsunami" to draw personal consequences.
Five years ago - admittedly, under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber at the peak of her career - the Christian Social Union won 60.7 percent, now, a year after the coup against Stoiber, but the strength was only good enough for 43.4 percent.
The CSU was a "sammalon" in Bavaria, producing 18 percent of Germany's GDP for the past 46 years.
While the Conservatives in the southern federal state, which is of key importance for the Hungarian economy, continue to be in a high position, they will in any case be forced into a coalition in the future.
One of the first signs of reorganisation within the party is that a member of the narrow intelligence team to start probe negotiations on a possible coalition of the Munich government with the liberal FDP, respectively with the right-leaning Free Voters grouping, will also be the deputy chairman and federal agriculture minister, Horst Seehofer, who is considered a possible successor to Huber.
It is ironic that Gabriele Pauli was in the assembly on the Free Voter ticket, whose appearance against Stoiber was used by the Huber-Beckstein duo to carry out the coup, but then they made a mercilessly short process with an ambitious municipal politician.
CSU leaders are now focusing all their energy on how to stabilise Beckstein.
In the transition period, the active role will also go to Stoiber, who has so far spun the threads from the background, the former country's prime minister and former CSU president calling the bitterest day of his political career on 28 September.
On Monday, Huber made some snide remarks to the CDU, saying they would have deserved much more support from their sister party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted the defeat as a warning to the CDU and Angela Merkel.
After the September 2009 Bundestag elections, Merkel will not be able to become chancellor if the CSU, which played a major role in its national success in 2005, will not be on its feet by joint forces.
According to Merkel, who found it difficult to hide her disappointment because of the fiasco, the loss of CSU positions will not have a negative impact on the Berlin grand coalition.
Which, of course, is relative: treating the wounded CSU will not be easier, and the Social Democrats' crisis continues.
The SPD achieved its weakest result in Bavaria with 18.6 percent of the weakest result since 1946.
Lukashenko:opozice - 110:0
In Sunday's elections, not a single opposition member made it to the Belarusian parliament.
This can be explained, according to Russian observers, by the well-being and stability prevailing in the country led by Alexander Lukashenko, but according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), the lawlessness that occurred in the counting of votes.
The OSCE, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognize the election.
Although the 110-seat legislator of the 10m-year-old country has lacked the opposition for a decade, the opposition, affiliated with the name of the United Democratic Forces (ODS), seriously hoped before the election yesterday that Lukashenko, who had resumed his presidential mandate on the basis of a change in the constitution in the 2006 debatable run, for the fourth time, to "allow" his or her "allow" to appear in parliament.
The ODS also abandoned the previously considered boycott.
In the background to the opposition expectations, it was that Russia's increasingly economically dependent Belarus - which had taken credit to mitigate the impact of Russia's ever-greasing natural gas import and had also contributed to Beltransgaz, which owns pipelines passing through the country, to get into Russian hands - to improve relations with the European Union, to improve relations with the European Union, to which, because of the Belarusian political establishment, rated as the anti-democratic Lukashenko, and other high-ranking politicians do not receive an initial permit.
The relaxation previously pointed out that the OSCE emphasized positive shifts and not shortcomings in its assessment of the election campaign - such as banning the candidacy for a third of the opposition candidates.
Monday's flash report by the OSCE, however, already had reservations about the campaign, during which opposition candidates could not essentially appear in the press, especially the opposition's fact that the opposition cannot be present at the vote count.
At the same time, according to the opposition, improvements can be felt in the political system: political prisoners have been released, and Minsk is willing to engage in minor confrontations with Moscow, refusing to recognize the secession of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, even though Russia, with which Belarus forms a union-based state on paper, has considered these two territories to be independent for a month.
"We took two steps forward and one back, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has begun," Alexander Milinkevich told our paper.
According to the opposition candidate from the 2006 presidential election, it is desirable for it to remain so, even though it has "fledglance to be allowed into the insignificant parliament of a single member of the opposition."
Looking at the opposition's results, it does not plan protest actions, rather it seeks to deliver its message to voters about the need for economic reforms.
"We have a lot of problems with that, of course, we have to print the opposition papers in Russia, the distribution is put in the obstacles by the local authorities, but I can still see that the change is supported by more and more people, even among the older ones," Milinkevich said, pointing out that the Lukashenko regime, which sees the creation of social safety as its greatest success, does not consider the officially most supported layer of pensioners to be the correct or officially supported layer of pensioners.
"Due to the country's indebtedness and the rise in the trade deficit, it is only a matter of time before the social safety of the 'marking cemetery' silence collapses,' Milinkevich says.
Unlike the opposition politician, Russian observers viewed the election as democratic.
The head of the U.S. Community Independent States mission, Sergei Lebedev, told the Russian news agency Ria Novosti that "people do not believe the words, but the deeds," so the absence of the opposition is nothing more than evidence of the maturity of Belarusian voters.
Global Marseille menu
The European Union and India will double trade turnover
As the European Union and India are mutual leading trading partners, the subject was dominated by the agenda of the ninth-level summit meeting in addition to other, predominantly global challenges.
A Franco-Indic Summit will also be held today, with the main focus on atomic energy cooperation.
Indeed, the European Union recognises that India is an emerging democratic power that should be given a greater opportunity to speak to international affairs, but member countries have so far failed to find a common denominator to support New Delhi's permanent membership of the UN Security Council.
This question was not even further discussed at yesterday's already ninth summit, held in Marseille.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy, as the current president of the Union and the President of the European Commission, as the President of the European Commission, José Manuel Barroso and the High Representative for Foreign Policy, Javier Solano, welcomed Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, with whom they also agreed to double the turnover of trade within five years, or would rise to more than a hundred billion euros.
With the exchange of goods rising from 25 to 55 billion between 2000 and 2007, it is not an overly ambitious target.
As a sign of this, twenty-six bilateral agreements already in existence with India on civil aviation were aligned in a legal light, bringing the green light to air transport in the future.
By the end of 2009, India would like to sign a free trade agreement with the Union.
Sarkozy promised that the negotiations would be accelerated.
The aim is to balance the balance sheet, while the EU is India's first trading partner, with New Delhi ranked only ninth among the EU's partners.
The summit also paid attention to global affairs.
The situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan, or terrorism, respectively - both sides have condemned it in all its forms and called for a speedy call for a UN conference to be convened.
They also tended to close the round of business negotiations from Doha, although both have a large part in its failure so far.
The European Union has confirmed that it will insist on its energy and climate programme, that it would like to reduce emissions of pollutants by at least 20 percent by 2020.
India also agreed to this, as well as the fact that next year's climate conference would need to be struck down by a global agreement and the production of gases causing the greenhouse effect to reduce by 50 percent by 2050.
Both sides would also like to prevent food prices from rising and support the convening of an international conference to analyst the financial crisis.
India's prime minister will arrive today in the French capital, where he is preparing to do business in a bilateral meeting on the peaceful use of atomic energy.
Paris believes French firms will receive a mandate to build Indian nuclear reactors worth twenty billion euros.
According to agency reports, the agreement would be valid for 15 years.
In Frankfurt, more than three hundred Italian publishers
The large participation of Italian publishers at the Frankfurt International Book Fair.
More than three hundred Italian publishers will attend the 60th edition of Buchmesse, the most important international meeting for the exchange of rights.
The International Frankfurt Book Fair is expected to attend this edition by more than 7,000 exhibitors from one hundred and one different countries, who take over the 171,790-square-foot trade fair with more than four hundred and three thousand titles to be seen, with Turkey as a guest of honour.
Deputy Minister of Culture Francesco Maria Giro will represent the Italian government at the inauguration ceremony in the Italian pavilion: Italy will in fact attend institutionally with the Italian Centre (Punto Italia) - on 264 square metres of the exhibition area.
A meeting with the press in Room Struktur Buchmesse in Pavilion 5.0 will be the following: it will be an opportunity to introduce numbers, tendencies and perspectives in terms of the state of publishing in Italy.
According to the data, the importance of the books by foreign authors in relation to the overall Italian production is still diminishing, mainly due to the literature for children and adults.
Brunetta: "From now on, breakfast before work"
It is the first time in the history of the Chigi Palace that the revolving door of arrival and departure of the staff.
But from today, this new measure will start to work against shrewd people, against those who get a sticks and then go for coffee during working hours.
The novelty against the laureates was presented today by the Minister for Public Administration, Renato Brunetta, and the Secretary General of the Presidential Council, Mauro Masi.
"The squeezing door - says Brunette - is a tool for better work, higher performance, more full-time and more services" the minister specifies.
"Now a new period of responsibility and transparency will open.
This is about reformism," stresses Brunette.
We will complete the Chigi Palace to introduce it in all the buildings of the Board's Presidency.
For Masi, "the choice of revolving doors is also important from a symbolic point of view."
There were no objections from the employees, the secretary-general assures: "This was a joint approach with the staff and the cooperation of all."
In short, no more breakfast during working hours; no more coffee and a croissant.
The brunette smiles and says, "it's no better than a proper cappuccino at 7 a.m."
During a conference at the Higher Vocational School of Public Administration
in Rome, the minister will eventually announce that during the three months the absence of public employees for the illness has decreased by 50%, that is to say, 60,000 more people a year at work."
And it will add that it is necessary for the Italian public administration to become more efficient
"its pay-time dynamics – the minister explains – has doubled in the last 8-10 years, given the private sector and is far higher than the inflation percentage'.
Meanwhile, thousands of public servants have gathered to reject the Brunett Decrees in accordance with the Codacons-supported request.
"While the Public Administration Secretary will today present figures on the lower absences from work due to illness - the consumer protection association - the 'file lax' nation is growing steadily.
In Italy, we have thousands of productive and fair public service staff who have gathered to declare war on the illegitimate standards contained in the decree."
Tara will mainly protest against the exclusion of sickness pay supplements that depend on the activity; an extension of the time at which the patient can be checked for the time frame in which the inspection visits will be carried out and against the other standards included in the new ministerial provisions.
Industrial accidents, Napolitano: "Redes-out prevention"
Every day, 2,500 accidents at work happen in Italy, three people die, and twenty-seven remain permanently disabled.
Inail's values confirm that in 2007 we have about 1,200 deaths as a result of accidents at work.
These values testify to the seriousness of the phenomenon, which remains one of the main reasons for death and causes almost double the death of the deaths compared to the murders.
To re-exorcate the attention of the institutions, social and information means of information about this dramatic problem, Anmil is celebrating in all Italian regions today the 58th national victim of the victims of labour accidents set for the second Sunday in October.
"The worrying data widespread by Anmilem and the same tragic reports of these days confirm the important issue of job security," the President of the Republic of Giorgio Napolitano confirms in a report sent to President Anmil, the National Association for Crippled and Invalides for Work, Pietro Mercandelli.
The Head of State expresses his admiration for the constant joint efforts to make job security efforts, to protect the injured workers, to help the families of the victims and to complicity of public opinion."
"Naturally, an outraged 'encrath' has been raised, genuinely shared in the face of the tragedies that are causing a stir in the media and the participation of public opinion in their scope, but the day-to-day reality once again offers us dramatic cases, even repeated in its dynamics."
Napolitano does not hide the fact that "there is, without doubt, a problem of resources: it is crucial to invest in training and information.
Particularly important are the take on numerous initiatives in the field of education to give young people facing the world's work a clearer awareness.
It is necessary to draw attention to this phenomenon, not to give up on its worsasence social seriousness, to apply and to improve legislative standards.
The president of the chamber, Gianfranco, stressed to his part of the Chamber, "how the occurring of death is created by an absolutely critical social condition, how it offends the conscience of each of us and forces all institutions to make a convincing effort to end this state of emergency."
"As far as data from accidents at work, they seem to be showing some positive turnover, but this does not deny that the number of deaths resulting from a work-related injury is so alarming," President Anmil Pietro Mercandelli noted again.
"We would not want this "trash-trapping" to lead to less attention, because it is the moment the attention is stopped that tragedy erupts.
"We believe that there is still too little to stop the problem of injuries, and there are many activities that can have an impact on the problem.
It is essential, in our opinion - Mercandelli stressed - to increase controls and inspections, but also to intervene more strongly in the field of training for staff, from the school age."
"There is still a need for further efforts - he added - in terms of communication and public opinion participation.
But it is mainly necessary to make a greater sense of responsibility by employers to the phenomenon that represents an exceptional social phenomenon .".
Mercandelli eventually said it was a progressive degeneration of the level of the right to compensation projected for job victims and the "devastation of supportive care" that the system has been receiving in recent years."
"The goal, then, is to return the worker's insurance guarantee - he added - because the fate of those who harm must not depend on spontaneity or gifting from time to time by the legislator."
Mp3 players charged, expose hearing at risk
Listening to loud music for a long time and use portable music devices as Mp3 players can be caused by permanent hearing damage.
According to a European Commission notice published today, which, in an official report, extended in Brussels, cites the opinion of the Committee on the Science of the Health Risks, which has recently arisen and been identified (Csrseri) Eu.
"From this scientific opinion, we read the notes, it follows that 5-10% of those who listen to music using portable music for at least five years, more than an hour a day per week and keep the machine at high volume, risking a persistent loss of auditory abilities."
"It worries me that such a large number of young people who use often portable music machines and mobile phones at high acoustic levels can unwittingly damage their hearing in an irreparable way," admits Meglena Kuneva.
"The scientific findings - the leader goes on - implies a clear risk and a rapid response is needed.
The most important thing is that we need to encourage consumers and publish this information.
We must continue to re-examine existing control systems in the light of this scientific findings in order to make them entirely effective and to keep up with the new technology'.
Brussels has asked for the Independent Scientific Commit for the problem to be explored due to the high use of portable music machines and the growing number of young people exposed to the noise of this origin.
"Scientists - concluded by the Executive Officer of the Eu - confirm the need to worry, and now the European Commission will examine, together with the other members and parties, which have raised the problem, what measures could possibly be implemented and thus better protect children and young people from exposing to noise, the source of which is portable musical and similar devices.
There is already a European safety standard already in place that limits the noise level of portable music machines to 100 dB, but concerns about hearing impairment are increasing, which may be caused by an over-exposure to similar forms of noise.
It is possible to greatly reduce these damages by looking for solutions such as a reduction in the level and duration of the exposure.
In its beliefs, the Eu Scientific Committee states that users of portable music appliances, when using loud music (more than 89 decibels) for just five hours a week, exceed the currently applicable limits corresponding to maximum permitted workplace noise.
Those who listen to music in such conditions for a long time risk persistent hearing loss after five years.
This problem should be affected by 5-10% of users of such devices and their amount can be calculated between 2.5 and 10 million people in Eu.
Rome, Alemanno will let the Commission for the Future of the Capital
We will start today, close in March, have sums in June.
Such is the Campidoglium calendar to the "Cisses for the Future of the Capital of Rome" staff, which met this morning at its new headquarters outside the Caracalla Spa.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and another 49 members of the commission will draw up a guidebook for Rome.
When the doors are closed in March, Giunta and the municipal council will evaluate the analyses and projects so that they can present a strategic plan for Rome in June with the "official stamp" of Campidoglio and his councillor Gianni Alemann.
"The Commission is completely independent and all political, social and cultural ideas are included - it wants to emphasise Alemanno - It will have to secure proposals for the development of Rome, which will ultimately be used by the political arbitrators, which remain Giunta e the Municipal Council.
This is not about replacing the functions, but merely an attempt to have a place to process a major project for Rome.
Work will be completed in March and then dissolved, as this institution must have a precise time date.
In June – the mayor announces – we will present a strategic plan and use the work done by the Commission for the Future of the Capital of Rome'.
Anyone who accuses the Commission of futility, given that its opinion will not be binding, Alemanno will reply: "It is all about the work the commission will be able to do and the quality of their proposals.
If they are of good quality, as are the Commission's proposals to Attali, and I am sure of that in Rome, its contribution will be decisive.
Too often, politics is spraun on the daily problems and the urgencies that occur from time to time.
We, on the contrary, want to look longer and further, in a deeper perspective , to work seriously on the development of Rome and its future.
In addition, the mayor of Rome wants to point out that "this Commission is neither an unnecessary undertaking nor a bluff: it is absolutely free, the Roman citizens will not be the state or the euro and will serve to think and engage the best intelligence that the capital has."
For Alemann, basically, "a strategic sketch must be taken as a starting point, or a definitive or a stationic one, to allow our city an authentic rise at the level it badly needs and think with a unified spirit of itss."
The future, which, the mayor of Rome, clarifies "it will not be limited to the current municipal borders, but will look much further away" not only in the optics of the future metropolitan city and its legal status as a capital city, but also "includes the role that Rome can and must perform as the capital of Europe and the Mediterranean."
Obama? The first anti-American president. It's already known why
A well-known US president wrote that it was important for him to remain independent: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president."
The first was Jimmy Carter, who, with his decisions, decimated the US economy and maintained relations (as today as a private citizen) with the enemy of Islam."
Attacks against Obama are mounting just as the election date approaches.
A Miami lady wrote on the website: "This man is full of ambition.
But Obama has the audacity: he thinks he will get to the highest post of nation, which had two governors and five black senators!".
In fact, these attacks don't say much"; they're attacks unequivocally of racial origin, and they don't answer the voter's question: will he be a good president? And then we have the polls; everyone says that Obama will win and by a wide margin.
Even in this case, there are those who act by the heart and not by the brain.
One newspaper from the Mississippi, from the bowels of the southern United States, wrote a comment: at least once in the election stall, we know well who the American patriot will give their vote to.
One of the pages of the American mentality will be on the lion, which remained skytarial until the last moment.
Say what you want, we'll eventually take care of it ourselves, who to tick, whether to Obama or McCain."
There are people who swear: if Obama were to win, we would leave America.
These are things that have never been said before, it seems almost a certain success for a black candidate.
But for all these considerations for the Democrats, George Bush's main weapon.
They asked 1,500 people: what mistakes did Bush make during his mandate? Eighty-nine percent replied: Iraq.
America is changing.
In Vietnam, this nation lost fifty thousand soldiers and was sent home with kicks in the ass.
In Iraq, 4,500 soldiers lost their lives and the Americans were not forced to pack.
And yet, Iraq became a weakness for most of Bush.
Who will take the place of Georgie W will have to perform a huge task.
The economic collapse of the US was also felt by journalists: the paper is the IPse period. And many accuse the internet, the "killer" of the paper.
The PEW Research Center asked five hundred journalists about the state of their profession and the premise of the future.
Well, today, almost all journalists are pessimistic about their future.
However, the responders did not openly say that they had less to worry about credibility.
They don't feel isolated as they once did.
The problem for American journalists is money, the money.
For these journalists, the crisis of 2008 is a crisis-stricken economic model.
In addition, the cuts made in the newsroom, the room where the editors work to put together the newspapers, are a huge problem.
According to the journalists surveyed, this is a problem that needs to be resolved, if we do not want traditional journalism to be fundamentally changed in the way of the general public.
The American journalist is permeating clear but complex pessimism.
Six out of ten print journalists and the executive seniors believe that journalism is going the wrong way on the national scale.
In the local area, the executive group is at 65%.
Printed against the broadcast.
It is not difficult for journalists to see where the site is going.
Larger publishers are making their way to the internet, which many view as a "killer" of the press.
The "Economic Pressure" highlighted by journalists has increased by as much as 79%.
Five hundred journalists surveyed admitted to resorting to technology in the hope of "perpeting something good" for their journalism.
The biggest gap in American journalism is among those who run newsrooms – that is, the leaders – and the reporters who work for them.
56% of national leaders are confident that their reporters share their values, while the value at the local level is falling to 23%.
This has something to do with "work assurance" for someone.
Leaders who think they will lose their jobs within three years are 47% at the national level.
As for journalists, they're at 30%.
As for "certain work" involving staff (our editors, ndr) in America, it is still a daily occurrence.
Only 13% of journalists are working on a contract.
In a nation as huge as Usa, with three hundred million people and thousands of newspapers, magazines, radio, TV and the internet, employers often offer what they want, so it is a question to take or leave.
The executives almost always receive huge salaries, and the editor can earn as much as $10,000 a month outside of paying for pensions and insurance.
As regards holidays, the argument is complicated: a certain number of days after the first year, a certain number of days after the third year to reach 15 days after a certain number of years.
But American journalists, according to their own confession, often get sick during the course of one year.
It is merely a climate issue.
UNIPOL: THE COURT IN THE JUDGET, DANILO COPPOLA IN GROTTTERFERRATOR
The president of the Second Criminal Chamber of the Roman Court, Carmelo Rinaudo, decided to dismiss the filing of real estate entrepreneur Daniel Coppola, who asked to be transferred from his city, the Grottaferrats, to an apartment in Rome.
Coppola is under investigation for bankruptcy in connection with the sale of Unipol-Bnl.
During the trial, he received his release from house arrest last week, which was converted into a forced residency in Grottaferrata.
His attorneys, Michele Gentiloni e Gaetano Pecorella, have asked that a real estate entrepreneur be able to change his whereabouts from a rural town to the capital.
However, according to the court, this move (against to whom he expressed pm) would allow him to influence his company and access the evidence that accusing him of.
Elites in danger
This phenomenon was already apparent a few days ago, when the Chamber of Representatives voted against the rescue plan to provide the $700 billion presented by the White House: a significant portion of Americans were more interested in and interested in punishing Wall Street than in saving economics.
This is confirmed by yesterday's New York Times, which informs us that the current crisis will divide the Republican Party, increasingly divided between its old East Coast soul, gentler, responsive to federal institutions, and the business community, and its new soul, which is conservative, hostile to the "them" from Washington» and the world of finance, particularly in the states in the central and south.
A soul that arrogantly manifested itself in the vote I spoke of at the beginning.
But this particular thing is just an example of the changes, the major changes that the current economic earthquake is already showing: not only in the United States, but throughout the west and perhaps not only here.
Both in Usa and in Europe, this crisis seems to be operating as an accelerator of phenomena that have been incubate in incubation for a long time, which are being reinforcered in the new climate and finally come to light.
The first of these phenomena is the re-acupization, the extraordinary revival of the market, the dual category of the State-Morse in relation to a certain re-nationalisation of economics.
Indeed, the crisis is a crisis in the banking financial institutions, which of course have strong ties abroad, but in which, above all, budgets of people and families living in a single country are included to the greatest extent.
Which created a political problem for those who run it: that means answering the difficulties and protests of people and families, which are, among other things, voters.
In short, the crisis appears to be the world's economically, but politically almost exclusively national.
Political internationalities seem to be significantly out of the game or that it has little to add: the European Union, which is divided as always between different interests and different state strategies, has given the obvious proof and that is unable to opt for one common political line.
And so everyone is facing intervention by the government of each individual state, the rescue plans, the revival of the market, the new rules and, above all, the distribution of funds: the moment we get into distress, only states have economic resources, a multitude of financial resources, to be able to try to put everything in order.
And also the necessary means and the permissions to be able to use them: two sources of immense value, in certain circumstances that perhaps no market and no international organisation will ever be able to dispose of to a similar extent.
This new emphase, which the crisis places on the national element, is, in complete compliance with the increasing importance that attempts to attribute the latest economic advances to one factor closely linked to it: territorial jurisdiction.
Paradoxically, in fact, while we were convinced that we had entered the kingdom of vita, the increasingly sophisticated technology, the imaterial, while we were convinced that the global finances had already been destined to rule the world, we suddenly realized that our future, on the contrary, would have to deal with such poor, immeritous things like water, grain, naphtha.
All the things that would have been said to be can be transported from one place to the ground to another, but they are, in any case, connected, absolutely, to the bounded space, the territory.
So, whoever becomes their ruler certainly has a lot more cards up their sleeve than who isn't, and who's unlucky to live in a place without grain, without diesel or water.
I'm getting to the second novelty, which foresees a break.
Who speaks of territory, of the state, of the government, he inevitably talks about politics, that is, about leadership.
Taking into account the economic crisis, two convergent phenomena appear to be forming.
From one side, the realization that there is an objectively need for authoritarian leadership, a request for someone who could seize the situation.
On the other hand, a wave of discredits against existing leadership, especially economic ones, which have proved equally unsatisfactory and full of dark places.
And together, something even deeper and, in a sense, unsettling: discrediting, impatience, a sense of incompetence and absence that seeks to dominate the entire ruling class in more and more Western countries.
Indeed, it seems that it is increasingly expanding in the broad masses of the population of beliefs than their actions as the ideas of the hitherto popular elite, as their way of feeling and being, as their culture in the truest sense of the word, that the elite have surpassed their time and are indifferent to the views of the majority.
In short, the demand for leadership nourishes one branch from the underground, but the strong movement to the removal of the ruling classes and the traditional political order is reflected in the sudden election"offs», or in the unexpected changes in collective moods in recent and most recent times, from the conservative rise in Austria-Bavorsk to the fall of Labour in the UK, to the rebellion of US congressmen against Bush (and perhaps the victory of the right in Italy has to do with it).
We have the impression that the traditional elites, their parties, their programs, but also their ceremonies, their newspapers, their accredited intelligence, some would say their format, they have increasing problems to understand, that is, to represent, which, not from today, is being created in the deep strata of Western societies, and that the economic crisis is strengthening again, growing, potentially waning too much.
Before this, it would be exaggerated to talk about a permanent "mask revolt».
But we certainly can't say it means keeping your eyes open.
Super glue to walk on the walls
Overcraper the laws of gravity through super glue and in the future walks on the walls like Spiderman.
This is the object of various American research centers, and now a team of four institutes has come very close to it.
Scientists managed to keep the 100-kilogram body glued to the vertical wall with a sticker of just 2.5 square centimetres.
STUDIUM – The American journal Science has published the discoveries of some researchers at the University of Dayton, the Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by a team of researchers is the development of materials already existing, using a special carbon structure called carbon-like carbon pipes.
«The base of glue can be imagined as a series of pipes laid out as a arranged pile of spaghetti» explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Institute of Georgia of the Atlanta Institute of Technology.
Scientists were inspired by the legs of the geeon, covered with microscopic hairs that allow the animal to be perfectly attached.
Tests conducted on various materials, such as glass, Teflon and glass paper, have shown that the new glue is ten times more powerful than the legs of these reptiles and at the same time"se simply peels off the wall» explains Liming Dai, a researcher at the University of Engineering at the University of Engineering.
CHODIT FINDED BILK? -"This material could be useful as a makeshift glue» is supplied by Liming Dai.
Walking the walls like Spiderman, perhaps, is it, but researchers are thinking of a far less fascinating use as a combination of electrical appliances, because the dwarf carbon pipes are heat and power conductors.
Other applications could be about aerospace engineering.
For now, no super heroes.
OTHER RESEARCH – Also, the University of Berkley, California, is researching new glue.
In an article in the American Chemical Society, California scientists presented glue formed from micro-fibre as hair that is self-cleaning from dust to the surface to still maintain perfect fitting.
Medication: Never with juices
Watch out for grapefruit, orange and apple juice.
If you take these drinks, which are consumed primarily in summer, because they are refreshing and full of vitamins, together with some of the life-saving medicines, their consumption is altered or reduced in effectiveness with serious health consequences.
To highlight the risks of the juice of both the finished and fresh juices in the ajings in London, combined with the use of some medicines, to be triggered by the American Chemical Society's current 263rd National Meeting in Philadelphia: one glass of grape, orange and apple juice, just a need to reduce the absorption of some life-saving drugs, to nullify their beneficial effects, and put patients at risk to the health of patients.
Grape juice has already been accused of being responsible for increasing to the toxic level the effects of some anti-aritemic drugs, antibiotics, an anxiolite, antihistamine and neurological drugs.
MEDICES IN RISKY– This was announced by the Italian Medical Agency itself in the newsletter two years ago, and galvanized doctors and patients not to underestimate the dangers of this mixture and to look out for what they drink when they take medication, such as Diazepam or Methadon.
NOT ON THE GRAPEFRUIT – According to experts, orange and apple juice also contain substances that are dampened by the drugs.
A long list of effects subdued by grapefruit and other juices.
From there, the call of Michele Carruba, director of the Pharmacology Department of the State University of Milan: "Such discoveries are usually immediately announced to the various international and national pharmacy agencies, which eventually arrange and exchange information instructions of drugs.
So read always the illustrative leaves of the drugs you get and if you come across something unclear, don't be unsettling, but ask your doctor or pharmacist to clear up» stressed the Ansa expert.
The Nobel for Economics to Paul Krugman
The Nobel Prize was awarded to American Paul Krugman for his studies in commercial models and localization of economic activities.
Krugman is a 55-year-old Newborn, who teaches at the University of Priceton and who is a well-known editor of the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the most important critics in the Bush administration's foreign, economic and political actions.
A few months after the assassinations in September 2001, the days on Enron's failure, Krugman predicted in a commentary published in the New York Times that the second event would be, in terms of implications for the history of the United States, far more important than the first.
A prediction that sparked more than a few polemics and that had been reproached for years, but which proved to be accurate.
«I am surprised and shocked at the speed with which collapses such as Enron and Worldcom disappeared from the public interest, Krugman said at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi of the Executive Committee of the Central European Bank, Krugman is an "economist of great importance», but also a populariser who has" a very aggressive style, particularly critical of the Bush liberalist administration's excesses».
Open Office, we have the third edition of the package "anti-Microsoft»
It's the release day of Open Office.org 3.0, an open source personal-produced package that is moving toward more and more users, from home to office, from experts to public administration, as a free alternative to the better-known Microsoft Office.
After about a year of work by volunteer workers, controlled by SUN Microsystem, the new Open Office is shown to the general public with various new releases: the welcome screen and the revised and improved opening window will be added to the revised and improved opening window, far more essential, as a compatible as the operational Apple Mac OS X and the support for the new ODF (Open Document Format) format, 1.2, the last standard version of the ISO version.
The emphasis is also on the cooperation with the Office 2007 package, Open Office is able to open the document with the new Microsoft suffix (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
Interesting are the special features of some models, such as what allows you to reduce the dimensions of the PowerPoint presentation, useful for example for electronic transmission, or the ability to transfer the PDF folder to the graphics model and maintain the original look of the page.
Still from this point of view, we can create "PDF hybrids" documents that resemble the typical Adobe graphic and have the characteristics of a spreadsheet or a text program.
Cooperation is an element that has received many improvements within the application programs: in excelllu, it is possible to work together between different users and avoid conflicts on changes, in the text program each collaborator is assigned one color to commentary to make the identification clearer in the revision phase.
Some firms are also working to redeem some of the Open Office features on the Web (on the cloud), and should reenign the final result in the coming weeks.
The Italian version can be downloaded at http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html, added to the English version, which is located on the mirroro from Friday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, as usual, the package is also available for the Linux operating system.
Also, the installation cd can be sent to home or to the workplace on request.
And if the theme of free of charge can be a draw to expand in homes, it is the Open Office business area that bets a lot, and can already count on the various projects carried out in public administration and in schools.
And there are also training offers, consultancy and assistance services ideal for small and medium-sized companies, which could open up business prospects.
Open Office consists of five main models: Writer, for video writing replacing Word; Calc is a spreadsheet that goes to replace Excel; Impress for Powerpoint-like presentations; Dbase, as in the case of the more famous Access, is a program that allows you to work on databases; Draw, finally, is a graphical model.
The goal for 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads, and considering that as of today we are almost at 3 million and 600 thousand, with the release of a new version, it is possible that this projected number can even be surpassed.
Kohl's results are also positive, this is the fourth case of doping
A new positive case in the last Tour de France: it is Austrian Bernhard Kohl, from the Gerolsteiner team, the third-ranked and winner of the best top-fighter's shirt.
The report was quoted as saying by the L'Equipe website.
26-year-old Kohl is the fourth driver positive for Cero, the Epo of the third generation, after the Italech Riccardo Riccò and Leonardo Piepoli and the German Stefan Schumacher, and he from Gerolsteiner.
The results of Kohl's blood samples fall into those made in recent weeks by the laboratories of Losanna and Chatenay-Malabry.
If the control analyses confirm the positivity at Cero, the Austrian will lose third place in the Tour and will have to face a set two years of disqualification.
The report on the positivity of Kohl's third-generation Epo is confirmed by the head of the French anti-doping agency, Pierre Bordry, who announced to the Associated Press that he had already informed the outcome of the Austrian government authorities.
The 26-year-old Austrian placed on the podium behind Spaniard Carlos Sastre and American Cadel Evansema, and also won the dot-themed T-shirt of the best top scorer.
IMIGRANTI:NEW YORK TIMES WITH THAT, ITALY RASIST?
Italy "as a country of emigrants, it has only been transformed into the priority of immigrants in the last house" accepted with resistance.
He transforms this to a beautiful country into a nation of racists? That's how he fumbles in a long New York Times article, which devoted to this article to the debate on the subject of racism in Italy, and began with the case of young Abdul William Guibre, originally from Burkina Faso, killed in Milan last month, because he stole a box of biscuits.
This case is made visible by what the New York Times defines the "paradox of the North": the northern regions are at the same time the ones where "more integration and more work" are registered, but also "the country's most powerful anti-immigrant mindset and the strongest support for the Northern League."
To confirm the increasing tensions between Italians and immigrants, the NYT cites instances of intolerance from Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampina and Castel Volturna.
Not only that.
The new legislation required by Lega, which seeks to hinder immigration and facilitates the expulsion of illegal immigrants, is also cited as an example of a changing climate in Italy.
Tendency highlighted by both the Pope and the President of the Republic: "Giorgio Napolitano, having met with Benedetz XVI in the Quirinale, asked that the state and the church work together to defeat racism."
Found plane of Steve Fossetta, a millionaire who disappeared a year ago
The rest of the plane was found by Steve Fossett, a millionaire who disappeared on September 3, 2007, while flying over the desert in Nevada.
The wreckage was discovered on one plateaic sea level at an altitude of three thousand meters, in the Mammoth Lakes area of Sieř Nevada, on the border between California and Nevada.
However, there were no human remains inside the aircraft.
The Sheriff of County, John Anderson, dispersed the doubts that remained: "The plane was found, we sent a team there, and now we are sure that this is exactly the one Steve Fossett flew the day he disappeared" he said at a press conference.
The sheriff therefore clarified that the remains were not found either on the plane or in the surrounding area.
The 63-year-old millionaire has been considered dead since February.
The U.S. Transportation Safety Agency (Ntsb) reported that hours after the wreckage was recognized, a investigative team was dispatched to eventually identify the plane: it is exactly the Bellanc 8kcab, missing since September 3, 2007, when Fossett took off from Yerington, Nevada, for a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, still in California, not far from the Nevada border, some of Fossetta's personal items were found by one pair of one pair near their dwelling in Mammoth Lakes.
These are two documents with Fossetta's name, both released by the Illinois Federal Air Administration, cash and one jacket.
Fossetta's search was discontinued a month after his disappearance.
The billionaire won a place in history thanks to a long collection of firsts.
In 2002, on the sixth attempt, he became the first man to complete a trip around the world in an air balloon: a two-week flight alone.
Three years later, he circled the world on the plane and without landing.
His many records also include a flight at an altitude of 15,445 metres, above the Andes, albeit with a copilot.
Glk, an ad you don't expect
One unusual Suv with an original design and well defined decisive lines, wide surfaces with precise corners.
This, in a nutshell, is the last Glk born of the "compact" jeep of the star's house, by which Mercedes-Benz tried to bring a whirl of news to this sector.
It is thanks to its unconventional treatment that the unconventional and unconventional communication will accompany the launch of Suv Glk, which will be available in the Mercedes-Benz showrooms from next October 17.
In this way, the advertising campaign, which will accompany the new vehicle's debut, will also launch an unofficial method of communication thanks to the futuristic poster campaign in 3D, which is used for the first time in Italy for the car brand.
The maxi posters project, divided into three different phases, will be dominated by Milan's main business avenue, Corso Como, until 15 November.
The first phase of this new type of communication will begin with the introduction of a car in stereoscopic vision and using special glasses to be distributed near the Corsa Como, the new Suv in almost real size and in three-dimensional format.
Indeed, if you look at the picture, you'll be under the impression that the car will come out of the poster.
Then, using the innovative Elumina8 technology, the new Glk will be enlightened at different moments in all its minutiae, to be re-flag in a single image.
Mercedes is undoubtedly trying to introduce something new into the stereotypical field of automotive communication with this ad.
Will he succeed in attracted the interest of future customers in this way?
So we know who the Italian hooligans are
Triveneto, risking Daspo.
Who are the 150-200 boys and girls that Italy is now ashamed of? They are part of the group "Ultras Italia" which has been following Nazionale azzurra for years and which has so far, in fact, never caused excessive problems.
Nor has she ever met her opponent's fans.
The orientation of the group is right-wing.
The founders are from Triveneto.
From Verona, Padua, Trieste e Udine.
In Sofia, they were joined by groups (in fact few groups) from Campania and Puglie.
They have three-color flags that feature the descent cities of the people involved: they were removed on Saturday night to avoid being recognized.
They are inspired by English fans.
In Bulgaria, they found genuine Nazi fans, Levsky.
Figc made 144 match tickets available to Italian fans: all in the name, that is, easily controllable.
And Viminale actually checked them all: there was no one among those who went to Sofia with the ongoing Dasle, no one who would be forbidden from attending stadiums.
Four blue fans who had earlier offences from the stadium were denied a ticket and a game banned.
Now Viminale is waiting to read the reports that come from the Bulgarian police, then take the precautions: In this case, it is possible to give Daspo for five years to at least fans who were arrested or identified during the riots.
The international Daspo, which forbids to attend not only Italian stadiums but also throughout Europe.
Our hooligans, in short, will not set foot on a single stadium.
To luck.
But now there is a fear of emulation: that means that more than a hundred and fifty will be joined by others.
"We must immediately extinguish this fire and not justify those who behave in this way," they confirm from Viminal.
So, "gently open eyes, mainly for the national match on Wednesday in Left."
It is in Puglia that there is a small core of supporters.
Tomorrow the Osservatorio will meet, on Tuesday Casms, which can also count on one part of Aise, it is the Secret Service, which takes care of the problems in the stadiums.
"The chororates-The Leader-Histor and the taut arm during the Mamel anthem?
Such is the idea of Domenico Mazzilli (expressed in a really little happy way), who is the director of Viminál's Osservatorio for a few weeks (he got a job that was formerly Francesco Tagliente and then Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli was formerly a Quaestor in Trieste, where the core of the Ultras Italia backers, founded in 2002.
It is true, as Mazzilli says, that in Bulgaria it is not a crime to glorify the leader, but of course that the behaviour of these 150-200 fans is an embarrassment.
"I am not a sociologist - the Osservator number one adds - the crimes are attributed to the country in which they happened.
So far this group has remained within the limits, now let's take a good look at what happened and assess for the future.
However, let's also talk about whistling at the Mamel's anthem: it's not a crime either, but if you don't mind, it's an inrag...'.
Students victims of expensive rents - up to 900 euros per room
The leashing market for university students is not a crisis.
According to the latest research by Sunia, the tenants' unions, a single room can be rented by a student in Milan up to 900 euros, in Florence 700, in Naples 650, in Rome 600.
"Jev has already reached such proportions that entire classes of students have lost the right to study because of the overall high prices that their families would have to endure - explains the head of the office for the studies of Sunia, Laura Mariani - in this city the high demand from the students distorted the market in such a way that it spaped the process of price increases that also swarmed on the residents."
In most cases, rents contain several offences: contracts in a free way, not registered, without a limited rent, associated lessing.
For Sunis, there is an exceptional intervention that could regulate prices thanks to the revision of taxes.
If we look at the research details, we will see that in Milan, in the Brianza area, about 450 euros is needed per bed, a single room is paid from the minimum price of 650 (Bape Nerez zone) to the mean value of 800 (zone Lambiate, Udine and Fiera) to the maximum of 900 (in the Vittoria zone).
In Florence, one bed costs an average of 350/400 euro, one room for about 700.
In Bologna, where students concentrate in zones close to the university, it takes 250/280 euros per bed in a double room, from 370 to 500 in the single room.
In Rome in the central university zones (San Lorenzo, piazza Bologna) they want about 600 euros per single room, 450 bed in a double.
The values are a little lower (550 euros for single) in zones close to other universities (Ostiense and Cinecittà).
We will only save money if we move to the peripheral areas: 300 euros for a bed and 450 for the single room of the Prenestina, Centocelle and the like.
In Naples, there are 300/450 euros for a bed, from 400 to 600 euros per room, with the highest prices in the Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei zones.
In Bari they want a bed of 250/350 euros, at least 350 for a single room.
In smaller cities, prices are definitely lower, but they have more impact on the citizen's economy.
In cities like Perugia, where rents for non-European Union students are the most common phenomenon, one more anomaly is finally recorded: an increase of about 25-30% of the fee they want from foreign students, compared to Italian students.
Farewell to old Paradiso cinstre, cities cancel historic halls
Cinematographic historical halls close in favour of Multiplex.
"The city without cinema is like blind, it's like a face without eyes."
The painting, offered by director Giuseppe Tornator, successfully documents what is happening in Italy's major city centres, as well as rural towns.
The process of curbing cinemas, the birth of the great multisoisals in the suburbs, and the subsequent demise of monosals in the central quarters of cities, is one of the events that seem inevitable and irreversible, but it also has all the hallmarks of true cultural crime.
Often the historical places are disappearing charged with memories," it's as if we've lost a friend, a friend with whom we shared a part of the road and a lot of emotion», is felt by the director of the New Cinema, the film that won the Tornado Oscar and the grand award of the jury in Cannes 20 years ago, and who told the poetry of a village cinema and sadness because of the way of life that the cinema must have lost forever.
The values obtained by the Anec, the main association of operators, speak volumes: in the last five years, the door of 316 cinemas of the traditional tip has closed the door, and the highest account was paid for primarily by the halls in the most important cities: 10 fewer in Florence, by 9 in Milan, Naples, by 6 less in Torín, by 5 in Palermo.
Among the regions most affected by the closures, Emilia-Romagna is in first place, with the loss of 82 cinemas, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
And the evidence that the first responsible for their disappearance is the advent of the multiplex is the one that the three Italian regions that have registered the highest number of new cinema multiswalls: 195 more counties in Lombardy in the last five years, by 81 in both Tuscany and Emilia-Romagne.
«The Italian procedure has evolved unatroenically» claims Paolo Protti, President Anecu,"it is useful to create new structures, but it would be necessary to guarantee that the already existing ones will survive, because when one cinema in the city closes, not all of its visitors are willing to relocate to the multiplex.
Then let's not talk about the lack of fund subsidy to the operators: the previous national debt is about 10 million euros.
In moral and ethical terms, it is a shame that the government does not respect existing laws.
Support for the sector would require between 16 and 18 million euros per year».
What is interesting is the Bologn case, the first Italian city to worry about closures and which has decided to find a way out by signing a protoclu between the village and the Anec, the first of this type in Italy to protect and promote small cinemas both in historical centres and in the suburbs.
Among the proposed standards are the steps of tax relief in favour of the operators and the benefits for the audience in terms of mobility: viewers will be able to enter the zone with limited traffic and have special prices to stop and in some parking lots.
«This initiative I like» is called by Giuseppe Tornatore"and I hope that other cities will follow the example of Bologna by introducing other measures».
However, it is certain that in order to oppose the great power of the multiplex, the traditional halls need to improve the quality of sound and image, because today's audience is more demanding.
The defence of the traditional cinema is a theme that was important for ever: the closure of the Super Cinema in Bagheria, instead of my childhood and adolescence, was the spark that persuaded me to establish the "New Cinema Paradiso" that I had been thinking about for 10 years.
I have lived in Rome for 25 years, and when I walk through before the already closed Rialto or Quirinil in Nazionale Street, where I shared so much emotion, so that I would not have to look at the inscriptions of blackened dust, I will turn to the other side».
Joining between politics and the mafia group 'transkate, Mayor of Gioie Tauro in prison
"The mayor of Gioie Tauro was willing to adjust the city's office's elections according to the interests of the mafia group Piromalli."
The accusations that the Flasma Directorate against the Calabria Mafia are piling against the mayor and vice-haem, Gioi Tauro Giorgi, Dal Torrione e Rosario Schiavone, and the mayor of Rosarne, imprisoned this morning for external cooperation with the Mafia organization, are tough.
Also in the irons, Gioacchino Piromalli, an old middleman between the clan and the public administration, and his grandson's lawyer, the namesake of the boss, already accused of committing crimes of a mafia character, sentenced to pay 10 million euros.
"Ignorated all the legal and moral standards as well as common sense," the prosecutors write as two local governments expressed their willingness to pay the consultations to the lawyer, Piromalli.
"So they would have allowed the mafia group - the judges write - to officially enter the city's authorities and facilitate the already enormous possibilities of public administration control and management."
The president of the Calabrian regional commission, Agazio Loiero, does not hide the fact that "secret agreements between local institutions and the organised criminal underworld are a lot in his county: "There are areas in which the concentration of the mafia is stronger than in others, where collusion is inevitable.
But we also have many local politicians resisting the cope with the 'ndrangheta, the heroes who are still unstiliety'.
This morning's imprisonment is followed by the imprisonment of July last year, by which police have shown that the mafia group Piromalli has been hit by the final hit.
Since the end of April last year - the city council of Gioii Tauro has been disbanded since 1991, the reason for the then-intuplied link between organised crime and the local administration - local politicians were stripped of office in the municipal administration.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, the leader of the Christian Democrats, who, at the moment of dissolution, was elected head of the right-of-center coalition after the closer election in May.
He shouted about the scandal when Prefecttur ordered the dissolution of the municipal council.
He called to accountable then-Mr. Interior Minister Marco Minniti and accused him of ploting everything for political reasons, but the judges' ordinance on imprisonment signed this morning explains that the mafia group even went so far as to ask for a change to the A3 motorway project.
Other interrogations ordered against Dal Torrion, the public prosecutors write, came to light "willingness to move the businessman's claims, the representatives of a larger group very close to him, as is commonly known, to Piromalli and to adapt the public administration's choices to the interests of the mafia group.".
When the energy is born of the waves, the big ones come into play.
It is an endless deposit that covers more than 70% of the Earth's surface and is now beginning to be discovered by the world's great energy companies.
Waves, currents, tide, new sources of inexhaustible energy are on which the eyes of colossus such as Chevron, which is now trying to reach out to these sources, are now trying to reach out to their hands.
The possibility of creating energy from sea movements has been studied for more than a century, and in the 1970s, in connection with the first oil crisis, research intensified.
When the price of oil fell around 1980, the idea of using marine energy went away, but now the environmental organisation and the new oil price increase have given the sector a new impetus.
The World Energy Council (WEC) said in London in 2007 that around 15 percent of the world's electricity consumption could be covered by the use of sea waves.
this amount would be double the energy currently produced in the nuclear centres.
In addition, there are currents and tide and tide.
The Giant Attacks.
the company that bet on marine energy was Enersis, which agreed in 2005 to build a facility in northern Portugal.
When this intention was announced, it seemed like a huge revolutionary move.
After two years of betting on marine energy, it is increasingly a society that is betting on marine energy rather than traditional energy.
"The arcron is studying ocean energy technology, a spokesman for a company that is linked to the United States oil colossus, the Wall Street Journal, commented on the opportunity to work with us.
The cooperation we are considering concerns obtaining a permit from the U.S. Energy Commission, which is required to launch a project to use marine energy in Alaska.
We cannot underestimate this signal, especially considering that it is in Alaska that the US continues to extra mine for oil, and President Bush recently came up with a plan for a new drilling.
In addition to Chevron, Verdant Power Inc. from New York and Ocean Power of New Jersey and the sums invested so far, although not known in detail, show growing interest, observers say.
Technology, kerou needs to be developed.
Experts talk about the technology that is still in its early beginnings because it is not known what impact the environmental impact of the use of marine energy will have.
For now, facilities in Portugal and some in Scotland are small dimensions and do not seem to be causing major problems for the ecosystem.
But for greater energy production, it is necessary to use technologies with a greater impact on the forward.
The methods are different: Ocean Power, for example, uses the system's fears that are linked to each other.
The strength of the waves, which moves up and down with the buo, is changed using the cylinders and cylinders to the hydraulic pressure inside these buores.
Pressure spends the turbine, which supplies power to the generator.
The energy gets ashore by underwater cables.
For now, four of these types are in the project phase, waiting only for federal approval, and some of the energy could be used for military purposes.
In contrast, Verdant Power already generates power for the shopping mall and car park by using six pdmarine turbines in New York's East River.
The movement of the water during the tide and the inmour is caused by the rotation of the turbines, which feed the generator in this revolving movement.
Verdant commented that they had a long list of clients waiting for the necessary authorization because of the possibility of using this energy.
After the waves, after the tide and after the outflow.
Particular interest at this point in time deserves the potential of tidal and low tide, the Institute for Electricity Research says.
Although this is a disjointed factor, the tide and the tide are more predictable than wind, sun or waves, and therefore more reliable as an energy source.
It was in the energy of the tides and outflows that states such as New York, Maine, and Alaska, and other coastal states, had already invested $7 and a half-million-on-year in 2008 and forecasted investments of up to $35 million for 2009.
