Parliament did not support the amendment liberating Tymoshenko
The Ukrainian Parliament today rejected a proposal to repeal a section under the criminal code amendment that condemned opposition leader Yuliya Tymoshenko.
The amendment, which would have opened the way for the release of the imprisoned ex-prime minister, was rejected by MPs at second reading of a proposal to commute sentences for economic offences.
Tymoshenko was sentenced in October to seven years in prison for entering into an allegedly unfavorable contract with Russia to buy natural gas.
The sentence is not final, the appeal of the convicted person is due to be heard by the court in December.
Tymoshenko calls the ruling a political vendetta against the regime, and suspicions of court bias have also triggered trial in the West.
The proposal to drop Section 365 of the Criminal Code, on the basis of which the ex-prime minister was convicted, was supported by 147 Members in the vote.
It needed 226 votes to pass.
Libya's Victory
The story of libyan liberation, or Libyan rebelia, already has its losers.
Muammar Gaddafi is buried in an unknown place in the desert, and without him, the war is over.
It remains to define the winner.
As is customary in the region, Islamists will win elections, but it is whether moderate or radical.
The Transitional National Council has signed up to Sharia law and we already have some idea of it.
Libya will become a crime-free country, with a hand-cut for theft.
Women can forget about emancipation, potential apostasies from the faith will be executed and so on.
Instead of being a dictator, a society consisting of rival tribes will unite the Koran.
There will be order in Libya that we cannot imagine and that we certainly would not want.
But our way of life is neither the best nor objectively the best, and it would probably not be suitable for the Libyans mentioned above for a change.
In fact, it's surprising that Islamic fighters have taken help from infidel dogs.
The only excuse for them is that, from their point of view, it was not a general from America who was driving NATO airstrikes, but Allah, whose size they celebrated with every good intervention.
So when winners are sought in Libya, the West is not one of them.
We took part in a firefight, served Islam, and our politicians got rid of a political ally in the person of a dictator without guaranteeing any profit.
After fresh bad experiences in Afghanistan and Iraq, we are not militarily occupying Libya.
This leaves locals with no problem with the exoneration of the "crusaders".
But without the occupation of the oil company, will they have Libyan black gold as their mouth?
They may not be, and the West will finally be able to boast of selfless protection of human rights.
Unless those Sharia law-abiding ones stop us.
A new era of crisis is beginning.
France and the rest of Europe have come into the crosshairs of investors
A statistical whirlwind swept across Europe on Tuesday.
Individual countries published GDP figures for 3Q.
The Czech economy stagnated interquartally, Germany and France are growing.
But the bond market is now breaking records.
Investors are no longer just looking at Italy, but also Spain, France, Austria and others.
The statistical authorities of the euro area, Germany, the Czech Republic and some other European countries published preliminary estimates of the development of the economy for the third quarter.
Germany's GDP grew by an expected 0.5%, France by 0.4%.
At the same time, both countries adjusted data for the second quarter, in which Germany was doing better than expected (growth of 0.3% instead of the original 0.1%), but France said it was in a slight decline of 0.1% (initial data showed stagnation).
The Czech economy grew by 1.5 percent year-on-year in the third quarter of this year.
Quarter-on-quarter, however, gross domestic product (GDP) stagnated, confirming the trend of gradually slowing economic performance growth, according to the CZSO.
The results are worse than analysts' estimates.
Highlights:
The Czech economy grew by 1.5 percent year-on-year in the third quarter of this year, but stagnated quarter-on-quarter.
The German economy grew by 0.5 percent in the third quarter, according to preliminary and seasonally recalculated data.
The economies of both the euro area and the European Union grew by 0.2 percent between July and September compared to the previous quarter, in line with analysts' expectations.
The Greek economy sauched by 5.2 percent year-on-year.
The yield on its 10-year bond is at 28.45%.
Italian and Spanish bond yields are rising to critical limits.
Austria, the Netherlands, France, Belgium, etc. are also starting to feel the problems...
Yields on Czech 10-year bonds are below 4%, even as the situation in the region deteriorates.
There are voices from Germany that the ECB should be a lender of last resort.
The Czechs qualified for the EURO.
They won 1-0 in Montenegro and celebrate a $200 million promotion
The national football team has accomplished the toughest challenge of the season!
In Montenegro, thanks to the great Czech and the beautiful goal of Petr Jiráček, she won 1–0.
Czech football, with a great deal of luck in the second half, defended a luxurious lead from the home rematch and will not miss the European Championship again.
IHNED.cz watched the match in detail.
Almost no excitement in the first half and a great deal of luck in the second.
Thanks to a home defeat in the end, the great Czech and hero Jiráček won 1–0 in Montenegro and celebrates their progression to the European Championships.
The Montenegrin team came under pressure in the second half due to the precise defence of the Czech team.
The underdogs of the match were Damjanovich and Vučinič, who burned two great chances.
Thanks to the great Petr Čech, the Czech national team will not be missing the European Championship next year, and a reward of approximately CZK 200 million will be added to the box office of domestic football.
There was a lot of fighting football from the opening minutes.
Both teams had a hard time getting involved in the combination, and it was mostly played around the halfway line.
The pressure of the home players did not come in the first half, because the Czech defence precisely averted long kicks for defence.
Iranian students are prepared to die for their country's nuclear program.
They created a living shield
Several hundred college students have created a living shield around a nuclear facility in Iran.
In their gesture, they want to express their support for their country's nuclear program before a possible Israeli attack.
Students prayed in front of the property at noon on Tuesday and then called for the deaths of the US and Israel.
Several hundred students at universities in Isfaan, Iran, on Tuesday created a living shield around the Isfaan Nuclear Technology Center, where uranium is processed.
They are thus signaling that they are ready to defend their country's nuclear program with their own lives.
In a recent report, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) noted that Iran does not appear to have stopped pursuing a nuclear weapon.
A possible attack on Iran's nuclear facilities is under talk in Israel.
Students prayed at noon before entering the Isfaan nuclear facility and then called for death to America and Israel.
In the event of an attack aimed at crippling Iran's nuclear program as much as possible, the Natanz facility, where uranium is enriched, would be targeted in addition to the Isfah Center, according to the Israeli press.
Obese child's diet: not eating breakfast and dinner sausages
More than a third of children aged 9 to 13 have overweight problems, with 9 percent of schoolchildren overweight and 5 percent of children obese.
Meanwhile, obese children mostly come from families with unhealthy lifestyles, as the latest survey showed.
It shows once again how important the environment in which they grow up and the patterns in which they are surrounded are important for a person's healthy development.
For example, sausages appear on tables in obese children up to half as often as in families of normal-weight children.
More than 19 percent of obese people had fried fries for dinner the day before research related to an awareness event called Obesity.
It is also not customary for fat families to play sports, but this applies to most families of today's schoolchildren - only 15 percent of children said that their parents would find time to move actively at least once a week.
Survey of 900 children
The survey was carried out at the end of last school year and was attended by almost 900 children from primary schools from all over the Czech Republic.
It was the second year of obesity is not a coincidence, supported by the General Health Insurance Company and Unilever.
So far, more than 12,000 schoolchildren from 4th to 8th grades have participated in the project.
Proper eating and enough exercise in the family is one of the determining factors causing a dramatically increasing number of overweight or even obese children.
"For example, only half of respondents reported eating five times a day in breakfast-snack-lunch-snack-dinner mode, which is one of the basic prerequisites for proper nutrition," reads one of the survey results.
No breakfast and sausage in the evening
Experts point out that relative details, such as the regular time of family breakfasts, are also important for healthy development.
In the Czech Republic, only 23 percent of schoolchildren' families have their free time for their beers at the same time.
In most families, everyone has their own free for a day.
And the worst was finding out that a tenth of households don't have a night's sleep at all.
Breakfast is the basis of a proper daily diet.
The questionnaire showed that unhealthy fries are much more commonly consumed in families of obese children.
Almost everyone - regardless of weight - drinks sweet sodas every day (70 percent).
Although more than 40 percent of the children surveyed regularly play sports, their parents had a score of less than half - 15 percent.
Build your diet
Another part of the survey allowed selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to compile their own diet according to their own taste and opinion.
"The dietary preferences of Czech children aged 12 to 15 are far from ideal in terms of healthy nutrition."
Among their favorite dishes there are a lot of floury, meaty and sweet dishes.
"The great popularity of sweet sodas is particularly alarming," the final report of the survey states.
For lunch as the main dish, pasta won just above the poultry.
However, children practically did not want legumes at all, and the popularity of fish and lunchtime vegetable dishes is also low.
Inclination to health
At the same time, the survey showed that children are willing to adjust their eating habits if they are given the right information.
"In many cases, the control group of survey participants who filled out the questionnaire after the end of the obesity awareness lecture is no accident, there has been a significant shift in preferences towards the principles of healthy nutrition," the project results state.
This was noticeable, for example, in sweet sodas, where more children would start to prefer ordinary water.
Children were also much more likely to tick poultry and fish as the main meal of the day in the questionnaire, limiting sweet foods and dumplings.
Stylist must also be a good psychologist, say pros
In the introductory article on how stylists learn, I kind of complained that there was a lot going on in the opening hours.
I had no idea what was going to happen next.
Lectures by three professionals in the field, dressing problematic characters and a seminar on how it works on set.
And it's going to get worse.
The closer we get to the final exam, the more information and practical tasks await us.
And even though the course takes place every Saturday and Sunday, it's really "treadm hard."
This time, director Alena and I discussed (there is not a single boy in the course) how to dress a woman who does not have a perfectly proportional figure.
And the vast majority of them.
Some have short necks, some have boyish physiques without proper curves, and some are overweight.
The stylist must know how to visually soften wide shoulders, lengthen the neck or add the necessary curves.
We were given tips on how to emphasize the figure nicely and at the same time not dress too challengingly for a woman like Jennifer Lopez, i.e. larger breasts and hips and narrow waist.
For example, if the difference between the waist and hips is such that the skirt or trousers don't really fit, then it's worth getting at least one of those make-up.
You will definitely not regret it, because perfectly fitting clothes are priceless.
You will feel much better in a tailored skirt than in one that constantly moves, rolls up, rests at the waist and so on.
The boyish figure can afford to wear clothes with draping, appaking, embroidery or gain.
Of course, there are many such information and types of characters, so I am glad that I have all week to sort all the information in my head.
And yet I'm afraid, given the homework you've done, it's too much.
Each of the course girls was assigned a celebrity to invent two outfits: day and evening.
We must take into account the current appearance, fashion style of the personality and type of figure.
I'm going to "dress" Miranda Kerr, maybe you know her from the Victoria's Secret campaigns.
I am in my mind, certainly better for me personally than britney spears, christina aguilera, who has recently gained about a hundred kilos (please take into account hyperbole), or young Selena Gomez.
We must cut the outfits from magazines or search the Internet and print and then graphically process them.
Moodboard, as the whole result is called, will also express our personal style and relationship to graphic representation.
Thinking about the graphic aspect of styling is also important.
The stylist not only does not not only physically, but also creates, for example, so-called product pages in magazines (for specific assignments, such as trendy handbags, coats, etc.).
The stylist and designer Mario Kameník told us about this.
But that's not until Sunday.
Stylist must have a general overview
Saturday's lecture, packed with information about the types of characters, was enhanced by three guests from the field.
Stylist Honza Pokorný, fashion designer Jakub Polanka and fashion photographer Ben Renč.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and a stylist should be able to take advantage of it.
And a handy stylist can work with one piece of clothing differently.
Variability is key in this case.
For example, such a trench coat (or if you want to originally trenchcoat) can be worn classically over jeans and a T-shirt as a cape, but you can also dress it on a bare body, put on pumps and take pictures like a dress.
Or just roll up the sleeves or collars and the whole look looks different.
"Play with it," he stressed.
But what I appreciated most was the following advice: "You need to know the rules perfectly to work."
"Then you can start breaking them," James said.
Finally, I understand why we are crushing all these lessons, what to combine with, what to do, why, when we sometimes see something different in fashion magazines.
Not to mention the parades.
Thanks to photographer Ben, I know that a stylist has to have many more clothes ready than can be photographed.
So for a fashion story that has ten pages (i.e. ten outfits), I have to be prepared to "hide" at least fifteen.
And that in the photo of the clothes it looks and works in combination with other pieces sometimes completely different than in reality.
So we have to count on that when creating an outfit.
Honza Pokorný confirmed that image and style sometimes make up to half the success.
Just look at Madonna, who isn't exactly a prodigy singer, but image and marketing have made her a world star.
In the Czech Republic, the approach to using stylist services is rather cold.
Even familiar faces sometimes consider it useless (it is enough that I can do something, the way I look in it is secondary).
And if someone has already had styling created from us, then we should expect that they will most likely dictate to us a completely different (smaller) size than they actually have.
Then all we have to do is Google and see if the tabloids wrote about the celebrity losing weight and the like.
Both Honza and Mario told us on Sunday that it is not enough for a stylist to orient himself in fashion and be able to put together an outfit.
In his work, he primarily communicates with the people he dresses, so it is important to be a good psychologist.
Being able to judge people, not pandering, standing up for your opinion.
"When a manager orders you to sort through her wardrobe and add nice pieces to it, you can't throw out the whole closet and say, for God's sake, that's terrible."
"Find at least a few things to praise and recommend what they can be worn for," says Mario.
He also specifically showed us what the so-called "flatbread", or set bag, must contain.
It's the one you turn on around your waist and you have all the necessary propriety on you.
In addition to bright things like scissors, a hair roller or safety pins, there are also a silon thread (with which the stylist helps out when taking pictures of products such as handbags or hats), special clips with which we pin the clothes at the back if it is larger (a pin or other clamp is not permissible, they would damage the garment), or a sewing.
So that we don't just listen, but also practically try something, we learned how to properly put on shoes.
Even when taking pictures in a studio where there is a flat surface, the sole could be damaged, let alone outside.
And so we glued and glued.
We can't even touch the shoes with scissors so they don't get damaged.
So you really need skill.
Mario pleased me when he complimented my creation without reservation.
The skill mentioned is really not my friend.
This is just a tiny fraction of what we heard about the second weekend's course sequel.
It's becoming increasingly clear to me that doing styling on a professional level isn't really a walk in the park, no matter what anyone says.
Need for Speed: The Run is raced across America.
recension
The originally carefree ride turns into a routine morning trip on the shift due to a series of completely unnecessary sloppy mistakes.
The ambition has largely been fulfilled, but it is of no use when no one clearly wanted to do anything extra.
The new episode, subtitled The Run, had high expectations before its release.
He promised that the years-old Need for Speed racing series would once again take a bit in a new direction, and from playable demonstrations it appeared to be a game that might not be just in numbers in the action racing genre.
We were also curious to see how the inserted passages, in which the protagonist gets out of the car and runs on foot, will turn out.
However, as is customary with the NFS series, many are a little different than expected as a result.
They are potentially decent arcade races, but the whole pulls down a few unnecessary bugs that have been appearing in the series for more or less several years.
So it's not really mistakes, but rather a manifestation of a kind of incomprehensible laziness of developers.
The adventure begins very well.
You are introduced into a story whose protagonist Jack has certain personal problems and as a solution is to participate in an illegal race across America.
You get behind the wheel on the West Coast in San Francisco, and your job is to get to New York first.
The idea carries with it several interesting elements.
The route is divided into ten stages, and then into more than fifty races.
It follows that each race is run on a different track and the stages are set in different, sufficiently different and interesting environments.
You don't feel for a moment that the game offers the same thing all the time.
In addition, some of the environments are very nice to look at, although the technical level of graphics corresponds to previous episodes of the series.
So it's nothing world-going.
But driving across deserts, autumn landscapes or high in snowy mountains feels visually very pleasant.
Moreover, the races are enhanced from time to time by some uncharacteristic element.
In the desert, for example, you get caught in a sandstorm that greatly reduces visibility.
In the mountains, on the other hand, you have to be careful not to get hit by an avalanche.
In addition, individual races are quite well planted in a row.
There's only a few types, but it's enough.
For a while you try to overtake the desired number of opponents (basically a classic race), then you catch up again (classic stopwatch fight) and then there is a duel with a single opponent.
From time to time, the police get involved, which makes your whole effort even more unpleasant.
New are the passages outside the car.
It's more like interactive animations where Jack usually runs away from someone and you have to help them by pressing the right buttons at the right moments.
Nothing complicated.
It is surprising, however, that there are far fewer of these passages in the game than you would expect (perhaps only three in particular).
As a result, however, it is to the benefit of the cause, because this element has no chance of becoming annoying and in the context of the above, it is one of the elements that diversify the game.
The driving model is following in the footsteps of previous parts.
This means that it is certainly not a who knows what nowadays, but it cannot be said to be a negative.
If you're looking for a realistic simulation, you'll need to look elsewhere.
But the more functional racing still suits the local driving model quite well, although we could find better with the competition.
So far, everything is in perfect order.
But problems begin to appear after a while.
Unlike the driving model, the model is no longer very good.
We don't expect a game of this type to count complex deformities and collisions, but if you have virtually no idea how your car will behave before hitting virtually any object, then I guess everything isn't quite right.
Typically, when overtaking or passing cars in normal traffic, sometimes you only lick each other lightly, but sometimes in an almost identical situation your car ends up in wild pirouettes.
Or even just shred.
Thanks to the reboot system, it doesn't really matter, but it will make you feel better.
Reboots are designed so that if you smash or drive far off the track, the game will throw you back to the last stop point on the track.
But there are only five restarts available in each race.
When you exhaust them, you have to start the race all over again.
So it is more of a tool in case something goes wrong than you can rely on them explicitly.
Sometimes restarts don't help either, they'll be solved only by the need to memorly learn the given section of the race.
The big ailing of the game is that the same things often happen in the same places.
For example, some corners need to be run in a specific way, otherwise you simply can't fit in them.
Other times, you will meet "civilian" cars in the same configuration, whether you arrive there first, fifth, five seconds earlier or a minute later.
This is especially bad in situations where you see the opponent passing easily between two oncoming cars in front of you, whereas when you get there, the cars are already in such a position that you have to go around them or brake them.
It doesn't matter when you reach them, because it's "calculated" so that the situation always happened right under your nose.
Opponents have another advantage.
During the whole gameplay, you will come across several places where, again, regardless of time, you will always be overted by the same opponent in the same place.
It hit the most at the end of the game on a long bridge where you're driving on the wrong side of the road.
The adversary must get there in front of you at any cost.
When it's in front of you, it makes your visibility about oncoming cars worse, so at first you're going to get a couple of nice smashes.
One can understand the intention to make the game more exciting and adrenaline-fueled, but the execution is so obvious that it reliably disgusts you quickly.
And it's a shame, because despite the simple driving model, gaming is fun and sometimes so action-packed that sometimes you literally can't keep track of where what's flying.
And it basically doesn't matter if it's due to the concept of 50 unique tracks, sorting races so that boredom doesn't stand a chance, or anything else.
An unconventional idea is to change cars during races.
You have to watch out for petrol stations by the roads, because that's where you can change your car, even though in the vast majority of cases you can make do with what you have right now.
Cars are divided into three categories.
Sports cars are suitable for urban areas, powerful American crashes on straight highways, and exotic supercars for technical riding, such as winding mountain roads.
With the main story mode goes hand in hand with the challenge mode, which are races in individual locations that you know from the story.
Here you earn not only medals, but also experience points in your profile, which is common for both challenges and story.
To get a higher level of driver, various objects are unlocked: from cars to backgrounds for the profile.
It is also again connected to the online autolog feature, which compares your achievements with other players and procures other community features.
One of the other hard-to-understand kicks is the situation from the last race in the story.
With your car you can get to the metro tunnel (so be it), where you drive it in the dark on the tracks (so be it).
On the speedometer, the numbers between 150 and 200 km/h (so be it) flash, and then a subway train crashes in from behind and scraps you uncompromisingly.
In the newsroom, we will probably have a discussion for a few more days about whether no one really thought a bit when creating the game, or whether the authors think we are really such a big jerk.
The technical side of the game is nothing special, but at least the overall visual impression is very pleasant in most cases and even great in a few cases.
It is so sad that in some of the more tense moments, the imageling decreases, in some cases quite tragically.
However, this applies especially to crashes with a larger number of participants, when smooth imaging would no longer be of any use to you.
The sound page is fine and the soundtrack is a matter of taste.
In an effort to like the widest possible range of rather younger audiences, a soundtrack from the category "every dog of a different country" was created, but it can be assumed that because of listening to music, someone will probably not buy the game easily.
The overall impression of Need for Speed: The Run is so quite awkward.
If the game avoided completely unnecessary mistakes, then we would not be afraid to say that The Run is the best NFS work in the last few years.
But this is how the game feels underdue.
I'm sure it's fun, but be prepared for bugs to spl be splplthing you in the eye with the power of the airport spotlight.

EU Ambassador Vicen:
Czechs have a reputation for negativity and Eurosceptics
"The Treaty of Lisbon has seriously upset the balance between the institutions."
"I didn't expect it to be such a hard war."
"It will take five, six years for the situation to settle down a bit, calm down and for all players to get used to their new roles," milena Vicenová, Czech Ambassador to the European Union, began her lecture at the Faculty of Law.
She showed how seriously she takes her motto "Clearly and openly about Europe" in the first part of the lecture, when she managed to describe the various EU institutions and their relations in such a clear and understandable way that many lecturers from the Faculty of Law of charles university could envy her.
Vicen also praised the work of the new Permanent President of the European Council, Herman Van Rompuy:
"At first there was criticism that he was bland, that he was a grey official, that he could not perform any role, and I must say that everyone was taken a breather, that he performed the role very well."
"He is a man who can listen to the 27 Member States, communicate well with them and has a clear vision of where the European Union should go."
She then explained the new post of High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy in response to the question: 'Who is this European Union? Which phone number should I call?", an important step towards unifying and making EU policy more readable towards countries such as China and India.
Nobody wants to ban us from the.
Vicen also addressed the agenda that the European Council has lived, is living and will live on in the near future.
She described the Czech Presidency as a success last year.
The Czechs addressed the emerging financial crisis, resolved the gas crisis or held a summit for the Eastern Partnership.
At that time, she described the fall of the government as a major negative, which severely damaged the Czech Republic.
The Czech representation in the EU is currently very busy.
In the ambassador's words, "really busy" was not only the Presidency, but also the subsequent financial crisis, which is still being resolved today.
Moreover, the union's new seven-year budget has yet to be approved, which is very complicated precisely because of the current economic situation.
Whether the budget will be lean and economical, which sectors will be given priority, which countries will be supported more and which will be less, is all on the agenda for the next negotiations.
The Ambassador also recalled her main slogans, which she came to Brussels with: 'About Europe clearly'.
"I really don't like ugly abbreviations, foreign words, lingo that no one understands.
How is a citizen supposed to understand that curved or round cucumbers, bananas of different sizes are not actually inventing in Brussels, or that we really need to be banned from whey.".
It also wants to make better use of the EU environment and get more Czechs into the European institutions.
A multi-speed Europe awaits us
According to the Ambassador, Czechs have a reputation as Eurosceptics and people who notice the negative rather than the positive aspects of things.
Moreover, it regrets the low representation of Czechs in the European institutions.
According to her, many factors are to blame, such as the modesty of our candidates, their inability to write motivational letters, but also the low support from the Czech side.
In addition to the successful Czech Presidency, she highlighted the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Four.
"Believe me, when a Pole and a Hungarian come to me and a Slovak approaches, the Frenchman next to me says, "Hey, what are you meeting there, what's your Visegrad Four?" and he doesn't look too happy about it at all."
In the future, according to Vicen, the Union will mainly face tough new rules on member states' budgetary policies.
He sees the concept of a two-speed, if not multi-speed, Europe as very real, rather than a new "European federation."
"We have eurozone countries and countries outside the eurozone."
"We have schengen space, we already have an institute of enhanced cooperation."
"For the first time, it was said to work together only the countries they wanted and those who did not want to stand by."
"There will be more institutes, and it will be a strong two-speed Europe," Vicen expects.
In this respect, it also appreciated the role of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuy in promoting the principle that all topics affecting the whole of the Union should be discussed between all Member States, not just those in the euro area.
Brand story:
IBM innovator begins second century of existence
If someone were looking for the word that most accurately expresses IBM's strategy, the closest thing would be "long-term."
For the general public, IBM is a symbol of the technological revolution, it is a company perceived as very contemporary, and yet a hundred years have passed since its founding.
The foundation of this long-term was laid by the first head of the company, the visionary Thomas J. Watson Sr.
He has already mottod that many of the world's problems can be easily solved if people are willing to think.
His motto, "Think!" became the imprint around which the future giant's life would unfold (and also the name of an internal magazine that began to be published at IBM in 1935).
It was also the foundation of Watson's carefully built corporate culture.
"For us at IBM, long-term thinking is a continuous movement towards the future.
IBM survived and prospered for a century by staying true to its core values while not being afraid to change everything else around it.
This allowed us to transform technology, business and society during our first centuries.
We hope to achieve even more in the second hundred," said samuel J. Palmisano, the company's current ceo, on the anniversary.
Sophisticated system
In the 1930s, Watson approached the care of his employees in a similar way to the entrepreneur Baťa in the Czech Republic - ibm people were among the first American employees to have paid leave, employer insurance plus an elegant employee uniform and a sophisticated system for rewarding the best inventors and traders.
Ibm has a long-term relationship with the customer.
From the beginning, the company was brilliant at extracting talent - as one of the world's first companies to abolish any discrimination, so it could choose.
In line with the anti-discrimination strategy, the current plan is for Palmisan to be replaced by a woman - Virginia Rometty - to head IBM next year.
She has been with IBM for 30 years and still holds the position of Head of Sales, Marketing and Strategy.
IBM has been doing so-called jams in recent years, online brainstorming, from which many future strategies and innovations arise.
No wonder there are enough ideas - there are almost half a million people working in the company.
Institutions with a good name
The firm's strong internal and external image ensures a strong position in the business.
"From the beginning, IBM had the concept of an institution rather than just a technology company," Harvard Business School professor and author rosabeth Moss Kanter told the Economist.
"IBM is not a technology company, but a company that helps solve business problems using technology," added George Colony of Forrester Research, a consulting firm.
As the company itself says, the difference between entering the market and thus creating the market directly.
IBM - or "Big Blue," as it is famously nicknamed because of its logo in the United States - has grown into one of the world's largest companies in a century.
It is probably the most versatile technology company - it develops hardware and software, infrared, hosting and consulting services in a range of products from servers to nanotechnology.
It holds the most patents of any U.S. technology company, and five of its employees have won nobel prizes.
Her inventions include an ATM, a credit card, a financial swap, a barcode or a floppy disk.
IBM, with roughly $220 billion, became the second-largest technology company by market capitalization this year (apple is the first) to overtake Microsoft for the first time since 1996.
Looking ahead
Not all products and innovations have hit customer tastes and times - IBM, for example, failed to bet on its own OS/2 operating system, Prodigy online services, or IBM PCjr computers.
"If your business is built on moving forward, you can't emotionally reteol yourself with the past," says Samuel J. Palmisano.
That's why IBM has no problem building its foundations on many platforms - and when they don't work, leave them.
Unlike, say, rival Microsoft, which basically stands and falls on the Windows operating system.
Perspective technology
IBM's sales are largely services, with software and hardware accounting for about a fifth of sales.
As of 1990, with more than half of it, hardware was the strongest representative.
Since 2000, IBM has sold $15 billion in low-yielding assets, investing $58 billion in the same period to buy promising technologies.
It has continued to invest since 2008, when the modern financial crisis swept the world for the first time.
IBM is acting on the legacy of its first boss, Thomas J. Watson, who also increased investment during the Great Depression.
So far, IBM seems to be going through the current crisis unaffected.
IBM's share price has risen a rocketing 120 percent since the beginning of 2008, while the company's net profit continues to grow.
IBM's corporate motto is to change everything but its values.
It can therefore be expected that even if there is another crisis, this flexible giant will be able to handle it.
IBM History: From Cheese Slicers to Space Travel
IBM (International Business Machines) was founded in New York a century ago, originally called computing tabulating recording corporation.
Ibm took over the name only in 1924 - originally a brand used for the company's branches in Canada and South America.
The merger of four companies dating back to the 1980s laid the foundation for later IBM.
They owned technologies such as the famous, i.e. hours recording the employee's arrival and departure.
The architect of the new company was businessman Charles Ranlett Flint, who until 1930 also chaired the company's supervisory board.
Flint hired the head of a rival firm, Thomas J. Watson, to help him manage the company.
The leader then eclipsed ibm's founders - Watson's ideas are still built on an invincible corporate culture and identity.
Watson ran the company until 1952.
IBM, as its name suggests, started with the production and sale of all sorts of machines for business - from meat and cheese slicers to checkouts.
In the first four years that Watson was in charge of the company, sales doubled to $9 million and began the company's massive expansion across all continents.
Watson was so indispensable to the company that after nearly 40 years in the leadership, he was replaced by his son, Thomas Watson Jr.
Under his leadership, IBM began working on the development of artificial intelligence, developing the first programming language.
In the 1960s, ibm humans and computers helped NASA direct space travel - to Mercury, Saturn, and in 1969 the famous flight of man to the moon.
Meanwhile, in 1964, IBM developed the first family of computers - the IBM System/360 series.
The classic "roast", which established the computer standard of the time, called the IBM 5150, came on the market in 1981.
Twenty years later, IBM sold computer manufacturing to Lenovo, China, bought the consulting part of PricewaterhouseCoopers, and began to devote its full attention to high-value-added consulting and services.
The strategy that has been paying off for IBM in the last three years is the Smarter Planet concept, the "smarter planet."
It aims to make smart use of technologies in areas not yet planned and to improve the situation, for example, in transport or urban management.
For business, IBM recently introduced the "Smarter Commerce" platform, which helps traders manage the entire commercial cycle.
IBM has a strong history domestically as well.
It established its branch in what was then Czechoslovakia in 1932 as the first country in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, in addition to IBM ČR, it also operates a strategic outsourcing centre in Brno.
The Central and Eastern Europe Headquarters is based in Prague and there is also a world-class research team dedicated to voice recognition.
Rychtářová about an unfaithful husband:
Ive, keep the donkey, I don't want him anymore!
Darina Rychtářová (53) said the end!
After her husband Josef Rychtář (53) became not only a protector of Iveta Bartošová (45), but also a lover, Darina still hoped that Josef would wake up from the pink dream and come home.
But now she doesn't want to wait any longer, and she's laid down clear rules for the next life.
"Pepa can come home, but not as my partner," Rychtářová explained.
When Darina Rychtářová granted asylum to Bartošová in her house in the summer, she probably did not even dream how her marriage would end.
Despite the fact that Iveta moved out of Říčany after 30 days at her insistence, Pepa did not leave the singer.
He even publicly admitted that he loved her.
Over time, Darina resigned, made good-up to her husband's relationship, and now even said goodbye to him forever.
The rychytář doesn't care who his wife sleeps with
If Rychtář and Bartošová were to break up once, his wife's open arms would not be waiting for him at home.
"He's the biological father of my sons, and if he wants to live out his life in our shared house, no one will expel him."
"But she will live to see him not as my beloved, stray old donkey, but as a person with whom I have certain ties," Rychtářová revealed, noting that she had already detached herself from her husband and insuited only mutual decency.
Joseph doesn't mind darina closing his back door.
"I respect my wife's decision."
"I will be with Iveta, and I'm not going to change it."
"My wife set up a paper marriage, and I respect that."
"The company goes on, I take care of repairs, garden, real estate, I shop."
"Darna and I are talking normally, except we don't share a bed," Rychtář told The Flash.
If Rychtářová also found a new love, she will not prevent her from doing so.
"We're not sleeping together, and I don't care where he's going, who he's going with, and if he has a boyfriend.
I know it's my fault, I fell in love with Iveta and I take full responsibility," Joseph concluded.
Worst women's habits: Do they affect you?
When you ask men if they can name any typical female habits, as a rule, all of them are very quick to roll them out of their sleeves.
Dear women, do you recognize yourself in the following lines, which show several female habits that can pump blood in men's veins perfectly?
shopping
Does your other half blame you for being addicted to shopping?
Do you have to buy at least one cloth a week?
Do you like to buy in bulk at discounts?
Then in your case, you can talk about shopping as a habit.
Some women realize that they should at least tame their shopping passion a little bit.
But tell me, who could resist just walking around clothing stores, looking for well-fitting uppers, and then trying them all out (ideally in different colours) in a cubicle?
Although shopping is a hobby for most women, it can literally become hell for men.
Just remember how many times you've told your guy to wait for you outside the entrance...
Constant dissatisfaction
"Am I too fat?"
"I need to lose at least five kilos - should I start exercising?"
"Do you even like me?"
Don't these sentences remind you of anything?
Don't you?
Then you're one of those women who's obsessed with the way they look.
Not that you should stop taking care of yourself, but a lot of men are directly allergic to their partners constantly complaining about their appearance.
The stronger sex also agrees that the higher the frequency of this complaining, the more annoying the women are.
Order and cleanliness first
It's like an endless merry-go-round.
Washing windows, vacuuming, wiping pavement, wiping dust, scrubbing the bath - at least twice a week.
Do you blame your partner for stepting on clean pavement with his dirty foot, the children for soiling the scrubbed sink and for empating the glass living wall you went to so much time polishing?
In case you suffer from this very "aversion", try to remember that nothing should be exaggerated, and order and cleanliness should definitely not come first within the family.
This harmless desire for cleanliness can endanger your relationships and family well-being.
cavil
"Throw those used shorts in the trash."
"Are you going to wear those old socks tomorrow?"
"Wet wipes don't belong on the ground."
If you poke your partner like this several times a day, know that you can reliably dial them.
Of course you don't mean any bad, you want to make sure everything's okay.
Maybe if men knew, women wouldn't have to poke them so hard...
Gossiping, gossiping
For some women, there are also rumors, rumors, as well as insults and conspiring against someone.
Women are focused on relationships, so they like to discuss who, where, with whom, how and why.
Perhaps each of us will release some harmless little gossip or gossip here and there.
Hand on heart, it's owned by almost all women.
The opposite is true, however, of the gossip of the coarsest grain, which likes and often gossips, perhaps despises everyone and is particularly dangerous for their surroundings - especially within the women's working group.
Jágr and Voráček helped philadelphia win with assists
Hockey forward Jaromír Jágr contributed two assists in Philadelphia's 5–3 win over Carolina on Monday night and is once again at the forefront of czech players' productivity in the competition.
Claude Giroux, who added one more pass and was named the game's best player, benefited from the 39-year-old star's overview.
Jágr's teammate Jakub Voráček also recorded two assists in the match.
Jagr told reporters overseas after the game that he had predicted Giroux a big night.
"I told him before the game he was going to score a hat-trick."
"I felt it."
"Sometimes you get that feeling," said Jagr, after which Giroux scored from the Flyers' first shot.
Moments later, the team's second hit had a Czech lead.
Voráček won the puck behind the Hurricanes goal and presented it between the circles to the scoring Maxim Talbot.
Patrick Dwyer cut the lead with a second before the first break, but the flyers again owned the start of the second period.
Specifically, giroux.
After working with Jagr, he scored his third goal, then his shot was transformed into a fourth goal by Wayne Simmonds.
"I love playing with him."
"I don't want to say he's the best player in the league, but he's definitely one of the top three," Jagr said of his center.
"I never thought I'd be playing with a hockey player like him at the end of my career."
"I'm happy about that."
"I want to play him."
"All those years in the NHL, my teammates tried to play me, now it's turning around," Jagr added.
Carolina made the game even more dramatic, scoring Tuom Ruutu and again Dwyer, who made it out of the penalty shootout, to within one goal.
But matt read, who finished outnumbered 2-1, did not allow any more complications.
"He made a great hit in our Pronger zone."
"He pouched the puck, I picked up speed, and (Read) went to the far post."
"I tried to hit him and I'm glad it worked out," Voráček described the last goal of the match from his point of view.
Philadelphia took the lead in the Eastern Conference with a victory.
Czech Montreal defenseman Jaroslav Špaček did not finish the game against Buffalo, withdrew in the second period due to an upper-body injury.
In addition to the experienced beka, the Candiens also lost a two-goal lead and lost 2-3 after a penalty shootout.
One of their raids was not transformed by Tomáš Plekanec.
Rather than losing points, the home coach was annoyed by the extensive back-row sick leave, with only five defenders playing the game.
"It's wrong."
"We only finished the match with one experienced player, the rest were youngsters."
"But there's just nothing we can do about it, we have to deal with it," Jacques Martin said.
"Alternating after rotation, it was coming down on us, and we couldn't resist."
"We should have made the game easier, move the puck out of our zone."
We had gaps in that," added one of the defenders, P.K. Subban.
Czech goaltender Ondřej Pavelec contributed 30 hits to Winnipeg's 5–2 win over Tampa Bay.
The Jets' goals, which ended a five-game losing streak, were shared by five different scorers.
How tour prices have evolved since 1989
Until 1989, only five state travel agencies were allowed in what was then Czechoslovakia: Čedok, Sporturist, CKM, Recreation and Autoturist.
At that time, travel agencies overwhelmingly sold only tours to the countries of the socialist bloc, as travel to the west was very limited.
Czech tourists thus travelled to the GDR (German Democratic Republic), the Soviet Union (Sochi in Crimea on the Black Sea), Bulgaria, Romania (both to the Black Sea) and Hungary (Balaton) for holidays to the sea.
A bright exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, when it was also possible to travel to Yugoslavia, but then the Yugoslav regime moved towards the West and the trips of Czech tourists to Yugoslavia were subsequently very limited.
The great paradox of the time of socialism was that citizens of the socialist bloc (i.e. Czechoslovaks) were not allowed to travel individually freely even within socialist countries.
If a citizen of Czechoslovakia wanted to travel individually to Poland or the Soviet Union, for example, he needed an invitation letter from that country, otherwise an individual trip was not possible.
Travel agencies at the time also offered tours to the West, but it was necessary to queue overnight with a sleeping bag or have "good friends" at the travel agency.
Still, it was not won.
The so-called foreign exchange promise, which was a condition for travel to the West, was not given to "politically unreliable people", who could not travel at all.
The Czechoslovak currency was not a freely convertible currency, so without a foreign exchange promise it was not possible to obtain funds (Western currency) for the trip to the West.
By far the most common, however, Czechs spent their holidays in the Czech Republic, which resulted in a large number of cottages and cottages, which czechs took and this habit survives to this day.
Since 1989, czechs have experienced a real revolution.
While until 1989 holidays in the GDR or Bulgaria were our maximum, last year Czechs spent 4.5 million holidays abroad in countries around the world.
A huge paradox that we are no longer aware of is that it was not possible for us, currently the most popular Croatia, to travel freely until 1989, as it was part of yugoslavia at that time.
In the early 1990s, visa requirements for neighbouring Western European countries were lifted, triggering a huge wave of short-term visits, mainly to Vienna or Germany in Austria.
Czechoslovaks could not get enough of trips to the West for a long time, everyone wanted to visit there at least for a while.
In Paris, for example, Czechs' tours slept in tents in parks, because our income at the time did not allow us to pay for a hotel or guesthouse.
A typical feature of czechs' travels at this time was the delivery of their own food, canned food, salami, etc. in order to save money.
Another important moment was the introduction of a freely convertible Czech crown, so that our tourists could finally buy western currency freely after many decades.
However, our standard of living and with it average salaries were rising, which resulted in another important moment around 1997.
Due to the increased demand for travel, travel agencies have started to regularly prepare charter trips since 1997, making air tours incredibly cheaper than in the past thanks to the possibility of bargaining for quantity discounts.
At the end of the 1990s, Czechs already had visa-free travel to virtually all developed countries of the world, except the USA, which continued to facilitate our travel.
Another interesting moment in the history of post-revolutionary travel came in 2000, when, thanks to considerable demand, the first ever direct charter flight to exotica was taken from the Czech Republic, it was to Thailand.
Since this year, direct charters to warm faraway countries fly with Czech tourists every year, this winter will be flown directly from the Czech Republic to twelve exotic destinations.
Around 100,000 Czechs visit exotic countries every year!
Another interesting moment in this period, which symbolizes our post-revolutionary development, came in 2008.
On November 17, 2008, the US cancelled visas for Czech tourists, which made our country one of the most advanced countries in the world.
In 2008, Czechs also spent more than half of their holidays abroad for the first time in history (50.3%) and for the first time in history, they spent more than 15,000 on one foreign holiday, including the cost of their stay. CZK per person.
The general meeting is supposed to find the chairman, but once again there is a threat of stalemate
For almost five months, Czech football has been without a chairman and there is a risk that Ivan Hasek's successor at the head of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FAČR) will not be known even after another extraordinary general meeting, which will take place on Thursday in Nymburk.
There is still no agreement on what electoral rules to follow.
Without it, there will be no vote on which of the three candidates will be elected.
Jindřich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Paclík are interested in leading Czech football.
Hašek resigned in June and, when he left, called on his colleagues to unite and find a strong personality to lead football in the future.
But in the post-Hasek era, football slipped back to a strifight between the two union chambers that cannot agree on a common candidate.
This was fully demonstrated on 16 September, when the new President was to be chosen.
Delegates of the general meeting went to the National House in Prague in Smíchov for nothing, because the meeting remained blocked and it was not just a method of choice.
Nor was there an agreement as to who had the right to vote in the pile - whether only statutory representatives or even officials entrusted with the power of attorney.
There has been partial agreement on this single point since then, and this has been helped by the recommendation of the Institute for State and Law, according to which representation on the basis of a power of attorney is not possible.
But there is still controversy over the electoral code.
Nor has the Executive Committee, which is dealing with anything else in its negotiations, whether regular or extraordinary, brought too clear to the situation.
The view of the choice has changed several times, but the neuralgic point is still the same.
The question is: how to proceed in the 3rd round to rule out the possibility of a stalemate?
"The dispute is whether to proceed in accordance with the statutes or to find another model," said Dušan Svoboda, one of the three vice-presidents of the FAČR, who represents professional football in the association's management.
According to the statute-designed model, the third-round candidate will win with more percentage support in the chamber for which he is running.
Moravia is reportedly willing to go to a concession in order to win a candidate who gets a higher sum of percentages of votes from both chambers.
And the Czech side is pushing for the condition that the winner must gain at least a two-thirds advantage in this percentage count.
"But then the two previous rounds would have lost their meaning, which would completely deny the two-chamber concept," he understands the objections of the Moravian Freedom Party, according to which it would be best not to bend the order and vote according to the valid statutes.
Somewhat surprisingly, Tomáš Paclík also agrees with this, although it is estimated that the statute-appointed electoral rules suit Pelt the most of all the candidates.
"I wish it was chosen according to the statutes at the most."
"So that some representative nonsense is not invented, as at the last general meeting," said the owner Viktoria Plzeň, who is running for the first time and has defined himself primarily against Pelt in his statements.
Pelta remains optimistic.
In Nymburk, he says, the new president will be known and believes that the candidates will work constructively together in the future.
"All passions will be calmed by the possible progression of the national team to the European Championships today."
"Football will be on a happy wave again, there will be a greater willingness to cooperate," says jablonec, who has the greatest experience in managing football at both professional and regional level.
Rajchl is more restrained.
"I hope for an agreement, but unfortunately the situation is very ambivalent."
"It is not among the people of Bohemia and Moravia, but there are efforts to adapt the regulations in a purposeful way."
"This may cause the general meeting to be blocked again."
"But I hope common sense prevails," Rajchl said.
There is not much time left for an agreement between all parties.
Some negotiations were supposed to take place directly in Montenegro, but who knows whether the football general will be complete by the end of the match.
The air special, in which vice-presidents Dalibor Kučera and Rajchl were to travel to Podgorica, did not leave Prague in the morning due to a technical malfunction and a replacement option was sought to transport part of the executive committee to the venue of the barricade retaliation.
In the end, a ministerial meeting may be decisive, which may take place on Wednesday.
Minister of Education, Youth and Sports Josef Dobeš would like to get divided parties within the strongest sports association in the country to reach an agreement.
There is a lot at stake: state subsidies, the credibility of football and the upcoming ČSTV general meeting, which will address the new direction of Czech sport after Sazka's financial problems.
Paclík goes into battle for president because he doesn't see a suitable candidate
If The Head of Football of Pilsen Tomáš Paclík had seen a strong candidate before the extraordinary general meeting who would have fulfilled all his ideas about the new Chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FAČR), he would not have entered the race for the top job.
"If a quality candidate exists, I'm fighting for him, and I'm not going to vote."
"But in the current situation, no one like that could be found," Paclík told ČTK.
The fight with Miroslav Pelta and Jindřich Rajchl is motivated by Paclík to try to prevent Pelt, the alleged favorite of the elections, from leading the FAČR.
Paclík also stresses that if he were to win, he would only last as chairman until 2013, when a proper general meeting is on the agenda.
In office, he would like to see an experienced and top manager who is not very connected to football events.
"I've spoken to some of the people who might be eligible."
"It was crazy for me when some people said that they didn't even want to identify with Czech football at the moment."
"That's the view I'd like to change," he said.
Paclík is said to be most concerned about Pelt's association with the chairman of the Pilsen Regional Football Association, Roman Berber, a man with a controversial reputation who is known behind the scenes as a powerful lobbyist with the ability to influence delegate voting at the general meeting.
It is so unacceptable for Paclík that Pelta should be in the president's position.
"If he had won, the status quo would have been preserved and nothing would have moved forward in football."
"Combined with the support of Berbro, who is a professed businessman, it would not benefit football even more," Paclík said.
He also alludes to the fact that Pelt's name was mentioned years ago in wiretaps during an investigation into a corruption scandal, but pelta came out unsuvied.
"I don't know what prestige Pelt's victory would bring to football."
"And what we would look like in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA," said Paclík, who is also taking into account his former statement that he would "sell the Pilsen club if Pelta became chairman."
If Paclík were to triumph in Thursday's election, he could imagine future cooperation with Pelta.
Another candidate, Rajchl, whom Paclík supported before the September general meeting, which ended in a fiasco, thinks the same way.
"He (Pelta) would be the first person I'd go to."
"He has great abilities."
"I could imagine him as the head of the national team."
"But he couldn't run the association managerite."
"I don't stick my nose where I can't," said Paclík, who attracted a lot of attention in September by standing behind the dismissal of a panel of judges headed by Luďek Macela, who was replaced by Dagmar Damková.
Paclík says he would have dared to run the association.
He refers to his skills in managing private companies, since last summer he has also been in charge of Pilsen, which, with his support, celebrated its premier league triumph in May.
"I have the strength to make a difference in the football environment, to contribute to its certain cultivation."
"To limit the influence of some interest groups, which may tend to influence the disciplinary and appeals committees, which goes into disgusting situations," said Paclík, who makes no secret of his antipathy to, for example, Spartan boss Daniel Křetínský.
He would also consider tightening the FAČR's relations with the Czech Olympic Committee as one of the priorities, with which he would lobby political leaders to get more lottery tax money into the sport.
"It is one of the key things that the new President should address."
"If gambling is taxed, as the political parties declare, I understand their argument, but they have to be honest about where the money is going," he said.
Paclík does not now take his connection to the Pilsen club as a burden, although he himself claims that the chairman of the FAČR should be "bipartisan".
Pelta is connected to Jablonec, Rajchl to Dukla in Prague.
"It's not ideal."
"But I don't see the point in hypocritically converting my shares in a Pilsen club into someone and going back there in a year and a half," Paclík said.
Pelta promised new fačr statutes to rule out electoral stalemate
Two days before the General Meeting of the Football Association, one of the candidates for president Miroslav Pelta promised to push for the FAČR to have new statutes that would definitively rule out disputes over the Electoral Code in the future if elected.
Jablonec's official is optimistic ahead of Thursday's meeting in Nymburk and believes that the pre-election fight will significantly dampen the possible success of the football team today.
Pelta had already promised before september's election that he intended to focus on representation and fundraising if elected.
He decided to go to the election before the last general meeting at the last minute, so a two-month postponement might have come in handy to defend his ideas about the management of football and present his ideas in a broader context.
"People at all levels have been doing football for a long time and expect the chairman to be known on Thursday."
"They feel it is high time someone led the association," says the man, who is mainly associated with the Jablonec club but who has worked for many years in Sparta and the union's executive committee.
That is why he believes that he has enough experience to manage Czech football.
He believes that the euphoria that reigned during Ivan Hasek's reign is behind the current problems with choice.
"Unfortunately, at the June general meeting, the statutes were approved, which were not as perfect as everyone thought."
"If different interpretations were not allowed, we had a president since September," Pelta pointed out.
It was the reworking of the most important document of the civic association that he took as a decoy to the delegates.
"If I become chairman, I'll take it as a personal task, and I'm willing to take personal responsibility if that doesn't happen."
"It's a principled thing we can't be without," Pelta says.
He says he's still trying not to define against his opponents.
He has previously announced that he can imagine working with Jindřich Rajchl, whom he recognizes because of his legal education, and he knows full well that his opponent would be his first vice-president.
For a long time he did not attack Tomáš Paclík, who, on the contrary, did not leave the thread dry on Pelt.
"He's been in football for a little over a year, he's had some successes."
"But his attacks were undignified, and he caught a lot of people off guard in the way of the election campaign."
"That's why many of them now doubt his true character," pelta said of his opponent, who is said to remain loyal to the proclamations he announced back in September.
His strongest weapon, he says, is his knowledge of football from the lowest competitions to the national team.
It should be the showcase of football.
"And I would also try to end all affairs, starting with the Bohemians case or the aftershots of last year's corruption scandal."
"Right after that, I would rush into negotiations with the private and state sectors to ensure enough money for the whole football," the 46-year-old candidate told ČTK two months ago.
At the time, he also promised that his arrival at the head of football would not mean any personnel purges.
"I'd have to get acquainted with the contents of the individual employees first," he said, speaking to Strahov, where there is understandable nervousness about the long limpness.
Despite the current catastrophic scenarios that accompany the upcoming general meeting, he believes that delegates will not go to Nymburk for nothing on Thursday.
"If the only point of contention is how we're going to vote in the third round, we can get over it."
"Football needs credibility, and the only way to get that is to finally have its leader back," Pelta remains optimistic two days before perhaps the decisive day of his tenday as a functionary.
Rajchl promises that under him the FAČR would start working hard
If the current Vice-President Jindřich Rajchl were elected as the new Chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic at thursday's general meeting, many people in the association would not be tifying this.
Rajchl promises that if he is elected, hard work will begin.
He wants to push through systemic changes and make executive committee members accountable for individual football areas.
He also promised to solve the Bohemians case, improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, bring more money to football and continue the work started by the previous chairman, Ivan Hašek.
"As chairman, I'd like to focus on football as a whole."
"From international contacts with UEFA and FIFA to national team, professional football, performance football to youth."
"This is not to say that I would do everything myself," Rajchl said in an interview with ČTK.
"I'm a team player, and I want to divide the competencies on the executive committee so that each member is focused on a specific area."
"And I'm going to give away hard work to take football a mile ahead in every segment."
"I don't think many people would be happy because it would start working really hard and not just criticise the work of others," he added.
Because of the critical atmosphere in the football movement, he said he was thinking about not running again.
"I'm known to work 20 hours a day."
"But I need to know that it's going to make sense, and that I'm not going to have people behind me who are going to keep throwing sticks at me and questioning my every move," he said, explaining why he hesitated.
"But a lot of people told me I couldn't give up, because then others would give up."
"That's a trust I can't just throw away," he said.
He is also motivated by the continuation of the work he started with Hašek.
"A lot of work has been done in the last two years, and I don't want to throw it away right now."
"There are processes that will not reverberate for a few years, and I would not like to see them stopped," he said, fearing that if another candidate Miroslav Pelta was elected, the situation at the association could return to before Hašek.
"I believe in systematics, and that's something I don't think Mirek Pelta can do."
"Behind him are, above all, there are people who would make football so that it would be only for the chosen ones."
"I can be blamed for a lot of things, but certainly not for shuning anyone."
"I'm trying to be objective."
"I want to do football for everyone, because then everyone will have a good time and not just the chosen ones," Rajchl said.
He also refutes the claim that he would only be a Czech President.
"Although some people try to say otherwise, I plan to do my best for Moravia."
"For example, it is time to consider splitting the second league into the Czech and Moravian parts, the winners of which would go to the first league."
"This would not be the current situation where there are only three Moravian units in the league, which is a problem towards young players in Moravia," rajchl said.
Since the head of the Pilsen club Tomáš Paclík was also involved in the fight for the chairman, Rajchl does not dare to estimate his chances of being elected.
"But I still feel strong support in the Czech Chamber, which elected me as its vice-president and sees that there are clear achievements behind me," said Rajchl, who considers it his achievements to save tens of millions of crowns on unfavorable contracts, negotiating TELEVISION contracts and negotiating a lottery law.
On the contrary, he blames the union for not pulling together.
While he claims pelt is "disqualified from returning confidence to Czech football", he regards the other opponent Paclík as a strong candidate with a lot to offer football.
"No one can dispute that he did a great job in Pilsen that year."
"If elected, he would perhaps continue with the things that Ivan Hašek started here and would not fundamentally change the staffing of the committees."
"He wouldn't want to twist it in his favor," rajchl says of the rivals.
Europe's most beautiful pools
Jump to blue
Julia Stanek
Paddling pool from Ufon's point of view, luxury pool in Budapest: Those who travel through Europe can experience their blue miracle - and after exploring cities or traveling let their tired feet rest in the thermal baths.
The book will show where the wellness by the water is most beautiful.
When Iris Meder went on discovery trips for the past year and a half, her luggage must not be missing: her swimsuit.
Lying on the water, she looked up to the height of the art-shaped domes, swam opposite the marble putti (the figures of a small naked boy, a child (with wings)) waiting for her at the edge of the pool, admiring the carefully restored Art Teucine swimming pools.
If she liked a swimming pool, she carried it into her notebook in an instant - with remarkable details about the way the building was built and the history of the building.
More than 200 swimming pools have been explored in this way by the architecture historian Meder and present them now in her just-published book "Badefreuden (The Joy of Bathing) ": Folk Swimming Pools in Munich, the historic Palace of Swimming In the Black Forest," The Hard Core of Concrete Structures" in Taunus.
She was guided by her "Journey to the Most Common Spa in Central Europe": In addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she visited locations in Italy, France, Bohemia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland - and always one city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
The 46-year-old German is a true enthusiast of swimming culture.
He's not overly exaggerated about sports, says Meder - it's just something else in the water.
To the anger, swimming fans must settle for blue cul-cul-scented and chlorine odor, while health runners can inhale the intoxicating smell of spruce forests or listen to the cheerful chirping of birds in the park.
"One day I asked why swimming pools must always be so ugly," says Mrs. Meder, who lives in Vienna.
"So I started collecting nice swimming pools."
Water level doubles architecture
Splashing in the jump pool and essential oils for the sauna - the well-being factor is therefore so great that it affects all the senses, so much for Mrs. Meder.
And when the founders tried, swimming pools can be a real feast for the eyes: "Instead of a floor, a man has a water surface in the spa."
"It's transparent on the one hand, but it reflects the beauty of the whole building."
Everything is optically doubling: high vault, colorful tiles, diving boards.
The small-format picture volume "Badefreuden (The Joys of Bathing) " provides everything you need to know about the architectural and cultural history of historical oases of wellnes on 190 pages - but above all it arouses the desire to jump into blue.
The remarkable specimens were discovered by the float collector Mrs. Meder during her search in Hungary.
In addition to wonderful healing baths such as budapest's 100-year-old Széchenyi spa, it has found nitrate-containing water in the original karst cave (cave bath in Miskolc-Tapolca) and thermal baths, whose pools are filled with alkaline water and are housed in a bottle-shaped building (Városi Termálfürdö in Jászberény).
A beautiful spectacle, on the other hand, is offered by many heated open-air swimming pools in Switzerland and Austria. While you can see the whole city from zurich's cherry bath, you can look at the snow-covered Arlberg in the outdoor pool of the St. Anton spa - and: There's a window in the steam baths from which you can watch the bustl on the ski slopes.
Perhaps the most remarkable pool design awaits spa guests in Längenfeld: The Ötztal water park looks like a ufo that has just landed in the Alps.
Steam rises from the three open pans in winter while rising to the sky in the backdrop of Mount Ötztalu.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
Not in every swimming pool, Mrs. Meder, the smell of chlorine rose into her noirs.
Many thermal baths smell of sorority, in the Árpád spa in Békescsaba, Hungary, it smells of heating oil to such an extent that one can hardly believe that it has reached the spa.
The smell comes from healing water containing alkaline bicarbonates, which is almost black and whose deposits stick to the shell as soon as only a person slips into the pool - a rather peculiar wellness experience.
However, Iris Meder was also disappointed in her search for a nice spa: When she wanted to visit the Czech solar and climate spa Luhačovice, she came across a closed terrain.
In 1902, architect Dušan Jurkovič designed the spa was closed.
As Mrs. Meder looked through the crumbling windows of the red-and-white-yellow Secessile building, she saw the weeds growing massively between the tiles.
The extinction, on the other hand, was built in a magical flat in the Black Forest: the Palais Thermal in Bad Wildbad.
These spas have already completed three stages of construction; man can discover not only Neo-Romanesque elements that date back to its creation in 1844, but also the Moorish Alhambra-style hall, which was annexed around 1900.
Since the careful modernization of 1995, the Palais Thermal has been a popular spa place for pool connoisseur Mrs. Iris Meder, and not only because she comes from the Black Forest.
"It's been a feat to combine such diverse building styles into such a beautiful complex," says Ms. Meder.
With such a palace, immersion in a thermal pool is probably a marginal matter.
Agrarian speculation
Deutsche Bank has commodity trade reviewed
Christian Teevs
Is Deutsche Bank abandoning its agricultural trade?
According to SPIEGEL-ONLINE, Josef Ackermann commissioned a task force to investigate the consequences of speculation for the poor world.
In January, the head of the group wants to draw the consequences.
Hamburg -
For federal citizens, the point is clear: 84% of Germans find it unacceptable, according to one study, for banks to speculate on agricultural raw materials such as wheat or corn.
Two-thirds of those surveyed even demand that Deutsche Bank and other credit institutions exit the deal because it exacerbates the problems of the world's poorest.
This is the result of a Forsa survey commissioned by the consumer organisation Foodwatch.
The study is based on a report presented by Foodwatch in mid-October.
In it, author Harald Schumann shows that bets on global commodity exchanges drive up prices, and banks are therefore complicine in the world's hunger problem.
The consumer advocates' campaign is aimed specifically at Deutsche Bank boss Josef Ackermann, although big banks such as Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are also acting similarly.
Originally, commodity bets were meant to insure traders against price fluctuations.
Meanwhile, most experts agree that capital market participants interested in high-risk trades have detached themselves from supply and demand - and made profits at the expense of the poorest.
Other than competitors in the United States, he responded to Ackermann's criticism: He promised to investigate the complaints, saying that no deal "is worth putting Deutsche Bank's reputation on the line."
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international working group is reviewing the complaints from the Foodwatch-Report.
The audit is due to be closed by the end of the year, after which the results will be presented to deutsche bank's board - along with a recommendation on how to deal with it.
At the end of January, bank officials want to say what the consequences will be.
In the end, there could be a reduction in commodity trade or even a complete rejection.
Ackermann is working on his own image.
Foodwatch chief Thilo Bode welcomed the report, but intensified his criticism of the financial sector: "Betting on rising food prices shows particularly drastically how ruthlessly banks are now harming the common good."
Let Ackermann, as the top banking lobbyist, do his duty.
"Deutsche Bank must remove from its portfolio all items for which money is used to bet on food prices," Bode said.
"It doesn't matter if Mr. Ackermann cares about the starving people or the reputation of Deutsche Bank."
Ackermann's view seems surprising at first glance, but it is clear that the group boss would like to leave a perfect picture a few months before he leaves office.
On Monday, Deutsche Bank announced that the chief executive would not go to the supervisory board any other way than planned.
By averting questionable agrarian speculation, he could improve his image.
And he doesn't have to worry about possible losses - that's what his successor should end up dealing with.
One in two would denounce investments in raw materials
Foodwatch is trying to keep up the pressure on the manager.
So far, more than 30,000 Internet users have participated in the organization's campaign.
On Tuesday, Bode published a poll in which the Forsa Institute interviewed 1,001 people on 7 and 8 November.
Eleven percent, accordingly, consider it legitimate that Deutsche Bank offers investments that are linked to bets on food prices.
Many bank customers would also have personal consequences if they learned that their bank was involved in such trades: As a result of the survey, one in two would denounce all investments where money flows into raw material speculation.
43 percent would warn friends about such a bank, 49 percent said they would think about shutting down their account and move to another institution.
21st century house in Vienna
Relocated pavilion
Ingeborg Wiensowski
The story of architecture with peaks, falls and happy endings: The Austrian Pavilion from the World Exposition in Brussels 1958 1958 earned prizes, became a museum in Vienna, remained empty and desolate.
Now it's being reopened as an exhibition house.
When it comes to modern post-war architecture, for bright forms, glass halls, bold expansions and new building materials that are typical of the belief in technological progress, then the Austrian pavilion of architect Karl Schwanzer for the 1958 Brussels World Exchencut is an apt and famous example.
Schwanzer Pavilion received the Grand Prix d'Architecture for its lightweight and lofty steel and glass construction.
The building is still considered a milestone of contemporary architecture.
He became famous for his architect by building the Pavilion of Austria during the next world exhibition.
With its legendary four-cylinder BMW-palace plus as a key to the secondary construction in Munich, it eventually became internationally famous in 1973.
His temporary exhibition pavilion after the World's Fair was placed in the Schweizer Garten near vienna's Südbahnhof (South Station), renovated and opened the Museum of the 20th Century in 1962 - it was named the "House of the 20th Century".
However, the museum building was not suitable, neither spatially nor technically - there were no walls for hanging art exhibits, no satisfactory climate.
Nevertheless, it was used until contemporary art got a new stand in Vienna.
Since 2001, the building has been empty and dilapidated more and more.
Now the architect Adolf Krischanitz has reconstructed the pavilion, it is now called the "House of the 21st Century" and will be used as a Museum of Contemporary Art in the future.
On Tuesday evening, the Belvedere Museum, to which the palace belongs, will open its first exhibition - a happy intention in every respect.
A new beginning was established by Agnes Husslein-Arco, who in 2007 became the new director of the Austrian Belvedere Gallery.
Husslein-Arco, a 19-year-old art historian with a distinguished career, including a figure skater in her youth, later at Sotheby's, the Guggenheim Museum and as founding director of the Museum of Modern Salzburg, pushed vigorously for reconstruction with politicians and conservationists, provided public funds and private sponsorship money, and determined the use.
In addition to contemporary art, the works of sculptor Fritz Wotruba should be exhibited by the foundation of the same name, a café and a bookstore should be built, and an office building must be built to do so.
Strict supervision, low budget.
Krischanitz was then the ideal cast to perform.
Not only did he sensitively reconstruct and expand Joseph Olbrich's Art Tecess buildings in Vienna and win the competition, but because he studied at the Technical University of Vienna with Schwanzer and the pavilion was an "extremely important place" for him to view exhibitions "almost every weekend."
He knew the original project and he also knew the problems of the building, which had already lost its generosity and lightness when it was relocated to Vienna and changed its use.
There were much bigger problems with the current reconstruction: the building was a "catapult for energy," krischanitz says.
The windows profiles of the glass façade were replaced, reinforced insulating glass was used by glass fibers, and the glass roof was replaced by special safety glass.
Cooling bridges-steel beams have been reinforced or replaced, and asbestos-filled ceilings have been rehabistrated.
Two underground floors provided space for new use, a recessed lighting channel between the building and the street provides lighting, a bridge leads to the entrance - almost a new building, but still a lofty Schwanzer Pavilion.
The original entrance door has been preserved, the building is painted in an old anticorrosive reddish-brown color tone.
And the cinema is even exactly the same as it used to be.
And all under the strict supervision of the heritage office and a low budget.
"Often, material had to be found that was good and cheap and also liked the heritage office," krischanitz says, referring to the broken basement floor.
Despite all the pressures, problems and reconstruction, the building remained flexible and airy.
It was difficult, he said, with a pavilion "coming here from Brussels," Krischanitz said recently, a typical "Drop-in-the-City-history."
Such architecture, he says, "always stands in the wrong place" and still wants to "inspire proper self-confidence."
In this case, however, the 21st-century House is not in an inappropriate place, because an urban happy accident has happened: A completely newly designed "City District near the Main Station" with office and residential buildings is being created in the Schweizer Garten ring road.
And perhaps there will be another happy coincidence: The 21st-century house could receive support from another Krischanitz building, as collector Francesca von Habsburg bought the Berliner Temporäre Kunsthalle and, as you can hear, is already negotiating with the city about a neighborhood at a site in the Schweizer Garten.
The track is planning a million-dollar winter crisis package
The track has shed an emergency plan to prevent train outages in the winter.
The number of employees is to be doubled.
That's going to cost millions.
In the fight against winter train failures and delays, Deutsche Bahn is issuing more than 70 million euros this year, according to a newspaper report.
The newspaper "Bild" reported provisionally, citing an internal group plan, that a total of around 300 million euros is expected by 2015.
It is said to achieve better use of trains and the rail network also in extreme weather conditions.
Among other things, it is planned to double the number of internal and external employees to 16,000 people to remove snow on railway facilities and platforms.
The aim is to get rid of the platform by the start of operation and 90 percent for the operation of the necessary switches during four to five hours of snow and ice.
Two months ago, after a high-level meeting with government and industry officials, railway chief Rüdiger Grube warned of train outages and delays this winter.
In the last winter period, the railway had considerable problems in passenger transport, because, among other things, in difficult weather conditions it had a shortage of reserves.
So numerous new regional trains have been waiting for approval by the Federal Railway Authority for years.
In addition, delays in the delivery of ICE trains
For years, the track has also been in the tit-for-tinge of having to have ICE train axles checked more often when a repair was wrecked on an ICE train at Köln Central Station.
Deutsche Bank pays $1 million fine in U.S.
After the uproar over boss Josef Ackermann, there are new troubles in the US: Deutsche Bank has to pay millions in damages there.
As if Deutsche Bank no longer had enough problems at home, the industry giant has yet to be ousted by its past in the US: the Frankfurt institution pays $145 million (106 million euros) in a single compensation procedure to settle disputes over the bankruptcy of five major cooperative banks during the financial crisis.
It is the sale of mortgage certificates.
The financial market regulator, the NCUA, blames a number of large banks for seduancing cooperative banks with false promises to buy financial products; that they may have reduced the risks.
Such papers lost considerable value during the crisis and pulled banks into the abyss.
"We are satisfied that we were able to resolve the issue without having to take the parties to court," said a Deutsche Bank spokesman in New York.
The bank pleads no guilty plea.
This also applies to Citigroup, which has committed to pay out $20.5 million.
NCUA ChairWoman Debbie Matz welcomed the friendliness of both financial institutions.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for cooperative banks in the US and helps with bankruptcies to protect customer claims.
The NCUA is trying to recover billions in damages.
The settlements now completed are the first of their kind.
The regulator also clamped down on other big banks, emoicing JPMorgan Chase, Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs in the summer.
For dubious mortgage certificates, it is so-called Mortgage-backed Securities.
These are based on bank loans.
When america's housing bubble burst in 2007, it became fatal to many financial firms.
In September 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, US-Investmentbank Lehman Brothers changed its mind.
Although the events occurred a few years ago, the banks are now blowing a sharp wind.
Investors and supervisory authorities have filed numerous lawsuits to get redress or to suffer misconduct.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has launched the largest wave of lawsuits.
It reprimins 18 international banks for put two state-owned U.S. real estate financiers, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, at a disadvantage in about $200 billion in mortgage deals.
Deutsche Bank also faces an FHFA lawsuit, with multiple deals totaling about $14.2 billion between 2005 and 2007.
The watchdog demands that the Frankfurt Institute be responsible for "substantial losses ", without, however, giving an exact amount.
Deutsche Bank rejected the claims as unfounded and said it wanted to defend itself.
Warren Buffett joins IBM with $10 billion
Financial guru Buffett invests heavily in IBM's IT business.
Since March, it has bought more than $10 billion worth of stock.
Warren Buffett, a major US investor, has always said that he will not invest in IT and computers because the long-term development of companies will be difficult to predict.
But now he has read IBM's business reports and changed his mind about investing in the industry.
He had to understand much earlier that IBM primarily offers services and prosate computer systems for it-separating other businesses.
Warren Buffett's investment is seen in the financial world as knighthood.
As a result, IBM's mother rock IS can now be called "Sir IBM".
Buffett revealed on US economic radio station CNBC that he had bought $10.7 billion worth of IBM stock since March.
His Investmentholding Berkshire Hathaway became one of IBM's largest shareholders with a 5.5 percent stake.
Buffett said ibm didn't know anything about his involvement.
He praised management, which even sought proper returns during the economic crisis.
"You've done a great job," Buffett said of the strategy.
IBM has long been betting on lucrative IT services such as computing centers.
The 100-year-old computer pioneer also offers software and consulting, as well as powerful PCs for businesses.
Buffett has rather avoided technology companies to this day.
It claims to invest only in undertakings whose activities they also understand.
Instead, Buffett reached for freight railroads, lubricant manufacturers, or machine products.
In addition to about 80 subsidiaries, his Holding Berkshire Hathaway also owns shares in a number of large-scale subsidiaries such as Coca-Cola and Munich Re, formerly Münchener Rück.
The 81-year-old took over the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway in the 1960s and made it one of the most valuable businesses in the world with wise investments.
Yet his way of life is modest.
He is therefore a cult figure for many investors around the world.
His almost infallible sense of making money earned him the nickname "Orakel of Omaha (Miracle of Omaha".
When Buffett's investment became known, IBM's stock rose 1 percent before the stock market began.
"Big Blue," as IBM is also called, has a total stock market value of more than $220 billion and is considered the world's most valuable technology company along with Apple and Microsoft.
But at Microsoft, so much Buffett wouldn't want to start.
Founder Bill Gates is said to be a close friend of his.
The threat is palpable
After the discovery of "Cells in Zwickau", turkish media doubt the German rule of law.
The newspaper even speaks of a "bloody ideology" that is now coming back to life.
The murders of eight small businessmen of Turkish origin and one Greek between 2000 and 2006 had a right-wing extremist background.
Fear and concern have been responded to in Turkey and within the German-Turkish population in Germany.
For for many German Turks, this brings back a specter that has long been considered dead: Since the arson attacks in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, there has been no comparable violence to the right-wing extremist background.
Yet there was never any doubt that there was xenophobia in Germany.
But the discovered right-wing extremist network reveals a scale whose dimensions can no longer be seen.
"Is bloody ideology coming back to life?" was the headline of the turkish newspaper's "Haberturk" online edition.
The "Sabah" newspaper, on the other hand, emphasizes that one of the perpetrators was supposed to be a secret police agent of the Constitutional Protection Unit, and they fear that the German authorities could also be involved in a right-wing radical swamp.
The Turkish community reacted deliberately in Germany: It recalled the victims of racist violence at the weekend with a demonstration in silence outside the Brandenburg Gate.
Only two weeks ago, the Turkish community in Berlin, together with German and Turkish politicians, commemorated the 50th anniversary of the German-Turkish recruitment agreement.
In cheerful colors, a life together was staged - as a history of success.
Several Turkish media outlets are slap in the air: "Germany's 50th Birthday Gift" is the headline of an article on the Turkish internet platform "Haber X", which reports on the background to the murderous series.
The edition of the "Hürriyet" for Germany cannot be taken for nothing to do with this thought connection.
"It's starting to smell," reads the headline of a column by Ahmet Külahci.
In it, he points out that people who paid taxes and made an important contribution to Germany's reconstruction were murdered.
The police's progress and its late success in the search are most critically discussed in German internet forums.
Why didn't the German authorities think much earlier to search for suspects in right-wing extremist circles, the authors wonder.
Thus, many show off, at least rhetorically, to use drastic means: "If action continues so superficially here, immigrants will have no choice but to defend and armedly."
"That's probably the best self-defense."
"Internal peace in Germany depends very strongly on the quality of clarification and proportionality of the punishment of the entire network ", writes "Selen".
What it means if internal peace in Germany is threatened is explained by the assassinations in Mölln and Solingen in the 1990s.
The photograph of the burnt-out site in Solingen is deeply engraved in the memory of germans and Turks.
For no other event has shown the Turks living here more clearly that there is a tangible threat to the Germans, that mistrust and distance can result in right-wing violence.
But the assassinations have made a sense of reciprocity more noticeable on the Part of the Turks.
Don't repeat past mistakes
At the time, the Turkish press was mainly criticized for the failure of German politics after the assassinations: Helmut Kohl refused to visit those in Mölln who survived.
After the arson attack in Solingen, he sent a telegram of condolence to the Turkish State President, but he was taken over by his Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel at a memorial service in Köln - Kinkel calculated in his speech what fees the Turks were handing over.
It's as if a person's value is measured by the height of their taxes.
The current Turkish media coverage once again shows how deep the distrust of many German Turks in the state-law structure is.
In addition to efforts to clarify extensively and re-evaluate right-wing extreme terrorism in Germany, this time it requires open words.
Scandalous bank on Lake Zurich
Europe's most good bank is not based in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
UBS suffered near bankruptcy during the financial crisis and has been swinging from one crisis to the next ever since.
Now a German is supposed to straighten it out.
That's certainly not what Axel Weber thought.
After his noisy departure from the federal bank's management, it became known in July that he would take on an almost equally spectacular new job in 2013: president of the board of directors of swiss big bank UBS - an unexpected and lucrative career move.
Axel Weber enjoyed publicly, praising Switzerland for its beauty and UBS for its newly acquired solidity, and made friendly comments to future colleagues.
"Die UBS has achieved a turnaround".
"I look forward to working with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel".
But back in September, it was clear that things were going to be very different.
A UBS dealer in London bypassed all of the bank's security systems and squandered around 1.7 billion euros.
UBS chief executive Oswald Grübel, not only a respected banker in Switzerland, had to leave.
The president of UBS's board has also been scalded ever since - and everyone is asking: When will Axel Weber finally come?
It has become known that Weber has been allowed to advise the bank since February 2012.
And he will take over the chairmanship of the board in May - not until 2013, as the bank announced on Tuesday.
It's going to be tough for Axel Weber.
He is not a banker, but rather an economics professor and an emissions banker, and he would certainly need time to work on it.
Suddenly, he takes responsibility for the bank's strategy, which just once again proved that it deserves the title of "Bank of The Greatest Scandals in Europe"
For UBS is huge - until recently it was the world's largest wealth manager - and has been slouching from scandal to scandal for years.
Nothing, it seems, will be spared by a proud Swiss bank.
It started during the financial crisis.
Until 2007, UBS enjoyed an excellent reputation.
The image of a silent and solid but also sly asset manager combines with ambitious goals: She also wanted to mean something in investment banking.
So UBS managed 2007, on the one hand, with $1.6 trillion more money from wealthy clients than any other bank in the world.
On the other hand, as an investment bank, it has moved to the league of the world's largest banks
That made an impression.
Hans Geiger, a former banker and later longtime banking professor in Zurich, says: "I always cited UBS as a model for a good bank at the time."
"From today's point of view, one wonders, "How could I have been so wrong?"
He was very wrong.
In 2007, it became clear for the first time that something at UBS had gone wrong.
Surprisingly, in the middle of the year, chief executive Peter Wuffli, who was still considered a highly intelligent and brilliant banker, resigned.
A few months later, it was clear why he had left.
The bank's investment division squandered Subprime's papers and had to write off billions.
To make it stand, UBS announced a capital increase of 13 billion francs.
But it did find investors, but one over which it would have recently turned its nose up: an opaque Asian state fund from Singapore and an Arab state fund that was so discreet that one could not even know its name.
But that was just the first impact.
Things got worse in April 2008.
The bank had to admit new billions in losses, the chairman of the board, Marcel Ospel, the second-highest-paid board in Switzerland, resigned in 2006.
Disaster ensued in October 2008: UBS was in a state-sponsored financial crisis due to its erroneous investments.
Nationalbank bought tens of billions of problematic securities from UBS, the Swiss Confederation gave six billion francs on mandatory convertible bonds for which it could become a co-owner of the bank.
The whole of Switzerland has been shaken - because it has noticed how dramatic it is for a small country to have such large banks on its territory.
After all, the balance sheet total of UBS 2007 was more than five times greater than that of switzerland's economy (see figure).
"We couldn't save UBS one more time," says banking expert Geiger.
The first disaster is followed by the second.
Months later, UBS capitulated to a tax dispute with America and showed a willingness to release data from wealthy customers who, if possible, cut taxes with the help of banks.
In addition, it agreed to pay $780 million to recover unauthorized profits from those deals, including a penalty surchar down.
In doing so, UBS has more or less openly admitted to helping to cut taxes.
At the same time, she lost what has always been her capital in the competition for wealthy clients: a halo of discretion.
After this scandal, Swiss banking secrecy was no longer what it had been.
This was followed by the resignation of the Chief Executive Officer and the President of the Board of Directors.
And an exodus of customers' money.
Thus, within a few months, the bank lost its credibility in both central business areas: investment banking due to bad speculation and wealth management to help reduce tax.
And just when things calmed down a bit, just when UBS was thought to have recovered, here comes this unfortunate trade anastasis: A single dealer wasted 1.7 billion euros before the bank noticed something was wrong.
And it's clear: risk management in investment banking is probably still not working out.
"The Adoboli case has probably found that risk control has changed too little," says Martin Janssen, an economist and Finanz professor of finance at Zürich University's Banking Institute.
The cfo of a large German bank is also certain: "The problem with UBS is that it cannot handle risk control."
After all, it was precisely the idea of prudence that Swiss bankers had taken a long time ago to become the watchmen of the world's great assets: no too great risks, but security for money - on this side, too, the alpine republic's world collapsed again.
Swiss bank vaults have become a symbol for unshakable reliability like Lindt and Sprüngli for particularly high-quality chocolate.
UBS's Zurich headquarters is still suited to the cliché of a good Swiss private bank - it's just a little bigger.
The location is classic.
The bank is headquartered in Zurich's Bahnhofstraße, which leads directly to Lake Zurich, framed by the snowy peaks of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are beautiful, the rentals of shops are among the highest in Europe.
Jewelry stores like Tiffany's can be found among Swiss traditional shops such as Sprüngli Patisserie.
Swiss banks have been based here for centuries: from Nationalbank to Palast der Credit Suisse to elite private banks like Julius Bär.
The UBS reception hall is accessed through a heavy revolving door.
Inside are marble-panelled walls, in front of them stand massive leather armchairs, next to the bank logo a large rudder to the "safe".
UBS knows what the customer is looking for here: security.
But this idea of Swiss banks, both Swiss big banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, has sometimes been suppressed or betrayed, as the head of a small Swiss private bank discovers.
He would rather not read his name in the newspapers, eventually closing, like all Swiss bankers, also doing business with both big banks.
UBS may have expanded too much, he finds - especially in investment banking, where the Anglo-Saxons have expanded.
I don't think the Swiss have anything else to say about it.
"And if they had, they had long since adapted to the Anglo-Saxon ways."
Indeed, it was Anglo-Saxon investment banking that changed UBS, making it high profits at first, and then disaster: No European financial institution had lost as much money in the jungle around Subprime as Schweizer Großbank.
On October 15, 2008, the disaster was obvious.
"On Wednesday, the ruling coalition of a small country of seven million decided on the largest rescue operation in the history of its nation," writes author Lukas Hässig in his book "Der UBS-Crash."
Up to 68 billion francs, or about 45 billion euros, were approved by politicians to save a large bank from bankruptcy.
How could this have happened?
If you talk to Swiss bankers, they see a problem especially in the size of UBS.
In June 1998, two of switzerland's three large banks merged into a massive group.
A bank was created that was already too big for little Switzerland during the merger - and continued to grow.
In doing so, it helped that UBS's two different banking predecessors complemented each other: one rich but sleepy bank in Zurich with a focus on wealth management, and a poorer but more internationally involved bank.
Suddenly, internationalized investment bankers came to a lot of money with which they could spin a lot of roulette.
Two names are associated with this rise of UBS: Peter Wuffli, head of UBS from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, then chairman of the board.
"I always thought Wuffli and Ospel were the team of the future," says banking expert Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the highly intelligent, modest one who knows a lot about models and statistics, and Ospel, a man who's been managing feelings around his stomach, who's worked his way up from banking science."
But Ospel said he relied on Wuffli towards the end.
And Wuffli probably made a decisive mistake in the end: "He probably thought his models were a reality," says Geiger.
"This is a tragic case."
Tragic, perhaps.
What is clear is: Pride preceded the fall.
UBS employees clearly remember the executive meetings at which Wuffli, the group's chief executive, repeated the same motto over and over again: Bring Goldman Sachs down from the throne.
The American bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
It featured "League Tables," a waiting list that documents the success of banks of the time.
In it, UBS tried to place at the very top.
She's already succeeded a few paces.
In foreign exchange and stock trading, she participated in the game at the very top.
But the corporate advisers in charge emphasize one weakness: In international interest-rate trade, in the "Fixed Income" bankers' speech, there is probably a big gap behind the largest banks.
UBS probably has gaps in U.S. mortgage products.
To close the gap, UBS decided to go on an adventure that almost cost it its existence.
Hungry for growth, both the bank itself and its risk-hedge fund have invested in Subprime's US investments.
It developed into a massive machine that repackathed securities into US mortgage loans and passed on - while also keeping the risks.
Also, when other banks were long looking for a way out.
"Back in the summer of 2007, when the real estate market was on fire, UBS was buying there," says geiger, a banking expert.
How great is the euphemism, so deep fall.
One manager after another had to leave when the attempts to clean up were more difficult than thought.
Positions at UBS have become a eject seat and are still swinging to this day.
Whoever runs the big bank now has an almost unmanageable job.
They need to find a strategy for a bank that has disappeared from all the nearby business models.
Geiger, a banking expert, already has an idea: an end to investment banking, a concentration on wealth management, a return to Swiss roots.
The bank doesn't want to go that far (yet).
But investment banking is about to d off the market, so much is now clear.
Next Thursday, the bank's new boss, Sergio Ermotti, wants to present his future strategy to the world.
The 51-year-old Swiss Italian was seen as merely a transitional solution when the bank surprisingly broke up with predecessor Grübel.
In the meantime, he has established himself: He is to run UBS's business for a long time, the Zurich bank said on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to bring the investment bank back to its state in the mid-1990s.
3,500 jobs will be cut.
That's not going to be enough.
UBS needs a vision.
Who's she?
What does he want to make money with?
These are the questions axel weber is already asking.
Publicly, however, he says only that he and his wife will first find an apartment in Zurich.
Next year.
Fear of recession in Europe weighs on the US stock market.
The impending recession in Europe has deprived American investors of the courage to start the week.
The change of government in Athens and Rome did not achieve the intended strike effect.

Italian and Greek glass in the past week was still considered half full, not half empty - but now problems have come to the fore again, said Mark Luschini of Janney Montgomery Scott.
In particular, financial values were on the ticket of the sale.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 0.6 percent to close trading at 12,078 points.
During trading, the market barometer was between 12,027 and 12,170 points.

Industry in 17 countries using the euro has significantly reduced its production and prepared to end the boom.
Companies produced two percent less in September than in the previous month, eurostat reported.
This has sceptical investors in the US. "We're not an island, we're addicts," said Steve Goldman of Goldman Management.
Europe may not recover from recession so quickly, and there are other signs of weakness in banks.
Investment legend Warren Buffett only confirmed this outlook: He said in a CNBC-interview that it might not yet be clear whether Europe is strong enough to do everything it can to end the crisis.
That is probably why, from his point of view, it is too early to invest in European government loans or banks.
Instead, Buffett abandoned a decades-old principle and entered the American tech industry.
His investment of more than $10 billion in IBM boosted the traditional group's share price, leaving it to list nearly 1 percent higher against the trend in trading.

Intelligent crows spread in cities
In many places, field ravens are considered "problem birds": However, these highly intelligent animals can no longer be expelled from cities, experts say.
Some like them, others would like to get rid of them quite quickly: Crows have been part of the city's image for centuries, yet in some municipalities complaints from residents about dirt and noise caused by animals are piling up.
At the same time, there is still no means in sight against "problem birds".
Field ravens may no longer be expeled from cities, experts said at the first crow symposium in Leer, East African.
There, experts from all over the Federal Territory consulted on possible exits.
Looking for alternatives in cities
Meanwhile, conservationists also derived urban problems from an exodus of specially protected field ravens: The use of chemistry in agriculture is probably increasingly destroying traditional areas for life.
Persecution, growing development and felling of typical trees to nest birds make life difficult.
Crows are protected.
Large colonies with more than 600 nesting pairs are in Soest, Westphalia, in the northwest, among others in Jever, Diepholz and Achim near Bremen and in Leer.
There, a 2005 controversial project of mass killing of crows in a rural district generated negative headlines.
Critics have called the capture of animals into bird traps and the killing of sticks particularly brutal.
"Normal exorcism, scare, brings nothing," said urban planner and landscaper Werner Klöver of Leer.
Removing nests by spraying water or felling trees often has undesirable consequences, said environmental expert Manfred Kaiser of Lahr in Baden-Württemberg.
"Animals recess, large colonies split and divide into other places".
Timidation is conceivable only as an exception for hospitals, retirement homes or schools.
"We have to live with them, we can't get them out."
Without the surrounding territory, the problem of cities cannot be solved, was the opinion of Mayor Wolfgang Kellner of Leer.
Cobivable is the combination of exhoting animals from sensitive residential areas and attracting them to settle in other places.
"Information boards instead of chainsaws" promoted by psychologist and ethnoologist Uta Maria Jürgens, on the other hand, because of the completely different treatment of animals: "One pimpling in the face can best withstand self-confidence in the end."
Ms. Jürgens co-founded the Schleswig-Holstein Ascherberg Nature Trail, on which information boards provide lessons about the life of a highly intelligent field raven.
In the meantime, the project is said to have already been accepted by tourists.
Also, on the criticism of the noise caused by birds, Ms. Jürgens had her own opinion: "This is about every volume of communication, they have a lot to say to each other."
The intelligence and skill of animals are legendary: Field ravens not only use tools to achieve a treat, but even make their tool as an aid.
Researchers from the University of Cambridge recently tested the behavior on four field ravens, how far the intelligence of birds reaches.
In one experiment, the birds quickly learned that stones must cause the structure to collapse in order to reach the moth larva.
Without much training, they knew what size and shape the stone had to have to cause the platform to collapse.
In the second attempt, the cunning crows then had to solve a more difficult problem.
In a vertically built cylinder, the researchers placed a small container with a moth larva.
With their beak, the birds could not reach their prey.
But the researchers put pieces of wire in there.
Of these, all four animals shaped a hook, with the help of which she used a rod to hunt a container for a handle from a pipe.
Three of the four field ravens even managed to do so with a stopper.
Cristiano Ronaldo shoots Portugal for the 2012 European Championship
Bosnians and Turks' hopes for the cup have not been raised.
The favorites Portugal, Croatia, the Czech Republic and Ireland participate in the 2012 European Championships.
Portugal, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland won the last tickets to the 2012 European Championships in Poland and Ukraine in play-off matches.
Led by two-time superstar Cristiano Ronaldo (8th, 53rd), Portugal defeated Bosnia-Herzegovina 6-2 (2-1) to make their fifth consecutive appearance at the European Championships after a 0-0 result in the first match.
The Czechs were satisfied with a 1-0 (0-0) result in the play-off rematch with the underdog Montenegro, when the first match was already a clear thing.
Croatia also scored in a 0-0 win against Turkey, while Ireland won 1-1 (1-0) against Estonia.
Nani (24th), Helder Postiga (72nd, 82nd) and Miguel Veloso (80th) scored more goals for Portugal.
Former Wolfsburg bundesliga professional Zvjezdan Misimovic converted a penalty (41st) and captain Emir Spahic (65th) twice reduced for Bosnia.
Sena Lulic received a yellow-and-red card (54th).
Bosnia have already failed in their 2010 World Cup play-offs in South Africa with Portugal.
Portugal made a bespoke start at the Estadio da Luz in Lisbon.
Ronaldo soon took the lead by hanging a free-kick from about 30 metres into the net.
A good quarter of an hour later, Nani showed his qualities in long-range shooting, adjusting his shot from 25 yards to make it 2-0.
The Bosnians, who did not play in the first half hour, had their first clear chance in goalkeeper Edin Dzeze.
The former Wolfsburg player from England at the top of the table put the ball at the bottom of the crossbar with his header, but the ball did not cross the goal line (33rd).
Jiracek scores for The Czech Republic
Finally, referee Wolfgang Stark of Ergolding was at the center.
After a tackle on Helder Postig in Bosnian penalty area, Stark opted for Schwalbe and awarded the Portuguese a yellow card. (36.).
On the other side, Stark made a questionable penalty kick after Fabio Coentraa's action, which Misimovic confidently converted.
But after the break, the 2004 European runner-up cleared things up with four hits.
For the Czech Republic, Petr Jiracek also ended the last doubts in the 81st minute.
With that, the 1976 European champion leaves for the fifth time in a row at the European Championships.
However, coach Michal Bilk's team with Bundesliga legionnaires Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomáš Pekhart (1st FC Nuremberg) were also lucky and had to overcome a terrible second at the initial stage.
Goalkeeper Petr Cech prevented a possible own goal from Tomas Sivok (9th) at the last moment.
Montenegro had its best options when duo Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic were in action.
Damjanovic fired in the 40th minute from the penalty area just past Cech's goal.
After the break, the crossbar had to save the place of the already knocked-down goalkeeper of the World Class Czechs, again reducing the striker FC Seoul (50th).
The goal made things clear shortly before the end.
Turkey missed the football miracle of Zagreb at that moment.
Four days after the 0-3 in Istanbul, the Turks did not go 0-0 up in Zagreb.
While national coach Guus Hiddink is almost certain to va as much as he has to va as a third-place finisher at the 2002 World Cup, the Croats can rejoice in their fourth appearance in the final round of the European Championship.
In front of 31,000 spectators at Maksimir Stadium, the Turks should have an almost fairytale start.
Selcuk Inan hit only the bar with a long-range shot in the seventh minute, and striker Kazim could not hang the rebound in goal.
After this terrible second, Croatia took control to an increasing extent.
Also, after the break, the Croats did not get a goal.
In addition to VfL Wolfsburg's Mario Mandzukic, who released Dortmund's Ivan Perisic in the 62nd minute, Bundesliga legionnaires Danijel Pranjic (Bayern Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht Frankfurt) were in action.
Trapattoni goes to the European Championships
In Dublin, the Irish celebrated their first European Championship appearance since 1988 in Germany.
Stephen Ward put coach Giovanni Trapattoni's team, who had already taken the lead in the 32nd minute with a 4-0 win in the first game.
Konstantin Vassilev (57th) equalized for the guests.
Ireland set the pace from the outset, but had to wait until the 23rd minute before Robbie Keane of the Los Angeles Galaxy had his first good chance.
It was only at the last minute that the Estonian defence prevented a possible leading goal.
But in the 32nd minute it was quite a long way off.
After a failed defense by goaltender Pavel Lundak, Ward was in position to push the ball over the line to make it 1-0.

SAP wants to double the number of its employees in China.
SAP, Europe's largest software maker, is investing billions in China in the coming years and wants to nearly double its workforce in the country.

"We will create more research and development facilities and employ the relevant staff," acting chief Bill McDermott announced at a customer fair in Beijing.
The population is now expected to grow from the current 2500 employees to 4500.
The number of branches of the world's number one software for businesses will double from five to ten or eleven.

Personal carnage
Peter Englund's emotionally powerful new book, Beauty and the Sorrow: An Intimate History of the First World War, begins with a list of performers so long that you get dizzy.
One piece of advice on how to act at that point: Carefully rip this page out and bookmark it.
You will get to know all the people very well in Mr. Englund's novel narrative, and this list will serve as a navigation - as a kind of beacon - at moments when, like the men and women in the story, you will feel confused and lost in different situations.
Mr. Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new deputy at the Swedish Academy, which awards the Nobel Prize in Literature.
The book we are talking about here is very unusual - the author himself describes it, quite aptly, as "antihistorical work".
It contains several well-known names, important treaties or famous battles, on the contrary, it almost lacks ambassadors, energetic journalists and debates about tactics and equipment.
It's not so much a book about what happened, the author explains, but rather a "book about what it was like." It deals mainly with "feelings, impressions, experiences and moods".
"Beauty and Sorrow" combines the wartime experiences of 20 more or less dozen men and women, on both sides of the barricade, from students and botanists to climbers, doctors, ambulance drivers and officials.
Some of these people become heroes.
Others become prisoners of war, lose limbs, go mad or die.
Their lives inger like the flames of candles lit in a church - new ones are added to the tangle of fates, while others are extinguished.
Mr. Englund's book is different from classic historical novels.
It corrects the notion that World War I was all about gruesome trench battles on the Western Front.
"Beauty and Sorrow" skillfully explores other places where war dramas took place: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
In this book, the soldiers solve problems with the fact that bee nests fall on them, they have to spend Christmas in the shadow of the pyramids, or they face the presence of tse-tse flies.
It's been a very moving read almost from the start.
War consumes people's lives like a natural disaster, like Hurricane Katrina smelling of gunpowder.
When gunfire starts coming in the distance and you're a woman who's at home with her kids, do you run or stay?
Who's coming, actually?
Almost no one understands what is happening, not even why the whole war was started.
"The vacuum created by the lack of facts," Mr. Englund noted, "was filled with conjectures, conjectures, hopes, fears, prejudices, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares, and rumors."
"Beauty and Sorrow" follows the stories of individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young sailor serving in the German fleet.
Their stories are all taken from biographies, letters and other already published materials.
Descriptions of their lives may sound both frightening and engaging, but thanks to the inclusion of small moments and details, they are absolutely vivid and believable.
Many of them deal with hardship and coping with it.
In the story of a German student, the author says, "Substitutes, substitutes everywhere."
"Coffee substitute, aluminum imitation, rubber imitation, paper bandages, wooden buttons."
It goes further and describes food substitutes in Germany.
It refers to 'meat made from pressed rice cooked in mutton fat (and supplemented with a false bone of wood), tobacco from dried grass and dried potato peels, shoes with wooden soles'.
It mentions that there were '837 registered meat substitutes in sausage production and 511 registered coffee substitutes'.
Some stories are about honor and bravery.
One American finds inner impulses for savagery and brutality, after which he declares of war: "In the end, you will understand that this is human nature. Not sit in comfy chairs with a cigarette and a whiskey, an evening paper, or a good book, pretending that this mask of yours represents civilization and that there is no barbarian hiding behind that starchy self."
On the contrary, a British soldier realizes that he is most likely to die soon, and no one will even notice, let alone grieve.
"When one finally accepts that he is sacrificing himself, he would at least expect it to happen in front of a grateful audience," he writes.
Instead, he feels like a "convict who is secretly hanged."
Other comments concern the departure of old Europe and the onset of new horrors.
"The conflict was increasingly becoming an economic competition and a competitive struggle," Mr. Englund writes, "a war between factories."
He captured what he calls "a new kind of beast of the coming century: an emerious and ideologically sworn mass murderer in a tailored dress who carries out his bloodshed without getting up from the table."
People behave completely unexpectedly, eriity alternates with heroism.
Mr. Englund also describes soldiers who deliberately tried to catch a venereal disease from prostitutes to avoid serving at the front.
"The most progish example of this behavior was the trafficking of gonococcus pus, which soldiers bought and rubbed on their genitals in the hope of ending up in the hospital," he writes.
"The most desperate ones were also shoring it in their eyes, which often blinded them for the rest of their lives."
In this swedish translation by Peter Graves, Mr. Englund's prose is brisk but not flashy, which fits perfectly with his human theme.
In dozens of small outputs, it captures the way in which war "unleashed utterly unchited forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred."
People are starting to wonder why their leaders are making them fight.
The best books about World War I mostly worked with hints, such as Paul Fussell's "World War I and Modern Memories" or novels like Erich Maria Remarque's "On the Western Front."
Mr. Englund prefers an unconventional concept.
His book has the most crushing endings unparalleled in popular educational literature.
But I won't tell you.
However, you will feel as if suddenly the author jumped out of the book, ripped the page from your list of heroes from your hand and set it on fire.
After a previous mistake, this time for a minute a precisely planned raid
Hundreds of police officers, some wearing helmets used in street riots, took part.
The night from Monday to Tuesday was chosen because Zuccotti Park should be almost empty by then.
No one knew about the operation except a few high-ranking officers. Others were first told it was an exercise.
Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly was at the forefront of the action, highlighting how many problems the police department had to face in the operation.
There have been no repeats of recent weeks, when, for example, pepper sprays were used against protesters, violating departmental rules and spilling over into squatters.
Therefore, the police operation to clear Zuccotti Park from the demonstrators was only launched after two weeks of careful planning and exercise.
Leaders were inspired by operations in other cities.
A massive emergency behavior exercise took place in randalls island, which was in preparation for an event in Zuccotti Park.
Leaders have stepped up so-called riot control training - counterterrorism measures involving the rapid movement of large numbers of police officers - targeting the lower Manhattan 600.
The last part of the training took place Monday night on the Manhattan side of the East River.
The orders to move to the park came literally "at the last minute", said someone to whom the event was originally explained only as an "exercise".
"I know a few police officers who were also called into this operation, and they certainly didn't get told that they were going to Zuccotti Park," said the person, who spoke only on condition of anonymity.
"Only the highest ranking members of the department knew that we were going to Zuccotti Park."
One reason for secrecy was a lesson the city had already learned once.
On October 14, city officials planned to clean up the park, but then backed away from the plan because as soon as the protesters heard about it, hundreds flocked to the park before the operation began.
Tuesday's event was attended by police officers from various units, including task forces from all over the area - dozens of police officers who are commonly used to strengthen neighborhoods with higher crime rates.
Mr Kelly explained that a large number of people come and go to the park during the day, so one hour at night was the perfect time to start the event.
"It was advisable to do so at a time when there would be as few people as possible in the park," he said.
Before the troops set off, emergency trucks with arched lamps and amplions lined up on the border of Pike Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near manhattan bridge.
The lights and the recorded message roaring from the amplions scared many of the protesters.
When members of the riot police entered the park in their blue windbreakers, many protesters packed their bags and left.
Police say she didn't touch a single tent until 1:45 a.m., giving protesters time to pack their bags.
Other teams of police officers were seen gathering at the edge of the park to break in if any arrests were needed.
Reporters were forced to leave the park.
Paul J. Browne, the police department's chief spokesman, said it was for their safety.
However, many journalists believe that the police wanted to prevent them from seeing her troops in action, and that some officers were rude to them.
Mr Browne claimed that television cars on Church Street, along the park's western boundary, could film without any problems.
Police were advancing in a westerly direction, weaving through a thick intertwined of protesters' personal belongings, including luggage and plastic bags full of clothing. Behind them came teams from the sanitation department, who immediately raked in everything left in the park.
Some protesters who refused to move were dragged out of the park. Documenting image materials appeared shortly afterwards on the Internet.
The most arduous group of protesters took refuge near the kitchen in their campsite, which lay near the center of the park.
Some set up a roadblock and the police launched their methodical arrests.
About 10 people in the center of the campsite chained themselves to each other.
And two people tied themselves to a tree, Mr. Kelly said.
Emergency services were called in to cut the locks.
There were no arrests in the park until 3:30 a.m., Mr. Kelly said.
The operation was completed about 75 minutes later, police said.
Mr Browne said about 142 people were detained in the park.
Most of the arrests were made because of "the organization of riots and resisting arrest," he explained.
The highest-ranking police officer at the scene was Joseph J. Esposito, chief of the police department, the highest-ranking uniformed officer in the department.
Phil T. Pulaski, the department's chief of detectives, also personally participated in the operation.
Mr. Kelly was present, but "he was not involved in the management of the operation," Mr. Browne said.
A second group of police officers waited along the east side of Broadway, between Liberty Street and Cedar Street, in case it needed to be called in.
Roadblocks were erected on Cortlandt Street, a block north of the park, and Pine Street, a block south of the park.
From these places, the police developed a protective belt further from Zuccotti Park.
At one point, police officers, many of whom were equipped with shields, were seen pushing people further beyond that line.
There were about 28 people on the northern border.
The wildest events of the night took place south of the park.
Around 5 a.m., a protester south of Pine Street was seen jumping on the hood of a police car, and several others were air-ousting from the tires of a police van.
At one point, a piece of plywood flew out of the crowd.
At the end of the operation, one police officer and one protester were hospitalized.
Aid workers' union to sue city over layoffs
Unions representing hundreds of school aid workers who lost their jobs last month plan to sue the city on Wednesday. They argue that redundancies were not necessary and, moreover, discrimination because of the disproportionate impact on schools attended by poor students.
The lawsuit is likely to be the last option left for district council 37 unions in their efforts to overturn the dismissal decision.
On October 7, six hundred and seventy-two school assistants, parent coordinators, and other employees, who were among the city's lowest-paid employees, lost their jobs. Their fired union leaders described it as retaliation against the city for not allowing it access to a labor-managed health care fund last spring that the city wanted to plug a hole in its budget.
City officials categorically denied the accusation.
At a city council meeting last month, Education Secretary Dennis M. Walcott said the layoffs were part of a budget approved in June.
One of the board members immediately countered that there was no specific talk in the budget of the dismissal of the auxiliary workers.
District Council 37 officials said they had already filed the necessary documents and warned the Department of Education that they would sue. On Wednesday, they will hold a press conference to formally announce the lawsuit in Manhattan Supreme Court.
The defendants in the trial will be Mr. Walcott and the Department of Education, while the plaintiffs will be eight laid-off workers, all of whom are African-American or Hispanic, as well as most of the other assistants who lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokeswoman for the city's legal department, said the city has not yet seen the lawsuit and will not comment on the individual charges.
According to a draft complaint obtained by the New York Times, the union focused on the number of redundant in poor parts of the city, trying to support their claims of wrongdoing. They take the view that poor schools have lost more assistants because they have long been denied sufficient funding.
They point out that while schools in the Staten Island section were not laid off at all and in the Upper East Side only minimally, in Brooklyn, district 23 in Brownsville, 17 school assistants lost their jobs, and 46 assistants were laid off in Districts 8 and 9 in the South Bronx.
He points out that five out of eight assistants lost their jobs at Public School 36 in Harlem, even though it is a school where 68 percent of students live in poverty. The suit says, "This is not a neighborhood full of wealthy parents who can raise funds to make up for the budget deficit."
Public School 36's budget was cut 3.26 percent this year, and the school also lost money when the city changed the way bonus funds were calculated for every poor student enrolled.
Among other things, the union argues that high school principals may have been confused by the way in which a document was written authorising the dismissal of parental coordinators.
In the document, the word "excess" was used to describe the action, i.e. to cancel the position, although this word is much more often used to describe the transfer of a teacher from the school's payroll to a database of available workers whose wages are paid by the central authority.
"Sixty-six parent coordinators have been dismissed," the draft complaint states, "and not just moved to the database as available staff."
Mission over, Congress ready to accept agreement on the situation in Libya
Finally, congressional Republicans and Democrats seem to agree on something related to the uprising in Libya.
But before that happened, the revolution had to succeed, long-reigning dictator Muammar Gaddafi had to be captured and killed, and the participation of United States troops ended.
On Tuesday, the Senate Committee on International Relations will decide on a statement supported by President John Kerry (Mass.) along with Senators John McCain (Ariz.) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Conn.), in which it should congratulate Libyans on their successful insurgency and thank American troops for their "bravery."
"With this statement, we want to acknowledge the courage of the people of Libya who have begun rebuilding their country," Kerry said.
"Both sides of the political spectrum would like to express their support for their democratic efforts."
These sentences may seem innocent, but no debate on Libya has been easy until now.
Over the summer, lawmakers from both parties argued with each other and the White House over the wording of a series of statements to approve or reject the United States' military role in nato's mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain introduced a resolution authoring the limited use of U.S. forces in Libya.
The bill was rejected in the House because of differences of opinion between the two political parties, so it was never even voted on in the Senate.
But on the same day that the bill was rejected in the House, the Chamber also rejected a measure that would have stopped funding U.S. operations in Libya.
This literally put the US mission in Libya in legislative purgatory - Congress criticized the way President Obama is running the mission, but it clearly didn't irritate its members enough to stop supporting him in his actions.
Congressional hesitation was eventually overtaken by other events.
The rebels took Tripoli in August and Gaddafi was killed on October 20.
Nato's mission officially ended on October 31.
Now the Senate may be ready to act.
In a statement, the International Relations Commission "congratulates the people of Libya for their immeasurable courage and admirable tenacity in their efforts to liberate their people" and "commends the men and women of the United States armed forces and their allies who participated in the operation to protect the Libyan people for their extraordinary bravery and professionalism."
The statement also "reaffirms the national interest of the United States in a successful and irreversible transition to democracy in Libya."
Will the new proposal win the full support of the Commission on International Relations, or will the legislators be split in two again, as was the case when the June proposal was approved?
The latest version was opposed by Sen. Richard G. Lugar (Ind.), the Republican Party's general counsel on the committee.
Lugar's spokesman said Monday that he had not yet seen the final version of the new proposal.
The House will vote this week on a Constitutional Amendment that would require a balanced budget, which should be the top legislative priority for almost every Republican and Democrat in Congress.
The measure, pushed by Bob Goodlatte (Va.), will be the First Amendment to the Constitution on a budget or other issue that will be voted on by the entire House or Senate.
So far, despite considerable efforts, other legislators have not yet managed to push their proposals all the way to the vote itself.
Goodlatte's proposal is just one of 68 constitutional amendments introduced in Congress that touched on a wide range of different issues.
Some of them were the same - the same proposal put forward by both the House and Senate - and others are minor changes to others.
In the House of Representatives, there are at least 15 versions of the balanced budget amendment and another handful that would like to "regulate federal spending."
While some of the proposals are identical, their proponents - especially budding Republicans who want to improve their reputations - can boast of their "authorship."
The budget regulation decree, which was passed in August, required both the House and Senate to vote on the balanced budget amendment.
In March, 58 senators voted in favor of a non-binding declaration in support of such an amendment.
In addition to the budget, several members want to discuss limiting the number of terms in which members of Congress could serve, while José E. Serrano (N.Y.) wants to increase the number of terms a president can serve.
Rep. Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Ill.) offered a number of amendments that would guarantee, among other things, the right to quality education and medical care.
A permanent proposal remains an amendment banning same-sex marriage, as well as an amendment banning the burning of the national flag.
Some legislators also want to allow federal laws to be annuled if two-thirds of the states oppose them.
Although members of Congress seem to be very active in drafting various amendments, they do not differ significantly from average compared to previous years.
In the 111th century, the 111th And 19th They offered Congress 77 amendments, while in the 100th congressional district, they offered 77 amendments. There were 66 of them to Congress.
Their activity even pales in comparison to the early 1990s, when, according to Senate library statistics, members offered more than 150 amendments every two years.
But they were not much more successful than current politicians.
The last amendment to be added - the 27th Amendment - was ratified in 1992, but was actually proposed by Congress in 1789.
"Beaten, but not defeated," Gifford says in her first television interview since the shooting
Ten months after she was injured at point-blank range by a gunman at a public meeting with voters in Tucson, Gabrielle Gifffords (Ariz.) appeared on national television Monday night, sang along to a tune from the Broadway show "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" and said she wanted more than a return to Congress to get better.
Giffords appeared on ABC News' "20/20" with Diane Sawyer. It was visible that the writing of sentences was still a problem for her, and she needed help walking.
The show documented her difficult recovery, which was necessary because of a bullet wound that pierced her skull in front, penetrated the left half of her brain, and came out of her head in the back.
Three months ago, surprisingly, she returned to the House to take part triumphantly in the debt ceiling vote.
In her first television interview since the January shooting, in which six people were killed and 13 others wounded, Giffords smiled, laughed and sang - describing her recovery as "difficult."
When Sawyer asked her how she felt, Giffords, 41, replied, "Pretty good."
The interview with Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of an hour-long special on "20/20" that aired on the eve of the release of the couple's new book, "Gabby: A Story of Courage and Hope."
The special has followed Gifford's entire recovery since the January 8 shooting.
Videos made by Kelly during the first few weeks show Giffords in a hospital bed with a shaved head and a long scar across her forehead.
While her husband encourages her, she can't do more than raise one or two fingers at the time.
A few months later, Giffords is pictured sitting in a wheelchair and being taught by therapists how to perform simple tasks.
Nodding your head.
Lip-sming.
And then, her first word: "What."
Within days, Giffords uttered another word - "toast" as she called for a change in her breakfast.
Videos aired by ABC show that music played a pivotal role in Giffords' recovery: The congresswoman sings along with a therapist to the melodies of Cyndi Lauper's "Girls Just want to Have Fun" and Tom Petty's "Free Fallin."
During the interview, Gifford, who devotes two hours a day to therapy, told Sawyer that she had no memory of the day of the shooting.
Her husband said he didn't read Gifford newspaper articles about the shooting until March 12, when she first asked him who the six who were killed in the incident were.
Suspect in the shooting is Jared Lee Loughner, who is being held in a Missouri prison awaiting trial under the influence of violent drugs.
"A lot of people died," Giffords told Sawyer.
"Terrible, terrible, terrible."
He told Kelly Sawyer that at one point his wife said during her convalescence, "I lost."
"So I said to her right away, Gabby, you didn't lose," Kelly said.
"You just got beat up.
But you're going to make it, you're going to pull yourself together, and you're going to come back stronger than ever."
Military units are met with compassion rather than respect
The event was a Wall Street gala that raised millions of dollars for war veterans in New York who don't have a roof over their heads.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about helplessness, frustration and loss.
Hundreds of soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines gathered around him.
The festively dressed crowd stood up and applauded enthusiastically.
"Both men and women serving in the military were considered heroes," said David Saltzman, who hosted the spring fundraiser.
The then Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff committee also attended the ceremony. In addition to him, Admiral Mike Mullen was on the scene, but he saw the role of the troops somewhat differently.
"They were all introduced as orphans," the officer wrote in an email.
I'm sure the organizers meant well.
I know you do.
But what I saw wasn't respect. It was regret.
Such utterly opposite impressions illustrate the difficult relationship between the military and the often alooning, sometimes glorifying, American public.
The army is boundlessly showered with praise for its sacrifices.
But this praise has a price, soldiers say.
The public is increasingly acting as if they feel sorry for the individual in uniform.
"We are not victims at all," said Brigadier General Sean B. MacFarland, who commanded troops in Iraq and will soon leave Afghanistan.
"But it seems that the only way some can support us is to put us in the role of unhappy souls."
This topic is very sensitive for military commanders who do not want to appear ungrateful or spoil relations with the public they serve.
They also realize that the anger faced by troops returning from Vietnam was much worse.
As a result, most words of regret are said quietly and privately among war veterans.
As the two sons of retired Colonel Mark Canciano returned from combat operations where they served as marines, their father warned them that people outside the military would watch their service from two angles.
From the point of view of some, he will feel respect and amazement, because they have defeated enemy insurgents and visited exotic places.
But others will wonder if "there is an evil, violent veteran hiding beneath the surface," said Cancian, who participated in the fighting in Iraq and took a position in Washington on his return to government.
He argued that when he was looking for a job, some of the people interviewing him were inconspicuously hinting at whether he could withstand the stress of working in Washington so soon after returning to the fight.
"When you talk about your service, you have to count on negative reactions," Cancian instructed his sons.
The military's concern stems in part from America's indifference to wars.
Battlefield successes rarely reap recognition in a country that has little awareness of its own military and finds little self-benefit in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
"As a nation, we no longer value military heroism as it used to be during World War II," said Lieutenant General David Barno, who commanded U.S. forces in Afghanistan.
Instead, recognition by politicians and the public focuses mainly on the suffering of men in arms.
Soldiers are decorated for the number of actions they have endured, the number of friends they have lost, or the extent of their injuries.
Army faces growing pressure to crack down on rape
This week, a decision will be made on whether to start a trial of 28 women and men against the military for alleged inaction in a rape case.
If not, hundreds of other plaintiffs are prepared to file suit.
Private First Class Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old the night she was allegedly raped by her army colleague and was 11 weeks pregnant.
It happened in October 2008, and she was headed to the barracks at Miramar Air Force Base north of San Diego. After dinner with a friend, she ran into her male colleague carrying a box of 12 beers.
He asked her if he could join her, that they could have a little drink in her room.
"There was a warning light in my head," Lyman said.
But the native Texan completely ignored her objections.
I thought, no, he's 19.
"He's from Texas," she said.
"I wish I'd listened to my instincts."
She claims that just minutes after they entered her room, the man walked over to her, threw her on the bed and raped her.
This week, November 18, Lyman and 27 other current or former members of the military will await the verdict of a hearing that could have a historic impact. This will take place in Arlington, Virginia, and will be about whether the charges against former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, go to trial.
The indictment states that Gates and Rumsfeld failed to combat the spread of rape in the military, which violates the constitutional rights of soldiers.
The indictment was filed in February by Washington lawyer Susan Burke, and the plaintiff had 17 members at the time. Over the following months, however, their number grew to 28-25 women and three men, all of them claiming to have been raped or otherwise sexually assaulted by their colleagues in the military, and that the military had failed to investigate, punish, and seek justice after the complaints were announced.
Burke says she's after the highest-ranking military commanders because the problem starts with them.
"The army is a directive system," he says.
"Who are the people who are in a position to prevent efforts to introduce measures against such acts? High Command."
Burke also claims to have contacted at least 400 other survivors since February, many of whom could be part of other lawsuits filed in the future.
Her strategy: Rather than grouping all the charges into this case - she put all the eggs in one basket, as she says herself - she will file lawsuits in several different cases if necessary to keep the pressure down.
The team defending the Department of Defense is led by U.S. Attorney Neil MacBride, who, along with his associates, filed a motion to dismiss the case.
Court documents obtained by Newsweek detail the defense's strategy - essentially, current or former soldiers cannot sue the military for injuries they sustained as members of the armed forces.
Under a 1950 Supreme Court order known as the Feres Doctrine, the federal government is not responsible for injuries sustained by active-duty soldiers.
"The alleged injuries relate to the military service of the plaintiffs," the document says.
The Ministry of Defence declined to comment on the matter.
But things have changed since the 1950s.
Although women are still not officially allowed to serve in combat, it is all about words: in modern wars, it is hard to find a clear front line.
In the wars in both Iraq and Afghanistan, teams of female soldiers played an increasingly prominent role, especially in communicating with civilian women in a war zone.
The result: between these wars, 150 female soldiers fell - two-thirds of them directly in combat.
The time has come for modernization in the military, Burke explains.
She's not alone in her fight. In addition, three other solicitors are dealing with the case.
At Yale Law School, visitors to a veterans' seminar on legal services are preparing a lawsuit against four major military academies for allegedly developing an atmosphere that promotes hatred of women.
Separately, the Nonprofit Organization of American Vietnam Veterans is gathering documents for its lawsuit against the military. The lawsuit focuses on a diagnosis of a "personality disorder" allegedly found in rape victims to give the military an excuse to release them - a common practice, according to activists such as Anu Bhagwati, part of the Human Rights Group Service Women's Action Network.
Her group had already filed a lawsuit in December against the state veterans' organization, accusing it of discriminatory practices that should have occurred in processing requests for help from people who claimed to have been sexually assaulted while on duty.
Nine separate proposals were introduced in Congress by a group of senators and members from both political parties, proposing a number of amendments.
According to the Defense Department's Office for Preventing and Tackling Sexual Violence, 3,158 sexual assaults were reported in 2010.
However, this type of attack remains unannounced in most cases, and according to the Pentagon's own estimates, this figure corresponds to about 13.5 percent of the estimated 19,000 incidents that occurred that year.
In a report issued in March, the level of prosecution of suspects is also discussed: In 2010, 20 percent of cases reported in the military - half the number of civilian justice systems - went to trial.
Prosecutors in Deputy Burke's case describe the attacks as just the first in a series of traumas.
Private Lyman, for example, reported the alleged rape to the military police less than an hour after it was supposed to happen.
During the night, she says, she was asked to repeat the details of her rape 11 times to various police officers, doctors and commanders.
She underwent all the examinations necessary to determine the rape, and the blood of her attacker was found in her bed from a wound she had made on his arm.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman attended a court hearing during which she was asked questions about whether she had made love to her boyfriend on the day of the attack.
Six people were called to testify about the reputation in favour of the alleged perpetrator, who was eventually acquitted.
"I remember the day the verdict was handed down," Lyman says.
"I felt like I was going to give birth right there - I ran out of the courtroom screaming."
"I was placed in a psychiatric unit, and when I got out, I remember saying to my commanding officer, "That wasn't his trial. It was mine."
The Lymans were ordered to see a military psychiatrist, who eventually diagnosed her with a personality disorder, making her unfit for duty.
In January 2010, she was discharged from the army without honor and therefore without entitlement to service.
Whether or not the case of Lyman and the other plaintiffs moves on to the next phase, it's a long shot, says John Turley, a law professor at George Washington Law School.
However, he notes, "From my point of view, they should be able to advance to the next stages of the negotiations."
Between them and the verdict, however, stands the doctrine in question, which has been criticized since the first time it saw the light of day.
I myself am a lifelong critic of the Feres Doctrine.
The military is decades behind because their duties do not indicate the same level of incentives and deterrence.
He adds, "The odds are hard against them... but it's important for them to try."
Change will only happen if good people are willing to fight.
If the hearing is not decided in their favor, Burkevoa, the plaintiffs' lawyer, will gather hundreds of other people ready to file charges and begin working on other cases on the subject.
"We will not stop fighting the military on this issue, from where there will be no reform," he says.
Or until we die, which is what comes first.
Walls have eyes: How scientists explore you on Facebook
Before Anders Behring Breivik became the new face of right-wing extremism in Europe, he was just another young man who presented his anti-immigrant views online.
On Monday, Braivik, who confessed to a july killing s rampage that left 77 dead in Norway, attended his first public court hearing.
Although Breivik could have acted alone, he was certainly not alone in cyberspace: he spent a lot of time at his computer preparing the attack, chatting with some of the millions of nationalists supporting right-wing groups on social media sites.
After this summer's tragedy, scientists want to know more about these people.
But how to find them?
Easy - just go to Facebook.
"We realized that getting them wasn't really that hard," says Jamie Bartlett, lead author of a recently released report by the British research team on European digital populism.
Facebook's personal information supply is so extensive, Bartlett says, that it was enough for scientists to simply use advertising on the site to identify with absolute accuracy the demographic they're looking for - something that marketing executives have been doing for years.
Bartlett's team across Europe found half a million fans of right-wing groups, and then they turned their attention to them and sent them advertisements. However, instead of inviting them into a newly formed group or offering them some dietary products, they were invited to complete a questionnaire that raised questions about their level of education, relationship to violence, and optimism about their own future.
Through Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues managed to get results from more than 10,000 fans of 14 different right-wing groups in 11 European countries - without even having to leave the office.
"It's a whole new way of doing research," Bartlett notes.
Some of the results are not all that surprising: online supporters of right-wing groups are mostly young men, irritated by rising immigration rates.
But on the other hand, "those who combine their online activism with offline activism are more reasonable, democratic, and less violent than those who remain constantly hidden behind a computer screen."
Demos' work is just one example of how Facebook is becoming a new tool in the hands of scientists.
Research teams, health scientists, and political researchers use this site to study everything from health problems to social trends hiding status updates, posts on walls, and "Like" buttons pressed.
Facebook reports more than 800 million active users. On average, each of them provides three different data a day, making this social network literally an "information supernova" behind the development of many new research. The number of academic papers with the word Facebook in its name has risen to almost 800% from five years ago.
For some scientists, the magic of Facebook is that it gives them the opportunity to study people without having to harass them on the street.
"In the old days, when you wanted to do a survey of people from the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them."
"You'd have to get to a side where you'd never be allowed to go," bartlett says.
"Facebook is breaking all of this down - you're just going straight to them."
Others claim that the site can offer a way to identify and avoid a socio-health problem.
In a recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin, the research team found that university students who discussed their drunken facebook posts were much more at risk of alcoholism than students who remained silent on the topic.
Moreno suggests that peers monitor the site and come up with an offer to help a student who posts too many drunken statuses.
"The problem can't be solved if you can't diagnose it," Dimitri Christakis, Co-Author of Dr. Moreno and Director of the Center for Children's Health, Behavior and Development at the Seattle Children's Research Institute, told the Washington Post.
"We found a way to identify children at risk that we would not otherwise have had a chance to discover."
Facebook itself constantly probes its users' data.
The site's information team has compiled statistics on the link between relationship statuses and St. Patrick's Day. Valentine's Day, voter turnout in 2010, and the nation's satisfaction coefficient (mainly using the information they had access to - internet freedom advocates have long said that the site should make its information treasure available to research and others).
But Facebook users know that the page is following them, whether they like it or not - in exchange for the opportunity to play Scrabble with a friend thousands of miles away, you need to provide your personal information to the page.
But what if Facebook users become part of research they don't even know about?
Scientists have clearly defined rules on how to collect data offline. However, online data is accessible to everyone.
"I don't think most users thought that scientists could look at their profiles," says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Lab, about a 2006 study he conducted using his students' public Facebook walls.
"As far as they were, they took it as information only between them and their friends."
Subsequently, it is also to consider the question of methodology.
Even when researching offline, there is no guarantee that the subject is completely honest.
There's no way to verify on Facebook how much of your profile information and wall posts are true.
"What you say on Facebook and what you do outside of Facebook are two completely different things," Selwyn explains.
That's why Selwin, who has spent years researching new technologies, thinks that pencil and notebook remain the best possible tool to use in research.
"When you go out into the real world and talk to real people, it's something that can't be replaced," he says.
"Social research should be about society and social activities - and a hell of a lot of social activities are still taking place offline."
'Cold and inhuman': Anders Behring Breivik attends his first public trial
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who confessed to plotting two attacks that killed 77 people in Norway this summer, described himself as a "resistance fighter" during his first public court hearing in Oslo.
"I am a military commander in the Norwegian Resistance Movement and among the Norwegian Knights Templar," he said outside the courthouse, where 500 people had gathered.
"I object to the court because you have been mandated by organisations that promote the ideology of hatred and because it promotes multiculturalism."
"I confess to my actions, but I plead no guilty."
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during the monologue because he "did not want to give Breivik the opportunity to use this hearing as a stage from which to express his views."
For the same reason, he refused to allow Breivik, who brought with him a prepared speech, to address the relatives of his victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered the police to keep Breivik in custody for another 12 weeks, banned him from any media contact for four weeks, and announced that the authorities would have complete control over all his visits and correspondence for eight weeks.
About 30 relatives of the victims and survivors attended the hearing.
Some came in the hope that they would be able to look Breivik in the eye, others to make sure he was kept firmly locked up.
They all participated in order to move the case to an early conclusion.
"I thought he looked cold and inhuman," one of the survivors of the attack told NRK.
"It wasn't pleasant, but I can say for myself that after seeing and hearing the suspect, I mentally moved on a little bit."
Breivik, dressed in a dark suit and blue tie, remained calm and professional throughout the hearing. When entering and leaving the building, it is without difficulty looking the journalists and survivors in the eye.
Despite Breivikov's bizarre notion that he was part of a larger "resistance" movement, the judge acknowledged that he was not insane, noting that there was no evidence that he had any accomplices.
It may be a consolation to some that the Attacks of June 22 appear to be the work of a single extremist and not a group of radicals.
But this does not automatically diminish the grief and confusion that are still in the minds and hearts of the entire nation.
"I wish she'd look like a monster, but she doesn't," said a relative of one of the victims.
"If I did, things would be a lot easier."
7 lessons from a lost interview with Steve Jobs in this week's movie
When Steve Jobs died on October 5, the opinions of people who compared him to Henry Ford began to emerge - and voted him his genius the Greatest Modern Inventor.
In a recently rediscovered Jobs interview that was dusted off for a special film heading to theaters this week, it will be for all Apple fans that his creative mind perfectly understood the business processes and workflows behind his products.
He was an amazing designer, a dreamer and a self-proclaimed member of the hippie movement, but also a pedant organizer and a man who matched every little thing to the smallest detail - he believed that many entrepreneurs suffer from "the idea that a really great idea is 90 percent of their work... [but] there's still a long way to go between a great idea and an excellent final product."
In 1995, Bob Cringely worked on the TV show The Triumph of Computer Fools, which dealt with the dawn of personal computers. During the filming, a unique, more than hour-long conversation took place.
By then, it had been ten years since Jobs was forced to leave Apple, and he had his hands full with his new computer company, NeXT, and he was impatient to see how the general public would embrace the Internet.
In the end, only a brief part of Cringely's entire interview was used in the TV show, and the original copies of the interview were said to have been lost in transport.
Shortly after Jobs' death, however, VHS copies were found in the director's garage.
This material, slightly edited, forms the basis of the 68-minute film Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview, which heads to select cinemas this Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone who is famous for his reluctance to give longer interviews, Jobs seems surprisingly excited to talk about his technological philosophy and business strategies.
And he's also proving to be a very thoughtful man.
Four times during the interview, there will be a longer pause between the question and the answer - 10 to 15 seconds of thinking, when jobs can be seen thinking perfectly about the answer to be as concisive and accurate as possible.
There are also moments when Jobs' perfectionism comes to light, when he seems impatient with Cringely's questions and drives him to get to more important issues and topics more quickly.
The interview was filmed before the pixar, iPod, or iPhone era, and features eerily prophetic thoughts as Jobs assesses what other companies are doing right and wrong, offering his own vision of the future in the field of computer technology.
It's one thing to read posthumous assessments of Jobs' career, but there's something raw and inspiring about Jobs, whom we see here as an eager dreamer in the heyday of his genius.
He has his own vision of what things could and should look like.
It wasn't long before he started to put them into practice after he had expressed his ideas.
A quick summary of the seven scenes from Lost Interview that are definitely worth noting:
How he learned to run a business:
"Over the years of business, I've always asked, "Why are you doing this? and the answer was always the same: Well, that's just how it's done."
No one knows why he does what he does, he never thinks deeply about business-related things.
That's what I found out.
Jobs goes on to describe his efforts to simplify accounting at Apple.
He was completely confused about the way costs were recorded - they often started with the words "standard cost", the amount of which he could only think about. At that moment, he decided to go his own way - he developed an automatic tool that guaranteed that they could determine the cost of trade in no time.
How he made a mischied at the Pope:
Jobs recalls the "Blue Box" he built with Steve Wozniak - a device that allowed people to effectively hack into a phone company and make free calls anywhere in the world.
A number of things have been written about the device in the past, but Jobs' enthusiasm for describing the Blue Box as an instrument of power is literally contagious.
He tells how he and Wozniak tested the device using a pay phone and were transferred from one AT&T network to another during the call, using as many satellites as possible.
"We've been around the world at least half a dozen times, so when we shouted something into a pay phone, it came from the other phone at the door a minute later," Jobs laughs.
"We were young, and we found that we could build a thing on our own that could manage billions of dollars' worth of infrastructure around the world."
The two of us made a little thing that could control a much bigger giant - it was an incredible experience and I don't think Apple would ever have been created without it.
Jobs goes on to describe a prank he and Wozniak almost pulled off. Through the Blue Box in the middle of the night, they called the Vatican and asked if they could speak to the Pope, posing as Henry Kissinger in the best possible way.
Gradually, increasingly senior members of the Catholic Church were summoned to talk to an American diplomat in the middle of the night, and it was only just before they woke up the Pope himself to the phone that the couple began to sip and put the phone down.
How he fell in love with technology (and phoned Bill Hewlett):
When he was 12 and looking for spare parts to build a frequency meter, he found Bill Hewlett's number in his phone book and called him.
Not long after their 20-minute interview, Jobs already had a summer job at Hewlett-Packard.
"She influenced me incredibly. It was the only company I knew at the time, and it shaped my view of what such a company was and how it should treat its employees."
Jobs later became one of the HP employees who visited the company's research labs in Palo Alto, where he saw "the first desktop computer ever made."
It was the size of a suitcase, it had a CRT monitor, and I immediately fell in love with it.
As a teenager, I went higher and higher at HP, hanging around that computer and starting to write programs for it.
How he invents innovation:
In several places, Jobs talks during the interview about how he invents new products on the fly.
Early in his career, when he set out to sell a couple of printed circuit boards, a customer asked him to put together a whole computer for him.
He had only 30 paid days at his disposal, during which he had to invent, assemble and deliver the finished equipment.
Later, when he was at Apple, he recalls the problems they faced in developing a computer mouse:
"I remember fighting quite wildly... they yelled at me that it would take five years [to build a mouse that would cost $300] until I got tired of it, I went out and found a designer."
Ninety days later, we were able to make a perfectly reliable mouse for $15.
How big companies are running out of breath:
Long before he led Apple's resurgence, Jobs prudently predicted that many industry leaders would fals in their vision and lose their market share.
"Let's say you work at IBM or Xerox, so you make better copiers or printers, so what's next?"
You have a monopoly on the market, so the company can no longer be more successful.
At that point, sales and marketing are already in charge, so companies are dominated by people in charge of this, while the people in charge of their own products are out of the decision-making process.
The technological genius that led the company to its unshakable position is now being replaced by people who have no idea of good or bad products - skill and technical knowledge are essential.
That's exactly what happened at Xerox...
Xerox could own literally the entire computer industry.
It could have been ten times bigger than it is, it could have been the Microsoft of the '90s...
Instead of winning, however, they lost.
How he sees innovation as a form of art:
"There is still a long way to go between a great idea and an excellent final product... and as this great idea evolves, it changes and grows."
During that time, you'll learn a lot about him.
You have to accept a whole series of compromises - you simply do not force certain things to do electrons, glass, robots or factories.
You have to keep 5,000 things in mind - different concepts - all the time and put them together...
In the end, it depends on taste - you try to think of the best things that mankind has ever created, and in a way you try to translate them into what you do yourself.
Picasso said good artists copy, but the best artists steal.
I was never ashamed of the best ideas.
Macintosh was so amazing and successful because the people who worked in it were excellent musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians and, by coincidence, the best computer experts in the world.
If it wasn't for computers and new technologies, they'd be able to do amazing things in completely different industries.
Scalia and Thomas dined with opponents of the health care law while their case was being handled by the court.
On a day when the Supreme Court sat behind closed doors to hear the politically controversial question of whether to upor President Obama's health care law, two of its justices, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, attended a gala dinner sponsored by a law firm that will attend the hearing before the court.
The incident occurred last Thursday, when all nine judges met to discuss the motions.
One of the cases discussed was a lawsuit brought by 26 states questioning a radical overhaul of health care passed by Congress last year - a law that mobilized conservative activists around the world.
The judges have agreed to hear the case. However, a 5.5-hour hearing is expected in March, the outcome of which will further steer the presidential election, which is scheduled for 2012 and will be in full swing at the time of the decision.
Paul Clement, who served as United States attorney general during the George W. Bush administration, will most likely be the lawyer who will stand trial and seek to have the law dismissed.
Clement's law firm, Bancroft PLLC, was one of nearly two dozen companies that helped sponsor the federalist society's annual dinner, which has been advocating conservative legal principles for years.
Another company that sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the trade associations that challenge the law, the so-called "black market". National Federation of Independent Business.
Another sponsor was pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc, for which huge funds are at stake in the process.
The dinner took place in a Washington hotel hours after the court hearing on the case.
Mitch McConnell, the senate's top Republican and a staunch opponent of the health care bill, also attended.
And the guests listed? Scalia and Thomas.
It's nothing new: This pair of judges has been participating in federalist society events for years.
And it's certainly not anything that violates the rules of ethics.
In fact, these judges are exempt from the obligation to observe the principles of conduct to which lower federal judges are subject.
However, if this were not the case, their conduct would certainly fall under the C4 principle, which states that "a judge may participate in events that are currently being held by related and other organisations in order to raise funds, but the judge must not be a speaker, guest of honor, nor be included on the agenda of the event."
Still, Scalia and Thomas' relationship with the two law firms involved in the case, as well as a company with huge financial interest in the case, was enough to alert activists calling for ethics in government.
"This shocking violation of ethics and indifference to the code of conduct contradicts the assertion by several judges that the Supreme Court is following the same rules that apply to all other federal judges," said Bob Edgar, president of Common Cause.
"The judges drank and dined at a social fundraiser with attorneys awaiting their case in court."
Their presence and assistance in raising funds through this action undermines the feet of any claim of unbiasedness, which is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas showed little sympathy for their critics, saying that they, too, seamlessly combine their legal obligations with those of groups like the Federalist Society.
Thomas' wife Ginni is a high-ranking conservative activist.
Moreover, conservatives argue that justice Elena Kagan, not Scalia and Thomas, has an ethical problem.
Kagan was working as attorney general under President Obama when the first objections to the law appeared in court.
Kagan's critics are pressuring her to renounce her involvement in the case, claiming that she fought so hard for the law then that she could now be unbiased.
Kagan has made no indication that she's about to step down.
Boeing wins record $18 billion jet aircraft contract
Emirates airlines are ordering 50 boeing 777 dual-flight jets with the option of purchasing 20 more.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliners to Aman Air, for which it is saching more than $1 billion.
When a company gets an order for 50 pieces of its products, it's usually no reason to celebrate.
However, if the company is aircraft manufacturer Boeing Co. and the price of these 50 aircraft totals a record USD 18 billion, it is something else.
Equally important news is where Boeing got the contract from: the Middle East, a sprawling goldmine for future aircraft orders.
According to a forecast released Monday, the Chicago-based company estimates that airlines in the Middle East will need 2,520 aircraft worth $450 billion over the next 20 years.
Over the weekend, Boeing announced its largest order in history in terms of dollar value for commercial aircraft - 50 2-2-inch Jets Boeing 777s.
The sensational order came from Dubai-based Emirates Airlines.
Boeing said at the 2011 Dubai Air Show that the airline has the option to purchase an additional 20 aircraft, which would bring the total value of the contract to $26 billion.
Then, on Monday, Boeing announced that Oman Air had ordered six Boeing 787-8s, sometimes known as dreamliners, boasting significantly better fuel consumption and passenger equipment.
The total cost of these six aircraft exceeds USD 1 billion.
"This is excellent news for the entire Boeing company," said Neal Dihora, an analyst for Morningstar.
"The quality of these particular customers is very high."
Many airlines in the Middle East belong to oil-producing nations there.
This means that they not only have the money to pay for the planes, but the increase in the price of fuel - mostly damaging to the airline because it is one of its biggest costs - is not so decisive, because the country itself is profiting from higher oil prices.
This is important because they are not as likely as other airlines to cancel or postpone aircraft orders because of the increase in fuel prices, Dihora says.
"They have such natural protection," he says.
The contract from Emirates consolidating Boeaing's leading position in the wide-hull aircraft market and brings into the dark Airbus SAS, which wanted to try to erode Boeing's dominance of its A350 transport model.
Boeing's victory comes four months after Airbus officials announced that the first flight of its largest A350, a direct competitor to the 777-300ER, would be postponed.
The postponed occurred because customers demanded more usable aircraft load and range, so the manufacturer took the time to give the machine more engine power.
Boeing Co.'s share price rose 1.5% to $67.94.
Mexican President's Sister Appears to Have Been Defeated in Michoacan Elections
Luisa Maria Calderon claims that her opponent, Faust Vallejon of the PRI, was helped in the hunt for the governor's seat by drug traffickers.
Felipe Calderon's sister appears to have lost the violent state election for governor of Michoacan. On Monday, she subsequently claimed that one of her opponents had been helped to victory by drug traffickers.
Preliminary results gave the leadership in the western state's gubernation to Faust Vallejo of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI.
"The interference of organised crime members in the entire electoral process, and especially in yesterday's elections, is alarming not only for Michoacan, but for our entire country," Luisa Maria Calderon said in a radio interview the day after Sunday's election.
"They threatened our candidates, members of the polling group... They confiscated ballot boxes, set up roadblocks... and let people vote to order for the PRI.
The PRI ruled Mexico for seven decades until 2000, when it lost the presidency.
But he plans an early return to power, and winning the Michoacan elections is an important step in this effort.
The PRI hopes to win the presidential election in July.
Vallejo seems to have narrowly defeated Calderon, who was leading the day before the election.
Calderon, a candidate for her brother's conservative National Action Party, or PAN, refused to recognize Vallejon as the winner.
Third was Silvano Aureolis, a candidate for the left-wing Democratic Revolution Party, or PRD, which until now controlled the governor's office. For a edible and unlucky party, this is a very unfortunate loss before the 2012 presidential election.
Aureoles also refused to accept the preliminary results as valid.
Vallejo, a former mayor of the state capital named Morelia, denies any ties to drug traffickers and encourages other candidates to acknowledge the results.
Michoacan has long been controlled by drug cartels specializing in marijuana, heroin and methamphetamines.
It is President Calderon's home state and it was in Michoacan in December 2006 that he launched a military fight against traffickers.
But the violence persisted.
The pan mayor, a supporter of Luisa Marie Calderon, was assassinated just a week before the election, and many candidates withdrew from the election out of fear.
But whatever the outcome of the Michoacan elections looks like for the PRI, winning will help the party gain new momentum.
The expected pri party representative in the presidential election, Enrique Pena Nieto, congratulated Wahington Vallejo, saying: "I think this victory could be very encouraging given the coming year."
ADB Calls on Asia to Help Save Eurozone
The Asian Development Bank has called on India and China to be ready to help rescue the Eurozone from its severe debt crisis, otherwise there could be an overall downturn in the world economy that would also have a negative impact on economic growth in Asia.
Rajat Nag, managing director of Manila-based ADB, said the world's two fastest-growing economies must "do everything in their power" to help the bloc recover quickly through the International Monetary Fund or direct bilateral agreements.
He warned that the Bric countries [Brazil, Russia, India, China] were watching all of Europe's troubles "too uninterrupted" and said that Asian financial assistance, combined with European leadership and resources, would help avert a long-term collapse of the global economy.
"We're all in this together."
"So anyone who can help Europe out of the crisis is useful," he told the Financial Times during an interview at the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
"Asia may be protected to some extent, but it's certainly not immune."
"So if China and India can help, they should definitely do it."
The European Monetary Association has been severely tested by a severe debt crisis for several months.
Italy's borrowing costs have risen dangerously in recent days, and the prime ministers of both Italy and Greece have resigned.
Europe's growing debt crisis has raised fears that it could drag the global economy back into recession, and calls have begun to emerge for emerging leading economies to unite to help the Eurozone find a solution.
Mr Nag predicted that all Asian support would be directed through the IMF, but noted that bilateral assistance - such as the purchase of bonds by the European Union Financial Assistance Fund, an institution for European financial stability - would give Asian partners in European countries greater negotiating opportunities.
Anand Sharma, India's trade minister, said that "India will do everything it can" to help the Eurozone, because its own economy is now suffering from a drop in exports and a run-off in foreign capital.
"Nobody wants the Eurozone to remain unstable and restless," he said.
"We face a difficult task and must maintain a high growth rate."
"This is not an alternative, it is a bare fact, because how else could we find employment for tens of millions of our young men and women."
Others argue that emerging economies, such as India's, have nothing to do with helping European economies when they are forced to face their own serious economic problems.
Ashutosh Varshney, a professor at Brown University in the US, said it would be politically very difficult to explain aid to Europe to India's 1.2 billion people, with 800 million of them living on $2 or less per day.
"One day they might find that Greeks retire at 50 and enjoy their holidays on the beaches, which would be hard for them to explain," he said.
Similarly, Lee Howell, director general of the World Economic Forum, questioned why India's reserves should be used to keep well-paid jobs for many Greek citizens in poorly managed and loss-making sectors such as rail transport.
Mr Nag stressed that the Eurozone crisis threatens a "dangerous domino effect."
The Bank's forecast of 7.5% economic growth in Asia between 2011/2012 now faces a "down risk" due to the European threat.
He said vulnerable emerging markets must develop "unpredictable spending plans" to protect them from downturns and significant capital outflows from their economies.
Pentagon warning on possible defense cuts
Defense Secretary Leon Panetta put a lot of pressure on Congress on Monday, warning that looming automatic budget cuts could jeopardize national security and trigger a financial chain reaction starting at the Pentagon and continuing across the battlefield in Afghanistan to civilian assembly lines.
The Pentagon will already have to digest a $450 billion budget cut over the next 10 years, but now fears a further $600 billion cut if Congress fails to reach an spending deal.
"The impact of these cuts would be devastating for the entire department," Panetta wrote in a letter to Senators John McCain, Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, South Carolina.
He said congressional failure to reach a budget agreement and the resulting so-called attachment would cause a 23% flat rate decline and a halt to many new projects.
"Because of such a huge reduction, used in this indiscretion way, it will not be possible to carry out most of our construction or shipping projects - you cannot buy only three quarters of a building or boat. Moreover, further modernization efforts could be seriously damaged," Panetta wrote to senators.
"We will also be forced to separate many of our civilian employees, and since the reduction is to take place so quickly, we will also almost certainly have to send civilians on forced leave in order to be able to meet the target requirements."
"These changes may shake the faith of those who care for our military and seriously damage its readiness."
Eventually, the cuts will affect combat troops, Panetta announced.
"Although the accounts for financing possible war operations overseas will not be directly affected by this stopover, operations there will be negatively affected by serious changes in other budgets," Panetta warned.
"There will also be cuts to contract staff, which will result in delays in contract arrangements supporting the war effort of our people."
"The paid staff will be reduced, resulting in late payments to suppliers and consequent disruption of legal and political support."
Both senators wrote back to Panetta 10 days ago asking for details on the potential impact on automatic cuts at the Department of Defense.
"The consequences of a stop at the Department of Defense could cause a rapid degradation of the view of the United States as a world military power."
"We are strictly opposed to this tough measure," the senators announced in a joint statement Monday afternoon, when they released Panetta's letter.
"It's not a conclusion we can live with, and we certainly don't want to sign it."
"The planned cuts are a threat to the national security of the United States, which we should not allow."
"It remains to be seen whether Panetta's letter and fresh warnings will increase pressure on Congress to pass the budget and amplene voices calling for the Pentagon to be left off the list of cut areas.
Panetta has been increasingly open lately in talks about possible cuts, even though he himself has moved on to his high-level position at the Pentagon with years of experience approving budgets in Congress and the White House, so he knew he was going to fight a tough fight.
At a press conference held last week, the Defense Minister hinted at a brief picture of what his department might expect - the shell of the army, but within which the core will be missing.
"It'll be like a ship without sailors."
"It'll be like a brigade without ammo."
"It'll be like an air force without trained pilots."
"He'll be like a paper tiger, like an army of barracks, buildings and bombs without enough trained soldiers to complete the mission," Panetta said at the start of his Pentagon speech.
"She will be like a unit without morals, unprepared and unable to match a possible enemy."
"As a result, he will welcome aggression..."
In an annex to the letter to McCain and Graham, Panetta specifies how the reduction will result in "significant operational risks: late responses to crises, conflicts, and disasters; significantly reducing landing and deployment capabilities around the world; expected unacceptable risk in future combat operations.'
Moreover, Panetta added that some of the largest defense projects could be completed, including those already being tested, as well as those that are only in the early stages of planning.
The list included, for example, the F35 project, a planned new bomber, a next-generation ballistic submarine, a new coastal battleship, and a new ground combat vehicle to replace the Humvee.
Halting further development and testing of the F35 would save $80 billion over the next decade, but its proponents argue that it is a necessary next step in improving the military needed to deal with possible threats from China and other rivals.
How to recognize a lie
A glance at recent headlines suggests just how serious and pervasive lies and deceptions are in everyday life.
Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain is busy with allegations that he sexually harassed several women - both sides say the other is lying.
Administrators at Penn State University were charged with perjury when they tried to hide records of a retired football coach sexually assaulting a boy.
Last week, French President Nicolas Sarkozy was caught using a microphone to tell US President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar.
The lie was able to destroy entire careers and steer the stability of many countries.
New York congressman and internet exhibitionist Anthony Weiner made a fool of himself by posting information that was immediately refuted by unquestionable evidence.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards has been accused of misbusing his campaign funds to try to conceal his illegitimate affair.
And no one will ever forget the media circus that swucted around Bill Clinton when he lied during his second term in office about his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
It's crawling with stories of cheating at school and college.
There are cases where teachers themselves give their students test answers just to look good in their own testimers.
Mentors, who should teach the opposite, send a message that lies and deception are acceptable.
How many scams do we encounter?
Studies show that in a single day you lie somewhere between 10 and 200 cases.
Suppose many of them are merciful lies.
Another study showed that strangers had been lie three times in the first 10 minutes of the first encounter in their lives.
Telling lies, or "recognizing lies," is a necessary skill that everyone should acquire, whether for personal or professional reasons.
But it is not a social game that is similar to, say, Charade, where one shouts, "I have you". Deception recognition is a serious science sector working with scientific data collected over the last six decades at prestigious universities during detailed research projects, especially in the field of psychology and philosophy.
One of the results of the research is that most of the old myths about lies have been dispeled.
Liars look you in the eye.
It's not like they stutter, stutter, blush or swish.
But don't deduce that it's difficult to spot and expose liars.
A trained identifier of a lie can reveal the truth from a sentence structure, tiny facial expressions, the way questions are created and their timing.
I have spent several years gathering scientific knowledge from a vast and evolving industry of lying recognition, and it is clear that detecting deception is a modern skill that is easy to learn and can help you greatly in today's complex world - especially if your job responsibilities include hiring, interviewing, negotiating or leading people.
Good liars can read others well, let them ease their vigilance, direct their emotions, and intuitively realize how the other side accepts them.
We know from research that extroverts lie more often than introverts, that men tell more "self-centered" lies, while women tell more lies "aimed at others" - mostly to protect someone's feelings - that married people lie less often to their partners than single people (but the lies they tell tend to be "outrageous").
We also know that if you are perceived as a sinner, others feel less guilty when they lie to you.
How do you know if someone's lying?
First, observe the normal behavior of the subject.
It's called "initial observation."
Thanks to him, he will have something to compare later findings with.
Notice the posture of the subject, his laughter, his work with his voice.
You should know if someone routinely taps their feet all the time so you don't wrongfully accuse them of lying just because they start tapping their feet in the middle of a meeting.
Then try to identify clusters of false verbal and nonverbal behavior.
But think of it only as a warning sign, not as evidence of a lie.
People who tell a lie can stop moving the upper half of their body as they try to remember their made-up story, they can turn the tips of their shoes to the door, bend to the exit, significantly change their posture or show "relief after the conversation" - an exaggerated relieved respite and a change of position when confession is difficult behind them.
Interviewees often give a false signal that the interview is over, only to see what the relief will look like after it's over.
Also, see the subject's language.
Famous is the story of how Scott Peterson once misstated and used the past time to claim that his murdered wife was alive, sparking a nationwide manhunt for her body.
Deceptive individuals can also express themselves aloorously: "I had no sexual relationship with that lady... Miss Lewinsky" or the difficult question will be repeated.
The most common verbal signs are very minor.
Someone can use a lot of "mitigating language" when answering a difficult question: "Well... to tell you the truth... From what I know... to the best of my knowledge."
We don't know much about the facts in such an answer, and it's often another warning sign.
There is no magic to expose every lie, but it is possible to acquire the skills with which to track down a lie.
With these skills, a person will have a better chance of not meeting some liar and cheater in their personal and professional.
Controversial oil pipeline construction plan to be rerouted after threat of U.S. government approval delay
Days after the Obama administration threatened to postpone approval of a planned oil pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico - putting unions at risk but reassuring environmentalists - the pipeline company said it was willing to reroute the project to get things moving again.
TransCanada announced Monday night that it will move the planned pipeline route from the environmentally sensitive Sandhills area of Nebraska, and is confident that the project will still be approved.
The company announced the decision at a press conference at the Nebraska government headquarters.
TransCanada's chief executive, Alex Pourbax, says the company is confident that the pipeline will eventually be approved, even though it will lead a different route.
The announcement came after the State Department announced last week that it was postponing a decision on a federal permit for the project, from where it would not conduct studies on possible alternative routes that could be used to avoid impacting the Sandhills area of Nebraska and the Ogallala water layer, a vast underground water reservoir.
"This is really a step forward," Republican Representative Lee Terry of Nebraska told Fox News.
A new environmental assessment commissioned by the State Department would likely postpone any decision until 2013, a year after next year's elections, but authorities deny that politics played any role in the decision.
In a written statement last week, Obama described the decision as a Request from the State Department and expressed his support for it.
The 1,700-mile pipeline will connect Canada and the Gulf of Mexico.
700,000 barrels of oil per day flows from the province of Alberta to refineries in Texas.
Six states will have to be cut through this path.
This project is absolutely hated by environmentalists, but it is loved by work crews, who estimate that 20,000 new jobs will be created while working on the pipeline.
Nebraska lawmakers, however, opposed the plan and considered introducing laws that would force the company not to enter the Sand Hills region and the Ogallala water layer, the main source of drinking water and irrigation.
An existing environmental impact study commissioned by the State Department found that the project would have only a minor negative environmental impact, but an energy industry source said the department's inspector general had ordered a new review of the entire original study process, focusing mainly on two issues.
One was whether a lobbyist hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was An adviser to Hillary Clinton in 2008, posed a conflict of interest in the program.
Another is whether the company hired to do the original study was chosen inappropriately because it had ties to TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle is accused of throwing up in fear of a toddler
A New York family claims singer Patti LaBelle stormed into the lobby of their Manhattan home, scaring their daughter so much that she threw up in fear.
The singer's performance of the hit "Lady Marmalade" scared 18-month-old Genevieve Monk so much that she suffered "personality changes, sleep disorders" and "heightened fear of strangers," her family says in a lawsuit filed in Manhattan Supreme Court.
On November 10 last year, stage technician Kevin Monk, his wife Roseanna, a kindergarten teacher, and Genevieve were preparing for a family trip.
When Kevin Monk brought the car, Roseanna Monk went downstairs with her luggage to the lobby of their house on Riverside Boulevard, carrying Genevieve with her.
Roseanna Monk said she stopped at the door for a moment and put the baby away for a moment.
"Someone came behind my back and said, "Do you know what your daughter's doing?" I said yes, and I left to pick her up."
LaBelle reprim snaided the pregnant woman irritatingly.
"In an aggressive tone, she said, "You shouldn't put your daughter at the door,"" Roseanna Monk said.
"I told her, "I don't care about your opinion.""
She became enraged and began to speak vulgarly - shouting loudly the meanest expressions...
She had a bottle of water on her, and she started splashing water all over me.
She claims Genevieve had a hysterical fit.
"I said to the woman, "Look what you did to my daughter,"" the child's mother said.
LaBelle lunged at her mother - who was still in Genevieve's arms - and had to be stopped by her entourage, who then dragged her to a waiting car, Roseanna Monk testified.
Meanwhile, her daughter was screaming so much that she threw up, she added.
Later, the family sent a letter requesting an apology from LaBelle, but received no response.
LaBelle's lawyer and spokeswoman did not return calls to comment on the case.
The lawsuit seeks uns specified damages, but the family's attorney, Sam Davis, said he took up the case free of charge and that the family plans to donate all the money to a charity dedicated to children with cancer.
"The purpose is to force Patti LaBelle to take responsibility for her actions," Davis said.
"This kind of behavior is completely unacceptable, especially if it's directed at a school teacher holding an 18-month-old baby in her arms."
Climate adversity has hampered the economy
During the first year of Mario López Valdez's reign, unemployment and unreliability increased in Sinaloa, foreign investment fell and with it the economy
2011 will go down in Sinaloa's economic history. This is the first year of Mario López Valdez's reign, which calls itself a government of change. This government has brought with it high expectations in terms of economic progress, however, due to adverse climatic conditions at the beginning of the year, no growth has been recorded and even the main indicators of economic development have declined.
Low February temperatures caused millions of losses in agriculture, limited the possibilities for growth in the state economy, and caused economic activity to decline by 3.6% in the first semester of this year. In the field of agriculture, there was a historic decline of 31.16%, which disrupted the dynamics of other economic sectors as well.
According to the damage report issued by the Mexican Council for Sustainable Rural Development, 582,835 hectares of cultivated land were damaged, of which 78.03% were completely destroyed and the remaining 21.07% were partially damaged. The main destroyed crops include vegetables, corn and peas.
The decline in economic activity until November caused a steady increase in unemployment in the state. According to the National Institute for Statistics and Geography, the state's unemployment rate rose during the first three quarters. Between January and March, 55,053 sinaloa residents were unemployed, representing an unemployment rate of 4.53% of the economically active population. Unemployment rose to 5.28% in the second quarter, and between July and August, average unemployment continued to rise, reaching 6.19%, representing about 74,000 unemployed. Thus, compared to the first quarter, the number of unemployed increased by 18,969 people.
Less liquidity
More factors are to the factor responsible for unemployment during the year in sinaloa. According to Gerard López Cervantes, director of the Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences of the UAS, the increase in unemployment can be explained indirectly, based on steps taken at the level of public policy.
"We are seeing rising unemployment, which is linked to various factors. These include, among other things, the loss of liquidity in the market due to resource constraints as a result of legislation passed by Congress to combat money laundering. It's not easy for people who illegally seize dollars to earn, invest, or use them for something," he stressed.
Stop migration
López Cervantes said that the demographic factor is also contributing to the rise in unemployment.
"The number of people going abroad to work in the United States has decreased, both because of the difficult entry and also because even if they get abroad, it is difficult for them to get a job. So people stay and demand work from our state, and so unemployment is rising," he said.
unreliability
The labour market analysis in Sinaloa is also deteriorating due to the growing unreliability prevailing in terms of working conditions. According to the National Institute for Statistics and Democracy, 60.38% of the state's employed people work without receiving benefits from the Social Security Administration.
Other features of the labour market, such as low wages, are added to unemployment and unreliability. In this administrative territory, salaries are the lowest in the whole country, according to the registers of the Mexican Institute of Social Security and the Secretariat of Labour and Social Planning.
The average monthly income of workers in sinaloa state was 5,352 pesths by September, well below the national average of 7,375 pesets.
Reduction of foreign direct investment
Along with a decline in economic activity and an increase in unemployment, 2011 also recorded the most significant decline in foreign direct investment in 10 years. According to the Treasury Department, foreign direct investment reached $630,697 between January and June, down 87.74% from $5,143,312 in the same period a year earlier.
On the other hand, the Ministry of Economic Development of the State Government lists investments amounting to 17 280 million pesets per year. These investments were mainly directed at service undertakings.
debt
In the context of the economic downturn scenario, the state government asked the state Congress in July to approve a 3 billion peso loan. This would be intended to invest in infrastructure projects in 18 urban areas in order to revive the economy. The local congress approved a loan of 2,600 million peso. By November, no gains in debt had been recorded in any sector of the state economy.
reaction
According to business representatives, the first year of Mario López Valdés' government highlighted the government's lack of management skills.
Miguel Loredo López, president of the National Chamber of Transformation Industry, said that in 2011 there was a lack of alignment of the will of individual sectors, including the state government itself.
"The development of the economy in Sinaloa has been really small this year. We must work hard to regain the land we have lost this year. In 2012, we must redouble our efforts, there was a lack of harmonisation of all of our efforts and, in particular, the correct and synchronized functioning of this new government. Hopefully next year will be much better," he said.
Slowness of the economy
Loredo López said events such as the frosts at the beginning of the year had halted the state economy and curtailed its development and growth.
"The weak economic movement was caused by a number of events, including frosts. One of the main consequences was a slowdown in the economy, which did not recover quickly enough to restore dynamism to achieve an acceptable level of movement of processes, products and services. That is why we are well below our expected forecasts at the end of the year," he said.
Redefine a mission
According to Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, president of the Employers' Confederation of the Republic of Mexico in Sinaloa, the state needs to be pushed towards more dynamic productive activities.
"Generally speaking, we see work being made. We believe that a long-term plan needs to be prepared in which the objectives and economic direction of the state are redefined, because it is important that all the material and human resources potential that Sinaloa has is mobilised," he said.
The work ahead
President Coparmex stressed the importance of setting out a vision for the future that would better manage the government's efforts.
"In general, I would say that the government has tried to achieve good results in various areas, some progress has been made in the area of economic development, but it is important to develop a long-term plan," he said.
He said the current administration has shown progress in public policy leadership.
"There are elements that make it possible to say that the government is trying to be welcoming. I can say that the work done here is visible and I think the government is aware that there is also a lot of work ahead of us," he said.
Convicted of 8 kg of marijuana
The Navolato resident was sentenced to five years in prison and a 100-day fine for possession of eight kilos of marijuana.
The General Prosecutor's Office of the Republic has informed that the convicted dealer is Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval. He was convicted of a felony health offense, specifically possession of marijuana for business purposes.
According to AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I, Valenzuela Sandoval was apprehended by Mexican military forces on June 7, 2010 while on an err on Cipriano Valdez Street, opposite station 80 in El Castillo, Navolato.
The dealer was driving a white pick-up truck. He had a black bag on the shelf in the car and a small backpack in the passenger seat. Soldiers found 8 kilograms of 23 grams of marijuana.
For these reasons, the detained man remained at the disposal of the Judge of the Second Division and the proceedings remain internal within the Centre for the Realisation of Legal Impacts of Crimes.
Owes project contributions
Social projects that are part of programs such as Robe, Saving Public Places and 3x1 for migrants face the risk of not being completed or long overdue due to lack of economic resources, said Miguel Ángel López Miranda.
The director of urban social development said that if construction work has moved forward so far, there is now a risk that the state government will not be able to provide the relevant supplies, which require more than 11 million peso funds for three programs.
He said the total investment in the three programs is almost 50 million peso. The state accounts for 25%. Until now, only the Federation and the city have provided the funds for the work, so it is possible that there will be a delay in the implementation of the projects.
"They are supposed to provide almost 12 million, and although the year is already approaching its end, we have received nothing at all. This is despite the fact that we should have been given a part as early as July," he said. "In order not to waste time, we have started the projects and are progressing very successfully, but we are short of money".
He stated that last year, under the administration of Jesús Aguilar Padillo, the state had failed to meet the relevant supplies, and therefore at the beginning of the new period the city had to apply for a loan in order to pay more than 7 million that were not given to them by the state administration.
"The same thing happened to us in the previous six-year period, because the state did not have the economic capacity to participate and the programmes went on. In order to get to the programmes mentioned this year, we had to raise funds to cover what the state did not complete," he explained.
Despite the promise from state officials to hand over these resources, he said a request had been sent to Armando Villarreal, the Secretary of Administration and Finance, to hasten the proceedings and the corresponding percentages would arrive as soon as possible.
"They were supposed to give us 12 million, and although the year is coming to an end, we haven't even received a peso yet".
Court approves 'end of analogous broadcasting' in Mexico in 2015
Replacing analogous signals with digital signals is one of the most important changes the world has experienced in recent years.
The Supreme State Court (SCJN) has dismissed a constitutional action brought by the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies against a presiding decree that wants to hasten the so-called "shutdown of analogous signals" and implement it in 2015 instead of 2021. He stated that the necessary eight votes had not been found to invalidate him.
A minority of four ministers, including the president of the court, Juan Silva Mezo, believed that President Felipe Calderón had not exceeded his powers when he issued a decree listing the steps that would lead to the transition to terrestrial digital television.
With this result, the action brought by the Senate was dismissed because the qualified majority of eight votes needed for the court to have its say on the constitutionality or unconstitutionality of the decree in question, which thus remains valid, was not obtained.
The draft judgment drawn up by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero presents the possibility of declareing the decree unconstitutional, since the regulation of all issues relating to radio and television is a matter reserved by law to the Federal Commission on Telecommunications (Cofetel). This violates the principles of hierarchical subordination and the exception of the law.
Only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero themselves voted in favour of the project.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies supported the constitutional dispute in an attempt to fight the decree. Minister Sánchez Cordero accepted the demands and suspended the application of the decree and all actions described therefec leading to the transition to digitalisation.
The ministerial meeting also decided to reject the action brought by the Chamber of Deputies without entering into discussions on the proposal, which is also handled by Minister Sánchez Cordero.
In his speech, the Prime Minister said that he did not agree with the arguments of the proposal in the sense that the federal executive cannot structure measures to prepare public administration through general standards.
"I don't think that even if she did, it would affect the autonomy of the regulator," he said, noting that public policy planning in strategic areas like the telecommunications sector is up to the federal executive, which has a constitutional mandate to determine the direction of the state.
Replacing analogous signals with digital signals is one of the biggest changes the world has seen in years. It is related to better use of radioelectric spectrum, better signal quality and multiple channels.
It considers that to put the change on advey would be to put off the benefits of digitalisation, which requires a decision on a matter of public interest. Digitalisation not only has a technical dimension, but also "touches on economic, social, political and national security issues."
As he pointed out, these issues "require the operation of the entire established system, in accordance with the principle of the economic direction of the state. It includes a number of competences entrusted by the Constitution to the government of the state'.
He recalled that a number of countries around the world had already completed the transition to the digital system and had done so through their governments, even though they had highly specialised technical bodies at their disposal.
He said it was not possible for the government to introduce compliance with legislatively prepared laws into the administration by issuance of a dissenting decree that to some extent interferes with congressional powers.
In Michoacan, they analyze the possibility of adding "voice by voice"
According to data published by PREP, the difference between first and second place in the governor's race is less than 27 percent. So far, 879 of the 6,074 constituencies have not been counted.
The possibility of counting "vote by vote" appeared in this year's elections in Michoacan, where, according to data published by the Prep Program, the difference between first and second place in the governor's race is less than 27 percent, and the votes of 879 of the 6,074 constituencies have not yet been counted.
In this context, the President of the General Council of the Electoral Institute of Michoacan (IEM), María de los Ángeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that a few days ago, on 9 November, the electoral authority approved a number of measures to harmonise local standards with federal electoral reform.
As will be recalled, Michoacán has not officially confirmed his political constitution or his State Electoral Code or the Electoral Justice Act. The state Congress approved the reforms shortly before the legal deadline for their entry into force was due to expire during this term, and Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel omited their publication within the deadline in the Official State Gazette Act, saying that he had some objections to them.
On November 9, the Supreme State Court (SCJN) settled a constitutional dispute initiated by local legislative power, declareing the head of state's vote on constitutional reforms "invalid and illegal" because he has no right to "approve or veto" them.
When asked about the possibility of a vote-by-vote census, María de los Ángeles Llanderal replied that, by approving the relevant measures by the General Council of the IEM, it would be possible for both the local electoral authority to carry out the partial and overall census.
In this way, partial counting of votes, one or more electoral packages, can be carried out under the following conditions: the electoral results do not agree; there is no record of the counting of votes and the calculation in the relevant box or it is not available to the president concerned; or if there have been errors and obvious violations of the election results.
In addition, a total recount at all ballot boxes will be possible if there is indication that the difference between the potential winner of the election and the candidate in second place is less than or equal to one percentage point; whenever an explicit request from the representative of the party and/or coalition that nominated the candidate in second place appears at the beginning of the session.
An overall recount can also be carried out if, after a proper count, it is found that the difference between the likely winner and the candidate in second place is equal to or less than one percentage point, and also whenever there is an explicit request from a political party whose candidate has finished second. In this case, electoral packages for which a partial census has been carried out will be excluded.
It should be noted that in such a situation there are elections in Morelia, where according to PREP the difference between first and second place is less than 0.16%, although 129 of the 923 constituencies have not yet been counted.
His will
His ashes will be scattered in the Zapalinamé Mountains, the family confirmed.
The remains of pilot Felipe Bacio Cortés were transported Sunday night to Saltillo, his hometown. During Monday, there will be a ceremony and a memorial mass.
According to the family, the Lieutenant Colonel's last wish was for his ashes to be scattered in the Zapalinamé Mountains.
After being given the highest honors along with the others who died in the accident, the Bacio Cortése family returned to the capital, Coahuila, aboard a Mexican Air Force plane. Family and closest friends attended the ceremony at Campo Marte.
At noon, the lieutenant colonel's ashes arrived at the chapel on Nazario Ortiz Garza Avenue, where family and friends also arrived.
At 5:30 p.m., there was a farewell at the Saltillo Institute of Technology organized by his former high school classmates and members of the American football team, of which Felipe Bacio was also a member in preparation for graduation.
"He wanted to return to Saltillo, and his wish was that his ashes be scattered in the Zapalinamé Mountains. That's how he always told his family and friends," said Sandra Bacio Cortés, the pilot's sister.
According to her, the lieutenant colonel fulfilled all his wishes, was at the height of his life, "he was a wonderful man, an extraordinary father, a son, a loving brother living for his family."
Felipe Bacio Cortés left the city of Saltillo very young and joined the Colegio del Aire flight school in Zapopan, Jalisco.
Some didn't believe it because they said he even drove a truck, but he always followed his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Dávila Bacio remembers him as a very good man, "as soon as he arrived in Saltillo, the whole family wanted to see him, as he did when he brought Martha Sahagún to Saltillo."
The young man even remembers that when he was seven years old, he went to Zapopan for his uncle's graduation, so he is convinced that he died doing what he liked most in life: flying a plane.
They said one last goodbye.
Felipe Bacio Cortés, Lieutenant Colonel of the Mexican Air Force, and I bid farewell to all the honors that Governor Jorge Torres López, citizens and government of the state, the Mexican army through the Sixth Military Zone, the Mexican Air Force itself, the leaders and students of saltillo Technology High School, where he studied in 1985 and where he excelled in his studies, , and in sports.
Bacio Cortés died in recent days after the helicopter he was driving crashed. Also on board was the cabinet secretary, José Francisco Blake Mora, and six other people, all officials of that state.
At 6:05 p.m., the remains of Saltilan-born Bacio Cortés (cremated) arrived to be handed over through the funeral service to the Mexican Air Force under major Jaime Martinez in an area where the family, his daughter Amanda and wife Cristina, mother, siblings and other relatives, students and teachers had gathered.
Three abandoned dead bodies found at Cadereyta NL farm
Hours before the discovery, military officials presented to the media 11 people who had been detained in the area for crimes related to organised crime.
The bodies of three men killed by gunfire in different body and head parts were found on an abandoned farmhouse in Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo León.
The discovery occurred on a 1.5-kilometre road from Cadereyto to Santiago, at the level of an area known as El Castillo.
People who moved around in these places noticed that the cottage with the beige-coffee fence had the door open from time to time.
When they looked inside, from a distance of about three meters, they noticed the bodies of three people, so they immediately alerted the authorities.
One person was wearing a yellow sports shirt and dark cotton trousers and was not wearing a t-shirt. Next to him lay a man in a sports shirt with white stripes.
A few meters away was the body of another person dressed in a red sports shirt and blue cotton trousers.
All three were lying face down on the ground.
According to data collected at the scene, all three people were probably murdered elsewhere because no bullets were found.
Messages addressed to one organized crime group were found on the fence of the cabin, as well as a number of bullet tracks, both on the building and on the door.
11 suspects arrested in Cadereyta
The Secretary of National Defense introduced 11 individuals, including teenagers who were members of a criminal group that operated mainly in the Cadereyta area and which has been linked to kidnappings, murders, persecution and illegal burials.
According to published information, during the first attempt on 11 November in the colony of Los Alveros, eight people were detained and one detainee was freed.
Three properties and a mobile phone were secured. They've confirmed they're members of a criminal group called Los Zetas.
The next raid took place at 6am on 12 November. Military personnel were on a roundab out in the Rancho Viejo area of Cadereyta when he noticed a car with no license plate and two people in it.
After stopping the car, they conducted a search and discovered one rifle, a shell casing and 18 rounds of ammunition.
Then, following these statements, one of the accomplices in the La Frauda area was arrested at around 2pm on 13 November. When he saw the soldiers, he tried to escape.
They were charged with illegal burial in the municipalities of General Terán, China and Cadereyta.
A new Italian government will be appointed on Wednesday
Appointed Prime Minister Mario Monti will meet the Italian President tomorrow to present him with a new government that will face the crisis that is keeping the country on the brink of economic disaster.
Appointed Prime Minister Mario Monti will meet the Italian President tomorrow to present him with a new government that will face the crisis that is keeping the country on the brink of economic disaster and which has put the entire eurozone in danger.
The presidential palace issued a statement announcing that Monti, appointed on Sunday, would meet with President Giorgio Napolitano on Wednesday to confirm that he could form a government.
It is expected to present a government composed mostly of technocrats, although it is not yet clear when the new government will take power.
Monti said he would present to the president the results of his talks with political parties in an effort to form a government.
"I want to confirm that I have absolute confidence in our country's ability to overcome this difficult phase," the former European Commissioner told reporters.
Monti did not explicitly say that he would be able to form a government, but the tone of his comments suggested that the obstacles were overcome.
"The framework is now well marked," he added.
Monti completed the process of forming a government in less than three days, in a much shorter time than usual. Meanwhile, Italy is trying to combat the political and financial crisis, which has sent the debt level to unsustainable levels.
The new administration, led by former European Commissioner Monti, must approve the tough austerity package required by European leaders. This is the only way to restore Italy's hacked credibility.
There's a lot of pressure on Monti to hurry up. Due to market volatility, interest on Italian BTP bonds with a 10-year maturity exceeded the 7 percent threshold at which Greece and Ireland had to apply for a bailout.
Emma Marcegaglia, president of the Italian employers' organization Confindustria, told reporters after the meeting with Monti: "We said that we would support this government very much".
We believe that this government is the last resort to get Italy out of this burning situation.
Monti's chances of success have been greatly boosted by support from silvio berlusconi's PDL, who was forced to resign on Saturday by the crisis.
"We believe that Professor Monti's efforts are destined for good results," Angelina Alfano, the center-right party's secretary, told reporters.
Support for the PDL, Italy's largest party, is significant because until now many of its members have opposed the technocratic majority government that Monti is forming.
Parliament's support
Monti's new government must have strong parliamentary support to push through unpopular austerity reforms.
Any impediment or delay in the effort could trigger a new and devastating attack on financial markets.
The Italian Association of Foreign Banks has joined the push, warning that Monti's failure could be a disaster.
Monti opened negotiations on Monday with political parties, trade unions and business groups, youth and women's organizations.
The round of negotiations will end on Tuesday night.
Monti was appointed on Sunday by President Napolitano, who made it possible to move very quickly in response to the crisis.
After a brief decline late last week, when it was already clear that Berlusconi would resign, Italian bond interest rates have returned to critical limits, responding to uncertainty about whether the new prime minister will succeed.
Saving Italy, whose public debt is €1.8 trillion, would go beyond the current eurozone's current financial reserves.
Monti said his government should stay in power until the next election, scheduled for 2013, despite general projections that politicians will only give him time to implement reforms and then call early elections.
Monti has said that he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but the major parties insist that this government must be composed only of experts to lead Italy out of the troubles that the country has been in because of financial pressure.
Political sources said that bipartisan mistrust and dissent between the parties complicate the attempt to include political figures in the government.
Spaniards attend international matches more often than Costa Ricaians
Of spain's 22 footballers, 10 cross the 50-international mark.
On the Costa Rica side, only one of the 22 players called up reached the number of 50 matches.
A huge contrast for costa Rica when comparing the 22 players from both countries who met today for a friendly match at 3:05 p.m. at the San Jose National Stadium.
While the world and European champions, the number one monthly FIFA rating, have a wide range of Class A interseletal matches to their account, Costa Rica has only defender Michael Uman, who is the only player to have played 50 international matches.
He reached that number last Friday in a game against Panama (0-2) at rommel fernández stadium.
Spanish footballers, who play in the All-Star Game and in the mighty clubs of the English Premier League, have maintained intense activity in league championships and domestic cups and high-level matches in European cups such as the Champions League for over a year.
We must also add to the previous one the experience of the national Spanish team in the complicated knockout matches for the European and World Championships.
Costa Rica's players, on the other hand, have very limited opportunities for foreign matches in the region. For example, there is Concacaf, which is considered the lowest level within FIFA.
We can see that the largest number of foreign matches from the Spanish national team is played by goalkeeper Iker Casillas, who last Saturday before England (0-1 loss in London) reached former goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarret with 126 international matches.
Casillas will continue today against Costa Rica and set a new record for Spain - 127 international matches.
Xavi Hernández, Barcelona's key player, has 106 matches to his credit.
Casillas and Xavi were even officially announced by UEFA last week, along with other Spanish players with 100 matches to their credit. Among them, the aforementioned Zubizarreta with 126 and Schalke midfielder Raúl González, with 102.
Carles Puyol came close to 100 with 97 games.
Followed by Xabi Alonso with 91; Fernando Torres with 90; David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81; Andrés Iniesta with 62; Cesc Fábregas with 61; and David Silva with 53.
Costa Rica's left wing, Júnior Díaz, is on the left flank with 48 games and goaltender Bryan Ruiz is 45th.
In addition, only 5 broke the 30-game mark: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
The smallest number of games.
Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Álvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31) are among the fewest in Spain with less than 30 matches.
Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest did not exceed 20.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba has two, in Costa Rica Víctor Bolívar has only one and Ólman Vargas and Edder Nelson are still waiting for their first match.
Spain's top scorer is David Villa with 50 goals, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
On the Costa Rica side, Bryan Ruiz has the most hits, nine, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
The quintet included the country in its tour to celebrate 20 years of existence
"Going to Costa Rica is a dream come true"
In an exclusive interview with Viva, bassist Jeff Ament of Pearl Jam said the band is ready to offer one of the best concerts at the National Stadium next Sunday.
We have waited more than 20 years, but the group itself assures that the opportunity to play in Costa Rica is a dream come true for them.
That's what bassist and founding member Jeff Ament, who spoke exclusively to Viva last week from Brazil, put it.
The band is located on the South American continent as part of a tour to celebrate 20 years of existence and will be at a unique stop in Central America on Sunday, October 20.
From 7:30 p.m. on this day, he will perform at the National Stadium with the angelic band The X and the national musicians from Las Robertas.
This is an excerpt from the interview, the full transcript of which can be found on la nación's website on the Internet.
It's a dream come true for your Costa Rica supporters. Pearl Jam will be playing in Costa Rica. Do you realize what your fans are experiencing?
Going to Costa Rica is also our dream come true.
We are only in South and Central America for the second time and the experience so far has been great.
I've only been to Costa Rica once, on vacation. It's a beautiful country, and I believe we can stay here for a few days.
So we're very happy to bring you our music.
I ask because they literally adore the band here, the fans are experiencing these days of preparation very intensely.
What do you think of your most vocal supporters?
Thank you for standing by us for so many years.
It took us almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica. Thank you for waiting so long and we're sorry it took us so long.
Some people already refer to the concert as the biggest show of the year.
Does that put more pressure on you?
Some of the biggest shows we've put on in the last 21 years have been created in a matter of weeks.
We put on some great shows in Sao Paulo and hope that this will get us in shape for a concert in Costa Rica.
Actually, we're really looking forward to the concert.
We love this country, we like surfing, we like the jungle. For both activities, Costa Rica is the best country in the world.
How did you know Costa Rica and its surf-appropriate waves?
We have a lot of surfer friends and I have a good friend who lives in Tamarindo. The waves here are incredible.
My friends go surfing in Costa Rica or Nicaragua or Mexico. These are the best places to surf. And that's how we learned about Costa Rica, through people who love surfing.
If we look at your tour, you have prepared a huge show with many songs.
What did you plan for your presentation in Costa Rica?
Since we've never played here before, we have no restrictions on what we can't do.
We will try to put on the best possible show with diverse compositions. We will try to play a few songs from each album and introduce our fans to a good and diverse repertoire.
You never repeat the repertoire.
why?
I think part of it is because we have nine albums and we can play over 120 songs and everyone likes different songs, so it's hard to choose which songs we play every night.
When we have two or three songs in our repertoire that we haven't played in a long time, we focus on them and we're also surprised because we remember why we liked them so much and that we may have forgotten about it.
That's how the show is more interesting for us, which is why I think it's more interesting for people.
This tour celebrates 20 years of artistic career.
Looking back, is it hard to believe everything you've accomplished?
Yes, I'm sure you will.
First of all, I don't think any of us could have imagined that we were going to be in one big rock band and that we were going to stay in it for over 20 years. Sounds like a dream.
We realize how much we've been given and we're touched that we can continue to play together.
We love each other and we love making music.
We are lucky to be able to look at the places we have always wanted.
We couldn't have done better.
What did it mean to you that you were an important part of the creation of the grunge genre?
It has always been an honor for us to be part of this group, in which all the greats are represented.
The people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains are our friends.
It's surprising when a movement comes from a group of friends, it doesn't happen very often.
From time to time, a group is formed in the city, but it is much less common for five to ten groups to emerge from one city at a time.
We're proud of it, and we're honored to be part of a seattle group.
Sometimes we play with some of them.
Last year we were at a festival with Alice in Chains and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden on tour. We're lucky they're all our friends, and we're honored to be part of this movement that originated in Seattle.
It's also very unusual for a group like yours to stick together and still have the same members after all these years.
Yes, the four of us have been together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, which in itself is a much longer time than the usual duration of the group.
I think, firstly, we are all lucky to still be in this world, and secondly, the fact that we are constantly interested in each other plays a role.
We are all close friends and thanks to this we have managed to open musical paths that leave everyone sufficient freedom to experiment.
We trust each other, we appreciate each other's music, and I don't think it could be better.
Your relationship to the word fame wasn't easy. However, thanks to your success, you can do what you like.
How do you find your balance?
As we grew, it became increasingly difficult to find balance.
We try not to go on tour too much as it is very easy to fall into this trap of crowds and people who love our music.
When you realize that people came for music, you remind yourself that you have to respect the music and what you gave it. You mustn't get carried away by being famous rock stars. Neither of us ever really cared about that.
How do you remember the next Mother Love Bone project?
I think we wrote great songs and it was something spectacular in the beginning.
We existed as a band for three years and never released an album until after Andy (Andrew Woods) died.
It was very frustrating because it took so long. Most importantly, we are still friends today with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore), who started out in the band with us. When I listen to a song or look at pictures, I remember Andy being incredible, the way I laughed with him. It's always been a pleasure working with him, laughing, talking about music or football and much more.
She was an incredible person, and we miss her so much.
National band Las Robertas will be commissioned to launch a show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know their work, especially Eddie Vedder, and that's why you chose them as openers?
Yes, the production sent us videos with a few suggestions and we liked this group the most. That's why we're curious to see what Las Robertas will offer live and must be very entertaining.
Why do you always change the words Yellow Ledbetter live?
That's a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), so I don't know.
He sings it, and I think he adds the first thing that comes to mind.
Who influences you as a bassist?
Lots of people.
I'm the first to think of Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C.J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There's so many of them, I could talk all night about bassists I like.
How did Pearl Jam manage to keep grunge even though it's no longer in fashion?
I think we've all always felt slightly separate from the word grunge.
When you say grunge, I imagine bands that I mentioned as Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all the others that were formed at the same time. And if music is still that valid today, it's something great, because it's music worth listening to, and bands like Mudhoney are playing better music today than ever before.
In the beginning, your music had a slightly gloomy character and is now more positive.
What is behind this change?
That's interesting because I feel like there are a few songs in the new album that are lighter, but there are also songs like The End or Juste Breathe that are considered very bleak, although they can sound positive.
At both of them, when Ed played them for me, I cried, and they're songs that are deeply dark.
I think when you grow up and you have some trauma in your life, you lose a family member or a friend, these things start to affect your art and music, and these two songs represent that to me.
I also think you can be a happy person and still make somme music.
Peru:
Fujimori was hospitalized again for medical tests
Former President Alberto Fujimori was hospitalized tuesday in a public hospital, where he will be tested for muscle loss in his lower limbs, his attending physician reported.
Fujimori, 72, who is serving a 25-year prison sentence for human rights violations committed by his government (1990-2000), suffers from several diseases, including tongue cancer, for which he has had four ser operas and is currently under the control of doctors.
Rep. Alejandro Aguinaga, who is his personal physician, told Canal N television that Fujimori will undergo tests within three days at the National Institute of Neoplastic Diseases, where they should find out why he hurts and why he loses power in his lower extremities.
Aguinaga said that in his opinion Fujimori could receive a pardon on humanitarian grounds, but the former president himself does not want a pardon because he feels innocent.
He under surgery four times for tongue cancer, lost 18 kilograms, and other ailments such as severe erosive gastritis, a cyst on his pancreas, kidney stones, high blood pressure and circulatory problems in his legs were added to these problems, the doctor listed.
Fujimori has been serving his sentence since September 2007 at the National Directorate of Special Police Operations.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the deaths of 25 people killed by a murderous squadron of troops operating illegally in the early years of his rule.
Mujica visiting Mexico to strengthen political ties
The official delegation led by Uruguay's President, José Mujica, accompanied by several ministers and businessmen, will begin a visit to Mexico on Tuesday. It aims to expand trade between the two nations and touch on the region's political issues.
Mujica will meet his Mexican counterpart, Felipe Calderón, on Wednesday. This is the most important meeting of a large-scale visit full of meetings with policy, trade and representatives of the Uruguayan community living in Mexico. The programme was published by the Uruguayan Presidential Office.
The meeting of the two presidents in Guadalajara will serve to exchange information on political matters between the two countries", the Uruguayan Presidential Office posted on its website.
According to local media, Mujica will try to get Calderón to support Uruguay in the dispute with France, which occurred when French President Nicolas Sarkozy listed the South American country as a tax haven at the G20 meeting in the French city of Cannes.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened that countries that would continue to remain as tax havens would be excluded from the international community. This statement provoked a negative opinion from Uruguay and a consultation with the Ambassador to that European country.
Mexico has been chairing the G20 since November. The G20 is a group made up of the world's most powerful emerging and developed countries. Since January this year, it has concluded an agreement with that Latin American country to prevent double taxation.
In recent years, the Uruguayan government has sought to concreteize fiscal exchange agreements in order to get out of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) "blacklist", which has countries that have not established all the required international standards of cooperation in the field of taxation.
From a commercial point of view, Mexico and Uruguay have had a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) concluded since 2004, which strengthened the exchange of goods between the two countries.
Bearded plumber runs in 3D thanks to "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario has been fighting tirelessly for more than 25 years to save Princess Peach from the clutches of villain Bowser, but he has never appeared in 3D before: in "Super Mario 3D Land", he will fight for the love of a girl with stereoscopic technology.
The title, which arrives in all stores around the world this month, has been created from the start to take advantage of all the characteristics offered by the Nintendo 3DS portable console, which allows you to play three-dimensional games without having to use glasses.
"Mario is a character who has to tell how stereosopia should work without glasses," said a Nintendo-specialized press worker in Spain, Omar Álvarez, during a video game presentation in Madrid.
Álvarez stated that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "the first Nintendo video game created specifically for this carrier", because until now successful films like "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" were adaptations of already existing titles.
A Nintendo spokesman said that in addition to being a 3D image, "Super Mario 3D Land" is an "affordable" video game that allows you to enjoy a fast and smooth game.
Álvarez confirmed that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part is "simple", the task of which is to attract less skilled users.
Once you have overcome this level, you can embark on a "second round" at the levels of the game that are more challenging this time.
In addition, users can choose real time between "aggressive D" or one that only affects the depth of the action. However, it will be necessary to play in 3D in order to overcome various challenges and "not succumb to optical illusions".
This new arrival of Super Mario in 3D also envisages the character returning to the portable console, which has not happened since 2005.
In this video game, Nintendo plays to the note of those who follow the saga and repeats the successful formula from previous episodes. It consists in the plumber of a bearded man having to go through dangerous mined platforms to free Princess Peach.
Although the player will find news in movements, in the surroundings, in disguises and also among enemies, the "playful" Luigi will also appear.
Colom approves Portillo's extradition to the United States
President Álvaro Colom announced Tuesday that he has taken steps to extradite former President Alfonso Portillo, who is to be held accountable in the United States for conspiring to launder $70 million.
This is the end of a process aimed at Guatemala's response to a request from a northern country that demands portillo's extradition so that it can sue him.
At the press conference, Colom confirmed that his decision was in line with the independence of the judiciary and executive, and that he had in mind that the criminal court had already ordered extradition.
He assured that during his mandate he had not "interfered" with court decisions and allowed all extraditions that came to his desk.
In addition to Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroquín will be extradited for murder and grievous bodily harm, and Edgar Estrada Morales and Víctor Estrada Paredes, both of them for drug trafficking.
Colom's move marks a step in the execution after all judicial and constitutional instances were exhausted to lead the trial against the former president, who ruled from 2000 to 2004.
In accordance with the decisions of the Fifth Criminal Tribunal and the Constitutional Court (CC), Portillo will be extradited after his legal situation in Guatemala has been resolved and respect for human rights is guaranteed.
Portillo was found not guilty of embezzling $120 million from the Department of Defense during his presidency. This process preceded extradition, but the Public Ministry appealed and brought the case back into play.
Trinijove helped 6,000 youngsters in a state of emergency
The organization was created to help children without education not to be on the fringes of society.
The balance of the first 25 years of the trinijove social support organisation is very important: 6 000 young people at risk of social exclusion have received help. For 25 years, the organization has been helping them overcome difficult situations.
To this must be added the long hundred jobs that have been created for this social group.
Yesterday's anniversary also served to present the balance sheet as part of a ceremony held at the former Fabra i Coats factory, attended by more than 300 people.
Trinijove was founded in trinitat Vella in 1986 to help young people with low education, jobless, drug addiction or social exclusion.
Yesterday's meeting in Sant Andreu was attended by a large number of representatives of organisations and institutions that have worked with the association over the past 25 years.
The diverse political representation, at the time of the elections, showed the uniform nature of the work carried out by Trinijove.
Together with The Generalitat President, Arthur Mas, and his predecessor, Jordi Pujol, the ceremony was attended by former Socialist Education Advisor Ernest Maragall, and former Deputy Mayor and current Environmental Socialist Councillor Ricard Goma.
The current Social Welfare and Family Advisor, Josep Lluís Cleries, and the Director General of Social Work at La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa, also appeared at the large Fabra i Coats Hall.
Mas said that Trinijove was created at a very difficult time and that today also offers a number of obstacles, but added that the work that the association has brought to date "is a good foundation."
The president cited Trinijove as an example of how to combat adverse circumstances and give courage to people in difficult situations.
"The crisis is nothing new for this organization and for the work it does," he said.
A sewed-up house was evicted, where gigantic parties were held
Intruders have appropriated 11 of the 13 apartments in the balmes building, 51
12 occupiers left the house at noon yesterday without resisting
All indications are that the nightmare experienced by the neighbours at 51 Balmes Street is finally over.
Twelve people voluntarily left the building they were illegally occupied at noon yesterday, where they organized gigantic parties that woke up neighbors. They left the building by court order and without the police having to intervene.
After the operation, the lock on the door was replaced to prevent a recurrence of the situation.
"From now on, the entrance will be guarded," the administrator said.
The occupiers, who occupied 11 of the 13 apartments in the building - the rest are inhabited - took all the electrical and partially water equipment, in addition to painting the walls and leaving behind garbage of all kinds, especially cans of alcoholic beverages.
Huge parties were held in the first three apartments, lasting up to two days and waking up the other tenants.
Next to the building is a disco, Balmes 51, which was also damaged.
Its owner, Maria Pantinat, explained to Europa Press that sales had fallen by 80% while the building was occupied.
The owner of the disco points out that the occupiers of the building were unfairly competing with her because they were selling drinks for 3 euros, whereas at the disco they cost 10.
In addition, the owner of the entertainment company had to respond to neighbors' lawsuits over noise. But the problems were caused not by the visitors to the disco, but by the inhabitants of the seizing house and especially those who participated in the parties held here, whose frequency and intensity have increased in recent weeks, according to the angry inhabitants of the neighborhood.
The owner of the disco explained that the problems were so great that they even agreed with the owner of the building and have been forgiving her rent for nine months.
The city police have also confirmed that they have received more complaints from neighbors about the situation in recent weeks.
Alberto Fernández Díaz, chairman of the PP's popular party group at city hall, demanded last week that "the building be evicted immediately to put an end to the problems of civic coexistence suffered by neighbors and the destruction of the area."
The Chairman of the People's Party explained that only one floor was taken before the summer, but in recent months the occupiers have reached all floors of the building and almost all apartments, and in one of them there have even been thefts.
In this respect, he added that "impunity must be put to an end and that it is consistent when it comes to acts against civil liability that have taken place in the building."
Yesterday, the city police also evacuated a building in the Nou Barris.
At 3:30 p.m., police arrived at building 35 on Mont-ral Street after being called by neighbors who saw four people enter the building.
All four were immediately apprehended.
Park or mountains?
The architects met on the occasion of the tendering process, which entails more than a controversy over fees
The city's 16-gate tender reopens the debate over the role of Collserola Park in Barcelona.
In the mid-1980s, in its heyday, the now defunct Corporación Metropolitana de Barcelona (CMB), the municipality printed several pamphlets in support of Collserola Park.
The leaflet defined the mountain as a large park of metropolitan Barcelona.
What's more, it was supplemented by a numerical comparison to New York's Central Park.
After cmb disappeared in 1987, the park returned to the minds of many as the upper limit of Barcelona. The Catalan capital is one of the few that does not focus on the north-south axis, but up (mountain) - down (sea).
Qualifying Collserola as a nature park goes in this direction.
The reference was no longer Central Park, but Yellowstone with wild boars instead of Yogi the bear.
That was the position until September, when city hall announced a mega competition consisting of 16 auditions for the same number of entrance gates to Collserola.
The gate, of course, plays into the park's mind.
Either that, or someone's trying to place the gate in the field.
So there is only one question: Collserola, park or mountain?
During the competition, both in terms of purely organizational and reflection on the city, this issue becomes a central theme of all Barcelona architects.
It is already as hot a subject as when two members of this old caste of the chosen ones shake hands during a meeting in an elevator.
And it was this act that created one of the rare match-ups between what barcelona's three architects and senior university professors think.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: the selection procedure is justified.
According to Roldan, after the bay party issue began, "the "mountain side" must also be discussed, so that Ildefons Cerdo's speech on green apples was not completed.
"We must base our principles on the principle that barcelona's largest park is the beach.
Among other things, its great availability.
Collserola is more complex," said the architect, for whom the name "gateway to Collserola" carries a "lexicological trap": we must not think of them "as entrances to the park, but rather as a demarcation of zones where it is possible to operate."
Modol, like Roldán and Bayona with experience in the world of urbanism, classifies the proposal as an "intellectual challenge" with "some dangers."
The dangers arising from the "uncertainty posed today by the public place project" after the experience of the 1980s, which had "its swan singing" in the Forum area.
The first concern is the very definition of the boundaries where it should be built.
"To define something is to take the next step", that is, basically to take it one step further.
"New urban planning and planning tools must be borne in mind, because the current ones (with reference to the General Metropolitan Plan (PGM)) can cause real disaster".
Looking more closely at the question, Modol believes that the Collserola valley slope can be "considered a park", but the Barcelona part cannot, for purely topographical reasons.
Modol also recalled that there is already work done by the Patronat de Collserola that "must not end up in the dump", although he welcomes the fact that the town hall offers his committee to intervene in the project from the "first moment".
Moreover, he understands that the proximity of the mountain and the city is a kind of pass that allows architects to engage in the debate, but "doubts" that it should be this technical profile that will lead multidisciplinary teams ("it's all about skill," he adds) that need to be created: "Architects should only be tools."
Bayona suggests that the answer to the question that gave the name to this game is complex, because collserolo's global vision is missing from the selection documents: "There have been 16 tenders that deal with all the mountain-sea, but there is no longitudinal study to look at the area and understand it as a whole".
This causes at least he to apply for all 16 competitions.
Otherwise, a single gate project may run into the concept and definition of the architect of the adjacent gate.
In his view, the town hall should guarantee that the zone immediately above Ronda de Dalt should provide a full-length equipment zone to ensure a smooth transition between the city and the greenery.
Casino has released Jonas Larrazábal, who will be released
After 72 days of imprisonment, legal agent Cadino Red pardoned mayor Monterrey's brother in a trial in which he was prosecuted for alleged extortion.
Manuel Jonás Larrazábal spent 72 days in prison and will now be released after casino red's legal agent granted him a pardon before the District's Second Criminal Court, which heard a racketeering case in which the mayor of Monterrey's brother was indicted.
After the Casino Royale assassination, Casino Red's owner, Sergio Gil García, posted a series of photos and videos in which Manuel Jonas was asked to pay an economic quota so that Monterrey City Hall would allow an illegal operation at a betting house.
After the public indictment, the State Prosecutor's Office began prosecuting the brother of the pan-Mayor. On September 2, he was detained and imprisoned for 30 days.
He was then transferred to Prison 1, located in Barrio Antiguo, the state capital, after four hours in front of Public Ministry Agent Number 3 for property crimes.
He remained at the site for the next 49 days after a second arrest order was issued and a Public Ministry agent refuted the possibility of complicity or organized crime.
On 19 October, he was taken to Cadereyta Criminal Court on suspicion of extortion of casino red's owners with a sum of one and a half million peso. However, he remained in a medium-supervised prison for only a few hours because he had been threatened with death.
During the trial, the leaders allowed him to stay in the city cells of San Nicolás de los Garza.
On October 25, he was presented with an arrest warrant issued by the secretary of the Second Criminal Court, Jorge Yánez, who said that after almost two months of investigation, sufficient evidence had been gathered to prove Jonas's guilt. Evidence includes, for example, the payment of 1.5 million peso to casino representatives in exchange for a promise that the operation would be allowed.
This Monday, Casino Red's legal representative, Víctor Aldo García Gómez, appeared before Judge José Luis Pecino and asked for a pardon for the region's mayor's brother. As a result, he will soon be able to return to freedom.
During the legal hearing, the public ministry representative assigned to the court, Ramiro Arias, asked García Gómez if the damage had been repaired and which of the associates had decided to grant clemency. But the attorney made it clear that the name would remain secret.
On the basis of official file 197/2011, a legal pardon is granted to Jonas Larrazábal. No complaint will be possible in the process against him. It is also not possible to claim compensation for damages or punishment.
After the trial of the legal representative around 3:50 p.m., the court ordered the immediate release of Larrazábal Breton.
The court's secretary, Jorge Yanéz, arrived at the prison in San Nicolás de los Garza to announce that he had been granted an official pardon and his case had been adjourned to the archives.
He also announced that the judge had issued an immediate order for his release.
Secretary Dionisio Pérez Jácome presented details of the plane crash that killed the governor's secretary, Francisco Blake, and seven others.
The Communications and Transport Secretariat (SCT) reported that the results of the investigation into the accident that killed Cabinet Secretary Francisco Blake Mora and seven other people show that the helicopter landed directly on the ground at full force without the pilot having a chance to attempt a forced landing.
At a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jácome, Secretary of Communications and Transport, said that before the plane took off, the pilot stated that climatic conditions allowed the flight.
"The parts that appear indicate that the unit came into contact with the terrain several times, the wings became entangled in tree branches 25 meters from where the unit lost its hull".
He also informed that the unit was designed for 19 people, therefore it met all requirements for the transport of personnel.
In addition, he stated that no parts were found on the ground following an investigation carried out in the impact area.
"The search revealed that parts of the aircraft were not in another location, so the aircraft hit land as a whole.
"The helicopter was designed for 19 people, it met all passenger transport requirements.
The terrain shows a slope with a slope of seven to thirty degrees.
The Secretary assured that the most important thing at the moment is to get results as quickly as possible. However, the investigation can take several months or up to a year.
Gilberto López Meyer, director general of airports and auxiliary services, said that at the time of impact, the Presidential General Staff helicopter was moving at cruise speed and the accident occurred on soft ascending terrain.
"This information supports the hypothesis that this was a routine overflight operation at the time of the accident," he said.
At the press conference, SCT Representative Pérez Jácome listed six basic points of the investigation:
Visual flight:
In accordance with aviation standards, the flight was carried out according to the rules of visual flight, that is, the crew must see the terrain during the flight.
Meteorological conditions:
Reports in the AICM indicate adequate conditions at takeoff, according to which the aircraft is advancing towards the border, between the DF and the State of Mexico there were visible layers of clouds at low altitudes.
Routes selected:
It is likely that due to the clouds, the crew was looking for a lower area and greater visibility all the way to the Cuernavaca Valley.
Impact location.
The coordinates of the impact and the helicopter's latest radar recording are consistent, and it is likely that there was no loss of control or disruption to the flight trajectory prior to impact.
Dispersal of aircraft residues in a restricted area:
The information currently available to us allows us to assume that the impact occurred on a straight trajectory and from the side.
A diagram of the dispersion of the aircraft's remains suggests that the helicopter was complete at the time of impact.
There was no record of fire or explosion.
No evidence was recorded at the scene of the accident to say that there had been an explosion or fire.
The latest results of the investigation indicate that there may have been several contacts with the mainland.
During field work, the remains of the aircraft were found at an altitude of up to 9200 feet above sea level, the terrain slopes, the slope goes from seven to 30 degrees.
The photos show footage that is believed to have broken down along the route.
The information provides elements that appear to indicate that the helicopter may have come into contact with the ground in several locations.
After careful searching around the accident, in an area larger than the area of the site, the remains of the helicopter were not found, reinforcing the assumption that the impact occurred while the helicopter was still in its entiree.
Mexican Institute of Health Insurance Launches Research into Gene That Causes Obesity
The Institute of Health Insurance is conducting research to discover the gene responsible for obesity in children and adolescents. The research is carried out with the support of experts from the IPN Institute
The Mexican Institute of Health Insurance (IMSS) announced that it is conducting research to detect the gene causing obesity in children and young people. Research entitled "The Genetics of Obesity in Children and Adolescents" will allow for results on overweight.
In a report, miguel cruz López, head of the Biochemistry Research Medical Unit at the National Medical Center Specialized Hospital, explained that a multidisciplinary team consisting of doctors, nurses, nutritionists and social workers had been set up.
This team relies on the support of specialists and postgraduate students from the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) and from the Centre for Research and Advanced Studies (Cinvestav) of the National Polytechnic Institute (IPN).
The general public, whether or not authorised to participate in the research, can also participate in the research. People can come to the IMSS sports centres in Valle de México, where tests will be carried out on minors from 8am.
He stressed that the research began at the Cuauhtémoc Sports Center (Mexican State), and since October 8, this activity has also been carried out at the Nezahualcóyolt Sports Center (East of the Mexican State).
Once data are collected from 500 to 600 children, the study will continue at the Independencia Sports Center (south of the Federal District) and finally at the Morelos Sports Center (north of the Federal Center).
He explained that the aim of this research is to identify the components and importance of genetics in terms of the development of obesity, and to trace risk factors to Mexican children and young people, the thus preventing the development of chronic degenerative diseases.
On the occasion of International Diabetes Day, which is celebrated on 14 November, he recalled that the aim is to collect data from 3,000 children and young people between the age of six and 14, with parental consent and supervision, for the application of specific nutrition questionnaires.
The questionnaire will also ask about physical activity and family history of hereditary diseases in order to avoid risk factors that could cause diseases such as diabetes or kidney insufficiency.
He clarified that anthropometric measurements (weight, height, waist circumference), blood pressure is measured, glucose, triglicerides, cholesterol, insulin are measured every Saturday, and genes are examined (trying to identify genes involved in the development of childhood obesity).
Cruz López said the research reflects health officials' concern about the alarming increase in baby weight.
'Health surveys conducted between 1999 and 2006 showed that in just six years, only boys had an increase in obesity of 77% and girls by 47%. There has also been a dramatic increase in overweight,' said an IMSS expert.
He stated that one of the reasons for the search for indicators is the assumption that the population of the country differs from other populations by its genetic history.
He reported that the average Mexican has 65% Indian-American genetic makeup, 30% European and 5% African. This fact is reflected in the genes responsible for the development of diabetes and overweight.
He explained that in general, the genetics of obesity are commonly explained as the inability to burn excess energy that we consume (calories) and which is stored in the form of fats.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit of the participants is that they receive an overall assessment of the condition of the children, which determines whether they show any known overweight or obesity.
He stated that even the presence of dark color wrinkles (acantosis) on the neck and forearm indicates the likelihood that the individual will suffer from metabolic problems and precukrov states.
So far, the information is confidential, doctors pass it on in writing to parents and explain to them all the measurements and lifestyle changes they have to make to avoid illness.
Cruz López explained that there are three main ingredients that cause overweight, obesity and other chronic diseases: a sedentary lifestyle meaning a lack of daily physical activity, sitting in front of the TV all day, and using means of transport instead of walking short distances.
Overweight is also caused by a large caloric intake, i.e. greater consumption of sweetened beverages, carbohydrates (tamales, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) with a high content of fats and proteins, and the genetic burden that is the subject of this research.
There will be no potholes in UNAM Asphalt
Rafael Herrera, a scientist at UNAM's Faculty of Ology, creates modified asphalt with polymers to create a mixture that has better functionality, regardless of climatic conditions and temperature
If paving were properly cared for, there would be no need to repair nearly 200,000 potholes after each rainy season in the Valle de México Metropolitan Area, warned Rafael Herrera Nájera, a scientist at UNAM's School of Ology (FQ), who added that if the construction and maintenance of asphalt cobbles were adequate, there would be significant reductions in potholes, or even could be completely removed.
In his lecture Technological Cause of Potholes, which he gave during the International Year of Chemistry, he announced that the laboratory under his leadership is developing modified asphalt with polymers, which should create a mixture with similar characteristics to asphalt, but at the same time greater mechanical resistance, both at low and high temperatures.
Herrera Najera believes that this type of modified asphalt could be used in places with an extremely warm climate, for example in some cities in the north of the country. This would improve functionality and reduce pothole formation.
He explained that asphalt, the heaviest part of oil, is a cluster of hydrocarbon molecules, molecules of large molecular weight called asphaltens, and others with low molecular weight called maltens. Together they give asphalt a typical viscoelastic character.
The viscoelastic nature of asphalt is that at high temperatures, around 180 degrees, it behaves like a liquid, at 120 degrees it has a high viscosity and at 50 degrees it is almost in a solid state, while at low temperatures the asphalt tends to break, he added.
This means that the resistance of asphalt in the streets is not uniform, but changes during the day according to meteorological conditions and temperature, warned a chemical engineering expert.
A scientist from the Faculty of Ology observed that most streets in Ciudad de México are covered with flexible paving, consisting of six layers of materials, the last three of which are mixed with asphalt.
Among the top layers there is an asphalt insert, formed by small stones drenched in asphalt and then compressed.
He emphasized that every stone that makes up the erm is covered with asphalt.
When passing cars or creating pressure, it is possible for the forces in the pavement to decompose well.
If it were modified asphalt, it would decompose even better, says the chemical engineer.
He added that the last layer called a shell, consisting of fine stones, i.e. sand also covered in asphalt, would be placed on the asphalt insert.
Since this layer will come into contact with the rims of vehicles, it must have more mechanical force than the asphalt liner and must ensure road friction.
Since as part of the paving it will be subjected to a heavy load, the shell must be of sufficient thickness and the material from which it is made must be taken into account.
Climate, especially humidity and temperature changes, are also a very important factor to keep in mind. Water, in particular, has a great influence on the functionality of the asphalt insert.
Once the terrain is moist, the water spreads inwards and it is difficult to get out, causing all layers of pavement to soften and thus form potholes.
He explained that during the formation of potholes, the film of the shell is first damaged, and only then does the asphalt insert be damaged. However, damage does not occur at the same time, but it is a gradual process that should stop at the first signs with the help of appropriate maintenance programs.
As a member of the National System of Scientists, he also explained that vehicle load is another important factor in the formation of potholes, and therefore the thickness of each individual layer of pavement must correspond to the load on vehicles and must be guaranteed that this load will not exceed. Only then can we prevent the frequent formation of potholes.
Rafael Herrera pointed out that when it comes to asphalt, we still have a lot of work to do and research is at the beginning. It is worth mentioning, for example, asphalt emulsions, which are already available on the market in other countries and allow easy repair of potholes without having to use high temperatures.
What was missing from the Valle candidate to become the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of factors that contributed to Melina Ramírez Serna not being crowned Miss Colombia.
Valle wins his 14th title of the first multimiss.
Valle del Cauca again failed to reach the Crown of Miss Colombia.
Melina Ramírez Serna had to settle for being on the winner's page, winning a silver crown and a sash to become Colombia's new first vice-president.
Based on the results of yesterday's final in Cartagena, in which Miss Atlántico won and sceptre took over, the department won its 14th title of the first multimiss. Melina joined the crowds of women from Valle del Cauca, who came within reach of the winning crown, but were eventually announced as the first multimiss. These include Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1987) 1988), Mónica Evers (1989), María Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008).
A question that many ask. What was missing?
The result is the defeat of the big favorite, who has shown in all previous rounds that she has what it took to become the new Miss Colombia, and not in vain to become the Queen of The Police and Joile de Volgue's Prettiest Face. Taliana Vargas and Natalia Navarro won these titles, which subsequently won the title of Miss Colombia.
One of the key factors that decided that the jury decided to appoint only the First Multimiss is that it did not convince with its answer to the question: "Which book did you like the most and why?", by Martín Murillo Gómez of the leamos literary editorial office.
When asked by the candidate:
"I read a lot. I have a lot of faith in the role of literature, I think it is one of the forms of culture. The book that influenced me the most as a child was "The Little Prince," a very deep book.
I'm currently reading Crime and Punishment. It is a book that is part of the worldwide literature that we should all know. And today I have with me a book by Irene Nemirovski, a Russian author. This is a wonderful book called "El ardor de la sangre".
This answer was disliked, firstly because of the term 'culturelizing' and secondly because the candidate did not explain what the individual books mentioned had affected her.
After the ceremony, Melina said she was calm and happy with the outcome: "The world is wise, what is to happen will happen.
And you people, read if you can. The Little Prince is a beautiful book."
One other hypothesis is that Valle destroyed the position of favorite.
The Bogotá journalist suggested that the fact that the candidate was the most popular, celebrated and the one who had won all the previous prizes (the Oster Gastronomic Challenge, the public title for best artistic dress and the Queen Mother) had aroused the envy of other contenders, stressed the Queen, who then failed on the stage.
This was evident during the first swimsuit presentation at hilton beach and during the two shows before the final coronation.
Although she shone on both of them, it was clear that she lacked the strength and passion shown by the magdalena and atlántico representatives.
Ariel Osorio, a journalist for the "Home at Home" program at the Canal RCN, believes that Melinda's first multimiss title confirms the fact that the candidate who wins the most titles during the competition does not end up leaving with the queen's crown."
Moreover, Valle has taken a rather unass than kind attitude towards the media in recent days, and that has not paid off.
Another hypothesis is that Valle failed to convince the jury of its interest in social work, which is the basis of the National Beauty Contest.
On the sidelines, two days before the election, international jury member Lucy Doughty said they were looking for a woman who was aware of her country's social needs.
"In the Miss Colombia pageant beauty is not enough on its own, it is necessary to see something more than just physical beauty. Social feeling needs to be addressed. It is important that candidates are involved in such projects before they enter the competition," she explained.
There is also speculation that the Valle candidate has lost points due to the shortcomings of her background and the fibrosis that was evident on her ass. However, this is completely contrary to the verdict of the jury, which chose her as miss "natural beauty" for the healthiest body, proper nutrition and responsible physical activity.
Jorge Hernán Orozco, who prepares the queens, acknowledges that Melina did not have the best body, that there were better girls, "but problems with fibrosis on her buttocks, which in my opinion were not very noticeable, took away her points only on the last day".
Meanwhile, journalist Guido Hoyos of Cromos magazine believes the Valle native made a mistake when she underwent several surgical procedures.
"Surgical interventions are fine, but they didn't do well in Valle.
The body was never her strong suit, and this is where it took its toll."
Because of this award, which was first awarded by the National Assembly of Beauty, after the swimsuit show, there was a cruel prediction that came true. It was claimed that this was the satisfaction Raymundo had given Mela so that he would not eventually have to award her the highest crown.
Whether true or not, it is certain that Melina today began the year of her reign, not as queen, but as a princess, from a position that gives her the opportunity to represent Colombia in various international competitions, where she will be appointed by the National Competition itself.
However, she will go down in history as one of the queens who, despite their thrilling success in Cartagena, did not make it to the top crown.
That was the work of the Cali resident who identified Alfonso Cano's corpse.
A fingerprint expert from Cali has gone down in history as the man who confirmed the death of "Alfonso Cano."
The work of these officials is crucial.
On November 4 last year, a fingerprint expert from CTI in Cali made history as the man who confirmed the identity of the Farc's supreme leader: "Alfonso Cano," through fingerprint comparison.
Of the seven fingerprint experts working in the CTI department, eliazar González, a puerta Tejada man who has worked in forensic research for 21 years, was the turn this week.
Early in his career, González worked at Chocó City Hall, where he often had to work his way through the forest for more than five days to reach a place where there were corpses that needed to be identified.
In 2000, he moved to the capital, Valle, and after taking the appropriate courses, he began to specialize in fingerprints. This science deals with the study of skin friction, i.e. the palms of the hands and feet.
In the week that the operation against the aforementioned Alfonso Cano was carried out, the Eliazars were told to take their clothes with them for at least three days.
Something big was expected.
On Friday night, he set off for Cauco in a helicopter from Palmira.
He knew he would have to identify two corpses, and that he suspected that one of them was the man who ran the world's oldest guerrilla. That's why they asked him to take Guillermo Leon Sáenz's fingerprint card (his real name).
However, when he arrived with the investigating team at the scene of the body, he did not recognize it due to his physical appearance. He looked very different from the media.
He had no beard, he was dressed as a villager in the area, without glasses, much thinner.
But prints don't lie.
Along with galton magnifying glass, ink, and transplant and light, Eliazar began comparing the corpse's dactyl records with the card entries.
The eye did not disappoint him: it was "Alfonso Cano".
That same night, a man originally from Puerto Tejada was authorized to confirm to The Minister of Defense, Juan Carlos Pinzón, whether he was indeed the Supreme Commander of the Farc.
Search for clues
For the dactyloscope of Sijín de Cali, the recognition shown to Eliazar González by President Juan Manuel Santos at the press conference of the operational service against "Cano" is very significant.
A lot of people don't know our jobs.
Dactyloscopy is an exact science, with no possibility of error, which can play a key role in criminal decision-making.
In addition to identifying corpses, these people help in researching crimes such as theft or murder and confirm the identity of the people caught.
When they get caught, a lot of delinquents present fake IDs or don't have papers at all.
We'll take their fingerprints and look for them in the database.
The investigator said that in the event of an injury, he had to remove a piece of the wall of the house in the house, because that's where the thief leaned to pull out a safe full of jewelry and money.
The walls are difficult because they are not intended to take prints, but in this case we were able to get a full handprint and identify the perpetrator who was involved in several thefts," he recalled.
Fingerprints can also confirm or refute suspicions in a murder case.
They recently found a dead man with bottles of alcohol around him.
Based on the investigation, it was determined that one of the family members might have been responsible for the murder, and the print on the bottle actually confirmed it.
Although it can't be 100% confirmed that he was indeed the killer, it's clear that he appeared on the scene of the crime.
A fingerprint expert from CTI explained that from objects, fingerprints are "printed using chemical or physical reactive substances."
When they appear, a transplant or tape is used to take them.
After that, the prints are sent to Asif, which is a database of delinquents, or to the Registrar.
"The problem is that there are still many Colombians at the moment whose data are not entered anywhere," said a CTI expert.
He explained that not everything is as shown in the CSI TELEVISION program.
Like everything that glitters, there is no gold, not on everything you touch, there are traces.
However, if it can be used, an appropriate comparison must be made.
"Outrage" protests in New York
Hundreds of protesters gathered in Zuccotti Square to camp.
A large part of them waited for the order to clear the area and moved to a nearby park.
Members of the Wall Street Movement provoked New York city officials on Tuesday as they tried to re-get to Manhattan Square, where they were escorted out in the morning. Then they tried to take another New York park.
Hundreds of protesters gathered in Zuccotti Square, where they wanted to get there thanks to a court order allowing the "indignant" to return to camp. The second part of the movement responded to the eviction by taking over a park in the north of the city, where further arrests took place.
"If the court does not allow us to return to the square, we will settle elsewhere and continue the legal battle to return to Zuccotti, both through rallies and peaceful rallies," said one of the spokespeoos of the "Take Wall Street" movement, Mark Bray.
Bray clarified that the "outraged" response to the eviction of the camp, ordered by New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg himself, reached court, where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order banning the forced eviction of the site and allowing protesters to continue camping there.
In addition, "indignation" also occupied another park located at the intersection of Central Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, near the entrance to the Holland Tunnel, which connects New York and New Jersey, and the parish land at Trinity Church.
They managed to take their place for at least an hour, but then the police came and detained some of the protesters. Bray didn't know the exact number, but he said he saw that some journalists had been handcuffed.
The organization assures that several hundred people have sedented on the site. A delegation of religious leaders also came to show their support and also to try to negotiate with the police.
Meanwhile, Zuccotti Square, which is private property, remains closed. A court hearing is expected on Tuesday, during which the legality of the morning evacuation should be analysed.
Some of the displaced protesters even handed out and handed out copies of the court order, and even gave them to the officers guarding the square, causing "some small clashes," said Bray, who denounced the fact that some policemen beat up protesters.
The injunction prohibits authorities from evicting members of the "Ocupa Wall Street" movement or using " laws that were published after the sea began, or prohibiting protesters from accessing the park with stores or other places they used previously."
Mayor Bloomberg told the press that because of the injunction, the city had suspended the reopening of public space and warned protesters that local laws did not allow them to return tents and sleeping bags.
The city's top official personally defended the early eviction of Zuccotti Square, an operation in which 200 people were detained and accessed because protesters were "breaking the law."
Bloomberg explained that he ordered the evacuation of the square because it was becoming "a place where people did not go to protest, but to break the law and in some cases hurt others" because "some shops received threatening letters" and "neighbors were worried about their quality of life."
"This morning's eviction was appalling and shows that Bloomberg is trying to maintain financial interests at the expense of the American working people," added a spokesman for the movement, who accused the mayor of "not respecting freedom of expression."
Representatives of the "Ocupa Wall Street" movement also said they plan to organize "big events" for Thursday in cooperation with community and trade unions to commemorate the two months after which protests continue. These started on September 17.
Pamela Anderson will represent the Virgin Mary in a special Christmas TV show
He will appear ad with Michael Bublé and other prominent Canadians on the TELEVISION program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" on 1 December
Canadian Pamela Anderson was Tim Allen's assistant on "Home Improvement," a lifeguard on "Baywatch," a bunny on "Playboy," the wife of rock musician Tommy Lee, and now an actress and model will be the Virgin Mary in a special Christmas show on Canadian television.
Private broadcaster CTV announced today that Anderson, along with sentimental song singer Michael Bublé and other prominent Canadians, will appear on the television program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1, embodying the Virgin Mary.
CTV today showed footage from a TELEVISION program in which Anderson, also known for internet home pornographic images, appears with her ex-husband, "Mötley Crüe" engine Tommy Lee, as Our Lady holding a doll representing Baby Jesus in a manitee.
Peters, a well-known Canadian comedian of Indian descent who recently served as a moderator on Charlie Sheen's "My Violent Torpedo of Truth" tour, will appear on the stage as Joseph.
In addition to Anderson and Peters, Canadian singer Bublé, who married Argentine model Luisana Lopilato in Buenos Aires at the end of March, will appear on CTV's special Christmas broadcast, and who is close to controversy.
Bublé recently called American Kim Kardashian a "fox" at one of her concerts in New York.
Japan returns to life after devastating earthquake
GDP grows by 1.5% thanks to household consumption, ending a period of declines that began in March
Since March last year, Japan's economy has been paralyzed, now recovering from a devastating earthquake that turned into a nuclear crisis, the worst disaster the country has faced since World War II.
The First Estimates of the Government of The Republic of The Republic of Georgia put the material losses at $300,000 million, a blow that is healing well despite the difficult global situation.
After three quarters of declines, the value of GDP between July and September was in such a position that it was possible to definitively turn the page: GDP grew by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and by 6% annually.
Moreover, the second-quarter results - for The Japanese tax year begins in March 2012 - project the largest growth rate compared to january to March 2010.
The recovery can be partly explained by the purchase of machines necessary for the reconstruction of areas destroyed by the earthquake and subsequent tsunami.
Businesses increased their investment by 1.1%, spending fell by 0.9% from January to March. This is the first decline in six months of continuous growth.
However, the real revival of japan's economy is based solely on an impulse that forces us to use the crisis to build on it or rebuild infrastructure. It's about exploiting the scarcity to start from scratch.
Japan has awakened. Mainly due to the development of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of Japanese GDP.
This variable increased by 1%, thanks to an increase in expenditure on vehicles, journeys and leisure activities.
Yen stigma
Flows were entrusted to the internal market when the yen - japan's currency - became one of the "bailout values" for investors fleeing the eurozone debt crisis and worrying US forecasts. It is a privilege, but it is also a heavy burden on export businesses.
With a stronger currency, products abroad are more expensive, which is negative for a country whose economy is determined by the financial health of large technology groups.
Toyota and Sony, for example, attributed their weak results in July to September to yen exchange rates.
While markets continue to besiege eu peripheral countries, Yoshihiko Noda's government is cautious.
"We must be careful about the risks that remain, such as the destruction of some foreign economies, the impact of floods in Thailand and the rapid increase in yen," Motohisa Furukawa, State Secretary for Economic Policy, said yesterday.
And indeed, the perspectives are not encouraging.
The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) clarified that most member countries showed clear signs of an economic slowdown in September.
An indicator that predicts inflexability in the world economy has shown that the economies of the major powers are slowing.
It fell four tenths to 100.4 points from 100.8 in August.
The euro area has even come below the average of 100. It reached 99.13 points.
Athens again spreads uncertainty
Papadimos says austerity measures will be approved, but conservatives won't sign any written commitment
With quick and risky marginal guarantees and uncertainty once again prevailing, Greece is increasingly entwined in the labyrinth that leads to the outcome of Europe's great debt crisis.
The presumption that the "consensus" of the new transitional Greek government is due to the demands of Brussels rather than the true convictions of political forces is beginning to be confirmed.
While the new prime minister, Lukas Papadimos, admitted yesterday that there was no alternative to structural reforms and that the 100 days he was given when he was appointed was likely to be short for their application, the leader of the conservative New Democracy party, Antonis Samaras, said he would not support the new austerity measures in any way and reiterated his demand for new elections for the expected date of February 19.
"The main task of this government is to apply the decision of the October 26 summit," Papadimos said yesterday during a parliamentary debate that will culminate tomorrow with a vote of confidence in the government.
The package of 24 programmes to promote employment, the reform of the Disciplinary Code of Officials and new measures against tax evasion will be among the first initiatives.
However, Samaras's message does not clear up doubts about his position: 'We are committed to helping the transitional government, but we have not committed to anything else'.
In his speech to the EU and the IMF, the Conservative Leader went a little too far. These organizations are supposed to unblock the $8 billion that Athens urgently needs. At the same time, however, he has said that he will not support and sign any commitment to austerity.
The European Commission, already indented by the impact of Papandreou's referendum, stressed yesterday that its demands are immovable: it will not unblock any aid unless the new government and the leaders of the main parties sign a "written commitment without ambiguity and as soon as possible."
A spokesman for Economic Affairs, Amadeu Altafaj, explained that Troika inspectors would return to Athens "very soon" to discuss with the new government "what it needs to pay the sixth part" of the $8 billion. But there is no definitive date.
Greek schnitdle has a little more to knit from.
Queen Sofia: "There are tools for progress and hope"
Queen highlights Spain's privileged position in relation to this kind of finance
Spain has 'achieved a significant global position in terms of microfinance'.
Queen Sofia recalled yesterday that the country has become the second donor of the planet in the last two decades in terms of this instrument of cooperation, the essence of which is "that it is an instrument of social progress, justice and hope for a better future for all mankind. It's a tool based on trust in man."
The Queen yesterday opened the 5th Global Micro-Lending Summit in Valladolide, believing that there is "no doubt" that this type of operation is "absolutely necessary" to achieve the MILLENNIUM Goals set by the UN by 2015. "In particular, it is about meeting the targets to achieve a reduction of half the number of people living on less than one dollar a day, an amount that sets the poverty threshold".
Spain "will continue to work" and expand its network of volunteers "in all corners of the planet and take this task responsibly," stressed Queen Sofia, who hopes that the initiatives and benefits of the Summit, which runs until Thursday, will "ensure the creation of better capacities and opportunities for the poorest and especially for women", who are primarily addressed with these loans.
"We have already achieved much" and "many challenges are still ahead of us".
The micro-lending summit is to be not only a discussion forum, but also a platform that supports 'basic objectives'.
Her Majesty explained that the aim is for 175 million poor families to have access to these financial services by the end of 2015 and for 100 million families to get above the poverty threshold under which they currently live.
The concept of micro-loans spread to Spain and other countries around the world "after the pioneer of the idea, Muhammad Yunus," the Queen said, adding that it was "an act of justice and the necessary recognition."
She described her father as "an admirable idealist who set out to fight poverty." She became acquainted with his work 15 years ago when she went to Bangladesh to learn about his lending policy on the spot.
This experience was followed by others. The first global summit in Washington and other meetings, such as in Côte d'Ivoire in 1999, in Canada in 2006. "In all these meetings, I was able to see a constant development," said the Queen, who, thanks to her support for the project, earned the title of "head of the family" awarded to her yesterday in Valladolide by the "movement of the poor."
Queen Sofia concluded her speech by calling on participants to engage in discussions and to find solutions to continue the fight against poverty.
"Ethical imperative"
Foreign Minister Trinidad Jiménez said solidarity "is an ethical imperative" that all democratic states must follow.
In this sense, she said that it would be a mistake to link cooperation with developing countries only to the balohobytes, because such cooperation is a 'permanent obligation'.
Jiménez believes that micro-loans are "a serious and honest policy to eliminate poverty", and now more than ever, developed-country governments must work in accordance with the criteria of solidarity and not allow solidarity to be the victim of cuts.
For Spain, micro-lending is one of the main lines of development cooperation.
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, welcomed the success of celebrating a concept based on giving trust to people who are being shut down by everyone else. The mayor of Valladolide, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, welcomed participants to a city that "opens its doors to a spirit of solidarity that is contagious."
CDU proposes electing a European president on the basis of universal suffrage
The first day of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) congress took place in Leipzig on Monday, November 14, without serious difficulties for Chancellor and Christian Democratic Party Leader Angela Merkel.
The question of Europe's future was not originally on the agenda, but it did not happen until the autumn, especially to satisfy party members who consider the government's policy towards the Greeks today and perhaps tomorrow lax towards the Italians.
The proposal for the President of the European Commission by the management was adopted almost unanimously.
Only nine of the 1,001 delegates were against and 10 abstained.
A standing ovation a few minutes later at the end of Angela Merkel's speech and then a few hours later by Wolfgang Schäuble, the very pro-European finance minister, left no room for doubt.
The main idea of the Chancellor and the proposal can be summarised in the slogan: the response to the crisis is 'there is not less Europe, but more Europe'.
Not just because Europe means peace, but because "nine million jobs depend directly on the euro."
According to the Chancellor in Europe, "the time for change has come."
This could be expressed by changes in the Treaty of Lisbon allowing the European Union to strengthen its control over the budgetary policies of the euro area member states, but it could also result in the election of the President of the European Commission on the basis of universal suffrage 'in order to give Europe one face'.
In any case, this is one of the ideas of the proposal adopted by Congress, the inspiration of which is clearly Wolfgang Schäuble.
It is unlikely that all 27 countries will quickly agree on this revolutionary move: the UK opposes it, and CDU leaders think Nicolas Sarkozy will take the same stance.
But the direction is set.
Similarly, delegates rejected by a large majority a proposal to rate each country's weight on the Board of Directors of the European Central Bank, depending on the weight of its economy, which will evidently result in a weight gain for Germany.
Concerned about calming the climate within her party, the Chancellor made several references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl. But she did not try to win congress by talking about "small" European states or states in trouble, willing to criticize arrogant Germany.
Although the Proposal on Europe addresses one paragraph on the importance of "Franco-German friendship," Angela Merkel did not quote France.
Only indirectly.
When she recalled that just 200 years ago there was a bloody battle at Leipzig.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleonic army.
What constitutes incapacity for work fraud?
After the aid, the UMP and the government launch an offensive against incapacity for work.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be in Bordeaux on Tuesday, December 15, to visit the social support office, where he will give a speech on a subject that has been repeated since 2007 on combating social fraud and redistributing solidarity.
As an accompaniment to this offensive, which is based on the will to make savings in the context of increased austerity but is no less clear from the point of view of a right-wing presidential campaign, the right-wing majority wants to focus on incapacity for work.
First, because of budget savings, the government intends to impose a fourth day of sick leave on private sector employees before they start taking sick leave.
Clearly, without the company's approval, an employee who gets sick would lose four days of wages, or at least 15% of their monthly income.
A measure that risks causing a lot of bad blood, but which, according to Les Echos, could bring in 280 million euros.
And also a measure that would be accompanied by another measure of symbolic reach: to give civil servants one day of unpaid sick leave (until now, they have no incapacity compared to three days in the private sector).
While these issues are the subject of debate, the right-wing majority is also launching a fraud theme aimed this time at mischief linked to incapacity for work.
"The checks will be much more extensive, and moreover: if you are caught, you will be returning," Xavier Bertrand pointed out in an interview with RTL on Sunday, November 13.
As in other cases, the effects of the notification seem somewhat disproportionate in view of the truth about incapacity for work inequities.
In fact, these have been the subject of constant monitoring since 2002 and a political onslaught that has been bearing fruit.
The French are no more ill than elsewhere in Europe.
Let's stop at a few official numbers first.
According to the Caisse nationale d'assurance maladie (CNAM), more than 237 million euros of daily compensation was paid in 2006.
According to france's Institute for Health Research and Documentation, daily reimbursements accounted for 5% of health spending in 2008, with €11.3 billion.
Of this amount, 46% related to maternity allowances and accidents at work, and 54% related to incapacity for work, i.e. EUR 6.2 billion.
That's only 2.5% of health care costs.
According to a study by Alma Consulting, the French had an average of 14.5 days of incapacity for work in 2010, compared to 17.8 days in 2009.
An average that contains certain deviations: another poll published in 2007 on job opportunities website Monster.com showed that 75% of the 40,000 French employees surveyed replied that they had not chosen any day of incapacity for work.
Another study, this time conducted by sickness insurance institutions, states that in 2010, 37.8% of incapacity for work was less than 8 days, 22% from 8 to 14 days, 15% from 15 days to 1 month, 15% from 1 to three months, and 11% lasted longer.
When compared to their European neighbours, French workers are no more prone to incapacity for work than elsewhere.
One long study conducted in 2010 by two CNRS (National Research Center) researchers showed that between 1994 and 2001, total absences (for health reasons or not) oscillated between 10% and 11.8% in France, compared to 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the UK, and 18% in the Netherlands.
Cheating on sick leave is only a very small part of black work.
When it comes to fraud, these are of little scale.
The strengthening of legislation since 2002 has caused systematic checks on incapacity for work of more than 45 days.
In 2008, CNAM found that 13.8% of the 285,000 inspections carried out due to short-term incompetence were 'unjustified or too long', i.e. 37 050 cases.
In the case of systematically controlled incapacity for more than 45 days, 11% of cases of 'unfit or unjustified' were counted to 1.2 million checks, i.e. 132 000.
A total of 169 000 'unjustified' cases per several million employees who were incapacitated.
A number that represents much less than a number that represents black work.
According to UMP MEMBER Dominique Tiano, author of the June report on the issue, this figure would represent between €9 billion and €15 billion missing from tax collection per year, i.e. more than the total amount of daily compensation and thus infinitely more than the fraud linked to the latter.
Papademos: Greece will have to apply a new rescue plan
Greece will need a new bailout program to rebuild its economy.
On Monday, December 14, Prime Minister Lucas Papademos made the remarks in front of parliament, adding that the 100 days given to his unity government would not be enough to achieve the task.
"In order to get our economy back on its feet, we need the support of our European partners and a new rescue budget plan," the prime minister said as he delivered his first public speech on Wednesday at the opening of a confidence debate in parliament.
Implementing the decisions taken at the euro area summit on 27 October will be the "main task" of the new government, as our country's participation in the euro area is at stake, he added.
As a result, Mr Papademos assumed that the country's public deficit would be "around 9%" of gross domestic product from now until the end of the year, after being 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
Right rejects new austerity measures
Right-wing leader Antonis Samaras on Monday voiced his support for measures already approved to try to escape the debt crisis, but warned that his party was not commit to any additional austerity measures.
"We will not raise our hand for any new measures," Samaras stressed at a meeting with MPs from his New Democracy party.
We have agreed targets for reducing the deficit and debt and combating waste, but we are against any policy that would hinder economic recovery.
Antonis Samaras replied to Mr Ollie Rehn, the European Commissioner for Economics and Currency, who warned that the IMF and the EU would not unlock the necessary €8 billion loan without written guarantee from all parties to support the measures under review, that his word was enough and that he would not sign anything under external pressure.
Euthanasia and assisted suicide must be legalised, says expert panel
According to a report by the Royal Canadian Society, Canadians are denied death.
On palliative care, the commission urges governments, health care institutions and doctors to work together to ensure the best palliative care, even in cancer cases.
Canadian society lives by the idea of denying death.
Only 9% of Canadians actually accept the opportunity to talk to a doctor about the conditions in which they want to die, and make decisions in this sense.
This is one of the conclusions of a wide-ranging report by the Royal Canadian Society, which involved six experts working in various fields, including ethics, law and medicine.
The commission recommends that the government change criminal law to allow assisted suicide and euthanasia if this option appears necessary for a patient deemed competent to take such a decision.
At the outset, experts cite a recent survey by the independent Economist Intelligence Unit that compared the quality of death in 40 countries on the planet.
Although Canada ranked 10th, the study notes that "the medication of death in Canada gave rise to a culture in which people are afraid to talk about death."
Medicaid yes or no, 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, experts with a mandate from the Royal Canadian Society tell us.
And despite the desire to die at home, which most Canadians have, 68.6% of them die in hospital.
This average applies to the whole of Canada, while in the province of Quebec this figure is highest with 86% of people who die in hospital.
On the delicate issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the report's authors come to conclusions that go against the position of the federal government, which has already said that it does not want to change anything about criminal law regarding euthanasia and assisted suicide.
According to experts, who have also reviewed all countries where these approaches are legalised or are not considered a criminal case, there is no evidence that this decriminalisation causes any application abuses, i.e. in the practice of euthanasia or assisted suicide against persons who are not responsible or dissenting.
On the contrary, Mr Jocelyn Downie, co-author of the report, confirmed yesterday in a teleconference more than numerous cases of these glitches in countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are not legalised.
"Euthanasia is also carried out in Canada, where it is clearly illegal".
"Assisted suicide is also carried out in Canada, where it is clearly illegal," explains Jocelyn Downie.
Canadians are in favor of euthanasia
Recall that, according to an angus reid forum survey in 2010, 85% of Canadians have already spoken in favour of euthanasia because they believe it will allow end-of-life people to ease their suffering.
And 66% believe that legalizing euthanasia will not mean sending a message that the lives of the elderly or the handicapped are worth less.
As regards those who practice assisted suicide, 41% of those surveyed believe that they should not be prosecuted.
The situation is less clear when it comes to maintaining or discontinuing patient care, the report's authors say.
They also propose in their list of recommendations that criminal law should state that withdrawal from treatment for which there is a legally confirmed refusal is not criminal.
The Panel of Experts also requires specialist doctors to be educated on the obligation to respect end-of-life rejection of treatment without fear of prosecution.
On palliative care, the commission urges governments, health care institutions and doctors to work together to ensure the best palliative care, even in cancer cases.
Finally, in the case of palliative or final soothing already widely used in Canadian health facilities, the Commission demands that it be considered euthanasia when it is no longer used to reduce physical pain and be subject to the same procedures.
Reservations of other experts
Some medical law experts have already expressed reservations about the conclusions of the Royal Canadian Society's expert report.
Pierre Deschamps, a specialist in medical law, described the position of experts-signatories of the report as "extreme" because it does not limit the practice of euthanasia to the sick in the final stages.
"This opens the door to a situation where anyone who is tired of life and who is over 18 years old could ask to be helped to commit suicide," says Pierre Deschamps, who studied the résumé of the report yesterday.
Mr Deschamps also underlines that it seems as if the report's authors put a person's autonomy above all other values that shape the social life of society.
Because "there are warning signs and limitations in society," he says.
Medical law specialist Margaret Somerville also expressed "strong objections to the report's conclusions, which she classified as a "manifesto for euthanasia."
Margaret Somerville, herself a member of the Royal Canadian Society, particularly doubts the report's data on the absence of misconduct in some countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legalized, i.e. in the Netherlands and the US state of Oregon.
Jordan's King Calls on President Assad to Resign
Damascus talks about a "conspiracy"
Syria is increasingly isolated
Supporters of Bashar al-Assad held a rally outside the Ministry of Foreign Affairs yesterday.
Yesterday, diplomatic pressures on President Bashar al-Assad's Syria, which, with Russia's support, resisted them and spoke of a "plot" against his country.
Two days after Syria's suspension from the Arab League, the European Union intensified its sanctions against Damascus, while Turkey and Jordan, syria's neighboring countries, took a stand in favor of President Assad's departure.
Jordan's King Abdallah II yesterday became the first Arab state ruler to call on President Bashar al-Assad to "hand over power" in Syria, where about 40 civilians and members of the regime's military forces were killed.
"If Bashar had his country's interests at heart, he would have to resign, but he would also have to create the conditions necessary for a new phase in Syrian political life," the king of Jordan, a country bordering Syria, said in an interview with the BBC.
On his side, Ahmet Davutoglu, the head of Turkish diplomacy, regretted that the efforts made by the Turkish mediation with the Syrian regime since the beginning of the year had not been crowned with success.
"Those who do not live in peace with their people in the Middle East and cannot satisfy them will leave," he said, alluding to neighboring Syria, to which Turkey is taking an increasingly hard line.
The United States was resentful of "strengthening the consensus against Assad and the dishonest actions of the Syrian regime" following the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union.
"The international community, the United States, the European Union, the League of Arab States, countries like Turkey are adopting an increasingly harsh tone" against repression in Syria, noted Mark Toner, a spokesman for the State Department.
During this time, 16 civilians and 19 members of the pro-government forces were killed in deraa, southern Syria, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported.
According to the NGO, two other civilians were killed "in gunfire and concentrated fire from heavy machine guns in jobar" in the Homs area.
But at a press conference, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Mouallem estimated that the country was "on its way out of the crisis."
Indeed, he also reacted vividly to the Arab League's decision to suspend Damascus' membership, which he said was a "dangerous step."
Syria "will not bow," he added, reassuring that "plots against Syria will fail."
Following its decision to suspend Syria' membership, the Arab League is currently in the process of "protecting civilians" and plans to send 500 human rights defenders, journalists and military observers to the country.
French Foreign Minister Alain Juppé is also favorably sympathetic to the idea of sending UN observers to help protect civilians from repression by a regime that he says is behaving "paranoidly."
A new special league meeting is being convened tomorrow in Rabat to take a position on the resolution plan decided on 2 December, which envisaged, in particular, the withdrawal of armies from cities plagued by dispute and the liberation of imprisoned protesters.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov yesterday called the Arab League's decision "flawed," while China urged Syria to adopt a plan to resolve the crisis, while avoiding supporting possible sanctions against Damascus al-Damascus al-Moscow.
Italy
Monti demands time and sacrifice from Italians
The next head of italy's government, Mario Monti, asked the markets for some time to form his team and start implementing a program that contains "sacrifices" in order to regain credibility lost in the final months of Berlusconi's rule.
The former European Commissioner yesterday discussed with political parties before meeting with trade unionists and employers' representatives today.
He should form a relatively slender cabinet made up of technocrats not belonging to parliamentary parties.
"Monti spoke of an important program with many victims," said Francesco Nucara, a member of one of the numerous parliamentary groups involved in the talks, after meeting the prime minister-designate.
Gianfranco Fini, president of the Chamber of Deputies, expects Mario Monti to ask parliament for a vote of confidence by Friday to make sure the new government has sufficient support.
The consultation will end with Mario Monti introducing a small team of 12 ministers to President Giorgio Napolitano.
Mario Monti commented on the nervousness in the financial markets yesterday and asked them for time.
In a "democracy, precise deadlines apply" when it comes to the government's preparation and agenda, he stressed, adding that he was "confident that markets will be patient and understand."
His appointment as president was initially well received by markets, but concerns resuaided after the unexpected fall in industrial production in the eurozone in September.
The appointed Prime Minister should assemble a team, including technocrats in particular, although he stressed that he would like to include "politicians" in it.
He expressed confidence that the new government would last until 2013, i.e. the date of the next election.
According to The President of the Chamber of Deputies Gianfranco Fini, the new government will have the confidence of parliament by Friday.
Mario Monti promised after taking office that he would act with extreme urgency and with the aim of italy becoming a strong link in Europe again.
A spokesman for European Commissioner Olli Rehn stressed that "even with the new government, our diagnosis of the Italian economy remains unchanged."
The European Union is convinced that Rome, despite the austerity plans adopted in recent months, will not achieve its objective of a balanced budget in 2013 and is calling for tough new measures.
Confindustria business association chief Emma Marcegaglia, who will meet Monti on Tuesday, focused on the need to revive the economy "because a country that does not show growth cannot adhere to deficit parameters."
Mario Monti, a former European Commissioner (1994-2004) recognised for his expertise and independence, "a professor" symbolising, according to the authors of editorials, a "call to seriousness" and "another Italy", represents an "epochal change" for Italy after 17 years of "berlusconiism".
The great unknown will be the life of his team.
President Napolitano would like to avoid early elections, as Italy must place €200 billion of government bonds by April 2012.
Soviet scientist helped Iran's nuclear program
Soviet scientist Vyacheslav Danilenko helped Iran develop a detonator that could be used for an atomic weapon, a U.S. NGO specializing in atomic risks announced Tuesday.
The Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS) relies on a recent report by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and other documents leaked from the UN agency to identify the scientist.
Last week, the IAEA expressed its "serious concern" about the "possible military dimension" of Iran's nuclear program.
According to the ISIS institute, widely drawn from IAEA documents, Mr Danilenko (b. 1934) should have worked for three decades from the 1960s at the Soviet military research centre in Chelyabinsk (Urals), where he was to produce synthetic diamonds by the method of detonation.
In 1989 or 1991 he was to leave the centre to set up a nano-diamond business in Kiev.
His company's economic difficulties were supposed to lead him to contact the Iranian Embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
Before returning to Russia, he was to cooperate on iran's program from 1996 to 2002.
In its latest report, the IAEA recalls 'clear data that the development of the detonation system carried out by Iran' was based 'on the work of a foreign specialist who not only knew this method well, but who - as one Member State informed the Agency - worked on this technology during a substantial part of his working career as part of the country's military nuclear programme'.
Anti-May crimes and offences increased by 50%
According to FBI statistics released Monday, the number of crimes and offenses against Muslims increased by nearly 50% from 2009 to 2010, while at the same time other racial and religious violence decreased slightly or little.
According to these figures, the total number of violence against Muslims increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, a 49% increase over the 13% increase in violence against Catholics, a decrease of 4% for offences against Jews and an overall increase of 14% for anti-religious crimes and torts.
The total number of "hate crimes" rose very slightly to 6,628 cases, 47.3% of which, according to the FBI, were motivated by racial disparities and 20% religious differences.
"After the decline in 2009, it is disturbing to see these crimes and crimes rise again," human rights first stressed, "the increase in anti-German violence is particularly significant," the organization added in its communiqué.
"Human Rights First has long emphasized that violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crime, must be considered a serious violation of a person's rights," adds paul legendre, one of the organization's leaders.
"The US government can and must do more to deal with these mischief," he adds, estiming that this could be done by improving police reports of "hate crimes."
The "hate crime" in U.S. federal law is a legacy of the civil rights era.
This rule of law was adopted after the death of Martin Luther King to punish violence related to race, color, religion, origin, and now sexual orientation.
Twitter is changing and more like Facebook
Microblogging service site Twitter introduced design changes on Monday to allow its users to observe the activities of successors, somewhat resomiting its Facebook services.
The new "activity" and "name" offers allow you to better and directly know the activities of other people who follow you or the people whose responses ("tweets") you follow.
This allows you to know if they allow you to track posts, whether they sign in to new accounts, whether they have favorite posts, etc.
This new face of Twitter was tested "in August on a small percentage of users" before it was expanded to the entire network on Monday, Twitter spokeswoman Carolyn Penner told AFP.
Twitter, which was known for its little instinctive functioning, with terms somewhat incomprehensible (RT for redistributing someone else's post, followfriday pour recommander de suivre un autre utilisateur) faisant le bonheur des initiés, s'ouvre ainsi a un public plus large avec un maniement plus comparable a celui des réseaux grand public Facebook et Google+.
On the network, users immediately assess the importance of this innovation differently in their tweets.
"It's useless, it takes up a lot of space and it's too similar to Facebook," @jemb123.
"Activity will help me better track some elements of my Twitter," @dannykronstrom.
Austria
entry of the golden rule on a balanced budget in the Constitution
The government of austria's grand coalition of social democrats and Christian Democrats decided on Tuesday to write a "golden rule" of budgetary policy into the constitution in order to reduce the public deficit and thus avoid a possible downgrade of Austria by rating agencies (AAA).
It was the Social Democratic Chancellor Werner Faymann himself who announced this decision at the end of a ministerial meeting at a situation where Austria's public debt, at 74.6%, is well above the criterion of a maximum of 60% set by the Maastricht Agreement, but much lower than the debts of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
"If Austria's solvency were reduced by just one degree from AAA to AA+, we would have to pay three billion euros more in interest each year," argued Vice Chancellor and Foreign Minister Michael Spindelegger, a French Democrat.
Austria thus follows the request of the Euro area Summit held in Brussels on 26 October 2011, where heads of state and government strongly requested that by the end of 2012, the reduction of the public deficit and the achievement of the balance of public accounts should be entered in the constitution or in the law of the same value.
The instrument adopted by the Austrian Government is close to the "German model", Germany was the first European country to adopt such a "rule".
By 2017, the public structural deficit will have to fall by 0.75% of gross domestic product (GDP) each year, and starting in 2017, the federal government's public structural deficit will not be able to exceed 0.35% of GDP each year, while the Länder, as well as municipalities, will have to report a balanced budget.
The aim is to put public debt below the 60% criterion set by the Maastricht Treaty by 2020/21.
Strong only
Noda threatens new intervention in foreign exchange markets
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned Tuesday that Japanese institutions would have to intervene again in foreign exchange markets if the yen were to continue to strengthen.
"We will intervene, as we did last time, if we find too much volatility" in the exchange rate of the jenu, Y. Noda explained to the Senate.
On Tuesday, the yen rose again to the historic levels that forced the Japanese authorities to intervene on October 31.
That day, Tokyo sold the yen for dollars to reduce the value of the Japanese currency, which had recently broken the record against the dollar set since 1945.
But only since then has it regularly risen supported by purchases by investors who see it as a "safe haven" in uncertain times of global economic slowdown and Europe's debt crisis.
The dollar fell back below 77 euro on Tuesday, and the euro fell below the symbolic bar of 105 euro near the levels that triggered the latest intervention.
Before the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the dollar was worth around 120 euros and the euro was worth more than 160 euros.
This flare-up of the Japanese currency is detrimental to island exports, as it makes made-in-Japan products more expensive and reduces the value of revenues obtained by Japanese firms from abroad when they convert them into domestic currency.
"Japan is recovering" from the devastation caused by the March earthquake and tsunami that devastated the Tohoku region in the northeast of the country, stressed Mr Noda, who fears that the price increase of the jen will kill the fragile recovery in the eggs.
The world's third economic powerhouse resumed growth in the third quarter (1.5% from the previous quarter) for the first time in a year thanks to a survey of export growth and consumption of households burdened by disaster.
But the Prime Minister concluded that the high value of the jen did not reflect "Japan's national economy."
Japanese Finance Minister Jun Azumi called on the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a two-day meeting of its political and monetary board on Tuesday, to take all possible measures to weaken the yen.
But the institution's vice-governor, Hirohide Yamaguchi, pointed out that the BoJ had previously taken "appropriate measures" to suggest that no additional monetary weakness could be expected on Wednesday.
At its last meeting at the end of October, the Securities And Exchange Commission increased by 5.000 billion yin (47 billion euros) its purchases of treasury bills, raising to 55.000 billion yin (519 billion euros) the cap on the amount it spends on buying various securities to flood liquidity.
Eurozone:
rates rise, exchanges fail
The risk of contagion from the debt crisis continues to undermine European indicators.
Despite the appointment of new heads of government in Greece and Italy and better growth figures in France and Germany, rates of weakened countries continue to rise.
European stock exchanges still concerned about the stability of the euro area are falling into negative expectations on Tuesday, November 15.
In Paris at 10 a.m., the CAC 40 index lost 1.4% to 3,064 points.
The Dax index in Frankfurt loses 0.4% and in London 0.1%.
"With new tensions surrounding the yields on loans from trouble-sute eurozone countries, stock markets around the world continue to make only part of recent gains".
"Nervous investors are just too aware of the risk of contagion," explains Terry Pratt, a broker at IG Markets, as quoted by Reuters.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange closed down 0.7% on concerns from market participants about Europe's ability to cope with the debt crisis.
"Japan, like the rest of the world, has its eyes on Europe, and the exchange will only continue in a narrow corridor of variations until investors have evidence that the situation is stabilized," says Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This relaunch of uncertainties about the future of the eurozone is hurting the currency itself, which continues its decline on Tuesday.
The euro is at its lowest level since a month and a half ago.
At 10 a.m., the European currency is worth $1.3570, retreating 0.4%.
According to brokers, the currency backed down after Chancellor Angela Merkel's CDU party adopted a proposal at its congress on Monday to allow countries in difficulty to leave the eurozone without having to leave the European Union.
Italian and Spanish rates far beyond 6%
Interest rates on loans in Italy and Spain remain at very worrying levels.
This morning on Tuesday, italy's 10-year bond yield is 6.85%, and the yield on Spanish 10-year bonds is 6.2%.
These tensions affecting interest rates in southern European countries, but also in France, continue to reinforce the concerns of market participants.
Mario Monti, the head of italy's future government, has strongly demanded time in the markets to remedy the situation in Italy, which is threatened by poisoning caused by the amount of its debt.
The new Greek Prime Minister, Lucas Papademos, confirmed that implementing the decisions taken at the eurozone summit on 27 October would be his government's "main task."
Spain is once again in a deliberate head of markets when elections to the Chamber of Deputies are held in the country on Sunday.
The spread between 10-year bonds between Germany and Spain has reached a new all-time high.
In anticipation of the figures announcing the growth of the euro area
Statistics show that France recorded economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter, mainly due to household consumption, i.e. slightly better than expected growth of 0.3%.
However, france's National Institute for Statistics and Economic Studies INSEE revised down the figures for the second quarter to a decline of 0.1% of GDP instead of stagnation.
And in fact, it's the fourth quarter that worries economists the most.
For its part, Germany registered growth of 0.5% during the same period.
The first estimates for the entire euro area are expected at 11am, while the European Commission has just highlighted the risk of a new recession.
Energy policy:
facts must prevail over dogmas
If there is one topic that cannot be grasped on the basis of short-term balance sheets or under emotions, it is energy policy.
The availability and price of electricity have a direct impact on the purchasing power and competitiveness of businesses.
It is natural for an election meeting to be an opportunity to think about such deposits and the place occupied by the energy of the core.
The debate will only be successful if all the economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options are explored.
The French must base their position on objective facts and rational data.
So far, there are 7 billion human beings on the planet, but demographic developments will cause a doubling of electricity demand between now and 2050 unless we want to deprive a significant part of the world's population of an important part of life.
At the same time, the lack of fossil resources will have to be addressed in order to continue generating electricity, while not forgetting the necessary need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in order to combat climate change, an idea that is currently disappearing from environmental debates.
The Fukushima accident has no effect on any of these parameters.
That is why Germany remains alone in its decision to reject nuclear energy.
However, this is not the case in Belgium, which makes its decision subject to the need to find some other source capable of replacing itself, nor switzerland, which it considers right to build only the power plants of the last generation.
On the contrary, the United Kingdom, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil, to quote at least some countries, continue their projects with determination.
After Fukushima, the United States decided to expand its park by one unit by restoring construction of one power plant interrupted after the Three Mile Island power plant disaster.
If the German renewable energy model is ever presented as an example, reality contradicts this.
Berlin's choice will be reflected in an increase in the price of electricity, increased energy dependence on gas imported from Russia in particular, a sharp increase in CO2 emissions caused by the construction of natural gas and coal power plants.
We will feel all these unpleasant effects within a few months.
The Danish case deserves us to think about it.
The European champion of wind farms, from which it receives 30% of its electricity, is also one of the largest consumers of coal and gas due to wind irregularities, which makes CO2 emissions and Danish electricity prices 65% and 50% higher than the European average, respectively.
On the contrary, thanks to the immutability of our energy policy, our neighbours will pay an electricity bill 40% higher than that of French households.
While in a globalised economy energy costs are a key factor in competitiveness and a guarantee of keeping industry in national territory, French businesses enjoy the benefits of the cheapest electricity in Europe.
For this reason, any significant reduction in the share of nuclear energy would trigger a strong increase in the price of electricity, which would make illusory beautiful statements about the re-industrialisation of our country and the defence of purchasing power.
A price that the vast majority of French people refuse to pay, just as they fundamentally do not oppose this energy, as opinion polls show.
Let us recall that our country's energy policy has enabled the sector to be built with 125 000 direct jobs and 410,000 downstream jobs.
The heavily exporting sector has attracted a large number of small and medium-sized specialised jobs to international markets that cannot be transferred abroad.
If France decided to leave the core, it would sacrifice a significant number of these small and medium-sized enterprises and lose the €6 billion a year that the country receives for exporting nuclear facilities and services.
What power plant owner would order a nuclear reactor designed to operate for 60 years while its manufacturer is scheduled to go into decline?
When dealing with the energy equation, it must be accepted that there is no magic source for energy production, nor is there any diabolical one.
The development of low-CO2 installations, nuclear installations and renewable energy installations carried out by the French industry group AREVA demonstrates the complementarity of energy sources.
In the case of nuclear energy, it is an absolute necessity to maintain the highest level of safety.
In France, we have the State Office for Nuclear Safety, which carries out uncompromising and transparent supervision of existing nuclear power plants as well as the construction of a new power plant in Flamanville.
Our teams, whose professionalism is recognized, have the idea of safety in their blood.
In 50 years, the nuclear industry has seen three serious accidents.
The only one on Three Mile Island was in normal operation conditions and was left without human casualties and environmental consequences.
In Chernobyl, the reactor concepts and inexcusable human error caused the drama.
In the case of Fukushima, some seem to forget that the accident was the result of two natural disasters of unprecedented magnitude that caused the deaths of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will learn the lessons of this accident, as it did with the previous two.
The fruit of this step and the cooperation between the French and German nuclear safety authorities, operators and designers is that the EPR reactor is a concept capable of withstanding such events.
While all those interested in building a nuclear power plant consider it, halting its construction in Flamanville would be an excellent gift offered to areva group and EDF's competitors and free up the way to take a leading position in nuclear development.
It is necessary and legitimate to seek the best energy solution for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let emotions, dogmas and machinations dominate a debate so decisive for our country's economic, social and financial situation.
Is immigration a burden or a chance for the economy?
The immigration policy implemented under Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticised from various angles - the flood of the police, the courts and the administration subject to the numbering policy, the compatibility of this policy with the status of 'country of human rights' that France boasts of.
Recently, it was administrative harassment by foreign students that became topical when the Interior Minister (see Libération newspaper of 23 May) declared that France "does not need foreign talent, masons and waitresses."
But until now, it has rarely been disassembled from the point of view of the economy.
It must be said that there is a fairly broad agreement between left and right in this area.
Jacques Chirac set the tone on the right in 1976 by saying that "900,000 unemployed should not be a problem in a country of 2 million immigrant workers" and michel rocard on the left when he said in 1990 that France "cannot accept all the misery of the world."
The only difference is the degree of generosity
In 2005, the fear of an invasion by hordes of Polish plumbers on French territory was shared on the right and left.
In both camps, immigrants are seen as a burden on the economy and French society.
The only difference lies in the degree of generosity we deign to give immigrants.
In his programme, François Hollande confines himself to banalities, ediching that joint development will make it possible to solve our 'migration problem'.
This idea of immigration as a burden and a problem may apply in elections, but it is very expensive economically.
As economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron point out in their recently published work synthesizing the latest knowledge of immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pp.): there is a broad consensus among specialists on the positive impact of migration movements on economic growth, wages and employment in countries , which accept immigrants.
Curbing immigration is crippling growth and hurting employment.
Concerns about the effects caused by migrants are based on the idea that they can replace French workers, especially the less skilled, and put downward pressure on their wages.
But experience shows that, in fact, immigrants are much more complemented than substitutes for French workers by carrying out work in understaffed sectors.
Low-skilled immigrants in sectors that do not attract French workers, and those most skilled in dynamic sectors where education is not enough to offer jobs.
Positive effect on wages
Just as a surgeon will have difficulty working in a country where there is a shortage of anaesthesiologists, these additions between French and migrants make the arrival of immigrants have a positive effect on the wages and employment of French workers.
Giovanni Peri thus calculated that the growth of migration movements by 1% will cause real wages to increase between 0.6% and 0.9% in the long term.
Yet it does not take into account the fact that the differentness of immigrants contributes to the creation of ideas and economic growth (the high proportion of naturalized immigrants among American Nobel laureates; Google, Intel, PayPal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Migrants are also net contributors to social systems in European countries, at an average of 1% of the total budget.
For example, the World Labour Organization estimates that in Germany, one immigrant aged 30 will bring a net contribution (income minus expenses) of 150,000 euros to public budgets over the lifetime.
At the beginning of his mandate, Nicolas Sarkozy expressed a desire to go for the lack of growth rates "with teeth ententented."
These teeth, used to deter immigrants, had the opposite effect.
Europe invented democracy, it remains to think about European democracy
Democracy is a rare and very fragile commodity.
The European continent should remember this, for although it was invented in Athens 2,000 years ago, it experienced the tragedies of world wars, totalitarian regimes, the Holocaust, the Gulag, but also Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal and colonels in Greece during the XX century.
Some people might have believed that for democracy to triumph definitively over its enemies, it would be enough to make a choice and make it as direct as possible.
But it has been known since Napoleon that it was an ease of thought.
Universal suffrage, while a prerequisite for democracy, is not a prerequisite and can become an "instrument of oppression," as the Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot once said.
No, democracy requires much more: public space, public spirit, values, separation and power control, education, enlightenment, social and economic solidarity, justice.
The Crisis of Europe that we are experiencing is an economic crisis, but it is just as and since the beginning of the crises of politics and democracy.
Admitting the error of a Greek yes-no referendum will be worth two revelations in this regard: exposing the need for a great return to political power, but also exposing a disturbing sense of its impossibility, its impropriet.
This ambivalence must be thought through in order to be overcome.
The truth is that the front lines of the Democratic race have shifted today, and that many of the Republican fighters are no longer firing in the right direction.
We cannot gain anything if we demand a series of national referendums organised as necessary and disorganised.
Bianko exposed to a European absolutist monarch or jumping with his legs tied into the void of nationalist depth: what a choice for a citizen!
No, we do not want guillotine knives, but a common, full, peaceful and continuous exercise of choice and democracy, this time at European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal - nor would we know where to stop the list - because the crisis is in Europe.
It is the whole of Europe, bowing to the dictates of markets and credit rating agencies, that suffers from its incompetence and lack of solidarity.
It is the whole of Europe that is being humiliated on the international stage.
We are concerned about the transfer of sovereignty to Europe - but it is the whole of Europe that is slowly losing its sovereignty and with it each of its peoples.
There is an urgent need to return the management of the European project of democratic sovereignty.
For only together will Europeans be able to reduce the burden of their debts, get rid of market governments, and prepare for the future by investing.
Exiting the crisis will presumed decisions at European level that could not be taken without full democratic legitimacy, otherwise they would lead us to disaster.
Having long fought against this proposal by the Socialists and Jacques Delors, we are all now vigorously demanding European economic government.
so.
But to think so without stronger political and democratic integration, and to be seen as such citizens, would be a new folly and a new impasse.
We must take on a new phase of European building.
In order to create a republic in France, it was necessary to "be" Republicans.
A revolution in interests couldn't be enough.
This lesson continues to apply.
We must build a Europe that is more economically integrated.
This will only be possible by building a Europe of more politically democratic and genuine European democratic sovereignty.
Let us become Europeans to build Europe.
"Contactless" smart cards spread
In an optimistic atmosphere, the World Smart Card Fair will open on Tuesday in Villepinte, near Paris.
According to Eurosmart, 2011 should end with an 11% increase in global sales of microprocessor cards (bank cards, SIM card phones) to more than 6 billion units.
The most carrier is the contactless technology segment, which allows you to pay on public transport or make purchases just by zooming the card to the reader.
This year, 460 million smart cards are expected to be sold worldwide, compared to 320 million sold a year earlier!
Their share is expected to increase further in 2012 (an expected 580 million units) and reach approximately 10% of the total smart card market (6.925 million cards).
After being towing APEC countries for a long time, Europe is gaining ground in contactless payment.
Approximately 26 million Visa bank cards are already equipped with this feature and 75,000 payment terminals accept them.
In France, the beginnings are more modest: 400,000 contactless Visa cards have been issued.
But the big retail chains work for two.
Carrefour released 2.5 million Contactless Pass MasterCards this year.
In order to include a higher gear, banks need to equip their clients with them from now on.
"Two large French companies have committed to systematically distributing contactless bank cards to their clients in the future," announces Gérard Nébouy, Managing Director of Visa Europe France.
Banks test mobile payments
But this is only the first stage to the payment instrument of the future: a mobile phone.
Today, only a small number of devices are equipped with NFC (Near Field Communication) technology required to perform transactions.
"They're late."
"But their real expansion should happen next year."
"For 2012, we estimate their sales worldwide at between 80 and 120 million units," explains Marc Bertin, President of Eurosmart.
But the banks are already preparing in advance.
Crédit agricole yesterday announced the launch of a test in Caen, which will last from December to June next year.
About 200 clients and coworkers will be equipped with a case allowing contactless payments.
BPCE has similar projects in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And société générale announced yesterday that it is preparing to introduce an offer allowing its clients to pay by mobile phone without contact.
Terrorist front stretches from Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is concerned about ties between Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and Boko Haram.
Longstanding suspicions that there are ties between the al-Qaeda terrorist group in the Islamic Maghreb (AQMI) and the Nigerien sect Boko Haram are confirmed.
On Sunday, Algeria's Deputy Foreign Minister Abdelkader Messahel even admitted that Algeria had now "gained confidence" about it.
"The way both organizations operate and intelligence reports show that there is a lot of cooperation between them," he explained, without elaborating.
Paris seems to have similar analyses.
An investigation into the january 2010 kidnapping of two Frenchmen in Niger could help shed light on the connecting bridges.
After being abducted by AQMI members from a restaurant in Niamey, Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory were to be killed the following day at the same time as several of their captors in an operation carried out by special French troops.
French and Nigerian investigators were supposed to find several phones with chips belonging to the terrorists in the rubble after the raid.
Terrorist axis
Analysis of calls made leads to several people in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), investigators are particularly interested in two figures: one leading to a Nigerian who has long resided in Maiduguri, a town in northern Nigeria that is the cradle of Boko Haram, and the other to a man said to be close to AQMI and the sect.
"This is progress, but we must undoubtedly wait for more convincing evidence before we start talking about operational cooperation between AQMI and Boko Haram".
"But it's possible."
"We have known for years that the sect enjoys external financial and intellectual support and is becoming more and more active," says Nigerian investigator Kunle Amuwo.
In recent months, this "support" has become more and more evident in the development and manifestations of Boko Haram or in its operational procedures, which from now on include human casualties or increasingly complex explosive devices of the same design as those used by AQMI.
The international community, led by Washington, has since put pressure on Nigeria to take into account the problems raised by Boko Haram.
In fact, the Nigerian authorities have long regarded the group as a community of enlightened mystics of little worthy interest.
Rapid success
Boko Haram was founded in 2002 in Maiduguri around the mosque, school and fundamentalist Mohammed Yusuf. Boko Haram, which means "Western education is a sin" in the language of haoussa, approves the establishment of an Islamic emirate in Nigeria's Muslim north.
In this poor region, such a connection is a quick success.
The sect is politicized and requires strict adherence to Islamic sharia law, while its supporters begin the fight against the central government.
These people focus first on churches, bars and authorities.
In 2009, Boko Haram supporters became extremely active, multiplying their attacks against police stations.
As usual, the government's response is still the same.
The army surrounds the city, resulting in 800 deaths.
The founder of the sect, Mohammed Yusuf, is captured and killed in prison.
Since then, the group has become radicalized and is leaving its post in the north.
At Christmas 2010, he carried out an assassination in jos, which killed 80 people, and then another in the capital, Abuja.
In June, it is again in Abuja, where Boko Haram will attack police headquarters in its first suicide attack.
And in August, the U.N. local office will be the first international target.
The creation of a terrorist wassuau in Africa, which should run from Mauritania via Nigeria to Somalia, is now worrying all security specialists.
Now that Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb has surrounded Mali, and al-Shabab Somalis and Somalis are operating in Kenya, Boko Haram is emerging as a new danger to the continent.
Speaking to Goodluck President Jonathan Juppé in Nigeria last week, He said France was on high alert and ready to "pass on all information."
The world according to presidential candidates
On issues related to China, Iran, or aid to Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, and Rick Perry are competing in simplification and ignorance.
Can a crisis-weakened America manage the world with simple or even simplistic ideas?
Listening to presidential candidates, voters might think so.
For days now, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry, and others have been repeating the sauching statements and brief instructions on foreign policy that have traditionally been a strong point for Republicans.
Often unsubstantiated slogans about China, Iran, or aid to Israel blend in.
Mitt Romney, the top-10 candidate in the race for the Republican "Grand Old Party" nomination, threatened to call the Chinese before the World Trade Organization and charge them "for manipulating their currency," a theme in America that has been inflamed by the migration of entire parts of its industry toward Asia.
All the worse if this must include starting a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, Obama's former ambassador to China and the only candidate with some sophisticated foreign policy vision, almost got caught up in a stance that "smooths" emotions.
It required a tough but constructive dialogue with Beijing (President Obama's current position).
But Huntsman, who is last in the polls, remains unassvincing.
In the image of President Reagan
Romney also promised military strikes on Iran if sanctions fail to halt its nuclear program.
"If elected, I will imprison Iran," he said fanfare.
"If Obama is re-elected, they'll have a bomb."
He also promised to increase military aid to Israel, accusing Obama of being a failed in his duties to that partner.
Businessman Herman Cain, the second-best-placed candidate, demonstrates an embarrassing ignorance of the documents.
He recently called for a tough stance against china's military threat because Beijing is "trying to develop nuclear capabilities" - clearly unaware of the fact that China has owned a nuclear weapon since 1964!
Texas Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants strikes against Iran, says he's ready to send the U.S. military to Mexico to fight drug cartels.
The use of torture against presumptive terrorists banned by Obama in 2009 is also recommended by Caine, Perry, and another candidate, Michele Bachmann.
They are all far different from republican nominee John McCain, a heavyweight on foreign policy, in 2008.
Opponents of the current president say Reagan had simple ideas, too, and yet he won the Cold War.
They recall that Obama himself was an amateur and that he added water to his wine on the fight against terrorism.
They highlight the failure of his naïve dialogue with Iran, the hasty withdrawal of the boys from Iraq, his excuses for Libya, and thus attribute the label of weak
But the attack isn't easy.
The population is viewing President Obama's national security policy, which removed Ben Laden, rather positively.
He has no confidence in military interventions from Iraq that lead to a mired.
And with arguments that America needs to be reconstructed economically in order to resuscitate its leadership, Obama is knocking in a more right place.
Nord Stream, russia's new gas port of entry to Europe
The Nord Stream long-distance gas pipeline connecting Eastern Europe directly to Russia and running along the bottom of the Baltic Sea has begun to work.
It must supply gas equivalent to the equivalent of 30 million households.
Gazprom, the Russian gas giant, wanted to celebrate the event properly.
More than 500 guests, including four heads of state and government, attended the inauguration last Tuesday of Nord Stream, a new pipeline that will connect Russia and Germany directly under the sea.
Symbolically, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fillon and his Dutch colleague Mark Rutte turned the control wheel of the valve controlling the entry of Russian gas into the Western European network together.
With this new pipeline, 27.5 billion additional cubic meters of Russian gas will begin to flow into Western Europe each year through the first 1,224 km pipeline connecting the St. Petersburg region with the Federal State of Mecklenburg-Pomerana.
The second pipeline, which must be completed at the end of 2012, will allow a total of 55 billion cubic metres of gas to be supplied, a quantity equal to all French consumption.
And it is already recalled the possibility of building a third pipeline on the same route.
For Gazprom, the timely completion of this huge construction has the character of a victory.
Poland and the Baltic countries strongly objected to the project.
In fact, Nord Stream will allow gas to be supplied directly to Germany without being routed around the country by a third state (Poland or Ukraine).
Suddenly, the two countries are losing some power: the possibility of pressing Russia by threats to close its access to Western European markets is becoming more difficult for them.
Warsaw expressed this most strongly when it did not hesitate to compare Nord Stream to the "new German-Soviet pact," referring to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin during the occupation of Poland in 1939.
It means saying that this is a politically sensitive subject.
Western Europe has gained greater certainty in its purchases by supporting this Russian project.
But this is at the cost of weakening Europe's energy, because the project has created rifts between Europeans from east and west.
Barely five years ago, Russia succeeded in pushing through its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and wealthy, gas-rich Western states whose deposits are nearing their end.
"This pipeline is part of our partnership with Russia, a new artery that connects us organically," François Fillon confirmed at the opening ceremony of the pipeline, demonstrating the point at which large gas contracts are both political and economic.
All this explains the broad smiles of Gazprom executives present in large numbers in Lubmin, the gas supply points.
The construction of this pipeline is also an important technical act.
The undersea pipe is made of steel fitted with a concrete casing to protect it from the anchors of seagoing vessels.
It lies at the bottom of the sea at an average depth of 200 m.
During its construction, minefields dating back to World War II had to be avoided.
"For safety reasons, almost 100 had to be removed or destroyed," says Jens Müller, a nord stream spokesman.
Measures to protect fauna and flora also needed to be increased.
The pipe itself is a long metal snake weighing like the 242 Eiffel Towers, which is not interrupted anywhere on its entire length by valves or maintenance stations.
One control platform was supposed to be built near Sweden, but was rejected by project managers when the Swedes were little wanted to see the Russian state-owned company permanently settle off their coast.
"In the event of a fault, we will stop the gas passage in less than 1 minute", says Jens Müller.
In the event of a leak, the gas contained in the pipeline will escape into the air.
But this case is considered unlikely by the builder, since the welds were designed to cause a leak once every 100,000 years.
An underwater robot pulled by a ship performs an inspection of the condition of the pipeline from the outside, while the inside of the pipeline is controlled by equipment circulating inside.
This cigar-shaped device with a diameter of 1 meter is introduced into the inside of the pipe and is pushed by gas.
At the finish line, after a full three days of travel at 3 m/s, it will provide accurate information on possible deformations of metal parts.
The long-distance pipeline was designed to operate for 50 years without the slightest repair.
Gas circulation is simply ensured by pressure.
The value of this pressure is 200 bar at the start and 100 bar at the finish.
Five companies have joined forces to implement this project.
Gazprom remains the leader, holding a 51% stake.
He was joined by German companies E.ON and BASF (15.5% each), as well as Dutch company Gasunie and French group GDF Suez (9% each).
The five companies created a joint venture called Nord Stream in charge of building and operating the pipeline.
The company is headquartered in Zoug, Switzerland, where taxation is extremely advantageous.
Gazprom subsequently leased the company all its gas transport capacity for five years under a contract that could be renewed.
"Gazprom will profit from total capacity, whatever the amount of real gas transported," says Jens Müller.
Financing of the construction of the pipeline was secured by 30% by shareholders and 70% by bank loans.
The total cost of the works should reach EUR 7.4 billion for both pipelines.
For GDF Suez, the investment costs thus increased to 240 million.
But minority shareholders are confident that their costs will be remedied, because only Gazprom takes the risk.
The pipeline exits from the Baltic Sea in Lubmin on a sandy coastline with pine forests.
Valves 4.5 meters high form the gas outlet gate.
The sensors measure the pressure, temperature and other characteristics of incoming gas before it is transported to German gas pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, this terminal has been receiving one million cubic meters of Russian gas every hour.
When full capacity is reached, it will be 3 million per hour and in 2012 6 million.
Moleskine BrandEd Notebook
The Italian company Moleskine, founded 50 years ago, wants to provide the joy of writing again.
It brings the smell of adventure, hours spent writing by candlelight.
Moleskine's notebook is easily recognizable by its black rectangular plates and its leaves of faded white color as if they had aged over time.
After all, moleskine's notebook, as we know it today, was born in 1997.
Milan-based Italian company Modo Modo will then decide to launch a new design but dissected notebook.
Maria Sebregondi, then a consultant working for the company, is taking over the launch of the new product.
The notebook is inspired by the old production technique "moleskin" (imitation leather), which is used, for example, to modify the surface of benches.
This type of notebook was highly appreciated by writers and travellers.
" Moleskine returned to popularity an old and forgotten object that was an icon of avant-garde artists until the XXth century", says Maria Sebregondi, who has since become a brand leader at Modo Modo.
Success is here.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales rose 26% to settle at 12.7 million units last year.
The situation is far removed from the secret production of the first years, when only 3,000 notebooks were made.
Moleskine crosses italy's borders and is exported to 70 countries from France to the United States.
It is difficult to compile some artificial portrait of the buyer, since the notebook attracts a businessman as well as a student or professionals.
Moleskine's image includes that its owners are people of cosmopolitan, cultured and open spirit.
The small Italian company, which had 12 employees in its early days, now has nearly 100 employees and has had two offices since 2008, one in Milan and the other in New York.
He sends his notebooks to bookstores and through the FNAC store chain to small boutiques in the city centers where he could assert his identity.
"We followed the spirit of the times and this need for new writing, despite the tumultuous development of emails," explains Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural signature accompanies the development of the Moleskine notebook: recently, the brand opened an exhibition, "The Walk," where architects or artists display their notebooks.
In August, on the occasion of the Locarno Film Festival, she also released new notebook plates resembling a leopard.
Moleskine benefits from its success and this cultural aura and diversifies its products: bags, diaries, pencils, laptop cases ... The brand extends to a wide range of carriers.
An envy-industed success: in the autumn of 2006, Modo Modo was bought by investment funds SG Capital Europe,now Syntegra Capital, writing a new page in moleskine history.
Why is the proportion of unemployed handicapped workers so high?
About 19% of handicapped people are looking for work.
Today opens on 15. A week for employing the handicapped.
Despite the voluntary public policy introduced in 2005, the percentage of unemployed people with disabilities is still twice as high as the average, i.e. 19% versus 9% for the entire population.
Is it depressing?
"No," says Éric Blanchet, ceo of Adapt, which organizes The Week for the Employment of the Handicapped."
"The progress made in 15 years is remarkable."
"At that time, the percentage of the unemployed was not two, but three times higher."
"However, much remains to be done."
It must be said that for unemployed disabled people, numerous obstacles remain before they start work.
These are the elderly: 37% are over 50 years old (17% on average).
They are low-skilled: 80% do not have a high school diploma, and of the 2.3 million university students, only 10,000 are handicapped.
Finally, long-term unemployment is widespread: 53% for the handicapped versus 38% on average.
In short, these are criteria that make it particularly difficult to return to work and which are at the heart of the problem, according to Christian Grapin, ceo of Tremplin, which was founded in 1992 to help businesses hire disabled workers.
So much for objective brakes.
What remains is unspoken, ways of thinking that are surely evolving, but too slowly.
A study conducted in April by the IMS-Entreprendre pour la Cité association found that the managers interviewed had a "low level of knowledge about people with disabilities" with an exaggerated notion of people in wheelchairs and mental or mental shortcomings.
As a result, private enterprises with more than 20 employees are still a long way from achieving the goal of employing 6% of the handicapped workers set out in the 1987 Law.
The most recent known figures, which date back to 2008, give a status equal to 2.6%.
"We are now around 3%," says Pierre Blanc, ceo of Agefiph, an organization charged with collecting fees from businesses that do not comply with the law.
This is evidenced by the number of 'fined' undertakings, as well as the amounts paid, which fell from 59,000 to 46,000 (and from €606 million to €480 million) between 2007 and 2011.
" The 2005 law, which increased contributions, put a lot of pressure on businesses, explains Pierre Blanc."
But this improvement also demonstrates real awareness, especially in large enterprises."
According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59% of enterprises with 20 to 49 employees employ disabled workers, compared to 82% of enterprises with 100 to 199 employees.
Gambling:"How lucky"
Before they challenge the French national team (Bleus), Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens on Tuesday night (8pm), they did not hide the pleasure of this friendly match.
We're not going to go so far as to write that there was a conspiracy between them, but the picture is symbolic.
Sitting side by side in the stands of the Stade de France, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard reconciled.
Five months after his striker's angry gesture against Turkey, the Belgian coach gave only words of praise to his player.
"I am very satisfied with Eden and his progress, as well as the fact that he loves his country".
"I want to move forward," assures the Player of French Lille.
As for the difference between his performances in club matches and national team matches," it's one and the same, he justifies it."
"I've been in Lille all year, which is not the case with Belgium."
"I need to clean up my brand."
Hazard, saved against Romania on Thursday night for this match against France, comes to the stadium in Saint-Denis to finally "shine."
The concept of 'joy' cannot be omited.
To play against Bleus, who he encouraged from the age of 7 and in their winning campaigns in 1998 and 2000.
"I've always been a fan," he says.
This necessarily contributes even more to the "special" nature of this meeting.
All the more so because opposite" are Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami) ", he recalls.
"We crossed immediately."
"Being able to play against them is just a pleasure!"
Kind-heartedly, Leekens also recalled "pride."
"Pride" to fight "match - holiday".
"Pride" also stated in the quality of the "neighbors" that France had "once again become a very high-level team" a little more than a year after the trauma in the South African city of Knysna.
"Laurent Blanc has done a tremendous job," he said.
Although Belgium will be absent from the next European Championships, the technical footballer would like to see the French on a plane in 2014... Brazil.
"Our little Belgians will become great," he underlined.
"We're building something right now, the players are ambitious, they're hungry."
"You'll realize it for the next few games." Including the one against France.
Portugal very confident
Portuguese coach Paulo Bento opens the campaign against Bosnia Bosnia (22,000) this Wednesday in Lisbon with great optimism.
Both teams lacked realism on the way there.
"At the end of those 90 minutes, we're going to be a happy team and, above all, a happy country."
Paulo Bento already sees himself in Poland and Ukraine.
For him, there is no shadow of doubt. The Portuguese national football team, at the helm since 2010, will qualify for Euro 2012.
Portugal is actually 90 minutes away from happiness.
There is one match left to play and one opponent - Bosnia.
Knowing Friday's result (0-0) in the hell of Bosnian Zenice, it seems clear that nothing is won.
Portugal certainly had the upper hand for more than an hour, but they were unable to score such a rare goal to ease it.
"It's a good result, but it does contain risk because we didn't score outside."
But back home at their amazing Stade de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are confident of going ahead in front of an audience that should create a screeding cauldron, even if the match certainly seems "very even," says the optimist but sharp-minded Bento.
"We expect a very even match, but we are absolutely convinced that we can have the upper hand," said the 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
"We still have a 50% chance of being at Euro 2012," said Carlos Queiro's successor.
Friday's tie in Bosnia forces the Portuguese to score and win.
A tie can be enough for bosnians who also need to score.
"It's a good result, but it does take a risk because we didn't score outside," Bento regrets.
"We will play against a team that has great technical qualities and that has players with great individual qualities," he added.
As in Zenica, the Portuguese will be interested in exerting maximum pressure on the Bosnian team from the outset so as not to give them time to think."
Good idea, on the condition that this time it turns out to be realistic.
