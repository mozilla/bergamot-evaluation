The Prague Stock Exchange fell to a minus at the end of trading
After the morning sharp drop, the Prague Stock Exchange corrected the losses.
Transactions in CEZ shares accounted for almost half of the normal daily trade.
The Prague Stock Exchange followed up its monday slump from the start of Tuesday trading, falling by almost six percent.
This time, the decline is caused by a drop in Stocks on Wall Street.
In our country, the market's reaction to the outcome of the US House of Representatives vote, which refused to support the plan to stabilise the financial sector there, is also reflected.
Stock fall in Asia
Stocks on The Asia Stock Exchange experienced a dramatic fall on Tuesday, although indices eventually erased some of the losses throughout the day.
The Hong Kong Stock Exchange's Hang Seng index wrote off nearly four percent in trading, but later erased some of the losses, reducing the decline to about 2.5 percent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises index, which tracks the movement of Chinese stocks on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, fell 3.8 percent, with markets closed in Shanghai.
Shares on the Sydney Stock Exchange lost more than five per cent, but eventually reduced their losses to 4.3 per cent.
Taiwan's stock market fell 3.6 percent, according to its index.
"The timing of the US bailout is uncertain and will affect financial markets around the world," said Joseph Yam, head of Hong Kong's monetary authority.
Hong Kong, although part of China, determines monetary policy independently, without depending on china's central bank.
Interest rates are at the same level as the United States.
US lawmakers should quickly return to negotiations and approve a proposal to support the financial system, according to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd.
Otherwise, they say, other countries are in danger of feeling the effects.
The BloodBath of U.S. Stocks
The US House of Representatives on Monday rejected a plan to support the financial system, which was to be spent up to $700 billion (nearly $12 trillion).
Lawmakers thus ignored President George Bush's call to support the plan.
According to Bush, the plan would address the root causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the entire economy.
U.S. stocks experienced a bloodbath on Monday, and major stock indices recorded their biggest fall in more than 20 years.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell nearly seven percent, and the last time it fell to a similar extent was in 1987.
The index was already falling before the vote, but as soon as it became clear that the motion had failed in the House, the index fell in freefall.
Congress backtracks: US government can pump $700 billion into banks
Top us congressional leaders and President George W. Bush's administration have agreed on a broader version of the financial aid agreement for america's financial system.
It will be voted on early next week.
US lawmakers have made a breakthrough in talks to approve a $700 billion (about 12 trillion kroner) bailout plan for the US financial system.
But it hasn't been won yet.
Congressmen must finalize some details of the agreement before they can release the final version of the bill and vote on it.
The plan to support the financial system will be discussed in the House of Representatives on Monday.
Barney Frank, chairman of the House Banking and Financial Services Committee, told Reuters on Sunday.
Sources say the plan could not be voted on until Wednesday at the time, according to sources.
According to economists, the announcement that the rescue plan will be approved should be the first significant psychological factor for the recovery of financial markets.
After that, however, there will be "sobriety" due to the complexity of the mechanisms by which to help markets achieve even in practice.
Paulson: Plan must be effective
"We've made great progress.
We have resolved our differences about what the market stabilization package should look like," Democrat Nancy Pelosi told Bloomberg.
According to her, a final vote could take place as early as Sunday.
Lawmakers met with U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson on Sunday night to finally form a government fund.
It should buy off unsellable mortgage assets from financial companies, which drag financial firms into heavy losses and threaten the stability of the entire system.
"We are on the verge of a definitive agreement on a plan that will work and must also be effective on the market.
We still need to continue with the recovery plan, but I think we're there," Paulson said.
Signal for Asian trading
The global financial crisis is affecting stock markets, which are falling sharply.
According to Nevada Democratic Senator Harry Reid, lawmakers are trying to reach a final agreement in Congress as early as Sunday.
They want to reassure investors before trading in Asian financial markets, which are the first in the time zone where a congressional decision could affect Monday trading.
But it is not yet clear when both houses of the US Congress will vote on the bill, or whether last-minute negotiations can get stuck on a problem.
Lawmakers hope it will be approved in the next few days.
However, the law still has a number of changes to make.
The total amount intended to assist the system is to be divided into two parts.
The initial $350 billion is to be made available as soon as possible, as Requested by President George Bush.
But Congress can block the release of the remaining amount if it feels the program is not fulfilling its function, in a sequence of another $100 billion and later a final $350 billion.
Bush praised progress in negotiations
While the president may veto the decision, Congress may over-vote on his veto.
But despite these changes, the basic idea of a program to raise funds to buy back bad mortgage securities, the value of which has plummeted because hundreds of thousands of Americans are unable to pay their mortgages, has been preserved.
"We've worked everything out.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on the bill on Sunday and the Senate on Monday," said Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
Us President Bush is also pleased with the progress of the negotiations.
His spokesman, Tony Fratto, said Bush is pleased with Saturday's progress and appreciates "bipartisan efforts to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy."
Limitations on golden parachutes
Senate Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd, the lead negotiator, said lawmakers agreed on responsibility for the money program, protecting taxpayers from losses, closing concessions, timing of funding for the plan.
The new law also to limit the so-called golden parachutes for directors of company participants in the program and establishes a committee to supervise the fund.
It should be run by the Treasury.
We've worked very this, and we've made great progress toward an agreement that works and is useful to the market and to all Americans, Paulson said.
The plan also provides assistance for homeowners who are having repayment problems.
The government should negotiate new repayments on the mortgages it buys in order to reduce the monthly cost of repayments for borrowers and allow them to keep their homes.
Marek: Psychological assistance
According to Patria Finance Chief Economist David Mark, the proposed plan is a good idea, but it will be very difficult to implement.
"This is because it is not known what mechanism and at what price the troubled assets will be purchased.
This will determine how the financial sector and the government split the losses," Marek told the iHNed.cz this week.
Whether the plan will be approved now or early next week is not that important, according to Mark.
"It is far more important that this week the congressors agree to support this plan and to make it as possible.
The psychological significance of the agreement to be approved is the most important at the moment," Marek stressed.
The triumph of right-wing populists in Austria, together they have 29 percent
According to early preliminary results, Sunday's early parliamentary elections in Austria have resulted in a marked weakening of both sides of the current grand coalition and a significant strengthening of right-wing populist parties.
The Austrian People's Party (ÖVP) has suffered particularly heavy losses, with the position of current President Wilhelm Molterer seriously shaking.
On the contrary, the electoral leader of the Union for the Future of Austria (BZÖ), Carinthian Governor Jörg Haider, is preparing a triumphant return to national politics.
According to preliminary results, it remains the strongest party in the country of social democracy (SPÖ) with 29.8 percent of the vote, but loses 5.5 percent of the vote compared to the last election in 2006.
Even worse was the ÖVP, which is losing almost nine percent of the vote with 25.6 percent.
These are the worst results of both these major parties in Austria's post-war history, and a disastrous result, especially for the People's Party, which triggered early elections.
As early as early July, when the ÖVP left the coalition, the People's Party had a significant lead over the SPÖ in preferences.
But voters apparently punished them for letting the government fail.
Speculation about the possible resignation of the party chairman and current vice-chancellor Wilhelm Molterer was already in the first reaction to the results.
Observers believe this could happen as early as Monday at an extraordinary meeting of the party's bureau.
Such a development would probably make it easier to get to the most likely outcome of the election result, which is to renew the grand coalition between the SPÖ and the ÖVP.
But, with the two right-wing populist parties strengthening - the Frees (FPÖ) gained a provisional 18 percent and the BZÖ 11 percent of the vote - the Social Democrats also expressed concern about a repeat of 1999, when the People's Party agreed with the populists (the FPÖ was still united then, split from the BZÖ in 2005) on a joint government that even triggered sanctions by the European Union.
Haider, who has already stated that he is ready to work with any party and envisages a return to Vienna for national politics, is clearly betting on this development.
The Green Party also entered parliament, but lost slightly and fell from third to fifth place among Austrian political parties.
Apparently, none of the other parties over 4% have crossed the threshold and have not made it to parliament.
Knife-edge duel: MP3 players against mobiles.
We will advise you on how to choose
While almost every mobile can play MP3 files, no MP3 player can make a phone call.
From this it seems clear that it is better to buy only a phone.
Still, there are enough reasons to get a standalone player.
The choice depends entirely on the method of use and the claims of the future owner.
It's probably hard to get a high-end, expensive record player home to listen to Maxim Turbulenc's latest album.
On the one hand, such music products do not come out on LP records and from a qualitative point of view there is no objective reason for this.
However, if vinyl with art rock, jazz or blues is on your shelves, you will probably at least dream of such a record player.
It is the same with music on the go, i.e. music compressed, simplified - music in MP3.
Here, too, there are price and quality categories.
It may be unacceptable for some to spend 8,000 crowns on a player, just as a Pink Floyd fan will have a hard time biting a 20-crown headphone from the market.
Two extremes, between which there is enough space for everyone.
The selection is wide.
Battery life also determines
Some high-end music players can do much more than just play music, but what most mobiles can't do at all.
No current device is as versatile as a phone.
In addition to primary functions, telephony and texting, he can play music and video, record both, have a better, worse camera and even navigate.
And considering smartphones and communicators, you'll have a small computer in your pocket.
It's a little miracle, because no fridge can grill and no TV can take pictures.
The versatility of the mobile also brings disadvantages.
The more features you use on your mobile, the sooner the indicator on the display will send you to the charger.
And playing music is one of the biggest energy eaters.
Few mobiles can play music for more than ten or twelve hours, most of them much less.
In this respect, music players (especially the simplest ones) are significantly more powerful.
For cheap mobiles, be aware that they won't play for more than a few hours.
If you call again and there, get another charger to work just in case - this also applies to more expensive devices.
With MP3 players, you won't have this problem, even the worse ones last at least 9 hours of continuous operation on a single charge.
Another problem occurs when recording music to mobile.
Unfortunately, only a limited part of the devices has a universal USB connector, and not every one of them can be directly connected to the computer without special software.
Of course, music can be recorded directly on a memory card, but few card readers can handle the miniature memory cards used in mobiles without reduction.
With players with exceptions (iPod), you don't need any special software.
Just fill the device with USB music from your computer.
Most mobiles and players already create a music library sorted by artist name, album title, genre or user rating.
Some devices display only the directory tree structure similar to Windows Explorer, and some can do both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smartphones with the operating system).
Players are easier to operate, mobiles can do more
When choosing a specific device, be especially interested in battery life, memory capacity, quality and type of audio output and, of course, the comfort of operation.
If music is primarily a backdrop for you and if you listen to it every day only briefly on a tram, you only need any mobile that plays MP3.
Which almost any cell phone can do.
You don't even have to watch too much what music formats your mobile or player can do.
MP3 can handle everyone, and the vast majority of music that gets to you will be in this format.
It is one of the most widely used and in addition to it, the vast majority of devices can also handle WMA music.
Less AAC (the format used by Apple and its iPods) occurs less.
Better mobiles also allow, for example, the purchase of music online.
Just visit the relevant website of the operator (or another provider) via the mobile internet and buy a song or album.
This service alone could be a strong argument for acquiring a music mobile.
Unfortunately, the offer of operators is lousy and is mostly limited to fast-fermented radio hits.
Prices are also not the lowest.
However, it is generally assumed that this way of selling music (whether via GSM, the Internet or wireless internet) will dominate the music industry in the future.
Most people carry their cell phones around all the time.
Whenever you feel like listening to something, you can feel the phone in your pocket, while the MP3 player lies forgotten at home.
However, it still depends on whether you always carry headphones or at least wired hands-free.
If not, you can take advantage of the integrated speaker that almost every mobile has, but only a minimum of MP3 players.
Perhaps the biggest advantage of music mobiles will be the price for many.
The cheapest ones normally cost under three thousand.
For three and four thousand crowns you will already get a very decent Walkman.
However, you will usually be limited by the absence of output on regular headphones.
The best and most technically equipped phones with a 3.5 mm socket for regular headphones cost up to fifteen thousand.
The advantage of the players is, among other things, easy operation.
The simplest - not necessarily the cheapest (see our selection) - the players can be controlled by anyone.
The minimum of functions, the similarity of control with a previously common tape recorder or a turntable is obvious.
There is no risk of collision in the form of a mistakenly turned on mobile internet and then a huge bill for data transmission.
What device to reach for
Even the cheapest mobiles (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have a slot for interchangeable memory cards (type M2, microSD, etc.).
Even with the purchase of the relevant card, you can fit up to two thousand crowns.
But beware.
For basic models, only cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB are supported.
Only the most expensive can handle even 8 GB of memory devices.
If you already have a mobile and still want to buy a cheap MP3 player, reach for Coron, Creativ, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or iriver.
Depending on the capacity (max. 2 GB), you do not have to spend more than 1,100 CROWNS.
If you are one of the more demanding listeners, you better reach for specialized mobiles - walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some Nokias and Samsungs).
These devices have separate control buttons for MP3 and the operator's comfort is thus close to a separate MP3 player.
The furthest is in the Sony Ericsson industry, whose walkman mobiles have the same user interface as separately sold MP3 players.
The same service and in the same price category up to four thousand crowns, but with more memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and battery life (normally 15 hours, up to a maximum of 35 hours), will take mp3 players away from the above brands.
The first virtual operator will arrive in the Czech Republic already this year.
maybe
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is quite mature and our operators offer virtually all services as their partners in Western Europe.
Yet we are missing something here - a virtual operator that would make the classic ones cheaper.
Maybe he won't be missing long.
We have written many times about the fact that Czech operators are among the most expensive Mobil.cz the world.
This was confirmed by the CTO, which pointed out that the price of SMS is higher in our country than in the rest of the Union.
After the latest steps of the European Commission in the field of regulation of roaming charges, a paradoxical situation may occur - for some customers of Czech mobile operators, SMS from abroad will be cheaper than at home.
How is it possible that prices in the Czech Republic are holding so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, there is no competition that really wants to fight.
It may sound paradoxical, we have three mobile networks and penetration well over 100%.
Mobile operators, on the other hand, like to play on the fact that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
Pavel Dvořák, president of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Authority (CTU), often invites them to do this, who has stated several times in the past that there is no place for another operator in the Czech Republic.
It is probably true that a classic operator with its own network probably doesn't have much of a chance anymore (after all, it would probably be difficult to find frequencies anymore).
But there is another option - a virtual operator.
It was the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market that brought about a significant reduction in prices, to which even classic operators had to respond.
Even before the entry of pikes such as Tesco Mobile and Virgin Mobile into the market, there were similar voices in the UK as in our country.
However, it turned out that the place for such operators is and can be really successful.
After all, we don't have to go too far for examples.
In February this year, we informed you about the launch of the virtual operator Mobilking in Poland.
In just six months, this operator managed to gain more than 100,000 customers and become the fifth largest operator there.
Mobilking is behind the Penta Financial Group, which owns, among others, U:fona in the Czech Republic.
The advantage of virtual operators is the ability to focus on a much more specific target group.
They only need far fewer customers than a conventional operator to function efficiently.
They do not entail relatively high costs for the construction, operation and maintenance of the mobile network.
In the world, virtual operators are usually profiled as low-cost - they offer cheap calls and SMS, but this is often outweighed by a narrower range of services.
For example, Tesco Mobile in the UK offers SMS at least half as cheaply as its competitors.
However, as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, betting on a novel target group can also be a pretty good move.
This operator focuses specifically on men.
"The right guys choose Mobilking - an operator they like and trust," says David Seibertz CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, which operates the virtual operator.
It is difficult to say whether a similar concept as in Poland could be caught in our country.
Miroslav Čepický, a spokesman for Vodafone, doubts this: "The Czech market is relatively small for the segment approach on which most virtual operators are based.
Moreover, it is relatively saturated in terms of service offerings."
No chance in the Czech Republic, say mobile operators
However, it seems almost certain that if there is a virtual mobile operator in the Czech Republic, it will not be Mobilking.
"We are talking about the expansion of this successful project, but in the Czech Republic the negotiations do not look very promising.
Rather, Mobilking will be launched in other countries in our region," Jana Studničková, spokeswoman for the Penta Financial Group, said in Mobil.cz interview with The Czech Republic.
Indirectly, it confirmed that existing mobile operators in the Czech Republic are definitely not in favour of this idea.
On the contrary, it tries to do everything to ensure that no potential competitor arises.
Gts Novera group has been interested in launching a virtual mobile operator for some time, so it would like to take the next step towards becoming a real competitor of O2 Telefónica in the field of corporate customers.
"We are very interested in offering our customers not only fixed but also mobile telecommunication services.
And the sooner the better.
We have repeatedly discussed this possibility with all Czech mobile operators.
We have already made progress with some of them in the negotiations," says Pavel Kaidl, the group's spokesman.
Maybe it's a good time, then.
From unofficial information, it seems that we should be looking forward to the first virtual operator perhaps by the end of the year.
For now, however, its creation is accompanied by an impenetrable wall of silence.
"At the moment, we do not believe that there is room on the Czech market for the creation of a full-fledged virtual operator.
The Czech market is very specific compared to other markets.
So far, we have not been approached by any entity with a comprehensive and serious project in this area," vlastimil Sršeň from the press department of Telefónika O2 said in a statement to Mobil.cz.
Other operators also refer to the specificity of the Czech market.
Martina Kemrová, a spokeswoman for T-Mobile, adds in rare agreement with the O2 statement: "So far, we have not seen any viable and mutually beneficial business project on which to continue to build."
He adds: "It is difficult to find a virtual operator in the T-Mobile network by the end of the year.
At this point, we would have to have a concrete agreement on the table in order to think in this short term."
Vodafone is focusing its attention more on meeting the requirements of its own 3G license.
Miroslav Čepický says: "We are open to negotiations with potential virtual operators, especially in the area of cost and infrastructure sharing.
This is what we consider most profitable from the point of view of our customers.
Vodafone's main strategy in this area is to find a partner to build a shared network for fast mobile internet."
Responsible authorities - one hand with operators
The progress of mobile operators is easy to understand, the entry of another operator would mean increased competition, would lead to a decrease in prices and thus a decrease in their profits.
So why make it easier for such a competitor to take over?
The tug-of-shreed of the U:5n formation also proves that when operators are up to something, they can pull together.
Probably the greatest pressure towards the CTO went at the time of the creation of U:fona from T-Mobile.
This is evidenced by publicly available information from the CTO website.
Now, however, U:fon is a good argument for not admiving a virtual operator.
Martina Kemrová commented: "Moreover, the competitive environment of the mobile market has recently been enhanced by the entry of a fourth mobile operator into the market.
Given the nature of the mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is clear that the entry of another player would place high demands on him and especially on his services."
However, due to this approach of mobile operators, it is striking that czech regulators are completely uninterested.
This is not just the position of the CTO, which unfortunately does not have the power to intervene in competition in the Czech Republic - unlike the UK and other developed countries.
These belong exclusively to the Office for the Protection of Competition (ÚOHS).
But he took a typical stance on the whole issue.
"Entry of the virtual operator into the mobile market would be possible after a contract has been concluded between the mobile operator and the virtual operator for the lease of the necessary infrastructure.
No such contract has been concluded yet, as the offer of potential bidders was probably not interesting enough for classical operators," kristián Chalupa from the Department of External Relations of the Office of External Relations said in response to our inquiry.
It is perhaps not surprising from the representatives of the operators that this worded statement.
This is more than a consideration from the Authority, which is supposed to represent the interests of consumers and, among other things, to ensure that no one abuses their position on the market.
Especially when Kristián Chalupa adds: "In countries where virtual operators normally operate, we can see that their entry into the market has contributed to a decrease in prices for mobile telephone services."
However, the pressure on the proper functioning of the market environment and the fall in prices are not among the interests of the IOC.
In fact, what is shocking about the whole case is the touching resemplification of the three mobile operators that result from their reactions.
The question of whether this is really just a coincidence is entirely self-asked.
Like the exact same price of petrol at petrol stations, it is certainly only the result of chance and fierce competition.
"The Office has found no evidence of anti-compete behaviour in this matter and therefore has no reason to intervene in any way.
None of the operators has a dominant position and therefore does not have adequate increased responsibility for their market behaviour.
The necessary tools for opening up the mobile market for virtual operators are probably also missing from the telecommunications regulator," Chalupa said in a statement.
The interpretation of market dominance is one of many points of contention.
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets prepared by the CTO, according to which telecommunications are the only market from the point of view of competition.
Of course, none of the Czech operators have a dominant position on such a market.
However, some legal experts offer a different view - the network operator's consent is always required to create a virtual operator.
And the mobile operator - quite logically - has a monopoly on its network.
So in a certain segment they necessarily have to be dominant.
However, even if we do not accept this argument, it should be at least a warning to the IOC that the three mobile operators are following a strikingly similar approach.
At the same time, complaints from a number of interested parties (including GTS Novera) show that they encounter very similar obstacles when dealing with all operators.
Blaming the CTO for responsibility is a fairly common trick in telecommunications, which the IOC gives away from the matter.
We've met him on several similar occasions.
Unfortunately, until the recently adopted amendment to the Telecommunications Act, the extension of the CTO's powers to the field of competition in telecommunications failed to be enforced, even though many experts promised to improve the situation.
The IOC representatives need to know this more than well, but apparently their interests are elsewhere.
It's possible when no one's watching
At the same time, the functioning of some pseudo-virtual operators, of which there are several in Czech mobile networks, remains unnoticed.
These are companies that issue their own mobile phone price listings, but they are only partially public.
These are usually multilevel marketing companies.
Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others offer their own mobile telephone services.
The price list of these companies usually only reaches the chosen ones.
The magic lies in the fact that the company acts as a classic corporate customer to the operator, ordering a large number of SIM cards.
As a significant customer, he will then receive special price (and other) offers.
The problem is that the terms and conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit such resale.
"If there are cases that you are talking about, it could be a breach of the terms and conditions that we would deal with and could result in termination of cooperation with the company," Martina Kemrová replied to our inquiry on this issue.
However, it is quite unlikely that such activity will not reach the responsible people from mobile operators.
Especially in the case of the three mentioned companies, it can be thousands of customers.
None of the operators opposes such a procedure.
They make significant profits from the activities of these companies, and yet - unlike real virtual operators - they do not threaten them with their own official marketing.
Miroslav Čepický points out possible problems: "The law allows such speculation, however, only a negligible percentage of customers use the services of these companies.
In addition, they must accept that the SIM card on their phone is not in their name, so they cannot have it fully as regular customers of mobile operators."
But that should be strange to say the least.
In addition, another question is opened for the IOC.
If mobile operators are eyeing a similar procedure, why are they blocking the emergence of a virtual operator?
It should be added that the IOC has quite strong powers to detect such activity and, if it does not wish, may not be satisfied with the operators' explanation that they have no idea about this and their terms and conditions prohibit it.
When we won't be the most expensive
As has already been mentioned several times in the text, the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market has brought a noticeable decrease in prices for services.
In virtually all countries where virtual operators were created, classic operators tried to prevent their creation more or less.
The arguments they used were virtually identical - too small, possibly too saturated, problems with the quality of services, etc.
But it is at these moments that regulators intervened in developed countries, defending not the interests of mobile operators, but their customers.
Whether through formal measures or informal pressure, they achieved the first virtual operator and packed others on it.
Unfortunately, Czech regulators are tossing the case around like a hot potato.
In our experience, we cannot shake the impression that the lack of competence is more than appropriate in these cases.
But let's not throw a gun in the rye.
If the behind-the-scenes information is correct and the virtual operator will appear with us really soon, the Czech mobile market may be moving again.
If one of the operators has admitted the creation of a virtual mobile operator, it will be difficult for the IOC to remain indifferent to the rejection (discrimination) of other interested parties.
And maybe we'll stop calling more expensive than the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Choose the best one
Listen to four performances of the new version of the Czech national anthem.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek inaugurated new recordings of the national anthem Where My Home is on the occasion of The Day of Czech Statehood.
The anthem was newly recorded by the National Theatre Orchestra under the direction of Jiří Bělohlávek.
There are four versions - with male or female solo vocals, in choral version and instrumental version.
Kateřina Kněžínková and Adam Plachetka took over the singing.
The anthem adaptations were written by Otakar Jeremiáš and Jaroslav Krček.
You can listen iHNed.cz four versions on the server on the server.
Bělohlávek considers the Czech national song to be one of the most beautiful hymens.
He has previously told Czech Radio that he deliberately chose singers with young representative voices, which are distinctive and popular, to sing solo variants.
"From the beginning, I tried to make sure that they had clear diction in both of them, and then that they were well understood, that they recircupied," he said.
The Czech national anthem will celebrate its 175th anniversary next year.
The song Where My Home was first performed in 1834 on the boards of the Estates Theatre in josef Kajetán Tyl's original Czech play Fidlovačka, accompanied by music by František Škroup.
It gained popularity, and people spontaneously took it as their own.
The first song was released after the establishment of Czechoslovakia in 1918 and became a natural part of the national anthem.
It remained one of the seven state symbols even after the creation of an independent Czech Republic.
What the "new" anthem sounds like
Prague Public Transport will also take a chip for the first time on Wednesday
Wednesday, October 1, 2008, will go down in the history of the Prague Transport Company as the date when the first passengers who will have an electronic coupon in their pockets will board the subway, trams and buses instead of a paper ticket.
At the moment, it can be purchased by about 100,000 people who own an Opencard.
Passengers can buy a 30-day and 90-day and annual coupon (which will apply from 1 January 2009) and at the same time have it uploaded to their chip card at the information centers and workplaces of the Transport Company in the metro stations Muzeum, Můstek, Holešovice Railway Station, Anděl, Roztyly, Letnany, Kobylisy, Rajská zahrada, Kačerov and Luka.
Coupons can also be purchased via the Internet on the website of the Transport Company www.dpp.cz.
More than 400 customers used the service by the afternoon.
Those who start using the online store can definitely forget about the picking windows in metro stations, where they still had to regularly stand in long queues for paper tickets.
They buy the coupon over the Internet and upload it to their Opencard at one of the thirteen branches of the Municipal Library.
"At these locations, there is a counter with trained service available to help those interested with internet purchases and also upload the purchased coupon to their card," said martin opatrný, a spokesman for the project.
In addition to libraries, it will be possible to record electronic coupons on Opencard also in self-service machines, which are mounted in several metro vestibules.
What do such vending machines look like?
They are red, resemble ticket markers, and passengers may have already noticed them at the metro stations Roztyly, Budějovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.
"There are now five in the city, but by the end of the year there should be 80," added Opatrný.
Coupon checks the driver's seat of the vending machine
The operation of the vending machines, which will start operating tomorrow, is simple.
Just insert the Opencard smart card into them and the previously paid coupon will upload itself to it.
From tomorrow, electronic coupons are valid not only in the capital, but also in its surroundings.
That is, on suburban trains and bus lines with the number 300 to 499, which mainly go to the capital by residents of Central Bohemian municipalities.
"On trains included in prague integrated transport, conductors are equipped with card readers to determine the time and band validity of coupons," filip Drápal from Ropid, which compiles prague public transport timetables, explained the ticket control.
Suburban buses have card readers built into the driver's ticket office.
When boarding, it is therefore necessary not only to show the smart card to the driver, but also to attach the Opencard to the designated place on the side of the cash register.
This will check the validity of the recorded coupons.
"If a passenger needs to verify the validity of recorded coupons, there is nothing easier than asking the driver for this information," Drápal added.
Passengers who do not take suburban buses and will not remember when their coupon expires can go back to the self-service vending machines where the coupons are recorded.
Here, information about the validity of their documents will be displayed on the display of the device.
Sudetenland wanted a referendum from the US
In 1945, the Sudeten Germans requested the integration of šumava with the United States.
This stems from a letter that is stored in the collections of the South Bohemian Science Library.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we want to live at least under the patronage of the United States of America.
With such a wish, some groups of Sudeten Germans reportedly turned to the US President in 1945.
This results, among other things, from a letter that has been preserved in one private archive and is now stored in the collections of the South Bohemian Scientific Library.
The Germans of Český Krumlov, in a letter to the American President, ask not to allow the return of the "Šumava county" - taken by Hitler under the Munich Agreement - back to Czechoslovakia.
"We have understood the situation correctly, and we really want to be sure that American troops are coming to German territory not as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators," the letter, signed "People who care about the fate of šumava," reads.
Since joining Czechoslovakia supposedly gives Sudeten Germans - knowing the Czech national character - hope only for brutality, ruthlessness, erosion, oppression and slavery, the authors of the letter from the American President are beg to take over the Protectorate for the present and eternal times over šumava.
"We cannot believe that, regardless of the opinion of a quarter of a million people, you would admit this territory to a foreign state that oppresses and refutes minorities and has contributed nothing to the Victory of the Allies," the letter reads.
The reason why authors cannot sign is supposedly fear of the vindictiveness of "Czech oppressors".
If the US President were supposedly in doubt about the sentiments of the Šumava Germans, it was enough for him to hold a referendum in šumava granite on whether its inhabitants wanted to become part of the USA or live under the patronage of the United States.
Although the text of the letter may sound a little naïve in today's knowledge of postwar history, according to some witnesses, it appropriately illustrated the expectations of the Sudeten Germans at the time.
Although Czech Germans must have at least suspected that they would be removed from the Republic, few of them even accepted such an option.
Some expected the United States and The United Kingdom to negotiate some kind of autonomy for the Sudeten.
Others believed they would simply stay in Czechoslovakia.
This is confirmed by the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in České Budějovice.
During the war, he was a German from Budějovice, deployed to the Navy on the Baltic.
When the British captured him at the end of the war and placed him in a prison camp in Holstein, dozens of other Czech Germans came to him to teach them Czech.
"They believed that when they got home, they could use Czech," said Chalupa.
According to him, none of the German prisoners living in Czechoslovakia before the war expected to be resustended from the Republic on the basis of the Beneš Decrees.
You don't mean pay!
Emotional campaign attacks drivers
The most expensive road safety event in Czech history.
Even so, it could be characterized by an emotional media campaign, which the Ministry of Transport intends to launch on Wednesday.
Minister Aleš Řebíček's office promises to deter drivers from dangerous behaviour behind the wheel.
The $150 million campaign will appear on TELEVISION, radio, cinema, the Internet, as well as leaflets.
It should discourage drivers from driving fast and drink at the wheel.
And also remind them to fasten their seatbelt before they leave.
He wants to reach into the conscience of young drivers, motorcyclists, pedestrians and, last but not least, professional drivers.
And what will appear in the spots?
Especially human stories that attack emotions.
And this is evidenced by the "bloody" slogan of the whole campaign:
You don't mean pay!
The word "don't think" is written in capital letters on the license plate.
And in a pool of blood is the word "pay."
This is meant to symbolize that a person can pay for a moment of inattention with his own life.
Viewers will be "haunted" by the spots until 2010.
The Ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in Anglo-Saxon countries, where images with drastic images of accident victims can be commonly seen.
It promises to reduce accidents and the number of deaths on Czech roads.
The spots were prepared by Euro RSCG.
Carrot and whip for drivers
"The carrot and stick system applies to drivers.
The sugar for them is that when they run a red light, for example, they save time.
The whip is a threat of a fine or an accident.
Drivers must be reminded of the risk," says Martin Kořán, traffic psychologist at Na Homolce Hospital.
And that's why information campaigns in the press and, above all, negative ads are needed, says the psychologist.
Less effective, he says, are boards that alert drivers to danger.
"If a static sign is installed warning of danger, it will probably soon merge with the surroundings and drivers will not pay attention to it," kořán pointed out.
Olmert would return almost all occupied territories in exchange for peace
Ehud Olmert, the interim Israeli prime minister, advocated the return of virtually all territories occupied in 1967, including Pre-Jordan, East Jerusalem, and the Golan Heights, in exchange for peace with the Palestinians and Syria.
He did so in an interview published by Jediot Achronot on Monday.
"We need to reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that almost all, if not all, of the (occupied) territories will have to be returned," Olmert told the newspaper.
"We will keep a certain percentage of these territories, but we will have to give the Palestinians a similar percentage (of Israeli territory) because there will be no peace without it," he added.
He acknowledged that any return would include East Jerusalem.
"Anyone who wants security in Jerusalem, and especially doesn't want tractors or bulldozers to run over his legs, as happened to one of my best friends, will have to give up parts of Jerusalem," Olmert said, referring to two attacks in the city in July in which several people were killed and dozens injured.
According to the Prime Minister, it will be necessary to find "special solutions for the Temple Mount, sacred and historic sites" that lie within the Old City.
"Anyone who wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty over the entire city will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
This will not work," he stressed further.
Leaving the Golan Heights
Olmert also advocated Israel's departure from the Golan Heights, which he said was an essential condition for a peace agreement with Syria.
But that would also require some effort from Damascus.
"I am not proposing to make peace with Syria just by leaving the Golan," he said.
"The Syrians know well what they will have to give up to win the Golan.
They will have to give up their current relationship with Iran; they will have to give up their relationship with the (Shia movement) Hezbollah; they will have to give up the continued support they provide to hamas terrorism (The Shia movement), al-Qaeda's (terrorist network) and the jihad (holy war) in Iraq," the Prime Minister said.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India may cool
According to Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg, if the problem with Czech scientists who have been accused of illegally collecting beetles in India could not be solved, there would be some cooling of Czech-Indian relations.
The minister made the statement in New York after meeting with his Indian counterpart Pranáb Mukherji today.
"If this were not solved, then yes, then there would be some cooling," he said after the meeting, which took place on the Czech initiative.
Mukherji said after the hearing that the executive branch could have a hard time interfering in judicial matters.
However, he stated that in the case of Petr Švácha, who was acquitted and fined, the central government can negotiate with the local government in Dardžiling, whose jurisdiction the case falls under.
"His problem could be solved," the minister said.
According to Mukherji, it would be best for Emil Kučera, sentenced to three years in prison, to appeal to a higher instance.
He can then apply for bail and await sentencing, he explained.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner had expressed the same opinion at the hearing.
"He recommends an appeal to a higher court, then he could be pardoned," said the head of Czech diplomacy.
The only way the Czech side can get involved is to provide "competent legal support" to the convicts, the Indian minister said.
At the same time, he said that the Indian side was already providing such assistance.
"We are most interested in maintaining the best relations with India, which have a long tradition.
Indians recognize that, too," Schwarzenberg said.
At the same time, as ČTK said, he stressed in front of his partner that the Czech Republic attaches great importance to the problem of Czech entomologists.
"We really consider it a profound mistake to imprime and indict these Czech scientists," he said.
The minister avoided answering the question of whether he had received a promise from the Indian side to deal with the matter.
"I've made quite a few promises," he said.
Questions after the accident: Are the stewards on the bus illegal?
The law does not know them, you can't walk on a long-distance bus
In connection with the tragic accident of the Student Agency bus near Padua, Italy, the question has ariset as to whether stewards and passengers can move on the bus while driving.
"If we wanted to strictly and formally comply with the law, the steward's activities are contrary to the Road Traffic Act," says Karel Hanzelka, a spokesman for the Ministry of Transport.
The accident, in which a 22-year-old stewardess died last week, is believed to have been caused by a truck driver crossing the bus.
Unfortunately, the girl was sitting next to the driver at the time, in the least safe place in the car, although she has two more seats reserved.
However, the bus can crash or brake sharply, even when the steward is delivering coffee or newspapers.
The role is whether the bus is equipped with standing places according to the technical licence.
If the bus is not approved, the passenger must sit.
Student Agency long-distance buses do not have standing places; this Aktuálně.cz confirmed by radim jančura, the company's director.
"We discussed this with the Ministry and at first did not allow the movement of passengers.
Eventually, they called it off and we came to the conclusion that passengers are allowed to go to the toilet while driving if they have their seat," he said.
The law does not know the steward
"There is no clear legal interpretation of the role of the steward - no legislation solves this role.
However, no legislation prohibits the carrier from providing services.
The Road Transport Act only knows the term of the conductor of the vehicle; it does not define its rights and obligations," adds Hanzelka, the spokesperson.
Josef Pokorný, Director of the Road Vehicle Traffic Department of the Ministry of Transport, on the other hand, thinks that the law treats the issue sufficiently.
"It depends on whether the bus is allowed standing places in the approval.
That's the end of it," he says.
Buses are divided into urban, where there are standing places and limited maximum speed, intercity with parking spaces with a higher permitted speed and long-distance parking spaces with the highest permitted speed and seats equipped with seat belts.
Like on a plane, says expert
BESIP transport safety expert Jaroslav Hořín does not see a fundamental problem in the movement of stewards on board the bus.
"There are not many dangers when driving smoothly, the situation can be compared to service on planes.
Even here, it's not certain when the turbulence will come and the stewardess may hit her head."
"But if the bus brakes sharply, of course, the laws of physics apply.
Just like on a city bus or tram.
The safety of stewards must be dealt with by the carrier by internal regulations," he says, also meaning that from the point of view of the law, the issue is unresolved.
Jančura is willing to cancel services
Student Agency offers stewards' services as the only bus carrier.
He employs 200 of them.
Even after an accident, the director does not consider their profession to be risky.
"But as soon as I get the impression that the stewards' profession is risky, I'll cancel them.
Coffee and newspapers can be given to passengers on board.
It would also save costs," he says.
Asiana director Alexei Litvin, who operates a fraction of the lines compared to SA, justified the lack of stewards in his cars as a safety concern.
"We don't have stewardesses, we've been up against that from the beginning.
Sooner or later, it's going to end in some kind of fatal injury," he told the Týden.cz.
A terrible tragedy has occurred.
A young stewardess from Pilsen, who worked for the company for two years, died in a regular accident in Naples.
The Slovenian truck probably veered out of the lane without using a rudder and blocked the bus path.
His driver tried to avoid the sudden manoeuvre, but he hit it with his right front.
Jančura refuses to sell out the two places reserved for the rest of the stewards.
"These seats cannot be reserved for long-distance services, they are blocked."
The company's going to sue the truck driver.
With compensation from the girl's family, the agency will not wait for the trial, but it also expects financial compensation from the culprit.
A change in the law?
In sight
An amendment to the law, which has been under the work of a 30-member expert group of the Ministry of Transport for over a year, could provide clarification on the movement of stewards on board the bus.
"However, no concrete conclusion has been reached.
Buses don't even deal with much, rather the point system, maximum speed on the highway and the use of a mobile while driving," says expert Hořín.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activities of stewards to be something that would significantly endanger passenger safety," concludes Hanzelka, the spokesperson, noting that the control of bus safety is the responsibility of the police and occupational safety authorities.
Czech judges the battle for the seabed
It will proceed to a wall-mounted electronic map showing Australia and the adjacent marine areas.
However, he is not interested in the continent, but in a small point lost in the blue of the ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and with it the adjacent seabed.
The area is as big as the continent itself," says Luigi Santosuosso, an Italian lawyer who is part of the 30-member team of staff from the UN Division for Ocean and Marine Law.
His boss, the director of the division, Czech lawyer Václav Mikulka, follows the interpretation and occasionally adds.
There's work drive and enthusiasm.
The seabed hides a hitherto little-known world, rich in natural resources.
Oil, ores and other mineral resources can be found here, but also as yet unknown living organisms that carry the key to developing a cure for cancer.
Bottom larger than land
Coastal states have now begun to apply vehemently for new undersea territories.
Under the UN convention, they use their rights, which they agreed in 1982 in Montego Bay, Jamaica.
It is mainly an area of the so-called continental shelf, which often extends up to several hundred kilometers from the coast of a given country.
It is entitled exclusively under the Convention to all sources of the continental shelf.
"Simply put, the continental recond is the part of the seabed and its subsoil that is a natural continuation of the continent under the sea.
It extends beyond the boundaries of the coastal sea, often beyond the 200 nautical miles of the so-called exclusive economic zone", explains Mikulka.
The request submitted by the country concerned to the Commission for the delimitation of the external borders of the continental shelf shall be supported by extensive scientific and technical documentation based on many costly surveys and measurements.
It is the result of many years of preparatory work.
"One of our roles is to provide legal and technical assistance to the Commission.
So far, the Commission has discussed five requests, russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
So far, only the three latter countries have succeeded," adds Mikulka.
Australia has recently been the first to significantly expand its underwater hold.
But he also acquired New Zealand - the area of the seabed that the commission awarded him last week is about 1.6 million square kilometers, roughly six times the size of the state itself.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in exploration.
The profit they will make in the future from the use of the seabed will, as they promise, be invaluable.
Other States shall submit their applications gradually.
They can do so up to 10 years after they have ratified the "Montego Bay Convention".
Where the continental reced ends, the ocean floor area declared by the Convention to be the "common heritage of mankind" begins.
No State is exclusive here anymore.
The right of extraction in this area is granted by a convention-established international institution.
"But the seabed is no Klondajk," says Director Mikulka in exaggeration, noting that his "individual areas are legally clearly defined and their regime is contractually enshrined."
Czechs in the Pacific
Part of the seabed now belongs to the Czech Republic.
They are shared with other states of the former Eastern Bloc under the joint organization "Interoceanmetal".
In 1991, it, like the investors of a few other states, was granted the status of a so-called "pioneer investor".
It is authorised to mine in the ClarionClipperton zone in the Pacific Ocean, located between Mexico, the Hawaiian Islands and Kiribati.
The area explored by the investor is slightly larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The bottom is rugged, it's a kind of underwater replica of the Tatras.
"It can be used on an area of 75,000 square kilometers.
The area is a rich site of polymetallic concreations containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese," says another Lawyer Ind Pakshi Rajan.
Macedonian division worker Rober Sandev brings one such concretation to the demonstration.
It resembles a small potato or, with a little imagination, a mythical shem that, according to legend, revived the Golem.
Düsseldorf's hope is Frankfurt
The big words in westlb's board letter to the bank's employees are not missing.
The merger of the Düsseldorf money institution's units with Frankfurt's Deka-Bank will create "the central institution of the savings bank financial group for capital market trading," read a letter released to the public on Monday.
According to the letter, WestLB will bring a "set of competences" to the transaction to ensure long-term returns.
In fact, they say, such a merger can be a decisive impetus for further mergers in the land-bank sector.
Such texts arise when the Board of Directors wants to demonstrate its ability to act in a problematic period.
The unstable WestLB is still under considerable pressure.
Not only from the European Commission, but also from the Federal Financial Services Supervisory Authority, whose message to the Provincial Government in North Rhine-Westphalia that it is time to find a solution for the future is still fresh.
However, the link between Deka-Bank, which savings bank customers know for its investment funds, and WestLB, whatever its kind, has been talked about for some time - even on the Frankfurt side.
At the presentation of the half-yearly results at the end of August, The Head of Deka-Bank Franz Waas said that he did not see the point in merging his Mainzer Landstraße bank with one of the land's banks, such as Helaba bank or WestLB.
However, the Board of Directors of Deka-Bank, which is one half of the Landesbank and the other half of the savings banks' associations, has entrusted the Board of Directors with conducting talks with WestLB on joint business activities.
This could be capital market trades, or part of them.
But the talks have only just begun, financiers note.
Deka-Bank, which with its 3,000 employees is one of the more important employers on the financial market in Frankfurt, is not the first to be talked about in the context of consolidation in the savings sector.
In 2003, it looked for a while that Deka-Bank might merge with Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz and Helaba Bank.
In the end, nothing came of this three-way.
Shortly after the merger plans became public, the Hesse Provincial Government spoke out against Helaba's participation.
The two remaining bank houses didn't connect that way either.
Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz instead acquired Landesbank Baden-Württemberg from Stuttgart.
Even so, there has been repeated speculation about Deka-Bank's merger with the land banks.
More recently, however, Günther Merl, Chairman of the Board of Directors of Helaba Bank, has been negative about speculation about the merger of his financial house with others.
Regardless, however, the belief that rapprochement between the various public-sector banking houses seems to be a necessity is medding.
Now, after the bavarian provincial assembly elections, bayernLB's merger with Landesbank Baden-Württemberg could be the first to begin.
That's not very good news for Helaba.
If the pressure for further mergers is to increase, it will gradually lose potential partners for such a merger.
In the south, it would only play second fiddle, even though it still faces the financial crisis significantly better than the bank houses in Munich and Stuttgart.
The association of savings banks and giro banks Hessen-Thüringen, which has an 85 % stake in Helaba, banned the link with WestLB at the beginning of the year.
Nord LB would therefore be considered at most.
But geostrategic considerations of this kind are only one side of the problem.
On the other hand, it is a question of how much the business models of individual institutions match each other.
In June, Merl stated that the german savings bank association had not yet answered the decisive question of what business model should ensure the future competitiveness of the Landesland banks.
It could also all end with the distribution of WestLB, which, of course, no one in this institution wants.
That is why the letter from the local board of directors says that it is trying to find a "comprehensive solution" for the entire bank house.
Time will tell whether and how this can be linked to the link between the various components and The Deka-Bank.
The second weekend of Oktoberfest is known as the "weekend with Italians"
It's elena's first time, luca's third or fourth time.
But this time Elena will be there as his girlfriend, so he says everything will be different, he says.
Behind them, at a five-tok kaiser barrel, stands a thicker bearded man, and two-00 tourists at Oktoberfest prove how deep his throat can take.
Elena slaps Luca first and then kisses him.
They came to Verona from Bologna.
From here, from the bus car park next to Puorta Nuova station, there will be four buses at 11.45pm this evening marked "destinazione Monaco, festa della birra", expected to arrive at 6.30am.
Three buses are mainly occupied by Italians, one bus is exclusively brazilian.
In one corner of the parking lot, these South Americans are already singing with their flag, celebrating at night.
And this loud, says Marco Guarda, it's not for Italians.
Marc, who is wearing a long coat with imitation fur lining and wide silver-framed glasses, owns the three buses.
He has been going with them to Oktoberfest for five years, this year alone he organizes three expeditions.
At night there, during the day between beer stalls, at 10.30pm departure back.
An overnight stay would only mean unnecessary costs, marco says.
The trip costs 75 euros, including a welcome toast with Kaiser beer, brewed exactly according to the Bavarian Beer Purity Act, health insurance and a German-speaking guide - Marco took a language course in Frankfurt.
Buses leave into the night, after the road to Brennero.
Beer's not serve, not yet.
The bus quickly shuts up, the passengers are asleep.
Well done, they'll still need their powers.
It stops in Brixen and Holzkirchen, where many other buses with Italian license plates take one more break on highway 8 just outside Munich.
When Marco's group finally arrives at the parking lot near Theresienwiese at 6:30 a.m., there are already about 50 other buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others are gathering, Marco's last speech, explaining the plan of attack.
First, put on a yellow hat.
On it, on the left, is "Oktoberfest", next to the internet address of Marco's travel agency: "conoscersiviaggiando.it".
Two, "When the door to the beer tent opens, run!"
"Go!" Go and take the seats at the back of the tent.
"Not forward, so as not to get in the way, and not all yellow caps on the same benches, spread out over space!"
May costs 8 euros, 25 cents.
And don't forget the tip.
"Show the security guys we're behaving properly.
As soon as you leave your seats, they're gone!"
Three, "Be here again tonight at exactly 11:30!" Understand?
And up to Wiesn, the beer tent area.
Along the way, a member of the group hangs yellow caps as signs for trees, signs and even an election poster of a large Bavarian party.
We need to prepare for retreat.
The second weekend of Oktoberfest is known as the "weekend with the Italians".
Exact visitor numbers are not available; There is talk of 50,000 people making their way across the Alps and crashing into beer tents, with ten per cent of all visitors reportedly arriving from Italy this weekend.
Seven police officers from south Tyrol will be bolstered by munich police, while Italian volunteers will support the Bavarian Red Cross, which has a national statistic in which Italians take first place ahead of the British (about 60 hits) and Austrians (about 80) with around 200 medical treatments.
The Hofbräu tent is particularly popular with Italians.
Sleepless nights for Hypo Real Estate lenders
As recently as last week, Federal Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück stressed that germany's banking system is relatively stable.
It is a good thing that this politician used the word "relatively" and imm immed with the fact that the German banking sector will not be spared crisis development.
Because that's what happened last weekend.
The Dax index-monitored financial house specializing in real estate financing Hypo Real Estate (HRE) will receive a multibillion-dollar loan from a consortium of German banks to protect against market turbulence.
A person familiar with the situation told Reuters on Monday that the loan aid would go up to €35 billion.
Hypo Real Estate (HRE) will only have to pay interest on the amount actually used up.
They say the money comes from private and public banks.
Behind it are the losses of depfa's subsidiary.
According to a newspaper report, this state financier refinanced extremely short-term for long-term projects for which he lent money, which is no longer possible because of distrust in the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank's reserve shrank by 95% to EUR 2.37 million and the equity ratio slightly decreased from 1.6% to 1.45%.
Current income and net income from financial transactions fell to zero from a year ago, revenues from increased value of receivables and certain securities, as well as the cancellation of credit trading reserves, fell by more than 70 percent to 5 million euros.
Only thanks to higher revenues from compensation for subsequent clearing costs in the restructuring of the former Depfa Group and interest compensation under the Tax Code and for brokerage for group companies, the 16 % decrease on the revenue side was even more moderate.
After its privatisation in 1990, the former state financier was burned on mortgages for sole traders, which were then earmarked from the portfolio of services and further managed by Aareal Bank.
Because too little was earned in conventional state financing, Depfa became more involved in infrastructure projects and in financing joint projects between private investors and the state (PPP) and diversified internationally.
Hypo Real Estate must now write something off from the value of its subsidiary, and these write-offs will have a "material material effect" on calculating the group's profit and loss, as some have been vaguely told.
The fact is, there won't be a dividend.
It was already reduced by two thirds for 2007.
Hypo Real Estate has been a major financier of state and infrastructure projects since depp's takeover.
More strongly than other institutes, it depends on refinancing in the interbank market because it has no customer deposits.
After the collapse of us investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, the source of interbank lending has practically withered, as banks guard liquidity.
Hypo Real Estate needs short-term refinancing funds for part of Depp's loan portfolio - about €50 billion - each year.
According to Hypo Real Estate, the group's financial needs are covered by this loan for the foreseeable future and the company is protected "from the influence of international money markets at the moment to a large extent incapable of function".
Other sources said the money would ensure refinancing by the end of 2009.
On the contrary, HRE Chairman Georg Funke stated that hypo real estate group will not have to use the money markets anytime soon.
The Federal Bank and the Federal Institute for Financial Services Supervision (BaFin) assume that the competitiveness of the Hypo Real Estate Group on the market is now assured.
This is what the bank's shareholders and creditors hope.
But given the dynamics and inadmibility of the crisis, there is probably no certainty.
It is not even entirely excluded that the loan does not need to be completely exhausted.
However, the opposite cannot be ruled out either.
After the bank appears to be insolvent late on Sunday afternoon, the bailout, though preliminary, cannot calm passions.
The share price fell 75 percent to 3.30 euros.
On the contrary, bond prices held up well.
While preferred debts have hardly moved, secondary bond rates are losing more.
This applies mainly to bonds of the former subsidiary Württemberg Hypo and logically bonds with a maturity after 2009.
Hypo-Real-Estate bonds originally looked like an alternative investment opportunity for speculators, but their stability must be understood depending on the stability of the international financial system, given the stability of the international financial system, after a significant sharpening of the banking crisis and the crisis of the institute itself, which brought it to the firm by taking over Depp.
As long as the issue banks, governments and less affected commercial banks are willing to support the system, it is possible to expect securities to be paid within their maturity.
But it may also happen what hardly anyone dares to hope for at present - the financial crisis will be overcome in the next 15 months.
But, given the news coming at the same time as this partial nationalization, the probability bordering on certainty has now become a mere legitimate hope.
This, especially for long-term creditors, is likely to prepare a series of sleeping nights for them to decide whether to waive their obligations.
Short-term investors may at least use the limit line to create a transfer of losses from previous financial years to exchange rate income of later years for the purpose of future capital gains tax payment.
German special forces units were at the rescue of the hostages
The Egyptian government has asked for help from Germany in dealing with the hostage crisis - experts have arrived.
When the situation escalated, special forces were ready, but no deployment took place.
Further details of the circumstances surrounding the liberation of 11 Kidnapped European Tourists in Egypt are gradually coming to public.
German special forces were also indirectly involved in the rescue operation, according to data from the Ministries of Defence and Interior.
According to the ministry's statement, both federal army experts and members of the German police's anti-terrorism group GSG9, federal police air force, the Federal Criminal Office, as well as logistics experts from the Technical Assistance Service (Technisches Hilfswerk) were at the scene of the liberation.
However, according to another statement from the spokesmen of both ministries on Monday afternoon, German forces were not needed, because the kidnappers let their captives go and fled when they recognized signs of forced liberation.
The Egyptian government is said to have accepted the aid offered by Germany as a support force for the on-the-spot action.
"Fortunately, this did not happen," said a spokesman for the Federal Ministry of the Interior.
The attackers kidnapped a group of travellers made up of five Germans, five Italians, one Romanian and eight of their Egyptian guides on September 19 in the south of Egypt.
After being abducted in a desert area in southern Egypt, they moved hostages in border areas between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the kidnappers remained unclear until the last moment, as did details of the liberation or possible ransom payment.
At present, the rescued are safe in Cairo.
Minister Steinmeier said the hostages were in the care of the German embassy.
He has not commented on the details of his release.
There is no information yet in Berlin on when the rescued will return to Germany.
According to "Bild", all five tourists, together with special forces, are expected to fly one of the German Air Force Airbuses and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
Sylvana and the secret of the bento box
When 16-year-old Sylvana Hiltrop is about to introduce her on her first day of high school in Tachibana, the girls start to sneer: the German is a complete "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvan knows that word from mangoes. On his new blog about the exchange stay, he talks about Japan.
"First day in Japan.
Sir, I was nervous.
I was scared out of my way to school.
I live on the outskirts of Tokyo towards Kawasaki and take the 40-minute train to tachiwan high school.
I had to find my own way, luckily I didn't get lost.
It seems that the beginning of teaching in Tachibana is not given as strictly as at home in Lower Saxony.
Students start meeting after 8:00, and twenty minutes before 9:00 a.m., a short session with the teacher, the so-called 'home room', begins.
But before class started, I was supposed to introduce myself.
I'm not the kind of person who likes to talk in front of people, let alone in front of a class of 40 students.
Since I wasn't wearing my school uniform yet, I wore my host mother's old skirt, with a blouse, blue knee socks and black leather shoes.
So, dressed like this, I stood in front of the bench and tried to pronounce everything correctly: 'Sajónara Woš Sylvan...' - my name is Sylvana, I come from Germany and it is my birthday in a week.
At that moment, I was very happy to start learning the language two years ago.
All 31 girls in the class were whispering, giggling and waved, and I kept hearing the word 'kawaii'.
I already knew that from my mangoes.
It belongs to the basic vocabulary of Japanese girls necessary for survival and means 'cute, sweet'.
Then I quickly entered my seat.
The girl next to me smiled very broadly, considering it an honor that a foreign student should have sat next to her.
The rest of the class was quite calm, but when the gong sounded, they literally overslept me.
They talked over each other and giggled and asked me about the possible and the impossible - and yet it's really hard to understand Japanese English.
At the break, everyone unpacked their bents.
My host mom also made me this lunch box - and that's different from boring German snacks.
I had rice with herbs, little sausages, a salad of cucumbers and algae, fruit and some fish in tofu batter.
I usually have no idea exactly what I'm eating here in Japan.
These things look strange and taste quite new.
What's certain is that everything is really good.
Well, except for the brine-laden plums, perhaps!
Benta in Japanese schools isn't just lunch.
Sometimes it happens that a girl gives a boy a handmade bento, which in this case is particularly artistic, and hopes to get to know the boy more closely during a snack during a break.
I read about that in my manga comics.
I wonder if I'll see it here, too.
'Why Japan?' my friends asked me when I told them I wanted to go to school in Tokyo for a year.
Then I always said:
'Cause it just fascinates me.'
After all, I've loved reading mangoes for years.
And to better understand these comics and their culture, I started learning Japanese a little bit.
So it was very clear to me that I would have to come here one day.
Because I also have a thing for tradition, customs and customs.
And they're highly valued here.
On the one hand, Japan is the country of the latest technologies and trends, on the other it is strict, disciplined and traditional.
And because everything is so well organized, I've never felt lost here, even though Tokyo is the biggest city I've ever seen."
U.S. House of Representatives rejects rescue package
The first chamber of the US Congress let a $700 billion bailout package for financial markets fall by a tight majority.
The Dow Jones industrial average plummeted.
By a 206-to-227 vote, the US House of Representatives rejected the government's bailout package for financial markets.
For all the calls from US President George W. Bush and leading politicians from both parties, no majority has been found for a program that should alleviate financial market turmoil.
In a dramatic action, advocates have desperately tried to convince critics of the $700 billion package.
Barney Frank, one of the Democratic negotiators, called on members to vote before the vote, even though, as he put it, the plan is not popular.
"It's hard to get political recognition for avoiding something that hasn't happened yet," he acknowledged.
Even during the vote, the Dow Jones industrial average fell more than six percent, or 600 points.
This was due to investors' fears that the state rescue package could fail.
Shortly before the end of the vote, the index's value rose to plummet again after the announcement of the package's failure.
Experts are now counting on further serious turbulence in international financial markets.
In order for the program to enter into force, both the House of Representatives and the Senate need approval.
Even rats have feelings
When a rat or a cockroach flees danger, does that mean they also feel fear?
Neurologist Joseph LeDoux believes that many animals have feelings.
But how could it be verified that they feel the same way when they behave similarly to us?
The internet magazine "Edge" has been publishing contributions from well-known scientists for several years.
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents selected answers to the question "What do you consider true without being able to prove it?"
I believe that animals have feelings and other states of consciousness without me or anyone else being able to prove it so far, when we can't even prove that other people have consciousness.
But in this case, we can at least hope, because all human brains have the same basic configuration.
However, as soon as we start to engage in another species and open up questions of perception or general consciousness, we enter immeasory terrain because the hardware does not match.
When a rat gets into danger, it will do the same thing as many other animals: it will pretend to be dead, flee or attack.
People behave similarly, from which some scientists conclude comparable subjective experiences.
I don't believe in that, though.
Two aspects of the brain structure make it difficult to transfer our subjective experience to the experience of animals.
This is partly because circuits associated with human consciousness almost always include the lateral prefrontal cortex (due to its contribution to short-term memory and performance or control functions).
This vast area is significantly more developed in humans than in other primates, and seems to be completely absent from other creatures.
At least for those aspects of our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal cortex, among them knowing who we are and the ability to plan and make decisions, there is reason to believe that man is even different from other primates.
Another dramatic peculiarity could hide the linguistic nature of a person: since so much of his perception is associated with language, it is often said that consciousness depends on him.
In this case, we could exclude the animals.
But even if consciousness did not matter to the tongue, it would certainly be influenced by language, so that animal consciousness, however constructed it may be, would probably differ from most states of our consciousness.
Therefore, it is difficult to know what consciousness looks like in other animals.
When, as something internal and subjective, it is not even possible to measure, due to special hardware, to analyze it on the basis of our own experience, it puts us in great trouble to explore it.
Most of my outlets relate to the content of conscious experience, but there is another aspect of consciousness that should be more scientifically accessible.
It would be possible to examine processes in the consciousness of animals regardless of their content, and this is exactly what happens in short-term memory studies in primates, especially in the example of visualization.
But this approach, pursued by Christof Koch and Francis Crick, focuses on the neural correlates of consciousness rather than causal mechanisms: both may be identical, but they may not be.
Interestingly, this approach also emphasizes the importance of non-confrontational cortex for the realization of visualization.
What does that mean for feelings?
I infer them from the fact that an emotional system, such as the fear system, is activated in a brain conscious of its own activity.
So what we refer to as "fear" is the mental state in which we find ourselves when the activity of a defense system located in the brain (or its consequences, such as bodily responses) uses memory.
Seen from this angle, feelings are closely intertwined with those areas of the cortex that are characterized by primates, and especially humans.
In connection with linguistic nature, a subtle gradation of perception arises, because we can use words and grammar to distinguish and categorize states so that we can attribute them side by side to others.
Antonio Damasio, for example, believes that feelings arise from more primitive activities in cortex and brain stem areas devoted to bodily sensations, similar to Jaak Pankseep, who focuses more on the brain stem.
Since this network has not changed much in the course of human evolution, it could easily participate in the feelings perceived by multiple animal genera.
In theory, I cannot oppose this, but I find it inconclusive.
Pankseep argues that what seems to us to be fear in rats and humans probably feel the same way: But how can it be verified, Pankseep goes on to say, whether rats and humans feel the same way when they behave similarly?
The cockroach flees from danger - does he also feel fear?
From my point of view, the mere similarity of behavior cannot prove the conformity of experience.
It is true that the neural comparison takes us further: rats and humans have similar brain stems, on the other hand, cockroaches and brains.
But is the brain stem responsible for the feelings?
And even if it could be proved in humans: how would we want to prove it in rats?
I believe that rats and other mammals, perhaps even cockroaches (who knows?), have feelings.
But I really don't know how to prove it.
And since their feelings are probably fundamentally different from ours (because human consciousness rests on special circuits and language), I examine emotional behavior rather than emotional perception of rats.
In any case, we can expect progress at the neural level if we measure the same in rats and humans.
As with rats, I don't check my tongue and consciousness, I don't even look at feelings, I don't know if they exist.
It may be considered shortsighted, but I prefer to move forward rather than throw myself against the wall repeatedly.
I'm a practical emotionalist.
UEFA President Platini: Grace period for Poland and Ukraine
Acting Prime Minister Ivan Vasjunyk said preparations would soon be managed directly by the president and prime minister.
"The government sees UEFA's decision in Bordeaux as a sign of confidence in Ukraine and its ability to organize a ME together with Poland," Vasjunyk said.
"But it is not an amnesty for our country.
Work has only just begun and there is still much to do in both countries."
Both hosts are lagging behind in the early implementation of the timetable for the construction or redevelopment of stadiums, streets, hotels and airports.
It is even possible that the number of stadiums for ME will be reduced from eight to six.
"We can't waste any more time.
We must now work as quickly as possible," said Grigory Surkis, president of the Ukrainian association.
"UEFA will be watching us at all times."
An even more radical move was agreed in Poland.
The leadership of the Polish PZPN association was removed and replaced by independent administrator Roberto Zawlocki after numerous scandals by the National Olympic Committee.
The committee met at the request of Sports Minister Mirosław Drzewiecki.
There is a "serious risk that PZPN will not be able to act according to the rules," Drzewiecki told Polish news agency PAP.
"We have assured UEFA President Michel Platini in a letter that this step will not suffer preparation for the 2012 ME."
Several major league teams were condemned to forced relegation last season alone due to manipulation, eventually even having to be moved to the start of the league on short notice.
Travel agents record increasing booking numbers
It looks like winter will be good for German tourism entrepreneurs:
According to one study, bookings for next month's tours increased significantly compared to the previous year - by more than 30 percent for the winter season.
Despite weak economic growth, Germans' appetite for travel remains undimmed.
For winter season bookings, travel agents saw a 31 percent increase in turnover compared to the same period last year, the German Travel Association (Deutscher Reiseverband, DRV) said in Berlin on Monday.
According to a survey by the GfK Market Research Institute, increased bookings are already available for the autumn months.
According to drv, turnover for October was about eleven percent higher than in 2007.
The basis for these results is GfK numbers, which evaluate booking data from 1200 German travel agencies every month and interpolate them into the overall market.
This result included bookings for tours that took place until the end of August 2008.
Travel to the US is particularly in demand because of the weak dollar exchange rate, DRV said.
For these trips, the increase in bookings is about one third.
In addition, Spain, Turkey and Greece, as well as domestic waters, are particularly desirable destinations for Germans.
Organized tours in particular are on the way, said DRV Chairman Klaus Laepple.
In view of the rising energy and food costs, the costs here are "more easy for the client to calculate than for an individually organized holiday".
Laepple explained that consumers can save money by, among other things, using early booking discounts or all-inclusive offers.
Even in the summer months, the number of bookings was said to be very good, so there will be a higher turnover compared to the previous year - although according to another study, the number of Germans who made a trip decreased compared to the previous year.
Outraged Dennis Quaid strikes back
She wanted to advertise a new movie, talked about private things in an interview - and now she's having trouble with her ex: Hollywood star Meg Ryan talked about her ex Dennis Quaid as a marriage breakdown.
He's furious and he's hitting back.
The Belated War of the Roses by former married couple Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: seven years after their divorce, the two Hollywood actors are in a nasty feud - in public view.
Meg Ryan, in an interview with American magazine InStyle last week, spoke for the first time about the reasons for the breakdown of her marriage: "Dennis was unfaithful to me for a long time, and that was very painful."
She said she only found out about the extent of the fraud after the divorce.
The impetus for this mental striptease was Ryan's PR work for her new film, "The Women" - which tells the story of a broken marriage.
Dennis Quaid's reaction to his presentation as an unfaithful husband was pronounced: It's "crazy," the 54-year-old actor told the New York Daily News that "Meg repeatedly chews up the history of our relationship and edits it."
Moreover, it is "regrettable" that their 16-year-old son Jack is once again "publicly reminded of the pain and radical changes that are divorce for every child."
While Ryan has been living alone since the divorce, Quaid is remarring and recently became the father of twins.
He concludes his thoughts on cheating as follows: "In any case, my life goes on.
I consider myself lucky to have an amazing family that is doing great."
Air and hotel prices fall
In the first half of 2008, flights and accommodation in Europe were cheaper than in the previous year.
In Germany, flights were even cheaper by up to 50 percent, according to one recent study.
Flights and hotel accommodation have become cheaper again - this is the result of a study by travel and financial services provider American Express.
The company analysed its data on bookings made in the first half of 2008 and, following a rise in prices in the first quarter, found a significant decrease in the second quarter.
After several years of rising prices on the hotel market, accommodation in many places has already become cheaper.
From January to March, prices in 41 of the 48 European cities surveyed increased by an average of 6.9% compared to 2007.
From April to June, however, prices were already 3.6 percent lower than the previous year.
The trend was most noticeable in Paris and Rome, where passengers had to pay 30 to 37 percent less than the previous year.
American Express sees the dollar's weak exchange rate as the cause of this trend, which has caused "a declining appetite for American tourists to travel."
Financial centres than industrial centres such as Hanover, Cologne and Stavanger have also been hit harder by the fall in hotel prices.
In this Norwegian city, hotel prices have even set a European record with a 26.3 percent increase.
Air prices also showed an upward trend in the first quarter:
Due to the increase in kerosene prices, economy passengers had to pay an average of 7.1 percent more than in 2007, and for fuel-intensive long-haul flights they increased by as much as 29.2 percent.
From April to June, economy air fares fell by an average of 12.5 percent compared to the previous quarter, but in Business and First-Class, the changes were much less pronounced.
In Germany, prices fell even more markedly than in other European countries:
They grew by 11.9 percent from January to March, and fell 23.6 percent in the second quarter.
On German domestic flights, according to the study cited, prices have even fallen by half.
One reason for this price fall is slowing economic growth, the company explains.
Demand in many segments of the air transport market is uncertain.
On the other hand, there is increased competitive pressure due to the Open Skies agreement, which liberalised air traffic between the US and Europe.
A sign of the tense situation is the cancellation of non-profitable routes by air carriers, as well as the high number of airlines that declared bankruptcy in the first half of 2008 - 24 airlines in Europe only.
HSV beat Gladbach 1-0
Thanks to one goal and simple methods, Hamburger SV takes the top of the table.
At Borussia, Luhukaya continues to fail to put together a functioning 11.
Written by Kristoffer Klein - magnify failed landing for representative Marko Marino.
This gladbach player didn't get into the game until late and failed with a stick-popped ball.
His message was precisely worded and sounded convincing from his mouth.
He simply knew he was right.
"We need a second goal," hermann Rieger hissed in the corridor to the hamburg arena booths.
There wasn't much going on in the catacombs, the break between halftimes was over, and most people were sitting in their seats again.
Rieger has been an HSV physiotherapist for nearly three decades and enjoys more respect than many momentary actors.
And so his plea was also answered in a responsible place.
Assistant coach Cornelius Jol pulled in and raised his thumb in a sign of agreement.
Cornelius is the brother of Hamburg head coach Martin Jol.
His order was probably the same: here with the second goal!
There was no execution.
"It wasn't a nice look at everything here today," Marcell Jansen admitted later.
Even Bastian Reinhardt would have "wished it more relaxed."
1-0 (1-0) The Hamburgians owe it to the head of Mladen Petrić (11th) and the fact that the very weak Gladbašians could not hurt the weak Hamburgians.
"It was a dirty victory," Martin Jol summed up.
Hamburger SV will celebrate its 121st anniversary this Monday.
On Saturday afternoon, the audience celebrated themselves, the blue sky above the arena and the live updated table on the video wall in which their team was listed as the premier.
It's going to be a birthday without a proper party.
"We know how to evaluate it," Marcell Jansen said.
He recvinises that the interim tabular result symbolizes the unexplaitedness of the league rather than the dominance of its HSV.
The late arrival of new players - Brazilians Neves and Silva, goalkeeper Petrić and FC Bayern acquired Jansen - is slowly being found, but it is not yet able to flash.
"We need more feeling and more dribbling," Jol said emphatically.
My first Oktoberfest
Endlessly repeated pop, beer made of and prominent people in costumes from well-known designers.
First time in a beer field.
Susanne Kronzucker and I don't really have much in common.
She's blond, tv presenter, and she wears a tailored costume.
I have dark hair, I'm a student, and my dress is secondhand.
But one thing unites us: we are not even three minutes in a beer meadow, and photographers are already lashing out at us and nimblely filling memory cards - that flatters me, it is my first time at Oktoberfest.
That's how you can make friends.
Looks like my cheap costume has served its purpose.
I'm here as a tourist and I live north of the sausage equator, so my sense of comfort in costume was rather limited.
But right after arriving at Theresienwiese, everything is better than it seemed.
Almost everyone is wearing women's costumes or leather trousers; no one looks disgusted or embarrassed - everything is perfectly normal.
Only my apron reaps the strange views at the chocolate banana stand.
A Munich woman points out to me that I tied it wrong: "On the left you are free, in the middle a virgin, on the right, married, in the back, you are oats."
I'm going to secretly switch bows from the back to the left.
"All right," he says, laughing.
Others don't deal with subtle flirting techniques as much, wearing simple felt hats that say "To drunk to get dressed!" and sticking naked butts at passersby.
A young man with such exhibitionist tendencies is named Bob, he's from England, and he came to Oktoberfest for the first time.
He thinks it's "gorgeous," with an extended "oh."
That's what he tells me after he relieved himself of a just-drunk may?
Right next to one of those hydrants that everyone thinks are trash cans.
So Bob is one of the dreaded "Wildbieslers", as in Bavaria they call free-urinating people in public.
Others are not lucky enough to get rid of alcohol in this way.
Around 8 p.m., paramedics run around the area where Oktoberfest is held, taking care of the needy drinkers.
Paramedics always appear in flocks - in four they carry covered stretchers from tent to tent.
They work like most beer meadow visitors: empty there, full back again.
You can't see who's lying under the tarp of this coffin out of the blue.
"So be you, which you can't go on," one of the paramedics calls me in response to my question and disappears into the crowd.
After defeat in the vote
Fear is spreading on Wall Street.
Initial reports of the sinking of the rescue package caused the Dow Jones industrial average to fall as much as 700 points.
That was the biggest one-day point loss in its history.
Later, Dow gained some weight again.
Around 8:30 p.m., the world's most important stock barometer showed a 5 percent drop to 10,579 units.
The Nasdaq technology exchange was down more than seven percent at 1,548 points.
The worst was in the Dow at the moment, American Express, which lost nearly 14 percent, and Bank of America, with a loss of around 12 percent.
None of the titles could strengthen.
Goldman Sachs shares lost nearly 10 percent.
Until a few days ago, big investor Warren Buffett had a stake in the company.
As part of the rescue plan, funds are to be made available for the purchase of so-called bad mortgage papers.
However, the full amount should not be paid at once, but in several stages.
In return, the State is to receive stock certificates of financial companies that could be reimbursed in the course of a favourable exchange rate development, thereby reducing the burden on the state budget.
Stock prices fall steeply in Europe
Billion-dollar aid to banks in Europe and the US does not relieve investors of doubts.
The share price of the large German bank Hypo Real Estate is heavily downgraded, dragging down the Dax index.
The US Dow Jones industrial average is losing ground despite the state's planned bailout of the financial market.
Spectacular exchange rate losses by Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank sent the German share index (Dax) deep into the back of the market.
Despite the rescue of the federal government and private banks, shares in the Munich real estate financier lost up to three quarters of their value, while Commerzbank lost more than 20 percent.
The Dax clearly slipped below the psychologically important 6,000-point mark, recording 5,839 points at minus 3.7 percent.
All over the world, stock markets have been on their knees.
In New York, a trading day on Wall Street began with significant losses.
Investors fear that the US government's $700 billion rescue package might not be enough to revive financial markets.
The Dow lost 334 points, or 3.3 percent, to 10,809.25 in early trading.
The US House of Representatives is due to vote on the rescue plan, and the Senate could vote on October 1.
Other European exchanges also went in only one direction: in London, the FTSE index initially weakened by 3.2 percent, the CAC-40 in Paris lost 2.9 percent.
In Asia, Japan's leading Nikkei index fell 1.26 percent to 11,743.61 after initial profits.
In Hong Kong, the Hang-Seng index fell 2.1 percent to 18,286.90 points.
In India, the leading Sensex index lost 506.43 points, or 3.9 percent, to end trading at 12,595.75.
In MDAx, Arcandor's shares lost ground following the announcement of the increase in registered capital.
Private bank Sal. Oppenheim has signed 23 million new shares.
In addition, the business and tourism concern announced that it would not sell shares in Thomas Cook.
Dark matter affects space probe flight
For years, scientists have been unaware of one mysterious phenomenon: dark matter affects the speed of space probes during the so-called swing-by maneuver.
Experts fear that Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity might not be entirely correct.
For almost 18 years, the space probe "Ulysses" has been flying through space.
Fuel lines, which will soon freeze, now threaten to die of winter.
For years, a mysterious phenomenon has been causing confusion among scientists - the anomaly of a gravitational slingshot.
A gravitational slingshot is an aerial maneuver of space probes in which they gain additional momentum in the gravitational field of a space body, such as Earth.
Thanks to this, the probes can save a lot of fuel.
The European-American cassini-huygens research probe used this physical trick as well as the Ulysses solar probe.
But what scientists have been saying for years in this case is astonishing: flying bodies do not behave 100% as one would expect under the good old law of gravity.
On the contrary, there are irregularities in speed.
Probes are unexpectedly accelerating or slowing down.
So far, physicists have failed to explain this effect.
He was baptized by the anomalies of the gravitational slingshot.
Several experts fear that even Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity, which describes the attraction of matter by curvature of space, might not be entirely correct.
American physicist Stephen Adler of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton remains convinced that Einstein was right, and is trying to explain the anomaly of the gravitational slingshot using so-called dark matter, the presence of which in the universe has been detected by astronomers.
"Dark matter could be responsible for this anomaly, which could also be very close to Earth," he writes.
Space researchers have only known about the existence of dark matter for about ten years.
It is clearly based on a gravitational force, the effect of which on other space bodies can be observed.
On the contrary, it itself is completely invisible, which means that it does not emit or reflect any electromagnetic radiation, not even visible light.
According to the calculations of scientists, this dark matter is a good fifth of the total mass of the universe.
Kidnapped tourists are at large in Egypt
After 10 days in the hands of their captors, the kidnapped tourists are once again at large in Egypt, according to the Italian Foreign Minister.
The kidnappers from Sudan demanded a ransom of several million euros.
Six kidnappers are said to have been killed in a shootout before being released.
Five Germans have been kidnapped in the south of Egypt.
They say the ransom negotiations are underway.
The Germans have repeatedly become the target of kidnappers.
WELT ONLINE brings you the most important cases.
European tourists taken to the Sahara appear to be free.
This was reported by Egyptian state television, the Arab television station Al-Arabiya and the Italian media.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release, according to reports on Italian television station Sky TG 24: "Our fellow citizens and other hostages have been freed.
We're checking their condition right now," Frattini said.
According to a report by Egyptian state television, five Germans, five Italians and one Romanian, as well as their eight Egyptian guides, are safe and sound.
All 19 participants in the desert expedition are believed to be on their way to Cairo.
The background to the shooting before the hostages were released remains unclear: according to an Egyptian security official, the kidnappers were ready to end the kidnapping before the Sudanese army surprisingly killed six kidnappers.
"The problem has been resolved.
They agreed to ransom," the worker said, as quoted.
He said it was "just a game of taking over the hostages" when suddenly "this surprise" came.
Sudanese soldiers shot dead six hijackers and captured two of them on Sunday in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt.
The kidnappers demanded a ransom of six million euros from Germany; The money was to be handed over by the German wife of one of the hostages.
The daily "El Masri El Jom", citing one of the German mediators, said that the release of the hostages was being pro-life because the kidnappers feared for their safety.
According to this report, the kidnappers wanted to release the female hostages after paying the ransom.
The men were supposed to be held until the kidnappers had a safe escape route.
The German Embassy in Cairo declined to comment on the report.
Police have released the name of the crash victim
The name of a 63-year-old woman who died in hospital after being hit by a car in Essex has been released.
The accident on Shenfield Road in Brentwood on Friday afternoon affected Carole Paulson from Chelmsford Road.
She was taken to Queen's Hospital in Romford but later died.
A 51-year-old man was arrested after the accident on suspicion of reckless driving.
He's already been released on police bail.
Stepfather abuse 'led to suicide'
Years of abuse by her stepfather led a woman to kill herself, a court has heard.
Michael Trerise, 57, of Stithians, Cornwall, was sentenced to six years after pleading guilty to eight counts of sexual harassment.
Truro Crown Court heard that he regularly tied up his stepdaughter Stephanie Randle when she was between five and seven years old.
"I feel responsible for her death," Trerise wrote in his confession.
The court was also told that Miss Randle killed herself at her home in Mutley, Plymouth, on 1 April 2007 at the age of 34.
When she lived in Coventry as a child, Trerise tied her up and blindfolded her and subsequently sexually abused her while her mother worked in a pub.
Trerise divorced his wife in the 1980s and returned to Cornwall.
His stepdaughter went to Plymouth.
However, the court heard that Miss Randle, who spent a significant part of her time volunteering for the National Trust, was haunted by the spectre of abuse perpe d'ed or her twice a week.
Prosecutor Ramsey Quaife said in court that in 2006, friends of Ms Randle, who was also very involved in surfing and cycling, said she was "emotionally dead" and had "given up her life."
In April 2007, her real father, Terrance Randle, found her dead in her flat in Plymouth.
It's thought she suffocated with a plastic bag.
Randle came face-to-face with his daughter's stepfather, who wrote a confession that ended with, "I tied her up and blindfolded her.
"I didn't abuse her.
I feel responsible for her death."
Judge Christopher Elwen told Treris: "You are an extremely strange fetishist and it must have been terrible for your victim when she was only seven years old.
"This unpleasant story ends with the victim taking his own life.
Even more terrible is the fact that if she had not done so, the case would probably not have made it to court at all."
"I would particularly like to highlight the consequences that Stephanie's parents say your crime has had on their daughter over the years," he added.
"She would obviously be a promising, successful and happy young woman otherwise."
Official who lost data will be charged
The BBC has learned that a government official who left top secret documents on a train in June will be charged under the State Secrets Act.
The man in question left two top secret documents on a train to Waterloo while he was temporarily assigned to the Ministry of Defence.
The documents were handed over to the BBC before they were handed over to the police.
It is the least serious offence against the law in question and there is no indication of criminal intent.
BBC defence correspondent Frank Gardner said such a move would be surprising to many in Whitehall.
"They probably thought the matter was being handled internally between the Ministry and the Cabinet Office," he said.
An employee, who cannot be named, is charged under Section 8.1 of the Act in question, a clause that deals with the protection of information.
The Crown Prosecutor recommended that the Metropolitan Police charge the officer on the basis of the very sensitive nature of his work on the Joint Intelligence Committee.
The documents he forgot contained secret analyses of Al Qaeda and the capabilities of iraqi security forces.
He was informed of the decision on Monday morning and was moved from his home to an unknown location.
Credit unions face B&B debt
British credit unions may have to deal with more than £80 million in debt after the Bradford &Bingley bank rescue.
The government has provided £14 billion to protect deposits with 2.6 million clients in Bradford &Bingley.
Interest on this loan will be repaid by all companies that take client deposits, including 59 credit unions.
Adrian Coles, director general of the Association of Credit Unions (BSA), said it was "humbling" that credit unions and their members had to pay.
The $14 billion debt will eventually be repaid by saving Bradford &Bingley mortgages.
However, the interest accumulated in the meantime will be repaid each year by all 700 financial firms that take client deposits.
The BBC's Compensation Plan for Money Services fund confirmed that all 59 credit unions are accounted for in this figure.
It is humbling that these institutions that have behaved prudently... now they have to pay some of the accounts of those institutions that were not nearly as prudent
Adrian Coles, BSA
He said that each company should pay proportionally to the deposits it held, and that credit unions should pay about 18% of the price.
The Treasury estimates that interest on debt will rise to £450 million in 2009.
This means that credit unions will have to find £81 million to pay off first-year interest.
Adrian Coles, director general of the Trade Association of Credit Unions, told the BBC he was convinced it was unfair.
"It is humiliating that those institutions that behaved prudently during the housing boom now have to pay some of the bills of those institutions that were not nearly as prudent."
According to the BSA, no credit union has fallen since they appeared in 1945.
"We're going to have to explore all aspects of this over the next few weeks to see what the possibilities are to protect credit unions and their members from an account that could be substantial," Cole added.
The interest due in 2009 covers seven months from the end of September this year to the end of March.
In 2010, interest for the whole year will be available for repayment and that could be almost twice as much.
Since credit unions are shareholder-free mutuals, this account will eventually be paid by their members through higher fees or lower interest rates on their accounts.
Turkey's diplomatic horizons widening
Long before Turkey began to seek to join the European Union, European powers longed to penetrate deep into Turkey's borders.
On the east bank of the Bosphorus, perhaps just twenty paces in Asia, stands one of the finest monuments of this failed imperial ambition.
Hydarpaša railway station was designed by two German architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Con in the Neo-Renaissance style.
Well, that's what the tourist guides will tell you.
The building sits at the end of the platforms with a tower on each corner of the façade, indistinguishable from some provincial German town hall.
The stone is dirty.
The whole structure is slowly disintegrating.
But once inside the vaulted cash register, one can no longer doubt the size of the business whose westernmost gate of the station was.
The station was opened in August 1908 by a German consortium, the Anatoly-Baghdad Corporation.
Germany, which was late in the game of empires, intended to realize its ambitions to control the Middle East with this railway, which was supposed to lead to Damascus, Baghdad, and beyond what is now Saudi Arabia.
But German imperial ambitions collapsed during World War I.
Their dorms were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his irregular units.
The relative isolation from the surrounding territories, created by the frozen borders of the Cold War, is gone
British and colonial troops advanced from Egypt, pushing the Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria.
And there was bad news for Hydarpaša station, too.
In 1917, an ammive train explosion destroyed its elaborate roof.
Turkish sources say it was sabotage.
Since then, it has been gradually crumbling and history has bypassed it.
But today, this gateway to Anatolia and further east serves - at least symbolically - to highlight the expanding horizons of Turkish diplomacy.
The ruling Justice and Development Party - the AKP - has created a whole new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation from the surrounding territories, created by the frozen borders of the Cold War, is gone.
A new policy is now in place - Turkey is engaged.
It is noteworthy that the Turkish Government has good relations with Israel and Syria, with the Palestinian factions Hamas and Fatah, with Iraq and Iran and, of course, with the European Union and the United States.
In order to examine the parameters of this new policy, I took a night train to the Turkish capital Ankara, where I was to meet one of the AKP's leading foreign policy experts, Turkish MEP Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning - about ten and a half hours later - after a sh, I arrived in the Turkish capital, designed as a new city for a secular state that wants to turn its back on its Otomanic past.
But the AKP, with its well-known Islamist roots, represents a paradigm shift in the Turkish consensus.
She aroused suspicion in the West, especially in Washington.
The taxi took me to the AKP headquarters, an ultra-modern stone and metal building deliberately built in an emerging suburb, surrounded by half-built department stores and power-trading shops, where middle managers in business suits - men and women - meet to do early morning business.
Suat Kiniklioglu could easily be a center-right politician from almost any other European political party.
Jacket, tie, I'm sure he had a Blackberry.
"The aim of the party's foreign policy is to reintegrate Turkey into its immediate vicinity.
The Cold War was an anomaly," he told me.
Turkey has been cut off from its border.
Today, they must look east and west at the same time.
It wasn't a choice.
He must have done both.
"But surely there will come a time," I asked, "when turkey may have to make a decision?"
"Turkey," he said, "did not want such a decision to take place."
Then he stressed what almost everyone I spoke to said almost by heart: Turkey's relations not only with the Middle East, but also with the Caucasus and around the Black Sea, are as good for Europe and the United States as they are for Turkey.
With Turkey on board, Europe as a whole seems to be able, metaphorically speaking, to go east on these tracks to Asia and the Middle East.
Back at Hydarpaša station, after another mostly sleepless night, I thought of the two German masters, Herr Ritter and Herr Cona, who watched this building be built a century ago.
How surprised they would be to find that Europe's ambitions in the Middle East can now, in large part, be in Turkish hands.
And as I waited at the port for the ferry back across the Bosphorus, I remembered that in those days Turkey was called the "sick man of Europe."
So it seems that at least then there was little doubt which continent should be entitled to this fascinating country.
Milk will increase by five pence per litre
People in Jersey may have to pay more for milk.
Jersey Dairy has announced that it will increase the wholesale price of its milk by five pence per litre from Monday.
It's the second price increase this year, after a two-pint price increase in February, and comes after research conducted by a consulting company.
Retailers are supposed to decide for themselves whether they want to reflect the increase in customer prices.
Prior to the February increase, the wholesale price of Milk from Jersey last changed in 2002.
Bail denied for Bangladesh ex-prime minister
A Bangladeshi court has rejected former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasin Vijid's request for bail, meaning she could be arrested if she returns to her homeland.
Her lawyers said the court refused to release her on bail on charges that she extorted more than 50 million taka ($729,700) from a businessman when she was prime minister.
The case is one of several corruption charges against her.
Khalid Ziya, Sheikh Hasin's longtime political rival, was released on bail earlier this month.
Sheikh Hasin is due to return to Bangladesh within the next few weeks, but her party, the People's League (Awami League), has demanded that the local army-held government give it complete freedom first.
Correspondents say that while she was released on parole to undergo medical treatment abroad, it is unclear under the terms of her release whether she will remain at large when she returns to Bangladesh.
Her lawyers say she will now appeal the High Court order to the Supreme Court.
"The High Court has rejected Sheikh Hasina's bail application, saying that she does not need bail when she is already undergoing an examination abroad, released on an affidavit," said her lawyer, Rafique-ul Huq.
"We will appeal against the High Court order."
Her lawyers argued that she needed bail to return to the country from abroad in preparation for the December elections.
A senior People's League official said Sheikh Hasina is due to return home after October 17.
She was detained last year after the military-held interim government took power, but was released from prison in June to undergo medical treatment abroad.
Sheikh Hasin and Khalid Ziya both deny all the charges against each other.
Fear of polio vaccinations in Afghanistan
According to the UN, nearly 200,000 children did not participate in the recent blanket polio vaccination due to Taliban-related violence.
The UN conducted vaccinations in six provinces last week.
However, she says that for security reasons she could not reach children in the south in parts of Helmand and Kandahar.
A UN spokesman said this was despite Taliban promises not to attack or prevent thousands of vaccine workers from working.
BSkyB loses ITV lawsuit
BSkyB lost a lawsuit to review a Competition Commission decision ordering the firm to reduce its stake in rival broadcaster ITV.
The Competition Appeals Tribunal ordered BSkyB to reduce its stake in ITV from 17.9% to below 7.5%.
The Commission has previously stated that BSkyB's shareholding thwarted competition and gave the company a disproportionate influence on ITV.
BSkyB bought the stake in 2006 in a deal that prevented NTL, now renamed Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Fair Trading Authority announced that BSkyB's acquisition of a stake in ITV had raised doubts about ITV's independence and called on the Competition Commission to launch an investigation.
Virgin's head sir Richard Branson, consumer organisations and regulator Ofcom were all opposed to the purchase.
BSkyB argued that the forced reduction in its stake in ITV was unreasonable and emproductive as a solution - mainly because BSkyB had previously said it was willing to give up its voting rights.
New investigation into U.S. attorneys' affair
The U.S. Attorney General has appointed a special prosecutor to investigate the dismissal of nine U.S. attorneys in 2006.
The move came as a report on the affair by the Justice Department's chief inspector criticized the actions of government officials.
The report criticized White House officials, lawmakers and former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was s insustered by concerns that lawyers had been removed for political reasons.
Special prosecutor Nora Dannehy will now investigate whether officials questioned during the investigation lied to investigators in order to obstruct justice.
Inspector General Glenn Fine said in a statement: "Serious allegations, including potential criminal conduct, have not been fully investigated or explained."
Appointing a special prosecutor with the power to compel witnesses to testify was one of his key recommendations.
The dispute began when the US Department of Justice removed nine US attorneys from their positions in December 2006.
At the time, the ministry said the lawyers had been dismissed due to poor performance.
However, it later emerged that the dismissed lawyers were no worse rated than many of their colleagues, leading many observers to conclude that the dismissals were politically motivated.
Some of the attorneys were involved in prosecuting high-ranking Republican members and senators, while others refused to investigate voter fraud allegations against Democrats.
U.S. attorneys are investigating and prosecuting in government court cases.
They may be released at any time, but may not be removed for political reasons.
The then head of the Justice Department, Minister Alberto Gonzales, came under fire for the layoffs and eventually resigned.
A number of other Justice Department officials have also resigned.
The inspector general's report was highly critical of Gonzales' role in the affair, saying he bore "primary responsibility" for the layoffs, that he had "abdicated" from his leadership position and was "remarkably unasslisted."
Other officials, including former senior Bush adviser Karl Rove, have been criticized for not cooperating with the investigation.
Meat Loaf's masterpiece will be honored
Rock star Meat Loaf will receive one of the Q Awards for his epic anthem Bat Out Of Hell.
The singer, who will attend next weekend's ceremony in London for his special gold award, said he was "honoured" by the recognition received.
The song, which lasts nine minutes and 50 seconds, was the title track of Meat Loaf's 1977 hit album.
This year's nominations are led by Coldplay, which has been shortlisted in four categories.
Paul Rees, Q Magazine's editor-in-chief, said: "There are some songs that stand above such things as time and genre, and Bat Out Of Hell is certainly one of them."
The song, written by Jim Steinman, needed great vocals provided by Meat Loaf.
It started with an instrumental part that lasted almost two minutes.
The song was released in Britain in 1979 as a single and reached number 15.
But Meat Loaf's album Bat Out Of Hell has been on the charts for around nine years, selling more than forty million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf - real name Marvin Lee Aday - has suffered from health problems in recent years, and in 2003 he was also operated on for an irregular heartbeat after collapsing on stage.
In 2007, acute laryngitis forced him to cancel concerts.
It later emerged that he had a cyst on his vocal cords.
Obscure street, often forgotten and possibly soon for sale
The city of New York has thousands of roads, streets, highways and other roads, some famous, others utility only.
But even many veteran taxi drivers and longtime locals have difficulty finding Extra Place, mostly because they've never heard of it.
This tiny alleyway is in the East Village and runs north from First Street - without getting to Second Street - between Bowery and Second Avenue.
At a width of about ten and forty meters, it resembles a dusty passage rather than a traffic thrust.
There are no street signs.
In a common atlas, it is practically invisible.
Nevertheless, the alley has admirers.
For example, Avalon Bay, the developer of recently built luxury buildings on First Street.
He wants to re-pave Extra Place and create a cleaner passage to shops and boutiques to open in new buildings.
Other admirers are longtime neighbors who say they were enchanted by the shortened alley simply because it was one of the last remains from before the block was re-empted.
However, the city's Office for the Protection and Development of Development, which has the street in its power, has no interest in sticking to it.
At a meeting of the municipal community's land committee, representatives of the city council and Avalon Bay outlined a plan under which the developer should buy the street.
However, according to Suzan Stetzer, district manager of Municipal Community 3, the committee prefers the option of the street remaining in the hands of the city and has asked for a new plan, which should be submitted next month.
"The city already owns very little land, and we'd like Extra Place to remain in its possession," she said.
"Proposals could be made for repair and administration, which Avalon could do, but we also want to guarantee public accessibility."
Avalon Bay announced a few months ago that it wanted to re-pave the small street and install seating positions, several of which would be used by a café whose interest in renting the space is expected by the developer.
The idea that Avalon Bay could buy the street was first announced at a meeting this month.
Michele de Milly, a spokeswoman for Avalon Bay, said that although the company wants to use the street, it does not necessarily want to own it.
"The main purpose of Avalon Bay is to repair this desolate alley and make it a beautiful place for the public," she said, adding that the sale was designed by the city.
Seth Donlin, a spokesman for the Building Preservation Authority, said the city really wanted to sell the street, noting that its office's job was to develop the property rather than manage it.
Compared to its more colorful neighbor, the Bowery, Extra Place has left a shallow mark on history.
Some people think that the street got its name in 1802, when Philip Minthorn's large farm was divided among several of his children, and no one claimed that narrow strip of land.
The back door of CBGB, a punk rock monument that closed in 2006, led to Extra Place, and the alley is perhaps best known as the backdrop to a photo on the cover of Ramones' album "Rocket to Russia."
"The place was amazing," says Danny Fields, the Ramones manager who took the photo in November 1976.
"It was full of garbage, torn clothes and pieces of barrels, posters, leaves and ropes."
Some locals, including bloggers who write about re-edusting the East Village, oppose the idea of selling Extra Place, saying that the piece of public property, albeit mead, should remain public.
Others consider Extra Place a rarity - an almost unchanged piece of the city that should be left as it is.
Jeremiah Moss, who writes a blog called Jeremiah's Vanishing New York (subtitled "The Book of Lamentations: A Bitterly Nostalgic View of the City in the Process of Extinction"), posted part of the story about Extra Place from The Talk About the City column, which appeared in The New Yorker newspaper in 1952.
The author of the article, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a narrow dead end, dark even in the daytime, and bordered by rusty iron warehouse doors and battered windows where a week-old newspaper is run in the ravine."
With a few exceptions, the alleyway looked exactly the same one recent evening.
The rat ran across the blind end of the street near the door that once led to CBGB, which now has an expensive clothing store.
There was graffiti on the walls, and next to a fresh batch of tossed newspapers lay an empty beer bottle.
A few passersby said they rarely thought about Extra Place, but suggested he could use some of the boost.
Fields, on the other hand, said he thinks some people underestimate the impressiveness of the alley in its current state.
"The best years of my life," he said, "were in places dark, damp and disgusting."
Bilingual debate: immersion in English
In this edition of Focused on Education, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi will discuss candidates' positions on bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, a California academic and director of education at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is the co-author of "Worse Than You Think: Why the Middle Class Needs To Choose Schools."
Effectively reaching Out to Hispanic voters is a tricky business.
Barack Obama's education agenda just proves it.
The Obama campaign notes that "African-American and Hispanic students are significantly less likely to graduate than white students," which is true.
To combat such performance gaps, Obama's education agenda advocates, among other things, "transitional bilingual education" for those who are just learning English.
But the question for Barack Obama is whether his commitment to bilingual education, which emphasizes the use of languages other than English in the classroom, is stronger than his interest in reducing performance gaps.
Take Sixth Street Prep, a charter elementary school in Los Angeles County East, for example.
The school's pupils are, in the vast majority of cases, Hispanic from low-income families.
More than a third of students, many of whom have only recently arrived, are still learning English.
Even so, in the 2008 state maths tests, an incredible 100% of fourth-graders reached the highest level.
Almost as amazing ninety-three percent of fourth-graders reached the highest level in state tests in English language and literature.
This incredible success was achieved by a different method than Obama prefers.
Sixth Street emphasizes control and practice, constant assessment of abilities and an excuseless approach.
Furthermore, and Obama should note this, according to Linda Mikels, director of Sixth Street, the school's pedagogical approach for those who are just learning English is "complete immersion."
Immersion in English emphasizes the almost privileged use of English in teaching.
Miss Mikels, who is against bilingual education, told me: "We had tremendous success with a brand new pupil from Mexico - after 12 months you would have walked into a classroom and not knowing which one it was."
"It works," she said, "it works for us."
Would Obama take school like Sixth Street Prep as a model of what other schools with large proportions of Hispanic and English learners should look like?
The school's results should make the answer to that question a matter of course, but his own party's education agenda (the National Education Association is a longtime advocate of bilingual education) and its own consistent support for bilingual education make it difficult to predict Obama's answer.
While Obama agrees that immigrants should learn English, he recently trivialized the matter, saying that people should stop worrying about "English only" laws.
Instead, "you should make sure your children speak Spanish," he said.
If Obama really wants to erase performance gaps, he should think carefully about educational patterns that work rather than deteming and trivializing them.
Oil plummets due to renewed economic concerns
Oil prices fell sharply on Monday on fears that even a US plan to save financial markets might not revive the economy.
Oil futures prices fell as much as 7 percent to $99.80 a barrel in morning trading on the New York Commodity Exchange.
Prices have fallen by more than $20 a barrel since last Monday.
In the past two weeks, commodity markets have been rocked by financial unrest on Wall Street, as well as a pair of powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After reaching a high of $145.29 a barrel in July, prices fell to nearly $90 a barrel earlier this month, then jumped again on a wave of huge financial market uncertainty.
Anxiety gripped investors again On Monday, even after the congressional bureau announced that it had reached an agreement over the weekend on the largest rescue plan in history.
This report has been overshadowed by fresh concerns that the financial crisis is far from over.
In the latest episode of the advancing disintegration, the government announced that Citigroup would buy wachovia corporation's banking division.
Meanwhile, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partially nationaled the European financial conglomerate Fortis.
Analysts at Barclays Capital said the frantic weekend negotiations that led to the plan to save the economy "are showing themselves incapable of reviving the market mood."
As the economic situation deteriorates, demand for commodities, including oil, is expected to fall.
"The outlook for global stock, interest rate, and exchange rate markets has become highly uifiable," Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a note to investors.
"We believe that commodities will not be able to escape the contagion.
From a commodity perspective, our biggest concern is the extent to which the American virus will spread throughout the world, and especially to China."
The bank's analysts lowered their expectations for next year as oil consumption fell due to slower economic growth, and lowered their 2009 gasoline price forecasts by about 20%.
Wild ride in the second quarter broke the team record
After spending more time in a Jets jersey than anyone else in the last eight seasons, defensive player Shaun Ellis thought he'd seen it all.
Then, on Sunday, he watched the development of the second quarter, in which the Jets turned a scoreless game into a beautiful drive.
"I've never seen anything like it," Ellis said.
The second quarter began after the Jets and Arizona Cardinals matched the gloomy clouds above them with their troubled play.
Then quarterback Brett Favre sent Laveranues Coles on a 12-yard touchdown run, perfectly foreshrust into an afternoon in which their gradually evolving partnership moved miles ahead.
Favre sent Coles out for two more touchdowns this quarter, including one that dropped a cornerback and another 10 seconds into the game.
"It wasn't anything out of the place," Favre said of all his passes to Coles.
"He's a hell of a player.
We communicated well, no matter what people think."
While Favre and Coles were tossing, the defense was attacking Cardinals quarterback Kurt Warner.
Cornerback Darelle Revis intercepted a stray throw and returned it 32 yards for a touchdown.
Safety Eric Smith picked out another pass and intercepted it.
Linebacker David Bowens forced Warner into a fumble.
The last loss of the ball, the fumble Bowens forced, was perhaps the best ever.
The Cardinals got to the ball with 10 seconds left, and after the Jets got the ball back, Jay Feely kicked a 20-yard field goal to take a 34-0 lead.
That's the most the Jets have ever won in a quarter.
Jets coach Eric Mangini, when asked to describe the madness, said, "Second quarter or third quarter?"
When told that both - the Jets allowed 21 unacsoed points in the third quarter - Mangini said, "I can tell you that I enjoyed the second quarter a lot more than the third.
Many points were scored in a short period of time."
Rested Gebreselassie improved his world record
Haile Gebreselassie of Ethiopia once again showed why many consider him the best long-distance runner ever, breaking his own world record in the Berlin Marathon on Sunday, becoming the first person to run a 26.2-mile race in under two hours and four minutes.
By winning on a pleasantly flat track in 2:03:59, he beat his previous time of 2:04:26, which he ran in Berlin last year, by 27 seconds.
Gebreselassie, who is 35, set the 26th world record of his career, which is truly incredibly wide - he has broken the world record or at least is a world champion at all distances from the metric mile to the marathon.
Last month, Gebreselassie skipped the Beijing Olympics because he feared - perhaps too alarmed in hindsight - that air pollution would irritate his asthma problems.
Instead, he promised to run in Berlin.
In near-perfect conditions - sunny and 48 degrees at the start, 55 degrees at the finish line - Gebreselassie won on Sunday with a lightning-fast average of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile.
Since track runners like Gebreselassie and Paul Tergat of Kenya focused on longer tracks, the marathon record has dropped by more than two minutes in the past decade since Ronaldo da Costa of Brazil won in Berlin in 2:06:05 in 1998.
After Sunday's victory, Gebreselassie told reporters that he had a calf cramp two weeks ago and missed a week of practice.
The break obviously got him excited rather than delayed.
"I'm so happy," Gebreselassie told reporters.
"Everything was perfect.
I started over a week ago and was a little in doubt today, but everything was fine."
He was also criticized - especially in Kenya, Ethiopia's East African rival - for allegedly over-planning his races, generally avoiding world marathon leaders, relying on wires as if it were a race on the track, and putting world records above the sense of competition.
But this criticism can hardly reduce Gebreselassie's tremendous running qualities.
Kept pace with four Kenyans, Gebreselassie reached the halfway point with 1:02:04 to go.
After the wires fell off, two elite Kenyan runners, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, continued to chase Gebreselassie.
A little more than three miles before the finish, Gebreselassie took the last time and escaped Kwambai, who then finished second in 2:05:36, improving his personal best by almost five minutes.
Kamathi finished third in 2:07:48.
In the women's race, Irina Mikitěnková, a native of Kazakhstan who is now a German citizen, rounded off an excellent year with the seventh fastest time in history in 2:19:19.
The record time of 2:15:25 is held by Paula Radcliffe from Great Britain.
Mikitěnková, 36, surprisingly won the London Marathon in 2:24:14 last spring.
She missed the Beijing Games due to what has been described as a back injury, but recovered and won in Berlin, improving her personal best by almost five minutes in the third marathon she has ever run.
She ran the race smartly and thoughtfully: she let four Ethiopian and Kenyan runners escape into a big lead, and then she dragged them after about 18 1/2 miles.
Askale Tafa Magarsa of Ethiopia finished second in 2:21:31 and Helene Kiprop of Kenya finished third in 2:25:01.
Pride and obstacles to black life in a separate city
Hidden among the larger Orlando's streurous theme parks, a few miles from everything shiny, noisy and huge, lies a quiet city where the pride and demands of African-American life come to life.
Eatonville, the first all-black city to be incorporated into the state, where Zora Neale Hurston spent her childhood, is no longer as simple as she described it in 1935: "a city of five lakes, three croquet fields, three hundred brown skins, three hundred good swimmers, enough guava, two schools, and no prison."
Now it's a place of pilgrimage.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee came to eatonville's annual Zora! festival to pay tribute to Hurston, the most famous female writer of the Harlem Renaissance.
The city she described remains on the sidelines, even though it has made it a stop for tourists by including it in a Florida tourist guide created by the Depression-era Federal Writers project.
It's still as independent, dignified, and private as it was in the 1930s, when Hurston wrote that rural blacks in Florida often resisted sharing their true feelings with a white man who "knows so little about us that he doesn't even know what he's missing."
Even today, in a year when a black presidential candidate, Senator Barack Obama, is calling for an open debate about race, many locals remain wary of the views of strangers.
"We pay great attention to how our story is told," says Hortense Jones, 59, who has lived here since birth and is a member of the oldest parish in the city.
"It's got to be right."
Eatonville has long been characterized as a paradox of triumph and effort.
It is both a historical model of black rise and a community of nearly 2,400 people, where the poverty rate is twice the national average.
It is a center of literature, but also oaks shielded by an example of Southern rural black culture - sometimes despised, sometimes praised - that arose from American slavery.
It's not surprising that the locals are both proud and protective.
And the worries about eatonville's idea really started with Zora, which is the only way hurstons are called here.
She introduced her hometown to the world through heartfelt books full of dialect such as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937).
Five paragraphs of florida's tourist guide turned the city a short distance into Route 17, which runs through florida's often-neglected center, into a stage of black history and human drama.
With a great drumbeat in her life and literature, Hurston led readers to the store of Eatonville's first mayor, Joe Clark, and then turned to more personal places.
"To the left of the road," she wrote, "is a white brown-decorated modern national school with well-maintained courtyards and playgrounds that Howard Miller always takes care of, even if he can't read or write much."
She also mentioned widow Dash's new husband and wrote that Lee Glenn "sells drinks of all kinds and anything that fits into an hour-long hotel."
So in just a few hundred words, Hurston connected Eatonville with self-government, but also with illiteracy, remarried marriage, and sex.
This was clearly not typical Fodor's publishing house.
In fact, it wasn't a portrait that everyone appreciated.
"Zora said it the way it was," says Ella Dinkins, 90, one of johnson's girls, who made Hurston immortal by quoting men who sang dirty songs about their beauty.
"Some people didn't like it," she added.
Hurston is still remembered here as a chipper eccentric who often returned after her family moved to Jacksonville, Florida.
Augustus Franklin, 77, remembers that most of the time, when she arrived in the city, she arrived unannounced in a huge Chevrolet, smoking and wearing pants in a city that is still proud of its dignified dress.
Most residents were fascinated, Franklin said, but many sneered.
"The people have always been happy to see Zora," Franklin said.
But, he added, swinging on a chair on the back terrace overlooking Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was most likely baptized, "she never stayed too long."
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were taken out of print.
Eatonville, along with the rest of the world, seemed to have forgotten her.
Although she was once a literary star, a contemporary of Langston Hughes and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in an unmarked grave in Fort Pierce, Florida, where she had previously lived.
There were no major funeral ceremonies or large public readings in Eatonville.
"I don't think they understood her importance to the world or her legacy at all," said Valerie Boyd, author of Hurston's 2003 biography "Wrapped in Rainbows."
Change came in the 1980s.
Orange County officials wanted to stretch the city through a five-way highway instead of Kennedy Boulevard, the local two-way main road.
Orlando's resuadment has already pushed Interstate 4 through the western edge of the city.
The proposal came at a time when Eatonville was still coming out of a difficult historical period.
Forced integration, along with other things, ended the relatively idyllic isolation of this community.
In the 1950s, the struggle to mix races brought hatred to the threshold of the community.
"At the time, a bunch of white guys, they came in and threw oranges and stuff at people sitting on the side," Franklin said.
"Actually, we had a lady who was killed.
They threw a watermelon out of the car."
In a 1955 letter to The Orlando Sentinel, Hurston questioned the Supreme Court's demand for forced integration, saying his decision in the Brown case against the Education Chamber was "insulting rather than glorifying to my race."
Residents now claim that the desegregation of schools, while positive in some areas, has reduced cohesion in Eatonville and undermined the courage of the local youth.
"Black kids were used to hugs - I remember - you hugged your teacher in the morning, you hugged your teacher in the evening," said N.Y. Nathiri, Ella Dinkins' daughter and executive director of preserve the eatonville community, a nonprofit group.
This lasted until teachers and pupils came from the same place, she added.
"You're not hugging your white teacher because your white teacher - I mean, there's a cultural barrier," Ms. Nathiri said.
However, civil rights have helped create space for many more Zora Neale Hurstons - black writers, actors and artists who, like her, have risen above prejudice with reckless self-confidence and quotes such as "How can anyone deny themselves the pleasure of my presence!
I won't understand."
In 1975, Alice Walker reached hurston's unmarked grave and began fighting to revive her reputation.
Five years later, Robert E. Hemenway's vau démen hurston's vau déitate came to the shelves in bookstores, which rein-added her to the American canon.
The highway project arrived just as Eatonville's most famous daughter had redissed the ramp lights.
Hurston's former neighbors now considered her a savior.
To show what can happen to its highway, the community began planning the Hurston Festival in 1988.
Thousands of fans arrived at the inaugural event two years later, and every January many return to celebrate.
After a few years, the state withdrew from the highway proposal.
"The five currents of the highway have resurrected, you'd think it blew up, real civic pride," Nathiri said.
Boyd put it more simply: "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory over the highway project helped change the city's image.
Out-of-towners like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who started going to the church here in 1993, began showing up in larger numbers, and residents began to rethink the past.
Eatonville joined the National Historical Register in 1998.
The new one-story library (named after Hurston, of course) opened in 2006 on the re-asphalted and beautified Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville remains Florida's anomaly: just six miles from downtown Orlando, it can sometimes feel like a back alley in summer rain, as small as when it was founded with just 27 black families in the 1880s.
(Today, 90 percent are black.)
Strangers who come looking for the story and meaning of Eatonville are still often treated with caution.
Permission for most interviews must be given in advance, and certain things - like murals in Eatonville's oldest church, painted by white people and depicting black people in fields - are not allowed to be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Jones, a courageous, confident teacher who likes rich red, still fear that their isolated community will not be properly understood.
And even as the Hurston Festival got bigger, so did the home pride.
Young people, in particular, tend to see Eatonville as Hurston saw her entire race: beautiful, with problems and all, but no better, not worse, and as proud, creative, hardworking, foolish, and diverse as other American races and ethnicities.
The voice of Franklin's nephew, 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, has a sincere love for the community as he plans to return to Eatonville after college to work in the local government or the police, which he says would use some help.
And even younger ones, such as 11-year-old Winter Park twins Alondra and Alexia Kenon, seem to have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
"Most people, when they just pass through here, they think, 'Um, this town is nothing compared to the others,'" Alondra Kenon said after church on a recent Sunday.
"But if you really stop and look at history for a while, it's a very nice city."
Here in New York, we're all fluent in finance.
At first glance, nothing has changed here.
If tourists in Manhattan stayed away from newsstands and giant TV screens in Times Square, they wouldn't realize they were standing in the middle of a storm.
They would never have thought that in the glass beehive of offices above their heads, bankers and hedge fund managers monopolizing New York have the worst "bad day at the office" every day since the 1929 crisis.
Delivery men still rattle metal carts along the sidewalks, carrying muffin baking trays to breakfast meetings.
Hispanics are still moving between the towers, wearing, like human mules, 50 ironed shirts that hang from the vahadels on their backs.
Office rats are still waiting in line for their morning bagel at street food stalls, and it's still impossible to get a yellow cab between 4:00 and 7:00 p.m. on a weekday.
It didn't look like a crisis at all until, with all the talk of pessimism, I decided to open a savings account on Thursday afternoon.
Even though I timed this assignment to cover up with a late afternoon siesta at my local JP Morgan Chase branch, there were already about 20 people waiting in line.
Not in front of cash desks to pick up or deposit cash, but in front of the counter where older clients order checkbooks, tourists ask for a way to macy's convenience store, and new customers set up accounts.
Most of the people before me, as I learned from Starr, my "licensed personal banker," came for the same reason I did.
But unlike me, they've already with withered their savings from smaller banks in places they came from, like New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Staten Island.
They have with with taken money from so-called thrifts (a bit like building societies), money associations and those types of savings banks whose branches operate in only one state, claiming to look after their customers as a family.
In the past year, 15 such banks have quietly gone bankrupt.
A few days ago, Washington Mutual, a $327 billion bank with assets, went bankrupt, and when New Yorkers returned home for the weekend Friday night, another bank, Wachovia, with $440 billion in assets, tried to catch a rescue buyer.
Office and store employees, who stood before me and feared another collapse, moved their cash to a bank that is perceived as a safe haven and that does most of the saving on Wall Street.
Ordinary New Yorkers have learned fluent financially over the past week.
A woman in my local Chinese supermarket spoke on the phone, speaking to Lehman Borthers, the bankrupt bank, and her emaciated chief executive, Dick Fuldo, with as much famine as if gossiping about a lazy colleague.
And Lyn, the uniformed 50-year-old janist of my apartment building, changed the subject of our ordinary conversation - Brad, Angelina, or my grocery delivery.
After my visit to the bank, she told me, "I have my savings in money market funds now.
I moved it, I'm not taking any chances."
Memorable lives: Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes: As Guildford's music director since 1962, Vernon "Tod" Handley (obituary, September 11) was in charge of the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and Choir.
As part of the district's music plan, he founded an excellent proteus youth choir a year later.
He was supposed to be under 21, but by the time Proteus last sang in 1979, there were almost 30 of us - we just refused to give up the chorus.
The name "Proteus" (mythological shape changer) represented the willingness and ability of the choir to embark on any music presented to it - whether madrigals or Messiaen, either alone or with the whole orchestra.
The musical adaptability created by such a young choir was often overwhelming, always exciting, all thanks to the inspiration of that one man and the enthusiasm for music that remained absolutely unchanged all the time.
How often did Tod just tell us to "let the music speak for itself."
He said, "The composer knows what he wants.
It's all in the music.
Then sing it! "
His baton technique was very clear and precise, but it was neither dictatorial nor flowery.
Wherever the standard of music was, it always lifted it up.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If any conductor was to be knighted, it was Vernon Handley.
I knew him well in the two decades he conducted Guildford Philharomines from 1962 to 1982.
I have reviewed over 100 of his concerts over the last 40 years or so and I can honestly say that I have never been disappointed in any of them - and I have been inspired many times.
Tod Handley had such a great combination of size and personal modesty.
He hated conductors who, in his words, simply "dragged one or two soaked stones around the world."
He's going to be missed by a lot of us.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
Your obituary of William Woodruff (September 25) states that "in 1946 he returned to economic history at Oxford and in 1950 became a researcher at Houblon-Norman... and at the same time studied at BSc, MA and PhD".
This is based on Woodruff's author's note in Beyond Nab End, but it's not accurate.
From 1946 to 1953 he taught economics history at the University of Nottingham, and at that time he finished his dissertation on the British rubber industry, led by Professor J.D. Chambers, and subsequently published it in 1958 as a publication of the British Rubber Industry.
Indeed, he spent the years 1950-51 in America as a researcher at Houblon-Norman and the summer of 1952 at Illinois, Harvard and New York University.
In 1953, he finally left Nottingham and moved to Illinois.
It is not known why Woodruff moved on to this part of his career.
Muslim graves desecrated after Austrian right-wing break
Heinz-Christian Strache, left, of the Austrian right-wing Freedom Party, and Filip Dewinter of the Belgian right-wing Vlaams Belang party attend a rally in Antwerp on Thursday, January 17, 2008.
They carry signs similar to road signs that show mosques crossed out by a red line.
Police accuse right-wing extremists of desecrating a Muslim cemetery in Austria on the same weekend that extreme right-wing parties made huge gains in the general election.
More than 90 graves in the cemetery in the town of Traun near Linz were severely damaged sometime between Friday evening and this morning, and police believe it was an organized event.
The culprits spray-painted Jewish symbols on some graves, such as David's Star, but detectives believe it may have been an attempt to disguise the motives of extremists led by hatred of Muslim immigrants.
It is unclear whether the incident was connected to the election in any way.
A spokesman for the Islamic community said they were "deeply shocked" by the news of the desecration, which comes as the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan approaches its end.
Austria, meanwhile, is entering the soul-searching round after swinging to the right in yesterday's parliamentary elections.
The two far-right parties, which together won more than 30 percent of the vote, the Freedom Party and the Union for the Future of Austria, waged a vehemently anti-immigrant campaign, and some of their slogans were condemned by critics as xenophobic.
Heinz-Christian Strache, leader of the Freedom Party, which won more than 18 percent of the vote, protested against headscarves and burqas in the campaign and even expressed his opposition to foods that are perceived to be related to Islam.
At his last meeting with voters in Vienna, he spoke of a "European brotherhood" to prevent the rise of Islam.
Both sides are trying to ban the construction of mosques and minarets, arguing that they are political symbols of the ongoing Islamization of Austria and Europe.
Surveys and analyses carried out immediately after the elections, which put the extreme right as the strongest political bloc in the country, suggest that this change was mainly due to young voters who are worried about their future in the European Union.
Gary Glitter is not allowed on a trip abroad
Gary Glitter, a glamrock star who was convicted of child sexual abuse, was banned from travel to France and Spain by the court.
Officials imposed the six-month ban on Glitter after he informed monitoring authorities that he planned to travel to Spain via France.
Kent Police agreed to the travel ban last Thursday after handing over evidence of Glitter's past child sexual abuse cases to officials.
Glitter, real name Paul Gadd, did not attend the hearing at Ashford Crown Court in Kent, but was represented by corker binning lawyers.
A spokesman for the court service said: "On Thursday 25 September at Ashford Crown Court, Kent Police applied for an order to prevent Mr Paul Gadd from crossing the border into France and Spain until 25 March.
Paul Gadd did not attend in person."
Glitter, 64, informed authorities that he wished to travel abroad, as required by his sex offenders' record.
He must notify the authorities if he wants to travel abroad for more than three days.
They must also hand over the planned departure date to the police a week in advance.
If he neglected the duty to inform the authorities, he could be sentenced to five years.
Kent Police said it would not discuss individual cases of Glitter's possible travels around the county.
A Kent Police spokeswoman said: "Kent Police will do everything necessary to protect children in this country or abroad.
From our point of view, it is easier to track someone who stays in Britain, because we have extensive systems that handle potential dangers more effectively.
Protecting kent residents is a top priority for Kent Police and we are working hard to monitor the behaviour of recorded sex offenders to minimise any danger to the public."
Glitter returned to Britain last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for abusing two girls, aged 10 and 11.
When he was released, he flew to Bangkok to board a flight to London.
But he said he wasn't feeling well, and refused to fly to London.
Thai authorities wouldn't let him pass passport control and he eventually flew to Hong Kong.
Chinese authorities also refused to allow him to enter, and he flew back to Bangkok, where Thai police and immigration officials insisted on his return to Britain.
On August 22, he finally arrived at Heathrow Terminal 3 and stayed there while his solicitor David Corker went to Uxbridge's Lowest Criminal Court in west London, while Scotland Yard successfully requested an order ordering him to register as a sex offender.
Glitter was previously jailed for four months in the UK for possessing child pornography.
An Interior Ministry source said Jacqui Smith, the Home Secretary, was calm and glad Glitter had been prevented from going to France and Spain.
"To capture the true character, I take pictures of the master off-stage." Günther Bauer - photographer
No heels, no ruffles, no costumes.
Only the essence of great flamenco masters, detached from focusing on interpretation - I will only get the relaxed expression of a man or a woman.
Artist on one side.
On the other hand, human.
Inseparable, privacy aside, at those moments far from the audience - that's when you can see the intimate gesture, the depth of the glance caught, or the passionate gesticulation of hands that are carefree because they're not about to step onto the stage.
German Günther Bauer alternates the theatricality of performances with singers, dancers and guitarists with the lesser-known face of masters in "Flamenco-people".
With this in mind, the photographer compiles a unique iconography of flamenco from different backgrounds.
The exhibition, which takes place as part of the Mes de la Fotografía Flamenca Photography Month program, "reflects the ever-growing international importance of flamenco," says the author, explaining that "Flamenco-people" "can be any kind of people, but if you look at the photos, you will find that these are not typical images of artists on the stage.
These people portrayed "on the street" are artists able to bring passion, sadness, joy to the scene... and completely captivate the audience.
To capture the personality of these artists, it is not necessary to take pictures on stage.
He carries his personality and character inside.
I was interested in creating a relaxed atmosphere that would allow me to capture the personality of flamenco greats.
Enchanted by the "Cante de las Minas" festival, Bauer began the long journey of portraiting flamenco singers, guitarists and dancers on a board camera in 1997.
They are portraits that, thanks to the choice of camera and material, resemble classic photography.
The use of different stylistic means is contrary to the classical basis of the film and lends it a contemporary spirit, an idea that Bauer himself says is mirrored by flamenco: "Music with very traditional roots, but it continues to surprise and evolve."
What attracts the audience is not the action of the dance, singing or play itself, but the personality and character of the artist.
The search for the moment when we encounter the most important, the spirit that appears in the way of perception, existence and experience, was and is the constant of the work presented during these days in the Gallery of El Fotómata.
This selection of nearly seventy photographed artists is shaped by well-known flamenco figures such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales and Vicente Amigo, among others.
The project has become a kind of flamenco anthology and will soon see a book edition containing portraits on display.
Two years ago, Bauer's passion for portraiture led him to the idea of repeating the idea on "Portraits of Sports Veterans" ("SportARTproject").
Although their concept is different from "Flamenco-people", the photographer admits that "taking pictures of people, getting to know them and being able to enter their lives for a moment, whether longer or short - that's my passion.
I think in photography, portraiture is the most difficult genre.
A person meets or encounters people, personalities he sometimes doesn't even know, or they only give him a few minutes to take pictures.
Despite similar circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to realize my ideas."
The collection of portraits of contemporary flamenco called "Flamenco-people" is on display at the El Fotómata Gallery at 20 De la Mata, parallel to the Alameda de Hércules, and can be visited until 16 October.
Vargas Llosa admitted that the novel he is writing is 'presumptuous'
Set in an environment he doesn't yet know, he tells of events unknown to him, yet Mario Vargas Llosa intends to successfully implement his new project - he is currently working on a novel whose main character is Roger Casemant, an Irish nationalist who lived in the Congo for 20 years and traveled in the Amazon.
The peren 24-year-old nobel prize favorite for literature confessed yesterday at the Hay Festival Segovia that the project currently employing him "is presumptuous", and that "all indications are that I should not write" this novel.
"If I had any sense, I wouldn't do it, but I will, and I believe I will one day finish it," he concluded his speech at the festival of the exchange of ideas, thoughts and words, which saw around 100 writers, historians and journalists and thousands of other people in the city over four days.
The author of the novel "City and Dogs" was one of the main characters of the third year of the festival of words and fulfilled expectations.
Vargas Llosa, who won the Hay Festival award for most popular writer - an old edition of Dickens' "Our mutual friend" - filled the Juan Bravo Theater to the last place.
With Félix Romeo in the audience, to whom an hour of time passed like water - the Peruvian, with amazing precision and a great deal of humour, recalled how a literary mission had been born in him from the original "incredible adventure" of "the pleasure of an avid reader" and the "power to live more than I have lived"; how he subsupulate the "lack of inspiration" by writing "disciplinedly", carefully accumulating the text, correcting and rewriting; or how Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alexandre Dumas influenced his writing, and what "remembrance images" are the main basis of his stories.
The Hispanic-American novelist admitted that "there is no way" to know if and to what extent books can change lives, "but I refuse to believe that literature is just fun, a fleeting experience" - vargas llosa stressed, saying that he "affects people" and "forces them to try to step out of line," and called on writers to "not succumb to frivolity" and "take responsibility" for their mission.
Due to climatology, the festival in Pozoblac is losing - spears are missing
The performance with spears, which concludes the festival in Pozoblak, was cancelled yesterday morning after the announcement by the performers that the surface of the square was not in good condition.
That is why the company, together with Fermín Bohórquez, Pablo Hermosa de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernández, decided to cancel the bullfights.
Adverse weather conditions have plagued the festival for a long time, with two of the three celebrations unable to take place.
On Saturday, the rain made it impossible for the second scheduled bull fights to take place.
During them, the formation of José Luis Moreno, Curro Díaz and Juan Bautista was to face the bulls in the arena on Castilblanc.
But that's only how it was celebrated on Friday.
The winner was Daniel Luque, who cut off three ears and was carried off on his shoulders as a reward for a dynamic and aesthetically high-quality performance.
On the same afternoon, Alejandro Talavante exchanged two spear blows for greetings and one ear, which brought him more open seats in the arena than bullfighting.
Even worse was El Juli, who walked through the Los Llanos bull arena unsatenly greasy.
In the second round of hard work without a single respite, he earned sharp criticism from most of the audience.
They got away from a checkpoint in Álava in a van with 2,000 kilograms of hashish
Ten minutes to five.
Ertzaintza RoadSide Check in armiñón (Álava) district.
Officers stop two people driving a van and they get away.
The cargo, more than two tons of hashish, is not to be stopped.
According to a report by the Basque government's Interior Department, officers pursued them and detained one of the people in the van, a man aged 38, identified as A.A.J.
The detainee was charged with drug trafficking and falsifying state documents.
The incident occurred while several members of the Transport Unit were conducting roadside checks on the N-1 at the locations where it passes through the armiñón district border.
They were about to stop the van for inspection, but the driver disobeyed instructions, accelerated sharply and drove off.
The officers immediately began to prosecute the car until the vehicle stopped on the side of the road a few kilometers away, at which point the two passengers jumped up and fled into the wooded area.
Ertzaintz eventually caught up with one of them and confiscated 2,178 kilograms of hashish that the suspects were transporting, according to a search of an Iveco Daily van.
The back of the vehicle was loaded with hashish packages, which were subsequently transported to other police departments for detailed expertise and weighing of the drug.
In addition, the police found that the license plate was "wrinkled" and did not match the data on the van's documents, so the detainee was also accused of falsifying state documents.
Ertzaintza continues to search for the second suspect, who, as has already been mentioned, managed to escape in order to finally determine the origin of the seized drug.
The detainee, A. A. J., 28, was taken to the police department for appropriate formalities before further investigation is later carried out.
Actress Heather Locklear arrested for driving under the influence
Actress Heather Locklear, a favorite of Amanda from Melrose Place, was arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara, California, for driving under the influence.
The witness saw her performing unusual maneuvers as she tried to pull out of a parking lot in Montecito, a California Highway Patrol spokesman told People magazine.
The witness stated that around 4:30 p.m. Locklear pedaled the gas, moving forwards and backwards with a loud roar, trying to get out of the parking space - she ran over her sunglasses several times while backing up.
The witness, who did not appear to recognize the actress at first, saw Locklear moments after stopping on a nearby highway and getting out of the vehicle.
The person also alerted the emergency services because they were "afraid for Locklear's life."
When a police patrol arrived at the scene, they found the actress inside the vehicle, which partially blocked the road.
"She looked disoriented," so officers took her to a specialized drug and alcohol center to undergo a test.
According to a police spokeswoman, the actress cooperated and excessive amounts of alcohol were immediately ruled out, yet "we believe Locklear was under the influence of some medication, which was apparent to the officers at first sight."
Locklear was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence of an unspecified substance and was taken into custody around 7 p.m., although she was released hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear returned from a treatment clinic to recover from anxiety and depression.
Llamazares urges Andalusian IU to exercise its powers in Silva case
Gaspar Llamazares, the IU's general manager and Member for the United Left, said today that the final decision in the case of former Seville City Hall Councillor Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned last week after being accused of acting on behalf of his family, would depend on the party's regional association.
"I am too federalist for this, it is up to the Andalusian organisation to exercise its powers," Llamazares said, hinting at the conduct the party will have to take in relation to the former member of the Seville City Council.
However, the head of the IU insisted that "transparency" was absolutely necessary in the case of the investigation into Silva's illegal conduct: "The IU has always fought to make such matters as transparent as possible."
He also stressed that the party has a "strict code of ethics for all public functions."
"May Blood" ('Sangre de mayo'), Garcia's epic bet
José Luis Garcia in "May Blood" (Sangre de mayo), inspired by Benito Pérez Galdós' National Past Episodes, revives the Spanish's famous uprising against the French - the most ambitious film in his filmography, with a budget of around €15 million.
In this way, the filmmaker wanted to portray the eloquence of the characters and the analysis of society, which he always admired in the work of the famous novelist, he explained today, together with Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría, during the presentation of the film in front of an extensive team of performers.
May's blood with a clockwork of over two and a half hours will be released in cinemas this Friday, and a more than four-hour series for Telemadrid TV is planned in the future.
José Luis Garcia, a great admirer of Galdós' literary work, claims that by making this film he fulfilled a "childhood dream", which he owes to Esperanz Aguirre, who three years ago commissioned him to make a film for the 200th anniversary of Madrid on May 2, he accepted the offer, saying that the plot would be based on Episodes of the National Past.
The $15 million budget, to which the province of Madrid has contributed entirely, provides a "unique opportunity" for Garcia to create an environment with backdrops and costumes corresponding to the image of "a cherry-and-white Spain that was wrong about a leader who could be fought for - the struggle for independence led to the country's decline and backwardness under Ferdinand VII," he said.
However, the director regrets that he cannot count on the financial support received by the films Sad Wing (Ala triste) or Goya's ghosts - almost twice the mayan blood - so he could not film some scenes from a script signed at the same time by Horacio Valcárcel, with whom he has worked for almost his entire film career.
The director of "Start Over" (Volver and empezar) works as he is normally used to - on stage with actors with whom he usually rehearses before filming and who do not choose casting because he finds it "humiliating" and also believes that "part of the profession of director is, among other things, to go to theatres and cinemas and thus learn what is going on in the craft , which it deals with'.
Many of the actors he chose for May's Blood have appeared on camera several times, including Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga and Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Garcia, with four Oscar nominations, one of which he received, believes that none of the three candidates representing Spain this year before the Hollywood Academy, May's blood itself, the Seven Tables of French Billiards, and the last selected Blind Sunflower, represent the younger generation of the Spanish film scene, but claim that "it is yet to emerge."
Garcia doesn't expect any awards for this film.
"At first you think you're working for what happens next, but then you realize you're only working for the make, so you give in to make one more movie," garcia explains, with a 30-year directorial career.
Isabel Bayón revives the spiritual legacy of Seville dancer Toórtola Valencia
A Seville flamenco dancer pays tribute to another Seville dancer.
Carmen Tórtola Valencia, from her father, Florenç Tórtola Ferrer, and her mother, Andalusanka (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in triana, and moved to London with her family when she was three.
She danced modern dance and focused on oriental dances.
She lived a life of passion, pioneering female emancipation like Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf, and Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist and a vegetarian and fought to remove the corset, which prevented women from moving freely.
The life of this woman influenced by the dance and aesthetic revolution of interwar Europe enchanted Isabele Bayón.
"I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and she designed this character for me - I thought it was incredible."
According to the dancer, "it's not about telling her life, it's about grasping the soul.
The names of her dance performances reminded me of the rhythms of flamenco.
So the "butterfly dance" reminded me of guajira or "snake dance" some kind of thong.
Her dance was sensual and they told me that my dance also corresponded to this aesthetic," she says.
The performance includes two exceptional personalities: Miguel Pod, who will sing Isabelle in one performance as well as in "Open Door" (La puerta abierta), and dance teacher Matilde Coral, who made an exception and agreed to collaborate with her former student.
"Matilde represents an older Tortola, a mature figure.
I am happy that she has accepted the offer to participate in my project, and it is a great honor for me."
The performance also includes music and guitars by Jesús Torres and Paco Arriaga, vocals by Miguel Ortega, el Pulga and Moi de Morón; the drums of El Pájara, the viola of Rafa El Viola and the collaboration of the actor Juanfra Juárez, "who has the role of eternal guide to this kind of artists, who are prima donnas with everything and who are always in love with them".
The work also takes into account the life of this woman, which took place at her time in such far-flung places as India, the United States or Russia, as well as throughout Europe, because she usually resided in London.
"I wanted to remind her because I think she was one of those women who has a huge influence at some point, but now no one knows her and even less appreciates her work," bayón says.
The performance starts today at 8.30pm at the Lope de Vega Theatre.
J. Vicente Resino at the Faculty of Arts
"I recommend José Vicente Resina's exhibition "Flamenco and Life" because his documentary black and white photographs are amazing.
They captivated me with the simplicity and powerful charge with which they affect the audience and the consideration and respect for the photographers.
An exhibition that shows a lot of feeling.
Resino can capture magical moments."
The book "Diary of a Freshly Married" also closes the trienni
The launch of the first illustrated edition of "Diary of a Newly Married" at Saint Stephen's Church (New York), on site, where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in March 1916, is part of a program coordinated by the Cultural Council of the Autonomous Andalusian Government to celebrate the "Triennial of Zenobia and Juan Ramón" (2006-2008), organized to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Award of the Nobel Prize in Literature and the anniversary of their deaths.
The "Triennial of Zenobia and Juan Ramón" is coming to an end with a new edition of this work, an international congress to be held in New York, a repair of the Nobel Museum House, and a travelling exhibition, "Juan Ramón Jiménez: That Ray of The Sun," which opened in May of this year, and after touring the various Andalusian provinces, it should move to New York as planned at the time of the congress.
The Cultural Council of the Autonomous Andalusian Government also ordered 800 copies of the "Diary of the Freshly Married", edited by Pedro Taberner and illustrated by Jacob Pérez-Encis, to continue spreading awareness of the personality and work of one of Andalusian poets.
America without Paul Newman doesn't like itself so much anymore
"Sometimes God creates perfect people.
Paul Newman was one of them."
These are the words of actress Sally Field, who collaborated with him on "No Evil Intentions" and, under the weight of knowing that Newman had left, reveals her bleak vision of abandoned American cinema and all of America.
Look how long it took them to get an Oscar.
And that he's been retired since 2007.
And that he was known to be gravely ill.
Still, he was a big man to everyone.
"Sometimes what one feels can't be expressed in any way, and now I've lost a great friend," Robert Redford said in tears, "my life and my country were better because of him."
No one was afraid of being ridiculous or exaggerating.
The father of film and country died in a particularly dark time of fear of terrorists and financial markets, at a time when American self-confidence is at an end, when reasons for pride are desperately sought.
When times are rough and people without virtues and only a handful of those worth admiring - there's no need to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
For all, he embodied an almost platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was an official opponent of Richard Nixon and a champion of lost and won cases, from a foundation against drug addiction founded in honor of his firstborn son who died of an overdose to his own brand of home-cooked food and organic food.
A complete treasure trove for a country that has spent a lot of effort freeing from a suicidal eating culture.
A storm of admiration flooded Hollywood, regardless of nationality or nationality.
The last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, stated that not one man died, but an entire era.
Another Englishman, Oscar winner sam mendes, said working with Newman was without exaggeration the highlight of his career.
The bad boy from Australia, Russell Crowe, dared to call Newman his greatest source of inspiration.
"That fox set a pretty high bar for all of us," says George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who nowadays has the courage to try to live like Paul Newman did - prides himself on honesty and leads a serious private life away from the cameras.
This is not always easy, sometimes even possible, in today's media jungle.
But luckily, that's the kind of people they are, and Paul Newman is their role model.
He divorced once, and has since been married for 50 years to Joanne Woodward, to which he was faithful, although he certainly had more than enough opportunities not to be.
"Why would I go out for a hamburger if I have a filet at home?" he liked to joke.
Let there be pride in heaven that there is a connection between his daughters and admirers on earth - it is not very common in America.
It is said that "of all the great roles he embodied, he was proudest of the role of devoted husband, loving father, willing grandfather and dedicated philanthropist."
Imperfect races of Olympic Madrid
Yes, many of us want the Olympics to take place in Madrid, and after a failed 2012, it may be 2016.
But I'm asking: are we ready?
If we follow yesterday's race, I say no!
It was talked about as the perfect race, and in my opinion, it was the worst I've ever been to.
Such a bunch of nonsense that right away, when it came to evaluation and I was the examiner, it would be clearly inadequate.
But let's look at it from the beginning, one by one.
Nonsense begins with picking up a race number that makes you have to leave early.
That doesn't seem bad to me, but when you go there, let them give them everything (including a chip to avoid overcrowding).
Oh, no.
Here one had to pick up a number first (first nonsense, go there only for that) and (after standing in the proper queue) - what a surprise! - they only had an S size T-shirt (second nonsense, because I need an XL size).
Where do we live?
Because of the crisis, they decided to buy only small T-shirts because it is less fabric and they are cheaper?
Well, that's a little thing compared to what happened on race day.
In addition to having to go very early for the chip and the queue for it lasted over 15 minutes, a backpack had to be handed in.
Over 35 minutes of waiting time, which is incomprehensible at a race where 11,000 people are expected.
So, as expected, the race started and we haven't put down our backpacks yet, and when we did, it was much worse with the pickup.
In addition, the wait was extended by 40 minutes by rain, which led to a general musing and an attack on the cabin.
I believe that 500 of us will have bronchitis tomorrow, and some, like me, will not see the right time to evaluate the results because of the chip they gave me, which I assume did not record the start time correctly.
Of course, if someone asked me about some perfect race, I wouldn't have thought of this one.
So I think we're just going to have to dream about a well-prepared Olympic city.
Microsoft is looking for a receptionist (virtual)
At the MIT new technology conference, Microsoft demonstrated further developments in the new AI-like image recognition and human interaction system - not very intelligent, but capable of performing basic tasks like summoning a taxi (or, in the case of Microsoft, a messenger that would move around the company's campus) and perceiving what they hear in conversation.
Thanks to the camera and a system that recognizes shapes and faces, this "receptionist" can find out how many people are in the room, who they are - even remember what they are wearing - and listen and understand the keywords of their conversations.
It can also sort the present by conversation groups.
In the demonstration video, the receptionist records a third person and understands that she does not belong to the group that speaks to her and that she is not an employee of the company.
He asks her if he's seeing anyone, and he's telling her he'll be with her in a moment.
All without a blue screen of death.
Breathtaking.
But that, of course, is the music of the future.
Now the company has more important things to do, such as a new version of the Windows operating system.
There's been a lot of talk this week about changing Microsoft's strategy.
Windows 7 will be lighter and won't have as many associated programs.
Steve Ballmer figured out that if computers had only the most to do, without the burden of commercial futility, they'd be five times more powerful - man, Steve, they'd be cheaper.
Discover like thunder when we consider that Microsoft version by version adds new features to Windows and other "extra".
A change of direction would be a worthy act.
Microsoft is right, the operating system is slowly losing its meaning, and so is the software.
When Google Chrome appeared on the network, I became one of those who are in the tinge of the theory that this was Google's first step towards competing with Windows.
Many have rightly pointed out that the browser is not an operating system.
The operating system will always be necessary because it is a necessary layer to communicate between hardware and software.
It has the same function as your wife or your husband when you have to say something to your mother-in-law.
That's right.
It never disappears, but it is necessary to think of the "death" of the operating system not as an absolute truth, but as a relative truth.
What Ballmer said this week confirms that idea.
People pay less and less attention to the operating system and vice versa to the Internet browser.
Your computer turns on to start Firefox or Explorer - or Chrome - and we spend more time on the Internet every day than around windows.
What are half of the applications that accompany the system for?
Less is more.
And Windows 7 must be less, much less than Vista.
Less heavy, less loaded, less complex.
Microsoft is now interested in offering its services online and finally becoming an alternative to Google.
They desperately need it, and here's a small example.
I took this photo at a Microsoft employee restroom in Redmond earlier this month.
There was a poster on the vending machine being them to use their search tools: "Your search. Our future."
In 2006, an independent study showed that 66% of Microsoft employees used Google to search the Internet.
Last week, by the way, the delay of the new version of Windows Mobile 7 was confirmed.
It will not come at the beginning of 2009, but at the end, so let us expect only 2010.
At Microsoft, they will certainly try to launch Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 together.
The phone is becoming more and more a computer.
Since Android and iPhone are already on the market, they will have to pay dearly for the delay.
Le Fabuleux Marcel
Pablo Picasso wore it on the Côte d'Azur, Leonardo di Caprio shone in Edward Zwick's "Blood Diamond", as did Al Pacino in Francis Ford Coppola's "The Godfather," and he's part of the uniform of the muscular gay community.
And if we want to enumerge his life roles, we can delve into the image of a typical muscle man with a pointed mustache lifting weights in a nomadic circus.
Basically, it is nothing more than a typical cotton men's bottom tank top, tight and sleeveless.
English speakers call it a 'tank', but le Fabuleux Marcel from Brussels stands out above all others.
Firstly, because of its burly name - although popularly called 'Marcel' - which has a connection to sport, because, as legend has it, it was named after the boxer Marcel Cerdan, the lover of singer Edith Piaf.
'Marcel' stands out above other quality cotton, unisex cut, distinguishing label and (almost unknishable) Belgian wool, which models of the most emblematic tops have as a detail at the neck.
And beware, because the Belgian company does not specialize only in tank tops.
He also makes college sweatshirts, retro boxer shorts, cashmere sweaters, cotton pants, navy T-shirts, baby clothes, mini shorts...
Thoughtful pieces for comfortable underwear.
Although it's a shame they're just underwear.
They're too beautiful.
Honda attacks for the second time with its bestseller
In November, Honda will launch the sale of the second generation Jazz model.
If the predecessor of this single-space vehicle already had considerable space, it now offers an even more spacious interior.
This is complemented by improved engines that increase driving comfort and allow for greater fuel economy.
Evolution rather than revolution.
That's the second generation of Honda Jazz.
Although aesthetically the lines of the new Jazz are very similar to the previous model, there have been many changes in this single-space car.
It is worth mentioning, for example, innovative design, a new platform, larger dimensions and new engines.
Even before we explore the new model, it should be noted that the new Jazz is coming to market six years after the launch of the first generation.
Therefore, the first thing we will notice is that Honda needed a shorter period than other manufacturers to recilys this model.
Although Jazz is a lesser-known model in Europe, it has become a phenomenon in other markets.
This is the case in Japan, the country where Jazz was the best-selling car in 2002, and also during this year 2008.
It is in Japan that almost a million units have been sold since the launch of Honda Jazz.
The second market was the old continent with approximately half a million units sold in six years.
Honda, however, aims for the new Jazz to increase sales in its category.
Thus, while in 2007 this Japanese company sold a total of 83 000 Honda Jazz units, in 2009 estimates are for 100 000 cars, which would mean an increase of 17 % on the European market.
As regards the Spanish market, Honda has sold a total of 8 000 Jazz models since 2002, which means 6,7 % of Honda's total sales in Spain.
As for the next generation of Jazz, the management of the Spanish branch expects to sell 2,000 units for the whole year.
It is the arrival of the new Jazz that will allow Honda to significantly mitigate the decline in sales in Spain.
In fact, the carmaker's management expects the end of the year with a total of 22,000 units sold, which means 4,000 fewer than in 2007 and a decrease of 16%.
Despite this increase in sales, Honda increased its share of the Spanish market to 1.8%, up from 1.6% last year.
In 2010, the Japanese firm expects to reach 2%.
To achieve this share, Honda is counting on the success of its next new model.
It is Honda Insight, a 4.37-meter-long five-second hybrid of compact size, from which the Japanese company promises worldwide sales of about 200,000 units per year.
As for the markets, the Japanese manufacturer estimates that 50% of Insight will be sold in the United States, while the remaining percentages will be split between the old continent and Japan.
The sale of Honda Insight is expected to begin in the first months of next year when it is presented to the public in Valencia in January.
Compared to the first generation, all dimensions of the new Jazz have increased.
Its length increased up to 3.9 meters (five centimeters more), width to 1.69 meters (two centimeters more), and wheelbase to 2.5 meters, which means an extension of five centimeters.
On the contrary, the height has not changed and is still 1.52 meters.
By increasing the dimensions, the interior space was also enlarged.
This advantage was achieved both by using the new platform and by storing the fuel tank in the middle of the car, which was already used in the previous Honda Jazz.
Also, the volume of the luggage compartment - which has a double bottom system - increased to 399 liters, 19 liters more than the volume of the luggage compartment for the first generation.
It should be noted that these dimensions occur in the version with engine 1.4, since the volume of luggage compartment for Honda Jazz 1.2 is 379 liters.
In addition to external features such as rear LED lights or the possibility of equipped with a glass panoramic roof, another improvement is easier access to the rear seats.
The door leading to the second row of seats allows an opening angle of 80 degrees compared to 67 for the first Jazz model.
The second generation Honda Jazz also has new engines.
Initially, this small model will be offered with two 1.2 and 1.4 liter gasoline engines.
Both engines use i-VTEC technology, which allows for lower consumption, lower carbon dioxide emissions and delivers excellent improvements to the propulsion system at the same time as high torque in full engine speed.
The first 1.2-litre engine has a power of 90 hp at 6,000 rpm with a maximum torque of 114 Nm at 4,900 rpm.
This engine - which had 78 horsepower on the previous generation Jazz car - has a consumption of 5.3 liters and an emissions of 125 grams of CO2.
Compared to the previous engine, which reached 83 hp for the previous generation, the current one will reach 100.
The 1.4-horsepower Honda Jazz 1.4 has a combined consumption of 5.4 liters and an emissions of 128 grams of CO2.
"I want to be a young mother. I'm not worried about who's going to be the father."
Her great resemblance to her sister did not prevent her from developing her own personality.
Mónica Cruz, though small in stature, is a woman full of life.
The Cruz sisters are now taking their new fashion career very seriously.
For Mónica, it means a lot more than just some pretty, famous girls lending their name.
In Paris, she participated in a promotional event organized by Mango at its new headquarters, as well as the announcement of the most important fashion awards sponsored by the Spanish company.
She's warm and shy, and she'll win you over up close.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I came to present a new collection that Sister Penélope and I designed for Mango for this fall-winter season, and at the same time I attended the announcement of the second edition of the "Mango Fashion Awards" and dinner at the Opera house in honor of Valentino.
So it was a difficult but exciting day.
What is the new collection based on for Mango, for which you have been working for a fourth season?
My sister and I both love movies from the 1950s and 1960s and we drew a lot of stimuli from them.
I also love to walk around the city and watch women walk around dressed, combine and top their clothes, I do that very often.
You're a dancer, an actress, a designer, a very versatile woman, right?
I think so, but after all, everything is connected and has many connections.
For example, I liked clothes from a very old age, I still wanted to go to my grandmother's, go through my aunt's closets and look at her clothes.
That was sensational, almost better than going on a pilgrimage.
When I became a dancer, I always tried to pay attention to how I dressed.
You know, we dancers pride our time on being groomed to feel good about our classes and rehearsals when looking in the mirror.
And as an actress, when they give you a costume, that's when you really get into the character.
So everything is connected, but with great respect for designers and professionalism.
You were 30 the other day, did you get caught up in a crisis?
whereabouts.
I feel better than ever, I enjoy my 30s.
I find that a woman is done, has experience and enjoys life with fewer mistakes.
The biological clock doesn't scare me.
I've been doing what I want to do since I was a kid, and that gives me a lot of inner happiness.
So you're thinking about being a mother, right?
Of course I know I'm going to be a mother because my body wants me to, and besides, I want to be a young mom, I don't want to miss it.
As far as my father's concerned, I'm not worried about that.
But one thing I know for sure, I'm going to make my child feel lucky, and I'm going to raise him with great love.
As far as the movie is about to go, you're going to have a few premieres of the movies you made last year.
That's right, and I'm looking forward to them coming to the movies.
I come from the theatre world, so I am very impatient and restless, I want everything right now and of course I can't.
I look forward to the premiere of "La última hora" and "En busca de la tumba de Cristo".
Let's see how you like them...
You had your premiere on the catwalk a few days ago alongside Naomi Campbell, right?
Well, don't say that.
It's not like I'm going to stand on the catwalk as a model.
I just got a call from Naomi Campbell, who I've known for a long time, and invited me to London to attend a fundraiser for her organization, Women for a Better Life, and the clothes we showed off - I also picked out two models from our Mango collection - were auctioned off and the proceeds were handed over to naomi's NGO.
People don't know Naomi has such a good heart.
There's a lot of rumors about her, and I, knowing her, can tell you that many of them aren't true.
Besides, I'm going to stick to the good he's involved in.
She asked me to perform for charity, but if she asks me to do a handstand, I'll do it, too.
I'll do whatever it takes for third-world women.
"Car bee" prevents collisions
Nissan was inspired to make progress in developing accident-fighting technologies in nature this time, specifically in bees.
This Japanese company has created a robot that takes as a model the flying of bees, thus preventing collisions.
This is the Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C, which represents the first step in precipitation prevention technologies.
Engineers at the Nissan Motor Co. Center for Technical Progress. the robot was developed in collaboration with the Center for Advancement in Scientific and Technological Research at the prestigious University of Tokyo in Japan.
According to Kazuhiro Doi, Public Relations' Director General for Technology, Research and Brand Development, the BR23C is presented as an extension of Nissan's four safety shield zones.
The robot is designed to strengthen the ability to prevent collisions in cars of this brand.
During the flight, each bee creates its own personal space of an oval shape, which is very similar to the safety shield of a Nissan.
However, the most important are folded bee eyes, which are able to see in all directions at an angle of more than 300 degrees, allowing the bee to fly in its personal space without stopping.
Engineers designed what they called a Laser Range Finder when creating this visual feature.
It records obstacles up to two metres within a radius of 180 degrees in front of the BR23C, calculates the distance of the object and sends a signal to the on-board microprocessor, which immediately converts it into a collision warning.
"At the moment when an obstacle is recorded, the robot imitates the bee's movements and immediately changes direction by turning the wheels to a right or even greater angle to prevent collision.
The biggest difference from any existing system is that all evasive maneuvers are completely instinctive.
If this were not the case, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, Director of the Mobile Laboratory and Chief Engineer of the project.
Unlike bees, the robot cannot move up and down even diagonally, its movement is limited to only two dimensions and to the direction in which it is made possible by rotating its wheels, but not in an infinite number of directions and possibilities, as in the case of bees.
In addition to acceleration and deceleration, Nissan also used the rotation function to prevent the robots from colliding.
"The device only needs to process the information every few seconds and act on this data.
It does not require information retention or logical intuition from previous maneuvers, allowing it to function without interruption with only two dozen KB of memory.
This may come as a surprise to you, but we're not talking about a gig or a mega in memory."
This is the first step in the development of new instant collision prevention technologies, a technology that Nissan predicts will be used in serial cars in a decade.
The robot uses lithium polymer batteries that are lighter and last longer than lithium-ion batteries.
Another possible future use of this technology could be to incorporate the unit into the GPS satellite navigation system, which would lead the driver to his destination while avoiding obstacles on the way.
Drivers repeatedly caught with alcohol in their blood will have to install an "alcolock"
The Home Office requires a driver with three administrative penalties for drink-driving to install a system in his car to prevent him from starting his car while drunk or not breathing.
The proposal became known in June of this year and is now included in the annual report of the Supreme Public Prosecutor's Office, according to which it is a pilot project that will last one year.
Its aim is to put the driver back behind the wheel, so drivers will also have to take a course in traffic re-ediched.
In addition to the National Transport Safety Authority, this experience will also be part of the Directorate-General for Transport (DGT) and the Foundation of the Institute of Technology for Car Safety (FITSA).
According to statistics, between 30% and 75% of motorists charged with more than once for drunk driving get behind the wheel again in this state.
Alcolock should prevent this as it is a vehicle-connected system that measures the level of alcohol in the excreted air and prevents the car from starting if the driver does not breathe before or if a higher than permitted alcohol concentration is recorded.
It will cost more than €1,000 and would have to be paid by the culprit himself.
A study carried out to this effect in the USA in 2007 showed that for vehicles equipped with this device, offences decreased by 65 % in the first year following the introduction.
In Spain, 115 people are expected to save their lives each year.
The measure is limited to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to address this behaviour before it result in a criminal offence.
And in order to help implement it, since the legislation can be implemented in the usual way, however, the necessary regulation of the criminal provisions requires a change in the law.
The device is not yet available on the Spanish market in any sales version, although some industrial cars and public service vehicles have already been experienced.
Just tomorrow, the Congress of Members will vote on the PSOE (Spanish Workers' Socialist Party) proposal, which recommends installing this system on school buses, as is the case in France.
In Mexico and without peeptoes
With British precision, at 5:40 p.m., as stated in the program, a Spanish Air Force plane landed in the presidential hangar at Benito Juárez Airport in México D.F., where the Prince and Princess of Asturias arrived.
The sun was just setting, but its rays still forced his eyes to be closed with his hand so that the successor couple could be seen getting off the plane.
The Spanish ambassador and other officials stood under the meeting.
A few hours ago, I asked a taxi driver on the street if he knew the Spanish prince and princess were coming for a state visit.
- yes, that's great, you can't get to the airport at that time to pick up people... She's from here or something.
No, no, sir, she's Spanish, but she lived here for a few years.
yes, well, yes.
But the Mexican press knows well who the Prince and Princess of Asturias are and how important their visit is.
Many people wait in the hangar at the airport, just outside the red carpet and the military cordon, which consists of 27 naval soldiers ready to fire an honorable salvo.
The prince appears with a smile on his lips in a dark blue suit, and the princess, very casually dressed and with her hair open, does not have her usual peeptoes, apparently she has been reported to be in danger of a storm in D.F.
Before they go to the hall where the official delegation is waiting, they smile at the photographers and pose for them in a nod.
A chatty Mexican TV reporter is waiting for them at the door of the hotel where they will be staying, one of the four largest in the city.
Enjoy the fear before you take out a mortgage
It must be acknowledged that the US Treasury, in addition to having enough capital to give away injections, does not lack ingenuity.
Faced with a crisis, and to prevent Americans from taking out risky mortgages with banks with dubious solvency, it has created a popular-educational game, "Bad Credit Hotel," online.
Or "Bad Loan Hotel"... or a confused hotel.
The hotel, and especially its receptionist, look bleak to think once, twice or three times whether it's the right time to apply for a loan.
And above all, where to ask, which is probably her intention.
The fact is that the game contains useful information, although not very detailed.
It is a site suitable for young people rather than a space for the whole public.
And what happens when the game ends?
Inside the hotel, a dream room appears.
At least something, because you'd better not talk about buying a house...
Best subsidized fashion award
There's probably no better place in the world to announce a fashion prize than Paris, and it's probably not a better designer and bon-wink than Valentino.
Mango has just announced the second edition of the El Botón-Mango Fashion Awards to enable an international presentation to new fashion talents.
The price is subsidized by 300,000 euros.
Belgian Sandrina Fasoli, a first-year winner, looked at her designs in the Mango outing on Paris's Haussmann Boulevard 54 yesterday, almost weeping with emotion.
To be sure, it is the second largest store of this company in Europe and has just opened on an area of 1,335 square meters.
The largest is located in London.
Many events, together with the desire to thank the designer Valentino for taking over the chairmanship of the competition jury, caused us to end up having a sumptuous dinner at the Opera Garnier in Paris.
Mango's festively decorated president's desk looked even more amazing alongside chagall's most exudable works.
Nati, heartbroken by her brother's recent death, donned this brand's dress and ELAH jewelry, over which breath was held, and hung in her son Luis - a nearly 6-foot-10 elegiast - accompanied Valentino at the head of the table at a dinner in his honor.
Andik, the boss and owner of Mango, took the welcome and, as a true gentleman, was left without a jacket, along with Baron Rothschild, as they were both offered to two ladies.
Mónica Cruz, who arrived at the store in - handmade - trousers and a shirt and changed into a long black sexy dress for dinner, was moved by a night walk around the Opera house accompanied by Goya Toledo, showed us the ballroom, and, recalling other times, grabbed one of the poles and implied "grand plié."
Inés Sastre did not stay for a tour of the palace buildings next door, but she showed us pictures of her son on her mobile phone before leaving.
The next morning we were able to enjoy the presence of Olivier Martínez - another young man riding a motorbike - and John Travolta, who arrived at the Intercontinental Hotel in Paris with his own sheets and towels and asked in advance that no fragrances be used in his rooms.
Stars under the starry Parisian sky.
Oh là là, c'est la vie.
1001 - anti-stress number
Not 1000, but 1000 plus one way to forget about chaotic and frantic everyday life.
To make matters worse, they are all summarized in one book, which will bring relaxation to the bookstore on September 30.
The alarm rings every morning at 7:00 as punishment, but it's even worse to imagine yourself engulfed in the rushed rhythm that contemporary life brings.
The office is called voltage and computer back pain.
Stress is a 21st century disease.
But there are neither, nor two, methods to combat daily exhaustion and the problems of detaching yourself from the world of work.
No, the number is no larger and no less than 1001.
Susannah Marriott, outside of yogi positions, classic massages and "spa" therapy, collected a whole "menu" of options on the pages of her book, adapted to each individual's tastes and time possibilities.
The anti-stress book is called "1001 Way of Relaxation" and thanks to Pearson Alhambra and DK publishing house it will bring peace to the bookstore.
If someone is of the opinion that it is not possible to achieve peace in areas such as work or personal relationships, the "manual" denies this view.
In addition, it offers other ways to be in contact with nature or 100% natural recipes that contribute to relaxation.
If adrenaline is no longer in your veins, which restores balance in your body, and stress has become a problem, it is time to sit on the couch, turn off and concentrate on reading.
Talking in your sleep
Some kids talk at night.
I don't mean the ones who wake up and tell us something that happened the day before, but children who talk while they sleep.
When it happens the first time, it may get you started, but it's actually meaningless.
It is a harmless sleep disorder called somnilokvie.
It's quite frequent, especially in children and adolescents.
I'm sure many of you were told he was talking in his sleep last night.
This phenomenon can occur very sporadically (for example, once in a lifetime with high fevers), or with greater regularity (every day, once a week, once every few months...), the next day the child does not remember anything.
There's not just one reason to explain her arrival.
It is often associated with other sleep disorders such as nightmares, night rages, enuresis nocturna (night wetting) or sleepwalking, but this may not be the case.
As mentioned earlier, it can often be accompanied by very high fevers, stressful or inflamed situations.
In any case, this is a little-researched phenomenon.
The intensity with which it appears is also varied.
The child can speak in a calm voice, say individual words, whisper, or vice versa (screams, cries, long speeches...).
In cases where it manifests itself with great force, it would be advisable to observe the child and consult a specialist to see if he has any problem that causes him great anxiety and in this way manifests himself.
We said that this is a harmless disorder, therefore it is not treated only if it is associated with another sleep disorder that can be treated (for example, if it is associated with apnea syndrome or permanent stress).
However, what we can do is keep in mind a few very simple preventive measures, such as:
Trying not to upset the baby too much before he goes to sleep.
So look for quiet games and avoid scary or somewhat violent TV programs or series.
In very nervous children and those who are given the opportunity to relax, it is possible to use relaxation techniques that will help them gain some inner peace.
This will allow the child to sleep more peacefully.
When somnilokvie appears, try to remain calm.
Remind yourself that it is harmless to the child and that from what happened, the next day she will not remember anything.
Useful advice
Don't wake him up.
It's useless because he's not conscious and you're going to interrupt his sleep.
Even when he speaks, he sleeps, and thus rests.
Remember that if you think that they are very distressed several times in a row, it would be advisable to turn to advice or find out what causes such anxiety in a child.
If you understand what he's saying (which isn't so common), avoid the temptation to interrogate him and pull information out of him.
It won't do any good, because when he's asleep, he's not conscious to organize his thoughts.
Plus, you'll hear what he's saying, but you don't know what he's dreaming about, so be very careful how you interpret the information and what conclusions you're drawn.
Never tell a child you can ask him about his secret at night.
Not even for fun.
That's causing a lot of anxiety.
Just don't worry, it's nothing bad, it's just an episode that only lasts a few minutes.
Illhaeusern... finally
Illhaeusern finally found his way to victory again after a long, lean period.
Without playing a particularly big game, the Yellow And Blacks created more chances and managed to turn one of them into a winner.
The game did not have a very fast pace during this encounter, in which the attackers struggled to assert themselves.
After the captain's first try, Kauffmann, who narrowly missed the line with a long-range shot, was starting to have The Illhaeusern lightly on top, first Fonderflick from distance, then Hirne through the air, Romain on a long leg or Diebold gradually coming to irritate dannemaria's defence.
The opponent, on the other hand, built a defensive wall halfway down the field, leaving only the agile Riahi at the tip of the attack.
The start of the second half proved decisive, first thanks to two chances from Dannemaria with the names Riahi and Temporale, then after opening the scoring for Illhaeusern, which was taken care of by Marais, well situated for processing the ball bounced after Diebold's previous attempt (53').
The Illhaeusernu goalkeeper, however, did not enjoy the joy for a long time, after about 12 minutes he was forced to return to the dressing room, leaving his teammates weakened.
Dannemarie, however, could not make the most of it, and the 11-year-old from Illhaeusern, who withdrew only a little to "thicken" the defence, did not cause any more trouble, except in the very last seconds of the match, when the ball flew very close to the crossbar after much confusion.
Sarkozy goes to angry fishermen
Before flying to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy takes a detour through Brittany.
To counter the show of force of fishermen who severely disrupted the accessibility of several Ports of Breton and Normandy on Monday, the French President decided to go to the port of Guilvinec in Finistère on Tuesday morning to meet with their representatives.
The latter promised to be adopted "in a constructive spirit", and hope to "come up with concrete proposals."
The presidential visit comes at the same time as the General Assembly of the "crisis committee" set up by Breton fishermen to take action against the sharp rise in diesel prices, which peaked at more than 1.14 euros per litre on average.
According to Elysée Palace spokesman David Martinon, the president "will talk to them about solutions that can be imagined in order to help their companies regain competitiveness and better secure the conditions of employment and disbursement of sailors."
Nicolas Sarkozy is expected to be a fisherman with intransigence.
On Tuesday morning, they performed operation "snail" (operation of slow-moving vehicles) in the morbihan and calvados departments, causing a nearly 10km traffic jam.
The holiday port of Quiberon was also blocked, but services to Belle-île were not disrupted.
A filter dam has been put into operation on the Quiberon Peninsula.
The sailors demonstrated their determination on Monday, burning tires and pallets in front of the fuel depots of the ports of Brest and Lorient just before dawn, while demonstrations took place in Concarneau and Saint-Brieuc.
The movement spread to other ports on the Atlantic coast and the English Channel, such as the Sables d'Olonne in the Vendée, where the trawlers remained in port, or Le Havru, where about 20 vessels blocked the operation of merchant ships.
Fishermen from Turballe and Croisic in the Loire-Atlantique area halted the blockade of the important Total refinery in Donges during the evening.
Those from Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait until Wednesday's meeting at the ministry before deciding to act.
In Guilvinec, the "crisis committee" is due to decide on Tuesday how to proceed with the journey and on its participation in an upcoming meeting at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
However, some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by the heads of the state fisheries department, who did not support their movement.
"The strike will continue" because "fishermen will not abandon anything" and "do not want to come to Paris," said Liliane Cariou, president of Lorient's fisheries department, for example.
Professional fishermen who do not pay diesel tax currently pay around 50 cents a litre, but they believe that the ship's profitability threshold is only reached when diesel is below €0.30 per litre.
Paul Newman magnificent
The unforgettable representative of "Butch Cassidy and the Kid" died of cancer at the age of 83 at his home in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford, and sam mendes bowed to the film's legend and politically engaged actor Paul Newman, who has died at the age of 83.
Embraer maintains its supply assumptions for 2008
The Brazilian aircraft manufacturer is counting on the supply of 215 aircraft this year, despite the threat of recession hovering over the world economy.
The world's fourth aerospace designer, Embraer, maintains its supply projections for 2008 with 215 deliveries, confirmed its president Fredrico Fleury Curado.
In the first half of the year, the manufacturer delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian designer expects a lot from the Chinese market, especially taking into account the range of his aircraft from 30 to 120 seats.
To date, Embraer has delivered 41 devices to Chinese clients in the space of eight years.
AIG is said to be considering transferring 15% of its assets
The insurer American International Group, which has been put over water by U.S. money authorities, is considering ceding more than 15% of its assets to repay the $85 billion it was given as a down payment, the Sunday edition of the Financial Times reports.
AIG is ready to explore the sale of most of its activities outside of life insurance policies internationally and pension activities in the United States, the journal states, citing sources close to the ongoing negotiations.
According to France Télécom, AIG's board met on Sunday evening to examine possible referrals.
No confirmation statement could be obtained from AIG.
The assets AIG intends to dispose of include its aviation leasing arm, International Lease Financial Corp., its 59% stake in insurance company Transatlantic Holdings, as well as its real estate portfolio and private equity investments, ft adds.
No final decision on these assignments has yet been taken, france télécom continues.
AIG must quickly raise cash to repay the $85 billion loan granted to it by the Federal Reserve Bank, at the risk of being seize 80% of its capital by us authorities, thereby diluting current shareholders to the appropriate ratio.
Paris. Analysis of the historic Morning Meeting
The New York Stock Exchange fell historicly on Monday after the House of Representatives rejected Paulson's bank bailout plan: the Dow Jones lost 6.98%, an unprecedented loss near 800 points, and the Nasdaq lost 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) fell 777.68 points to 10,365.45.
On September 17, 2001, the biggest drop in points in its history (by 684.81 points), on the day of the resumption of trading following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001.
The tech-dominated Nasdaq composite index lost 199.61 points, or 1,983.73, to 1,983.73, according to closing data, and the Standard & Poor's 500 index fell 8.81% (or 106.85 points) to 1,106.55 points.
Dejected from the start of the session, Wall Street literally plummeted after the House of Representatives unexpectedly rejected a plan to rescue banks, a plan to allow markets to regain some stability.
With 228 votes against and 205 for the Representatives, they refused to provide Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson with the funds he requested.
Nearly two out of three Republicans rejected his plan.
"It's a bad signal sent to the market that sees Congress unable to adopt a plan," says Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
"It shows how much the market has relied on this plan," she added, expressing concern that the project adopted in a few days would not come "too late."
"If this project is truly doomed (...), the baton will be handed over immediately to the Fed (U.S. Central Bank) and other central banks to avert a crisis that would further strengthen credit conditions," said Brian Bethune, senior economist at Global Insight.
And, emphasizing the urgency of the situation, Piegza noted that in the United States, "every new day brings the downfall of one financial institution."
After friday's collapse, Washington Mutual organized the purchase of Wachovia Bank's banking activities by its rival Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis has suddenly taken a turn and necessitated urgent interventions in favour of banks in the UK, the Benelux, Iceland and Germany, suggesting that markets are facing "not just an American crisis, but a global crisis," added an analyst at FTN Financial.
The bond market has risen strongly.
The 10-year treasury yield fell to 3.632% from 3.827% on Friday night, from 4.161% the previous day.
Morgan Stanley opens up its capital to MUFG
Morgan Stanley bank announced that Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), Japan's largest bank, is entering its midst, is issuing $9 billion to raise 21% of its capital. The adoption of this report was accompanied by a significant fall in its exchange rate.
A week after unveiling their tentative deal, the two banks explained that MUFG intends to buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley's ordinary shares at a single price of $25.25, representing a total of $3 billion.
The agreed price is 19% lower than the book value of the securities as at 31 August.
MUFG is investing an additional $6 billion to acquire convertible securities that will give it a 10% return and have an exchange price of $31.25.
Morgan Stanley clarified that the entire operation will take place on the basis of an average uniform price of $29, or 28% below its current rate.
Still, Morgan Stanley shares were losing 6.79% to reach $23.07 around 5 p.m. Greenwich Mean Time.
"This strategic merger represents an important opportunity on the way to accelerating Morgan Stanley's transition to bank holding status," said John Mack, ceo of the U.S. group.
The new status was adopted by Morgan Stanley last week, which is intended to allow it to variously differentiate its activities, but it also places it under the supervision of the Federal Reserve Bank.
Its merger with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis is forcing Wall Street's biggest aces to take a much more cautious approach than before.
Among other things, the terms presented on Monday show that the deal has been altered over the past few days: last Monday, Morgan only announced that it would sell up to 20% of its shares to the Japanese for about $8.5 billion.
"Until a week ago, we thought," toshihide Mizuno, MUFG's chief executive, explained in Tokyo, "that our participation would consist entirely of ordinary shares.
However, given the current situation of the economy and the market, we wanted to keep risks to a minimum and also to cover up."
Based on the weighted average price, MUFG will pay 7% less than its book value for Morgan Stanley securities.
And the operation will result in a 20% reduction in earnings per share.
The agreement foresees that MUFG will be able to convert half of its preferential securities into ordinary shares in a year if the latter exchange for a period of time at a price 50% above the exchange price, i.e. about $47.
Morgan Stanley assures that the capital it will bring to MUFG will enable it to seize investment opportunities, strengthen its balance sheet and increase its cash.
However, a spokeswoman for the group declined to provide specific information on the strategic projects of the two new allies.
After the MUFG investment, Morgan Stanley should boast a Tier One payment eligibility ratio of around 15%, one of the best in the industry.
Morgan stated that it had "significantly" reduced its balance sheet since the end of August.
Recent weeks have been challenging for the group, as its exchange rate has halved, while the cost of insurance against the risk of debt-related non-payment has skyrocketed.
These costs took the opposite trend on Monday, but remained high, around 12%.
Last week, Goldman Sachs, the only other "survivor" of Wall Street's big investment banks after the collapse of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the purchase of Merrill Lynch, announced that it had raised $15 billion, partly from Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett's group.
Rafael Correa in Quito on Monday.
Re-establish the republic around the socialism of the XXI century.
This is a joint project between Hugo Chávez of Venezuela, Eva Morales of Bolivia and Rafael Correa of Ecuador.
Last Sunday, the third appointee put a proposal for a new Constitution to the vote, along the way of his counterparts and friends.
And his mission is accomplished because 64% of voters, according to official results covering 80% of the vote, voted 'yes' in the referendum.
According to these results, 28% received "no", 7% of the votes were invalid and 0.7% of the ballots were empty.
In order for the draft Constitution to be adopted, it had to get half the votes plus one.
Two exit polls and a NGO count predicted a clear "yes" victory on Sunday, ranging from 63% to 70%.
Indeed, Rafael Correa called for his draft Constitution to be won on the night of Sunday to Monday.
"The constitution has won on its entirety," he assured and congratulated ecuadorians at the guayaquil governorate, 280 kilometers southwest of Quito.
It goes without saying that Rafael Correa received congratulations from Chávez and Morales, but also from his Chilean counterpart, Michelle Bachelet.
The vote, which according to the Organization of America (OEA) observation mission took place peacefully, concerned a text of 444 points building a "new socialism" promoted by the president.
The draft Constitution desectes the state's power over economics by relinquiring to it the "development planning" of a country living primarily from the extraction of oil by foreign companies and from foreign exchange sent by its emigrants.
The correa-sponsored proposal, which was elected in 2006, also extends the powers of the head of state, who will be able to serve two consecutive four-year mandates and will be able to dissolve the House.
Correa has already announced that he will use this power to run for a new mandate in February 2009.
Among other things, the Constitution consolidating the principle of free health and education, which the president began to implement in a country of 13.9 million people, where 50% of the population lives below the poverty line.
Finally, it also envisages a ban on the presence of foreign troops, ending the agreement between Washington and Quite on the use of the Ecuadorian base as a starting point for US drug operations.
Obama wins on points in first televised duel
Friday's first debate between the two candidates at the White House was followed by a second debate to find out which of the pair, John McCain and Barack Obama, had won.
The republican and Democratic campaign headquarters were not surprised when they both declared their victory in a televised duel watched by a third of American families.
Political analyst David Gergen believes that John McCain's performance, while decent, was not "brilliant" enough to allow him to stop a drop in the polls five weeks before the presidential election.
The Gallup Poll, whose poll released Saturday gave Obama a five-point lead (49% vs. 44% for McCain), recents that the Democrat is the one who won the duel.
Among undecided voters who matter right now, Obama is the winner for 39% of respondents, while, according to a CBS poll, 25% attribute the victory to McCain.
Obama should be able to confirm his leadership Thursday with a projected good performance from his running mate, Joseph Biden, during the first and only public debate with his rival, Sarah Palin.
"It would be a mistake to underestimate her.
She's gifted," Bill Clinton said over the weekend.
McCain, 70, has consistently highlighted his undeniable experience in foreign policy, while stressing his opponent's "naivety" on issues that formed the core of the first confrontation.
"Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand that..." was a repeated accusation.
"I don't think Senator Obama has the experience and knowledge to be president," he said.
Republican TELEVISION spots have been in such an offensive spirit since yesterday.
Obama, on the other hand, emphasized that he represents the future.
He did not lose his head and turned out to be concise and precise.
He highlighted his ability to make the right decisions and restore america's reputation in the world.
"McCain still doesn't understand, while Obama does," the Democratic spot said over the weekend, which blames republicans for not taking sufficient account of the impact of the crisis on "ordinary Americans."
"During the 90-minute debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you," Obama said yesterday in front of 20,000 people gathered at a campaign rally in North Carolina in heavy rain.
He didn't even say words like "middle class" or "working class." Financial disintegration clearly favors Obama, whom Americans see as more capable of saving an economy on the edge of a precipice.
"There could be a decisive reversal next week," the influential Democratic Senator Charles Schumer estimated yesterday.
Democratic Representative Rahm Emanuel, a former member of the Clinton administration, compared Obama's "economic foresight" to that of Bill Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
For the Democratic nominee, the current disaster is "the final verdict of eight years of bad economic policy, as george bush ran and supported by Senator McCain."
The Senator from Illinois reaffirmed that, despite Wall Street's unexpected jumps, he should be able to cut taxes on 95% of Americans, and also pointed out that implementing the country's eventual energy independence by promoting renewable energy sources is his number one priority, along with the introduction of a health insurance system.
McCain, for his own work, plans to build a park with 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
Both candidates cautiously dodged questions about the $700 billion (€470 billion) financial aid plan adopted by Congress last night, which is deeply unpopular.
"What about you, did you notice that there were any elections in Minsk?"
Young people and opponents of the regime demonstrated on Sunday evening in the main square of the Belarusian capital to reject the results of the parliamentary elections in advance.
Several hundred Belarusians gathered on Sunday evening immediately after polling stations in Minsk's main square were closed to protest against the irregularity of parliamentary elections.
Although no results have yet been announced, many young people have come to demonstrate against President Lukashenko's regime: "dictator, resignation."
Some admit they didn't even go to the polls: "What good would it do if they did whatever they wanted with my vote anyway," says one young man.
He does not believe that this regime, which has been friendly to foreign observers in order to resume negotiations with the European Union, would be ready to make a U-turn towards democracy.
Sanctions, which include a visa ban for 40 Belarusian leaders and the freezing of some assets, could be lifted if the elections are deemed clean by observers.
According to the opposition, this was not the case.
"We were kept away from the electoral commissions and our observers were not allowed to participate in the counting of votes," complained Yuri Potěmkin, spokesman for the Union of Democratic Forces, a diverse group of 12 parties.
"This is a cosmetic change," says Alexander Milinkievich, a former opposition candidate in the 2006 presidential election and leader of the pro-European movement, "because what matters is who counts the votes, and in our country it is the executive branch.
If any opposition MPs get into parliament, it will be by being appointed and not elected.
However, their entry into parliament may mean space on television, meetings in the regions and bills."
The opposition therefore feels obliged to participate in political functioning because "dialogue with the European Union needs to be started.
If our economy, deeply indebted to Russia, is hit by a crisis and we do not reform, we are in danger of becoming a protectorate of Russia.
But we want to be independent."
The opposition fears that the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which monitored the elections, will declare the elections valid.
It stresses that turnout seems too high and that the general introduction of early voting (26% of voters in Minsk) has opened the way for all sorts of manipulations.
"What about you, have you noticed that there have been any elections?" asks social democratic leader Alexander Kozulin, one of the last two political prisoners released in August this year.
"There wasn't a foot in the polling stations.
And there will be a maximum of five opposition MPs in parliament, those most suited to the regime."
The night silence once again took place in October square.
On television, President Lukashenko and members of the Central Electoral Commission congratulate on their success.
19 hostages freed in Chad
An Egyptian commando raided the kidnappers of 11 tourists and their eight-person entourage who were captured 10 days ago.
They're in Cairo.
Eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian guides, who had been held captive in the desert for 10 days, were taken alive and well to the Egyptian capital on Monday.
They were freed by An Egyptian commando in Chad during the morning.
The hostages arrived around 3:30 p.m., apparently in good shape, aboard a special aircraft to al-Maza military base, adjacent to Cairo International Airport.
They were immediately transported, without being able to comment in the press, aboard helicopters to a hospital in Maadi, a marginal residential area of Cairo, for medical examinations.
"They are in complete health" and "no ransom has been paid to the hijackers," Egyptian Tourism Minister Zohejr Garrana said on the airport's runway.
Since their capture on September 19, while on safari in a four-wheel-drive vehicle at the foot of Mount Uanat, on the border of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, a group of hostages have been dragged from one hideout to another by 35 unknown kidnappers.
The group includes 11 tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian - as well as eight Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, one border guard, the director of Aegyptous, a safari organiser.
A senior Egyptian security official suggested that 30 special forces members who approached the scene aboard two helicopters set off for the 100th night just before dawn.
"There was a gunfight, half the kidnappers were killed and the others fled," said the source, who wished to remain anonymous.
He suggested that a total of 150 members of the Egyptian Special Forces from the "lightning" unit had been sent to Sudan, where they received the support of German and Italian commandos.
Franco Frattini, the head of Italian diplomacy, mentioned the role played by secret agents and italian special forces forces from Belgrade, where he is currently located.
"We have to acknowledge that we have achieved this result through the professionalism and efficiency of our secret services, our special forces," he said, without elaboration.
He also denied that a ransom had been paid.
On the eve of the attack, the Sudanese army said it had intercepted a four-wheel-drive vehicle carrying kidnappers, killing six, including the Chadian commander, and arresting two.
The military claimed they were linked to a rebel group in Darfur, the Sudan Liberation Movement - Unity (SLA-U), which the movement immediately rejected.
Letters - The quiet majority of the culture department
The debate on cultural funding is filling the pages of newspapers with inch-long headlines and is the subject of an ongoing election campaign.
Better.
However, one area of our cultural life is still neglected.
Who will rise to foreshot the mead sums that are provided to small museums, archives, archaeological excavations, and national sites that starve to death?
What politician dares remind the federal government that he is neglecting his monuments and his historic buildings?
That in Quebec, as in Canada, we don't have laws that really protect our cultural heritage?
Did you know that the French Government will donate three and a half million euros to restore chinon castle in the Loiry Valley?
Our American neighbors have written in the Constitution that the protection of cultural heritage is part of American culture, and that this heritage should be protected by all citizens, all elected representatives, and all regional organizations, in cooperation.
In Quebec, a federation of quebec history societies, at least 40,000 volunteers, brought together in 211 societies for history, monuments, archives, and genealogy, seek to unrail history, preserve a pile of private archives, and protect archaeological remains for pennies.
Often, it is these companies that are the watchdogs of our monuments, driven by hopelessness protesting as promoters and leaders launch their bulldozers at old stones and forgotten cemeteries.
When are we finally going to see the grandstand for history and monuments?
Interview - Blood that's sure again
Héma-Québec celebrated its 10th anniversary yesterday, and its president, Dr. Francine Décary, was rightly happy, as Heema-Quebec became one of the most reliable and efficient blood suppliers in the world.
Above all, he regained the trust of the public, who were severely shaken after the contaminated blood scandal of the 1980s and 1990s.
As is widely known, the State Blood Reserve administered by the Canadian Red Cross Transfusion Department was contaminated with the Immune Deficiency Virus (HIV) and the Hepatitis C virus during the 1980s.
In the face of this drama and a wave of public resentment, in February 1994 the Canadian government launched a public inquiry, chaired by Judge Horace Krever, to explain the circumstances that led to such a tragedy and to formulate recommendations that such a disaster should not happen again.
While Judge Krever was delaying the report, some provinces set in place a committee to plan a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, Gélinea's committee played this role.
Following the Gélineau and Krever reports, two suppliers were set up in Canada: Hema-Quebec, which was to be managed by Quebec, and the Canadian Blood Society, to supply all provinces and territories.
"When Héma-Québec started its activities in 1998, barely 38% of people still had confidence in quebec's blood system," dr. Décary recalls.
"The situation was daunting.
By constantly trying to increase the safety of blood products and by working constantly in this area over the following years, we have regained public trust," he says, proudly adding that in early 2008, nearly 94% of Quebec's population trusted Héma-Quebec.
Dr. Décary, however, does not lose sight of the fact that "trust is something very fragile."
Since its establishment on 28 September 1998, Héma-Québec has applied the precautionary principle.
"At that time, we saw many cases in Europe of human form of mad cow disease, a new variant of the disease called Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease," says the woman who has led the company since its founding in 1998.
"And we had no idea whether this disease could spread through blood.
We therefore relied on one of the basic recommendations of the Krever and Gélineau reports, according to which, when we do not know and when the spread of a serious disease is at stake, in this case Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which is characterized by brain degeneration inevitably leading to death, exclusionary measures must be taken.
Therefore, in April 1999, we refused blood from people who had been in the UK for more than a month since 1980.
A few years ago, it was safely proven that this disease is transmitted through blood.
So this episode showed us that sticking to the precautionary principle made sense."
In 1999, a much more accurate technique for detecting HIV appeared on the market: tests using nucleic acid (NAT), which allow the presence of the virus itself to be detected directly in the donor blood, and not the presence of antibodies on which the tests used before were based.
NAT tests have made it possible to shorten the deaf period that occurs between the moment of infection of the patient and the moment when the first viruses can be detected in the blood by our techniques, explains the specialist.
We were able to shorten this period to less than a week.
This has significantly reduced the risk that some donors might be infected without their knowledge and without us figuring it out.
These improvements have made it possible to significantly reduce the risk of getting AIDS through blood transfusion.
One in 12 million people are now at risk of getting HIV-contaminated blood.
"In other words, it means that 12 million blood products will need to be distributed before someone gets HIV.
Since Héma-Québec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 blood products each year, it will take 24 years for the first case of HIV transmission through a blood product to occur.
I believe that today we can get or prescribe the blood transfusion necessary for recovery in complete peace," says the head of the Héma-Québek leadership.
"The challenge for the next decade is to keep our products safety.
We never know what disease-prolific element can appear in the system.
Just last year, the chikungunya virus appeared on Reunion Island, which, like the West Nile virus, is transmitted to the blood by stinging insects.
We need to be vigilant at all times," dr. Décary stresses that, in addition to safe supply, Héma-Québec must also count on sufficient supply.
"Needs are growing as the population ages.
As a result of more aggressive cancer treatment, patients often need a new dose of red blood cells or platelets.
The ageing population also has implications for the blood donor network, which on average consists of only 3% of Quebecers eligible for donation."
Any healthy person at least 18 years old, according to the criteria of admissibility, but can donate blood only once every 56 days, that is, six times a year.
On average, 14% of people offering blood are not admitted because they are carriers of AIDS or malaria, for example, and if they have visited a country where mud fever is raging, they are excluded for a year.
"With this 3%, we can maintain a condition that meets the needs of hospitals.
Shortcomings are very rare.
However, members of the donor network need to be supplemented in proportion to how they age and can no longer donate blood.
However, persuading people to give blood is difficult, especially to keep them and encourage them to become regular donors.
Life today is so unfettered that we rarely find an hour to donate blood," says Francine Décary.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Héma-Québec supplies not only blood products, but also human tissue, such as bone transplants, heart valves, eyeballs, and skin that is almost exclusively used for large burns.
These tissues are analysed, processed and frozen before being stored at Heema-Quebec, which also manages Quebec's only public umbilical cord blood bank.
The umbilical cord, previously considered biomedical waste, abounds in blood rich in stem cells that can be used to treat serious diseases such as leukemia.
"A few weeks ago, we celebrated the deposit of our 1,000th umbilical cord blood sample into the bank, and we expect to take over 1,000 a year.
We should start offering them for transplants early next year," says Dr. Décary, who describes the cord blood collection program as very popular.
"Some mothers are disappointed that they do not have access to it," because Héma-Québec does not have the resources to offer this comprehensive and expensive program to all hospitals in Quebec.
Football - Impact in semi-finals
Impact Montreal qualified for the semifinals of the USL Division I elimination series yesterday in saputo stadium for the second and decisive game of the quarterfinals, playing in the semifinals of the USL Division I elimination series, thanks to a 3-1 (4-3, 4-3, two-game goal record) win over the Seattle Sounders.
Midfielder Antonio Ribeiro scored the decisive goal in the 90th minute of the game.
Midfielders David Testo and Rocco Plancentino scored the remaining two goals for Montreal after a two-goal first half.
Roger Levesque was the only one who could handle Matt Jordan in favor of the Sounders.
Recall that on Friday, during the first of two quarterfinal games, the Impact suffered a 2-1 defeat at the Starfire Complex in Tukwil, a suburb of Seattle.
The Impact will face the Vancouver Whitecaps in the semifinals.
On Saturday night in Minnnesote, the Thunder evened a 3-1 deficit in a home game and eventually won 4-3, but the Whitecaps still advanced to the semifinals with a 5-4 record.
The Impact are expected to face the Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but details of the series will not be confirmed until today.
Briefly - Kovalev's winning goal
The Canadiens' first attacking trio is ready to start the season.
A unit made up of Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekance and Andrei Kosticin cheered the canadien's 3-2 win on separate raids at Centre Bell last night.
Kosticin, the biggest star of the encounter, scored a goal, Plekanec amassed two assists, and Kovalev caught one pass in his fourth three-pointer in six preseason games.
Kovalev secured the victory by scoring the only goal in separate raids.
"I'm not ready yet," said the Russian.
"I need one more game to feel good."
"He tried to do too much in the first period," Guy Carbonneau said.
"But I think he appreciated the end of the game.
He got a nice round of applause."
Charest bets north
Pm does not rule out calling early elections by the end of the year
Immediately after the Liberal Party (Parti libéral) congress, Jean Charest moved to Jean-Talon, Quebec, where new Health Minister Yves Bolduc (left) is standing in today's by-election.
"Push back the boundaries of our last great northern border": such is the long-term ambition that Jean Charest presented yesterday in a visually engaging manner at the end of the Quebec Liberal Party congress in Lévis, without giving details.
During his speech, pictures were projected behind him in a kind of picture grinder.
On three giant canvases ran a loop with remarkable images of hydroelectric dams, mines, Quebec from the point of view of "Google Maps", maps, etc.
Generous funds, as in the election period.
Indeed, at a press conference, the Prime Minister refused to rule out an early election in the autumn, although he pointed out that he had a very busy schedule.
The "North Plan" forms the fourth dimension of the "vision" that the Prime Minister intends for Quebec, a vision of a "new economic space" that includes a labor agreement with France, a canada-Europe convention, and agreements with Ontario.
Despite the fact that the opening of the North - the Northern Territory on the 49th parallel - has been frequently mentioned by the Prime Minister in his statements recently, it has never been the subject of a presentation.
However, the Prime Minister confined himself to explaining why the North was a "jewel with enormous potential", but did not give a deadline, the level of investment, or a clear priority in future projects.
At most, he mentioned several approaches to points that could be further developed: in particular hydroelectric power plants, forests, but above all the mining sector, encouraged by the growth of rapidly developing countries and the restoration of public infrastructures.
The North, according to Charest's list, contains "nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and even diamonds."
This "territory twice the size of France is in our country", "is in Quebec.
And he's not just with us, he's in us," he stressed, as if to show that he was insuding a national founding myth.
Quebec was built largely in relation to the North, the Prime Minister pointed out: the pursuit of gold in Abitibi, Quebec engineering, James' Bay.
"It's ours, it's our future," he added, after he paused theatrically to look at the huge map behind his back.
The North, 70% of Quebec's territory, includes part of Labrador, which Quebec has always called for, the prime minister said during a press conference.
"This is a traditional position repeated by all governments to date.
There is one line of border that has not been conventioned for a long time, and if the opportunity arises, I will take that position again in the name of the government," he said.
Otherwise, "we also need to rethink our vision of the North in the context of climate change," he said, speaking of a north-west transition that will open year-round as a result of the melting of glaciers.
In this new geopolitical context, the Prime Minister believes that taking territory becomes an obligation.
What about the inhabitants of the territory, the indigenous peoples and the Inuit?
The Prime Minister said that the Quebec government would be very attentive to them and that the project would benefit them, especially the young.
Two former ministers from two different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (a former Pequist MP from Ungava), have already started negotiations with some 30 communities.
The work was initiated by an inter-ministerister committee chaired by Benoît Pelletier and in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Natural Resources) has an important position.
The Prime Minister does not rule out a big meeting, "not necessarily a summit", but a moment when "a common vision will be set out."
Moreover, the Development of the North should be carried out in accordance with the principles of sustainable development.
The North plan will be "jointly designed, structured and environmentally friendly," he promised.
Jean Charest described this "vision" as a seamless follow-up to the vision of the liberal prime ministers who preceded it.
"Like the liberals who preceded us, we have changed our minds to turn challenges into new opportunities for growth and development."
Such was one of the still-ambiguous themes of the weekend, which was opened on Friday with a large cocktail highlighting the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage's ascending to the party leadership.
One of the resolutions adopted proposes to re-baptach beauharnois headquarters to the Adélard-Godbout Dam.
"From Godbout, who founded Hydro-Québec, to Lesage, who led the Peaceful Revolution and nationalization of hydropower, to Bourassa, who created James Bay, our party has been able to shape the future," jean charest said.
At the press conference, he referred to another authority, this time conservative, john diefenbaker's Roads to the North program, premiered from 1957 to 1963.
When it came to the Eastmain1a-Ruper hydroelectric dam, Charest stressed that it was scheduled to start in 2012.
"I'm just saying this between us, but I plan to be there," he confided to his member base, eliciting considerable applause.
The same prime minister who said in April that there would be no elections in 2008, and certainly not in 2009, did not rule out the possibility of triggering elections in the autumn of this year, which is what the law allows him to do.
However, he stressed that his agenda is busy, especially with the Federal Council mission in China and the Quebec-New York summit.
The weekend's convention provided the Liberal leader with a platform for some nationalist resolutions, especially some "efforts to amend the Constitution", which went very smoothly: the PLQ (Liberal Party of Quebec) demands in particular recognition of the "specificity of Quebec" in the Constitution.
It also wants Quebec to appoint a proportion of the members of the Canadian Radio and Television Council who would have a veto over decisions taken in Quebec.
On the part of the opposition, the North's plan was accepted with skepticism in its main features.
Pauline Marois, head of PQ (Parti Québecois), has once again pulled the Northern Quebec Development Policy, which landry's government launched in 2001.
According to her, when the Liberal government came to power in 2003, it renounced the implementation of this policy.
If she had held on to her, "we would be further along today," Marois said alongside her candidate in Jean-Talon (where the elections are taking place today) Françoise Mercure.
ADQ said it would support the government's adoption of the North Plan.
"But we wish it wasn't just a theatre," said Sébastien Proulx, a leader representing Mario Dumont, who is returning from vacation today.
Letters - Disgraced country
It was Vic Toews, the ex-minister of "justice" (oh irony) in Harper's cabinet, who took the liberty of saying louise arbour was a "disgrace" to Canada last summer.
To disgrace a woman who has waged a constant struggle for justice and who deserves all our admiration says a lot about the Prime Minister's surroundings and about Stephen Harper himself.
We are before us a government that, as the only one of all the Western countries involved, has not taken back to the homeland of its national locked up in the Guantánamo concentration camp.
A government that takes no account of the fact that Omar Khadr was a young adolescent at a time when the acts that were being resented were about to take place.
The only government that, despite Canada signing the Geneva Convention, is denying its word and leaving a child soldier to rot in inhumane conditions.
The only one who relies on a travesty of justice to assess the defendant's guilt.
Let us recall that UNICEF, Amnesty international and, in particular, the Association of Canadian Lawyers, are advocating the repatriation of Omar Khadr so that he can expect a fair trial in Canada.
The same government is turning a blind eye to torture: it cares little about the fact that this young man is psychologically devastated in the henchman, and no doubt permanently, after so many years of torment.
We don't realize it, but we're just witnessing the creeping erosion of our rights, our freedom, and our "democracy," a word that Harper is so driven by and that sounds so empty from his mouth.
The time has come when there is no morality anymore: it is possible to torture a Canadian citizen, to treat him badly, to imprison him at will at the will of the head of the hitherto minority government (as will be the case after 14 October...).
Many voters believe they will find salvation in a party that proclaims Virtue, Law, and Order: they do not see that this government has renounced what constituted the reputation and seriousness of our country.
Shame is, Mr. Toews, in this renunciation, and not elsewhere.
Opinions - Barrick Gold's Orwellian Discourse
In a September 17 issue, Le Devoir published a letter from Patrick J. Garver, executive vice president of Barrick Gold, a Canadian mining company.
With Orwellian logic, it confirms that the world's largest gold producer has launched a libel suit against three authors and a poor small publishing house in order to provoke a "transparent public debate" and is asking them for six million.
If it is true that judges are independent and impartial, they judge not truthfulness, especially in the case of libel prosecutions, but the law.
Unsurprisingly, Garver completely de-ersted this crucial distinction.
Or is barrick gold the best way to have a public debate, to bankrupt anyone who dares to defend the opposite position?
Whatever the outcome of the trial, the authors and publisher of Noir Canada will be forced to spend respectable sums to be prepared to defend themselves and fight a very unbalanced battle with an army of lawyers supported by the near-free pockets of a mining company.
Moreover, the tactic in these unbalanced fights often consists in ruining defendants in order to enforce conciliation proceedings that shut up the opposing party's mouth and, moreover, scare anyone who dares to pursue the matter.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, it should have introduced its view of the matter to public opinion.
Contrary to what is happening in several countries where Barrick Gold operates, in Canada, the debate normally consists of exchanging ideas, not blows with a tb;
So it was not enough for mining companies to open their books, their documentation, and to establish a real debate through newspapers, media, publications, and funding of independent scientific teams that could shed light on the matter.
Barrick Gold, however, does not seem to have confidence in public opinion, and he has shemahly rejected petitions and letters in support of the authors of Noir Canada.
Perhaps Garver could explain how he can demand "public debate" while contemptuate the views of the same public?
In the vice president's world, this word seems to refer only to boldly paid attorneys, and not to all Canadians; this is a rather narrow conception of this concept.
In a democracy, even slanderers have the right to speak out.
Barrick Gold does not understand - or does not want to understand - that the public that supports the authors and publishers of Noir Canada is doing so primarily because it rejects the brutal ways of the mining company.
The public is prepared to hear Barrick and assess the case, but on the basis of a civilized exchange of arguments, not in what many perceive as a prosecution in which the defendant's mouth is to be blocked (as part of its pursuit of the "public debate", Barrick has, incidentally, just issued an official invitation to the authors of Noir Canada to officially inform them to stop using the term...).
Aside from Garver's surreal speech, the prosecution initiated by Barrick Gold is a direct attack on the university's freedom to research and seek truth that is essential to any democratic society.
Overall, it denies the right to cite credible sources and to debate the facts and interpretations that constitute the very basis of intellectual activity.
If, in a country like Canada, it is impossible to study and discuss topics that the rich companies of this world do not like without being subjected to repeated prosecution, who else will be able to do so?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, it could have created it if it had followed the scientific standards used by noir canada's authors.
He's entitled to an answer.
The university environment to which we belong has long been able to manage debates and disagreements and resolve conflicts.
Barrick Gold's overreaching lawsuit makes it clear that, contrary to what it claims, it has no desire to have a transparent debate.
This is a loss for the university world, as it is for public debate in Canada, and it is time for governments to put in place measures to limit this type of wrongful prosecution.
The Operation to Save Wall Street - Democrats and Republicans Understand
Yesterday, the Bush administration and congressional leaders, both Republicans and Democrats, finally reached an agreement on the largest rescue economic plan since the great crisis of the 1930s.
A new version of the plan to use $700 billion to slow the financial crisis that has been stricching Wall Street for months has yet to be approved by both houses of Congress.
In particular, it foresees: better control of the applications of elected representatives, new mechanisms ensuring the repayment of public money deposited, new measures to capture the number of houses seized due to non-payment, as well as the right to monitor the level of wages paid to executives of rescued firms.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and Republican representative at the negotiating table, Senator Judd Gregg, announced the good news just after midnight yesterday, after completing a two-day negotiating marathon.
"We have made great striving and reached an agreement that is effective in the markets," said Bush administration official Henry Paulson.
"Everything has been done to keep the real economy and ordinary Americans safe from the crisis currently underway on Wall Street," the Democrat explained.
"This is a crucial point: if we don't, the trauma, chaos, and disruption to Americans' daily lives will be enormous," said Republican Judd Gregg.
Over the past few hours, negotiations have started to take a turn for fear of the effect that another failure would have on investors' mood.
The set time limit was the opening of the markets this morning.
Both CANDIDATES for US President were invited to the negotiations later, and both expressed their more in support of the agreement, but did not neglect to express their dissatisfaction that such a last resort had to be resorted to such a last resort.
Democratic Senator Barack Obama credited the agreement with some measures, not least one aimed at allowing homeowners to keep their homes, and measures on the wages of labor leaders of state-rescued firms.
"When we ask taxpayers to take special measures because of the irresponsibility of some people, there is nothing to congratulate.
However, these measures are necessary," he explained on the television.
His Republican rival, John McCain, who was asked by another network whether he would vote for the proposed plan, replied, "I'd like to see the details, but I hope so."
"The rough features I have read [show] that this is something that we will all have to digest and that will be able to move forward.
It is simply unacceptable to choose inaction," he said.
The $700 billion plan aims to buy back dubious claims and risky and unsellable assets of U.S. financial institutions with taxpayers' money.
The plan comes after 14 months of crisis unleashed by the bursting of the housing bubble, which first led to the collapse of subprimes, then shifted to other, more widespread forms of credit (PCAA) and resulted in a cash freeze and the disintegration of banks and financial institutions.
The collapse of the first draft agreement last week was caused by Republican members.
Ever since Democrats agreed that some of the "toxic" assets of struggling companies would only be liable by the government but not bought, there has been a belief that the impasse is over.
In an effort to bring the opposing views together in Congress, a measure was added stipulating that the government could introduce new fees to help it recover its deposit if it had to take losses for five years as a result of the program.
The new plan foresees a first deposit of $250 billion, to which an additional $100 billion can be added if the president deems it necessary.
The additional $350 billion should be approved by Congress in a new vote.
In exchange for its help, Washington will acquire shares in the rescued companies, which, if profitable, will pay him dividends and which it can resell when it is over.
The federal government will be able to delay foreclosure procedures related to the loans covered by the plan, as well as set limits on the amount of valuation and compensation paid to executives of affected firms.
The architects of the plan would like to put it to a vote in the House of Representatives today and in the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite all the efforts made, it is not yet certain that their plan will have the green light.
Yesterday, votes continued to rise against the project in both the Republican and Democratic camps.
"It's pretty obvious that Washington can't hear you," Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the House Finance Committee, said to voters.
"Yes, we have a serious financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But making money on taxpayers is not the solution."
Democratic Representative Brad Sherman, moderator of a group of congressmen dubbed the "committee of skeptics," presents the matter differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
"Four hundred esteemed economics professors, including three Nobel laureates, have written to us: we ask Congress not to rush too much and carefully examine which path to take," he said yesterday.
At the same time, it was reaffirmed in Europe that this crisis is a global crisis.
Following the extraordinary meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalisation of the Fortis Banking Group for €11.2 billion (US$16.3 billion).
Intervention by the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg became necessary after French bank BNP Paribas announced that it was withdrawing from the purchase of its competitor, which has been on the verge of collapse since losing €2 billion ($2.9 billion) as a result of the risky real estate loan crisis in the United States.
Fortis employs 85,000 people, is one of Europe's 20 largest banks and one of the top ten insurers.
"We will not lose this money," Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos said yesterday.
"In return, we gain the right to vote in the bank and influence.
This is what savers and households can appreciate in these uncertain times."
On the other side of the English Channel, meanwhile, the British government appears to have launched the nationalisation of another bank affected by the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government was to take over all existing bradford and bringley bank loans, more than $41 billion ($75.5 billion) of which were loans to buy real estate.
According to its announcement yesterday, the Spanish bank Santander will buy the branches and accounts of british bank clients.
Bradford and Bringley will be the second bank after Northern Rock that the British government must nationalize since the financial crisis began.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of a socially engaged icon
His azure-eyed beauty has long been his trump card, according to others, weakness.
Did this American actor, with a charming smile, break out of narcissism?
Yes and no.
The shyness, sensitivity, and unceasing talent that were his own also distanced him from the power category that breeds real stars.
But what a long-distance runner he was!
Paul Newman died Friday at the age of 83 at his ranch in Connecticut from lung cancer and remains one of the last icons of the fat years of American cinema.
Less spectacular than Brando, to whom he was similar and had long been a kind of rival on the screen, Newman was a more cautious actor, certainly a more fragile, but also an apostle of freedom and the disintegration of dramatic conventions.
Mixed blood often produces beautiful children.
Born in Ohio in 1925, his father was a German Jew and his mother was Hungarian.
From these European roots, one of the famous faces of the American dream was born.
Without exaggerated ego, which is the last sign of quality.
Because it saw this whole country in love with a self-made man, a warrior in the Pacific War wounded in battle who studied acting at Yale in the early 1950s, then attended New York's Actor's Studio and celebrated triumph in theater, television, and early film.
The same man who fought for civil rights was also a racing driver, ranked second in the 24-hour race at Le Mans in 1979, and a sex symbol, despite having been a model couple with actress Joanne Woodward since 1958.
With him also leave the shady places of this hidden, discreet, socially engaged star, allergic to the fuss of his own show business, which will forever remain mysterious to some extent.
A decent man, in the noblest sense of the word.
Paul Newman's departure this weekend has made film lovers dizzy, while his big roles compete on the black screen of memories.
After that, he defils more than half a century of ever-changing American seventh art.
Resuappeaming in memory is the charming cowboy from Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), a young man who rejects his sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in Cat on a Hot Roof, a 1958 adaptation of Tennessee Williams.
From a less distant past (1990), we recall his sensitive Mr. Bridge, disturbed at an advanced age by a marriage that did not live up to all expectations.
So many other Paul Newmans have made history.
Boxer Rocky Graziano, the battered, violent, unforgettable delinquent from Robert Wise's Somebody Up There Likes Me, a role intended for James Dean, taken over after his death in 1956, made Newman truly famous.
A likeable gangster in the absolutely great The Sting (Backstabbing), oscar for best picture in 1973.
A bitter and vindictive billiards player in Robert Rossen's the amazing The Hustler (1961), he will play the same character in Martin Scorsese's The Color of Money, which will give him only one Oscar out of seven nominations in 1987.
This face traveling through the ages, that was him.
And he again.
Different eras compete with each other in his career.
Young people know him mainly because of the iconic Slap Shot by George Roy Hill (1977) from the role of Reggie Dunlop, an unconventional hockey coach.
Fans reunited with him in 1994 at The Hudsucker Proxy of the Coen brothers.
He ended his career as the godfather of the Irish mafia in Sam Mendes' Road to Perdition in 2003.
Unlike several film legends who left the business relatively soon, Newman remained in the business for a long time, though he denounced Hollywood with its gildedness, pomp, and concessions.
The French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier, not without humor, considered it "a living challenge of underplaying," judging that he pushed too hard in his performances.
For the beautiful Paul Newman, to whom the roles came as a tray, the profession was not always so tender.
But he played the first lovers less often than outsiders: neurotics, alcoholics, crooks, and desperate men, whose downs and rebellions were reflected in his perfect features.
As director, Newman revealed little-known aspects of his shy sensibilities.
His 1968 film Rachel, Rachel (based on a novel by Canadian Margaret Laurence), starring his wife Joanne Woodward, gives a sensitive female portrait full of melancholy.
In 1984, he dedicated the 1984 film Harry and Son, a work of shame and sadness, to his son Scott, whom he lost due to an overdose.
In a flurry of tributes to Newman yesterday, his great friend and former band mate Robert Redford (who starred together in The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) said sadly, "His presence has made my life and this country better."
Generosity, love of life, such are the main qualities of a deceased actor.
Aside from his legendary career, the great civil rights activist, ecology, independent film, opponent of Hollywood's decline, is also leaving.
We used to see his likeness on bottles of wine vinegar, sauces, biscuits and other foods, which may have seemed rather tawy to us, although at first it was a gag.
However, the proceeds from the sale went to the account of his Foundation for a Difficult Childhood.
Newman was engaged in society until the last moment, rather than lulled into glory.
He left a letter to his five daughters containing the following sentences: "Always and to the end, your father was grateful to his happy planet.
It was an honor to be here."
And it was an honor for us to be able to follow the life path of such a prescient and magnanimous American artist.
And besides, after all, a model citizen.
What was produced in the invoice factory Zuschlag & spol.?
Shortly, on October 8, the trial will begin in the criminal proceedings against János Zuschlag and his associates.
Among other crimes, including forgery of documents, the politician and his associates are accused of fraud committed by a long-term and systematic criminal organisation, resulting in extremely significant damage.
According to the prosecutor's office, they used the money obtained in the tenders for their own purposes and often admissed the completion of tasks with fictitious invoices.
Money from the state and local governments - totalling about 65 million forints - went partly to fiatal baloldal's coffers, partly to the pockets of individuals.
The method, which was also reported by the investigating authority, was that the money raised in the tenders was collected on the basis of invoices for which there was no real consideration and the commitments entered into by the associations were never met.
According to the indictment, a large portion of the invoices were false.
The forms for these invoices came from the Józsefváros market, the round stamps were made in Kiskunhalasi.
The names of which companies are to be used for the production of invoices were decided, among other things, on a tour of the northern shore of Balaton, to which János Zuschlag sent Isttan Lados.
According to his statement, the former should have been looking for guesthouses and restaurants.
In them, he applied for bills for his consumption, according to which invoices submitted in the framework of tenders issued, among other things, by the Ministry of Youth and Sport, the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs and the Municipality of the Capital were produced.
The invoices were mostly issued by István Lados and his partner András Őri, who, according to our information, most often wrote the reports needed to obtain subsidies.
On his "study trip", Lados looked for a pub.
According to two invoices issued by Zuschlage and his associates in 2003, this hospitality establishment provided catering for a group of 90 from biztos pont.
However, according to the head of the company, so many people would not fit in this facility at once.
Similarly, the invoice issued in the summer of 2002 to a foundation called Jobb Jövőért, later Együtt and Harmadik Évezredért, was teeming with formal and content errors.
The guesthouse in Badacsonytomaji had only three rooms, more than ten people could not sleep in it one evening, yet one hundred and thirty guests were listed on the invoice.
However, the fillers of the forms with a rich imagination overdue this even when they put on the documents a company also engaged in hospitality - Pigal s.r.o., whose accounts, according to the information provided to the public prosecutor's office, did not even contain documents in the name of Jobb Jövőért and Hoppá.
Győző Farkas, head of hvg.hu, said that when he was summoned to the prosecutor's office and shown invoices, he immediately knew they were fake documents.
"The name of our business and our tax number were in the wrong place on the stamp."
As he added, in addition to the formalities, the fact that they accommodated 100 people according to the invoice, they have only eleven rooms that do not have such a large capacity.
In addition, the invoice also stated catering, and their restaurant has not worked for a long time.
Zealous invoice manufacturers were also unconvinced that the budapest travel agency was only organising foreign trips, and foolishly cited the invoice with a cash payment, which was also not the same as the company's billing practice, as a service for arranging a trip to Hungary.
Moreover, as was shown in the course of the investigation, they also stated VAT in the document, although the organisation of trips to countries outside the European Union was exempt from VAT.
The four documents issued to the Jobb Jövőért Foundation by Hotel Révfülöp s.r.o. did not agree, inter alia, on the amount of VAT. The company's activities are not covered by the 25% but by 15% VAT, in addition, hotel employees issued only printed invoices, but the invoice produced was handwritten.
In addition, the "publishers" spoiled the invoice by, for example, laying out, as it became clear from an investigation by the public prosecutor's office, as a road transport activity that the company based on investment advice had not originally carried out.
Moreover, the fact that the invoices issued to the Együtt and Harmadik Évezredért foundations and to XXI.
As in the case of Ravenna k.s. or the Sports Camp in Kunfehértó, whose representatives denied that they had issued the invoices.
For example, counterfeiters did not notice that HIB s.r.o. from Nyíregyháza was in liquidation at the time (2001), when a group from fiatal Városért was eating there, which is why, according to our information, the company's liquidation commissioner also denied that he had published the paper.
Invoices were issued knowingly
The second group of invoicers consists of those who knew to issue a fictitious invoice.
The Eséla Budapestért Foundation has issued accounts for some four million forints to the Harmadik Évezredért Foundation at the request of Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjú Szocialisták.
According to the indictment, the head of Collab s.r.o. was persuaded to issue a fictitious account by one of the accused, Ludovic Györfi.
Biogate s.r.o. also cooperated with Zuschlage and its partners, currently in liquidation, which in 2003 supplied the Jobb Jövőért Foundation and Atlasz and Vörösfenyő with invoices worth approximately five million forints for which there was no real economic activity.
Nor the movement of money, because the invoices created were later cancelled, which organizations forgot to mention in their documents.
Another group of billing firms includes those with ties to the defendants.
For example, Iván Kubatov was an authorized representative of the Ukrainian managing director of Delta Trió s.r.o., a fuel and motor vehicle trading company based in Budapest, but where the company is not found.
In October, November and December 2005, the company issued several invoices for the sale of computer equipment worth approximately 18 million forints.
According to the data collected by the investigation, these invoices were purchased by Kiskunhalas company Cash Investment s.r.o., which was liquidated from 14 September 2005.
The managing director of this company was a man from Romania, to whom Iván Kubatov was to be given documents relating to the company from 2002 to 2005.
As we know, Kubatov admitted during the investigation that he had issued invoices on behalf of the company to Atlasz, Hoppá and the Együtt and Harmadik Évezredért Foundations and had himself accepted their consideration.
At the request of Iván Kubatov, Fa-Bani Jos Faipari s.r.o. and Jos-Investment k. s. were founded by Romanian masons.
In fact, none of the firms worked, according to the defendant, because they didn't get a job.
Nevertheless, the companies benefited him by issuance invoices to Atlasz and Y-Generáció linked to Zuschlaga on behalf of the companies at the request of the co-accused lawyer Zsolt Szente, who also prepared their instruments of incorporation.
On behalf of Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade, Kubatov gave the organizations a total of 15 invoices worth 14.2 million forints.
The public prosecutor's office concluded that Kubatov had lost 10 percent of the amounts stated in the invoices and VAT.
The man also used Szi-Beri k.t. to issue fictitious invoices, this time for a tender for biztos pont.
In January 2006, Y-Generáció and Szövetség and Modern Magyarországért submitted proposals for a tender for the Mihálye Táncsics Foundation (TMA), a public benefit organisation of the Socialist Party.
They received 500,000 forints each, but did not spend the amounts on the objectives set out in the proposals.
In order not to reveal this, TMA submitted five fictitious invoices from Works Team s.r.o.
Moreover, these invoices were found during a search of Árpád Kemecsei's office at the Ministry of Education.
During the trial, some of the defendants are likely to describe the course of the production of invoices, as they have already done at the prosecutor's court.
What may be more interesting is if the main defendant János Zuschlag himself decides to reveal everything.
His statement so far is not very detailed, and although he has promised several times to explain everything at wide, he has not yet done so.
The question is whether it is in his interest - in exchange for paying a large part of the damage, fifty million forints, perhaps the Socialists have made a deal with him, and Zusi will take the blame.
He may have been offended, too, for his requests to relax the terms of his detention, namely the placement of house arrest, have so far been unansbeatable.
While the perpetrators of economic crimes who have done much more damage than they have not yet paid are free to walk, or at least wait for the end of the proceedings against them in their homes, he does not have this option.
The psychology of trumping: why are we spending more money?
In auctions, customers are willing to spend more money, overestimmute goods.
The neurological and economic foundations of this familiar - and seemingly irrational - behavior were revealed to researchers in the field of neurology and economics at New York University.
According to their study, published in the journal Science, people don't want to lag behind in a competition like the eBay auction, so they'd rather pay too high a price.
Using an experimental auction, the research tried to map a diagram of this "game" in the nervous system.
One group of volunteers bet, the other group participated in a staged auction, using the Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) method to study the active areas of the brain of the test people.
In both games, participants could win money, but in an auction game, an important element of which is to trump the other side, the whole located under the cerebral cortex, called the striatum, began to function intensively during the losing.
This brain region plays a role in the "self-rewarding" mechanism of the nervous system, among many other functions.
According to the researchers, the unscrewing of the price can therefore be explained by trying to avoid a sharp reaction of the striatum.
To support their theory, members of the economists' research team conducted a financial cross-sectional survey.
Under different conditions, three groups auctioned against one partner.
The control group was simply told what the fair value of the product was and they made bets.
In addition, members of another group were promised that if they came out of the game victorious, they would receive an additional $15 as a reward.
The third group received $15 before the auction, but in the event of a loss, its members also lost the money.
So the difference between the two groups was that one was highlighted by winning and the other by losing.
However, members of the "against the loss" group were willing to go higher than in the control and "winning" group, confirming the neurologists' hypothesis.
"These results cannot be inferred from any pre-existing economic theory.
Until now, these have explained the phenomena observable in auctions of the joys of victory and risk avoidance.
It wasn't until neurological imaging methods that helped us resolve the contradiction between the two theories that we have now come to a third explanation," said Andrew Schotter, a professor at New York University's School of Economics.
Hepatitis: when to see a doctor?
Around half a billion people worldwide suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C infection, and in Hungary this chronic liver disease is cited as one of the leading causes of death.
The number of domestic cases of hepatitis infection is estimated at 100,000, but only 7,000 of them are being treated. This is because the sick often do not know that they are infected.
The name hepatitis is the collective name of infectious liver damage caused by various viruses.
There are many similarities in their symptoms, symptoms are symptoms of inflammation of the liver and jaundice, but the agents of the disease and the diseases caused by them differ from each other.
Hepatitis viruses spread in two main ways depending on the agents of the disease: hepatitis A and E through the digestive tract (for example, infected foods, water), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses through blood and body fluids (semen, vaginal secretions, saliva).
In any case, travellers should be protected by vaccination against A and B virus, there is no vaccine against type C virus.
Symptoms of hepatitis A appear two to three weeks after ingestion of infected food, usually accompanied by nausea, weakness, abdominal discomfort, urge to vomit.
Then jaundice is formed on the skin and eye whites, lightening the stool and darkening the urine. Treatment can take up to two to three weeks.
Every year, a million people worldwide die from a more serious type of this disease, liver cancer and liver cirrhosis caused by hepatitis B.
The main cause is that only one in ten people infected is estimated to be treated with medication.
Also, hepatitis C can have very serious consequences: if not treated, it can lead to liver cirrhosis or liver cancer.
Most infected people do not even know about their disease, the causative agent of the disease destroys liver cells insidiously, so the first symptoms appear in many cases only in 20-30 years.
Therefore, timely prevention, the implementation of regular depressation is very important.
In three groups, this disease occurs much more often than on average: among people who had a blood transfusion before 1991, among drug users, and among people with tattoos.
Currently, the estimated worldwide number of individuals infected with chronic hepatitis C virus is 200 million.
Since the disease can already be demonstrated by a routine laboratory examination, a person should contact his general practitioner if he notices any symptom of unknown origin.
With early detection, the disease is treatable, the virus can be removed from the body to prevent contagiousness and prevent cancer.
September 30 is World Hepatitis Day, which was first organized worldwide in 2004 by organizations representing the sick.
Its aim is to draw attention to chronic inflammation of the liver caused by these viruses, the causes of its formation and the importance of early recognition of the disease.
Benelux governments national part of Fortis Bank
The Benelux states will help belgian-Dutch bank Fortis, which was the first in Europe to get into trouble because of the spreading effect of the US mortgage market crisis, by partially nationalization: the trio of countries will support the money and insurance institution, which also has a capital participation in Hungary, with €11.2 billion.
This was agreed at the highest level this weekend by the Belgian, Luxembourg and Dutch Governments, with the participation of the President of the European Central Bank and the European Commissioner for Competition.
Fortis is the first in the euro area to be in a major crisis in the international financial markets crisis, which has been spreading in waves for more than a year, and the decisions made on this issue could, in some respects, be seen as precedents.
In the sense of the decision, which was born on Sunday night, all three states will buy out almost half (49 percent) of the bank's assets there.
The bank will confidently sell part of its capital holdings, especially - mainly insurance - activities purchased last year from dutch bank ABN Amro.
Fortis shares started to fall sharply last week, with serious signs of crisis already appearing in the second half of the week.
But analysts agree that with its 85,000 employees, the bank is too big to fail.
The company's stock fell 12 percent friday, to a 14-year low.
Since January, the stock has fallen by more than two-thirds.
Given current share prices, the group's total market capital value is around €14 billion, but this is unrealistic, according to company leaders.
Indeed, management blames uncertainty in the overseas market for the collapse of Fortis shares related to the adoption of the $700 billion US package plan.
By Monday, the stock had already risen slightly.
On Friday, a new CEO, Filip Dierckx, was appointed to head the bank.
The money institution was also looking for private buyers, but no one has yet come forward with a more serious offer.
The Belgian government has previously announced that investors do not have to worry, they will not lose their money.
There has been no panic among the bank's clients so far, and branches have not been attacked.
In Hungary, Fortis Bank has a separate branch and has also bought several leasing companies.
Who believes in God doesn't hurt that much?
According to recent research, faith in God acts as a certain analgesic that could have facilitated death for already Catholic martyrs.
Scientists from the University of Oxford conducted an interesting experiment, examining how faith in the god affects the perception of pain in humans, the British daily Telegraph reported.
In a rather bizarre survey, 12 Catholic believers and an equal number of atheists were electrocuted, while all observed a painting depicting the Virgin Mary.
According to the results, Catholic believers were able to rule out much of the pain.
Thanks to a technique that examines the human brain in detail, it has also been shown that Catholics were able to activate the part of their brain that is responsible for regulating pain.
The research is the first in a series of research involving scientists, philosophers and theologians from different parts of the university, in addition to academics.
Exactly the test was carried out by attaching a sparkling instrument to the left hand of the test subject, which emitted electric shocks.
The researchers asked the participants in the experiment to stare at two paintings: Sassoferrat's Virgin Mary, dating from the 17th century, and Leonardo da Vinci's Lady with The Playfulness, painted in the 15th century.
The authors of the research hoped that the sight of the Virgin Mary would evoke a certain state of piety among believers, while they chose da Vinci's painting because it is not very different from the first and seems reassuring.
The test subjects spent half an hour in an MRI scanner, during which time they received 20 electroshogs in four consecutive parts, while separately watching a religious or general image.
Catholics reported feeling "safe" at the sight of the Virgin Mary, as if they had been "cared for" and "calmed down, filled with peace."
Watching a religious-themed painting, they said, they felt 12 percent less pain than when they had Leonardo's work in front of them.
Psychologist Miguel Farias, who also participated in the research, believes that a similar effect can be achieved with any strongly impressive image even in atheists, just the right photo needs to be found.
"We would have to find a picture that they would perceive very positively, from the position of mother or father," the psychologist said.
Anglican Bishop Tom Wright welcomed the results of the research.
"Practicing faith should change and, in many cases, change our personality," Wright added.
After such great results, it is only a question of what effect it would have on regulating the pain of believers if they were shown a madonna by Leonardo or a painter of similar caliber.
Would looking at a quality Virgin Mary mean achieving even better results?
You're what you share
On its 10th birthday, Google can claim that people can find it in their pocket at least as well as in the sky above their heads; they know where they were on holiday, what professional examinations they go to and what interests them.
But according to Eric Schmidt, one of the company's bosses, that's still not enough.
But when it comes to skeptics paralleling orwellian dark vision, the very nature of Web 2.0 is not clear to them.
Eric Schmidt recently told the Financial Times that Google's main goal is to collect even more personal information about users, which is necessary for Google's founders to stick to their original goal, which was, "Let's organize all the information in the world!"
According to a Google official, after 10 years of world-class work, the company is only at the beginning of working with all the information.
When asked what would happen in five years, Schmidt replied that he would like Google to be able to answer questions like "what should I do tomorrow?" or "what kind of work would actually be right for me?" - but software won't be able to answer such seemingly simple questions until they know enough information about users.
Not all Internet users are well aware that during an internet search, the search words are accurately collected, as well as what IP address it was searched from and to which pages the searchers moved after the search.
For example, with Personalized Search launched two years ago, users can keep their surfing history, look back at what they've searched for and clicked on, generating findings that are much more directly tailored to them in the long run - the same logic will be used to create recommendations, through which the system will offer us products and services based on previously mentioned and retained preferences.
What if my data is used against me, what if someone looks at what I'm doing? - asks users who are afraid when looking at Google's data monopoly.
In most cases, the extent of the potential power represented by the company seems eerily threatening, the counter-reaction does not cause guilt in internet users, fear of punishment, a desire for freedom, or even a rebellion against power.
However, it is a confirmed fact that all search terms are not only recorded, but can also be issued to a third party in justified cases, in such legal cases the personal rights of Internet users do not protect anything.
Perhaps the most famous example of recent was the coordinated action against Brazilian pedophiles, during which Google provided the Brazilian government with information that allowed the identification of pedophiles from the Orkut community sites set up through it.
But internet users worried about personal rights could breathe a sigh of relief back in May when the company, in hand with the electronic rights organization EFF, successfully proved its truth in a dispute with the FBI: Google must not be forced to provide any information secretly requested by the FBI in the future.
(At the same time, the federal government successfully won nearly fifty thousand web addresses and thousands of search terms, which it obtained citing a strengthening of the Child Protection Act passed years ago, but still failed to get lists of individual users' search items, or complete lists of websites and keywords covering a period of two months.)
The view of Google is so contradictory: it is flogged by those who fear the disclosure of their personal data, because they feel that their intimate sphere and private life will be harmed by using Google's services, and they are speaking out against it with a revolt that belongs to multinational firms with a conservative image.
Meanwhile, American geek culture and its wild offshoot, grouping around enthusiastic computer fans, activists, and users, appearing in many countries, sees it as a new generation of big business, a "corporation that's now running," unlike its rival Microsoft, considered the conqueror of the world because of Windows, however much they both fight for the same goals.
This may be because Google, unlike Microsoft, does not require an identification code from its users and does not require money from them for its applications; an open, free and constantly fresh source of information and a package of programs feels much more accessible, youthful, "cooler" than the practice of an official software giant.
But it may also be because geeks understand precisely the very problematic relationship between the Internet and personality rights that has brought with it just one of the most glassy keywords of recent years: web 2.0.
Web 2.0 is about nothing more than cooperation, about deliberately leaving traces behind and using the communication channels at our disposal, and although their scope is different for everyone, the essence remains the same: we show up.
The average young person can profile on several community pages from Facebook to Xang, which they can easily link to other services, such as Twitter or the last.fm app, recording the music they listen to, all of which they can then connect to navigation systems such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm, in addition to writing a blog that automatically discovers their latest photo galleries , which he stores on Flickr or Picas.
In doing so, we can read about a lot of exemplary cases from which she can explain: in the morning, looking at a flood of photos of mutual friends, a friend easily finds out who her crazy boyfriend spent the evening with, or the company can fire its employee just because she will tell her honest opinion about the top management on her blog: one thing is certain, the concept of private life has been completely reconsidered today.
One who lives an online life consists of what he shows, so we could define the basic thesis behind the behavior of today's youth.
And anyone who wants to hide something, or at least avoid a Googling monopoly, has an option (starting with Scroogel, for example, who uses Google's search engine but deliberately leaves no trace).
For example, a significant number of people deliberately do not register on community sites to be found. Google's online applications, from text editor to photo editor and news portal, can be exchanged for alternative versions that are not connected to giant server parks and that do not build the highest quality profile possible.
Public opinion is not very secretly awaiting when Google will show its tooth.
With a current value of $156 billion, the business is worth more than IBM ($140 billion), Intel ($124 billion) or Coca Cola ($110 billion), AdWords/AdSense's advertising space threatens advertising agency investments, and services introduced at an ever-accelerating pace are seriously making life difficult not only for Microsoft, but also for numerous other software designers.
But critics also find counterpoints to the disturbing effect: the chief executive, for example, completely rejected employee protests after raising the company's kindergarten fee to twice that, arbitrarily frequent daily meals for employees were too expensive, according to the company's management, but all this is lost alongside the fact that Google bowed to the Chinese government in 2006 and, within the meaning of their agreement, filters out every finding. , which is against the good tastes or interests of the Chinese regime.
One of the company's internal rules is that it never advertises new services in advance, only when they can be used, but what is certain is that the expected problems of the coming months and years may be steering the world in new places: while some believe that Google's project to scan and archive books and magazines is taking on such dimensions that the company will soon have something to do with the US Supreme Court , others are terrified of her Health system, in which we can compile a complete health profile with previous findings, doctors and problems.
The fact that Google is compiling a genetic database can serve as a good starting point for future generations of science fiction writers, cory Doctorow's famous novel "Scroogled" describes with Orwellian reminiscences a future in which one can only get close to a person with google data.
Two teenagers helped the double murderer from Ózd remove his tracks
Two teenagers were questioned by police in a double murder case in Ózdu, who they suspected were helping to remove traces of the crime, a spokesman for borsod County's High Police Directorate said on Tuesday.
The persons have confessed to the activity for which they were suspected and are currently charged with aiding and abetting a crime.
Both teenagers, two girls, according to MTI information, are being prosecuted at large.
Aiding and abetting is punishable by up to 5 years in prison.
The suspect in the double murder in Ózdu, a 23-year-old local man, was taken into provisional custody on Sunday.
He's suspected of a felony premeditated multiple murders for self-suathing reasons.
During the investigation, it emerged that a 23-year-old young man owed a 53-year-old man more.
The suspect refused to pay his debt, so he lured his creditor to a establishment in Ózd last Wednesday, where he killed first a man and then his 9-year-old daughter.
According to MTI information, the young man was preparing to commit the crime in advance, as evidenced by the fact that he committed the murder with a weapon hidden at the scene.
The weapon and the circumstances of its use are being investigated by the police with the involvement of experts.
Warsaw Stock Exchange made an offer to buy the Prague Stock Exchange
Two hundred million euros - approximately five billion Czech crowns - were offered by the Warsaw Stock Exchange for the purchase of a 100% shareholding on the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, chairman of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed the offer made by the Polish side, despite the fact that the Czechs had previously excluded the Warsaw Stock Exchange from the list of possible new owners of the Prague Stock Exchange.
This is due to the fact that the owner of the Warsaw Stock Exchange is the state.
99 percent of the shares are in the hands of the Polish state, which wants to sell 60 percent of the securities in a few months.
As the Czech economic daily E15 writes, the offer of Poles represents the highest amount offered to the bidder for the Prague Stock Exchange so far.
According to Czech papers, the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq Transatlantic Stock Exchange, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and Deutsche Börse have so far submitted bids.
Petr Koblic, the head of the Prague Stock Exchange, said last week that the Warsaw Stock Exchange would be the worst new owner of all bidders, and did not rule out that this could lead to the demise of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
The value of the Prague Stock Exchange is estimated by stock market experts at 5-10 billion.
Under the shareholders' agreement, about 90 percent of the shares could be sold off.
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is the investment bank Patria Finance with approximately 25 percent share, followed by Česká spořitelna with 14.7 and Tiger Holding Four S. a. r. l. with 13.5 percent.
On the financial crisis from the point of view of European papers
In their comments on Tuesday on the deepening international financial crisis, Europe's leading papers are already reminiscent of "the second of 9/11."
We can thank the US President for the global financial disaster, the Roman La Repubblica is pressing charges. The president was not even able to assuay his own party in support of that hastily drafted bill aimed at remedying this desperate situation...
Instead of the new Pearl Harbor, reminiscent of billionaire investor Warren Buffett, we could be talking about the second 9/11.
Part of the Madrid press also sees the culprit in Washington.
In the opinion of El Mundo, the world economy has been brought to the brink of collapse by its lack of political leadership.
The danger of the collapse of america's financial system continues to grow, for which the whole world will eventually pay.
While Bush's plan was not perfect, there is a danger after a vote in Congress that Washington will not offer a political tool to resolve the crisis.
The world economy is hanging in the air - just as one of the greatest transformations in capitalism's history is underway.
The threat can no longer be neglected, points out the Geneva daily Tages-Anzeiger.
Individual states can still throw a lifeline at staggering financial institutions, and taxpayers can save them from bankruptcy.
But if other banks collapse like dominoes, neither money nor further improvisation will be enough.
In the long term, the Member States of the European Union need to move beyond their national egoism and unite control over fragmented financial markets.
On Monday, the post-election monetary institutions received more than €100 billion, the Vienna-based Der Standard notes, saying that fears that, like Americans, European taxpayers will have to reach deep into their pockets to resolve the crisis are becoming increasingly real.
The European Union has not yet seriously addressed the crisis, which is rolling through the old continent like a tsunami.
"Rescuers" do not have to wave hundreds of billions of euros right away, but it would be good if they could set out which case it makes sense to reach for taxpayers' money to prevent even more damage.
Smart car immitates bumblebee flight
What would be the best method of developing technologies capable of preventing collisions, if not imitations of obstacle detectors occurring in the world of nature?
For example, in bees.
Bumblebees inspired the initial strategic idea of the surprise project, presented at the CEATEC trade fair in Japan. It was about building a new generation of collision avoiding systems.
In collaboration with the University of Tokyo, Nissan has designed the BR23C biomimetic robotic control system, a robotized minicar that features bee characteristics, with the ultimate goal of helping to create a system that can eliminate all collisions.
"During the flight, each bee creates its own personal space of an oval shape, which is actually very similar to our safety protective packaging," Kazuhiro Doi, the brand's general manager for technological PR and research and development, explained at the exhibition.
An important role is played by folded eyes, which allow bees to see in all directions at a viewing angle of more than 300 degrees.
To copy the function of the compound eye, the engineers reached for the idea of a laser range-range rangeometer.
It identifies obstacles up to 2 meters in front of the BR23C in a field of view of 180 degrees, calculates their distance and sends a signal to the on-board microprocessor, which instantly turns into an operation to prevent collision.
The obstacle is caught in a fraction of a second, then the robotized car begins to immit the movements of the bee and immediately changes direction by turning the wheels to the extent necessary to prevent collision.
Unlike any existing system, this switching maneuver takes place in a completely instinctive way.
"If this were not the case, the robotic car would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles," explains Toshiyuki Ando, head of the Mobility Laboratory and robotic car project.
They must react instinctively and immediately, as this technology suits the most vulnerable and innermost layer of the safety protective packaging, inside which a collision is currently considered unavoidable.
The whole process must reflect what the bee does to avoid other bees.
This process must take no more than the blink of an eye.
However, unlike bees, this movement cannot be directed upwards, downwards or diagonally, it can only be two-dimensional and only in the direction in which the wheels can be rotated.
Instead of the endless possibilities offered to bees when avoiding, only the possibility of rotating movement, acceleration and deceleration was applied in the case of a robotic car.
BR23C uses lithium-polymer batteries that are lighter and have a higher energy density, which means they have a longer lifespan than lithium-ion variants.
According to Ando, an instinctive, intelligent reaction is important, not the ability to process, much less the storage of data.
This mechanism must process and respond to only a few incoming signals per second.
There is no need for him to store and react using intuitive logic based on data from previous maneuvers, therefore he constantly uses only memory the size of a few kilobytes.
It doesn't need giga- or megabyte memory.
This is the first step towards developing instant avoidance technology that Nissan estimates could reach mass-produced cars within a decade.
Another option may be to connect the unit to the GPS satellite navigation system, which, after avoiding obstacles, would lead the motorist to the specified final destination.
Damn expensive kid already has a name
The $700 billion economic rescue package bill, to be divided into several instalments and aimed at buying up low-quality bank loans, is already in writing.
Half of the amount will be used in the first round.
After further negotiations, which ended only after midnight U.S. Eastern Time on Saturday, congressional leaders reached an agreement in a days-long debate on a $700 billion bailout package, Reuters reported.
"We've made significant progress," said Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic leader of the House of Representatives, who said all that remains is to write an agreement.
Both presidential candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain, also supported the compromise on the package.
Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said of the outcome of the compromise: "The programme will work and will be effective, but further action is needed."
The written version of the package was published before the opening of Asian markets at 8:00 p.m. Washington time on Sunday (2 a.m. Central European time Monday), but it did not cause any particular stock market rise.
The draft legislation, which will be adopted by the 2008 Emergency Economic Stabilization Act to establish the program, will be voted on first by the House of Representatives on Monday, then by the Senate.
President George W. Bush spoke with Pelosi on Saturday night, after news of the deal was also welcomed by the White House.
"We are pleased with the progress made last night and greatly appreciate both sides' efforts to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy," said White House spokesman Tony Fratto.
Indeed, the program differs from the Bush administration's original proposal to spend a total of $700 billion at a time to buy low-quality mortgage-backed securities.
It is now possible to spend no more than half of the $700 billion in the first round, so that $250 billion will be used immediately after Congress is expected to decide on the matter on Monday, and the Treasury Department will buy mortgage-backed securities that are rated as of poor quality, and the fate of the remaining $100 billion will depend on the president's decision.
The program will be controlled by a special body, of which the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank will also be a member.
Spending the second half of $700 billion will depend on another congressional decision.
The Ministry of Finance can apply a combined tactic within the meaning of the law: it can simultaneously buy low-quality loans, mortgages and mortgage-backed securities, or other "poisonous" loans.
The purchase can also take place directly within the framework of auctions, the competent representatives of the Ministry said.
The legislation will allow the companies concerned to participate in an insurance programme in which the Ministry of Finance grants them a guarantee for funds representing a cause for concern, for which the company will then pay a price corresponding to the amount of the expected damages.
As Henry Paulson said, the law provides the necessary resources to spend up to $700 billion to meet the urgent demands of the US financial system, whether it be large-scale purchases of bad funds, their insurance, or preventing systemic risk associated with the collapse of one of the big money institutions.
"We will take the necessary steps to be ready to introduce the law as soon as it is signed," he added.
On the contrary, bank bosses who have gotten into trouble and are waiting for state help can count on the government to reduce their severance pay - which in overseas slang is simply called a "golden parachute."
Their payouts will be restricted only in certain cases, in addition, these restrictions will depend on the method of assistance provided by the Ministry.
The restriction essentially means that if the Ministry buys as part of an auction, a tax surchar down on gold parachutes will be imposed unless fallen bank directors are sent straight into retirement.
In the case of direct purchases of poor-quality loans, the government will aggressively act to ensure that the money for management is not excessive.
It should be added that the existing contracts for gold falls will not change, the restriction applies only to new contracts, which is intended to be a further incentive to participate in the programme.
"This is the first time in American history that a legal limitation on ceo pay will be in place," said Barney Frank, chairman of the House Financial Services Committee.
Moreover, the state will have the right to acquire a stake in the banks participating in the programme, thereby reducing the risk to taxpayers, since once the economy and the rescued bank get back on their feet, they can also profit from the transaction.
The bill includes that over the next five years, the president must submit a proposal to Congress setting out how expected losses from the financial sector can be returned to taxpayers.
Of course, there were also voices on both sides expressing doubts about the plan.
"That's not what the American people have been ask of us, because that's not going to protect taxpayer dollars," said Republican Congressman Darrell Issa of California.
His Democratic colleague from Ohio, Mary Kaptur, resents that the provisions were pushed by those responsible for wall street's collapse.
Industrial prices continued to rise
Domestic sales prices in industry increased by 0.1 percent in August 2008 compared to the previous month, and by 12.9 percent compared to August 2007, the Central Statistical Office reported.
Export sales prices in industry were higher by 1.1 percent compared to July 2008, down 3.9 percent year-on-year.
As a result of changes in domestic and export prices, industrial production prices were higher by 0.7 percent compared to the previous month, up 3.2 percent year-on-year.
Domestic sales prices in the industry rose only minimally, by 0.1 percent compared to the previous month.
Domestic sales prices in the manufacturing sector also increased slightly, by 0.1 percent compared to July.
The largest price increase took place in August 2008 in the leather and footwear industry (2.8 percent), mainly due to a monthly price increase of 4.6 percent in the bag and saddlery industry and 2.5 percent in footwear production, respectively.
The higher price level of plastic and chemical raw materials caused a significant monthly increase in prices in the chemicals and products production sector (1.6 percent).
Prices fell in the oil processing sector (1.4 percent), production of electrical machinery and equipment (0.9 percent), as well as - to a minimum - in the woodworking sector (0.1 percent).
Prices in the paper production and publishing and printing business remained unchanged.
In other manufacturing sectors, we measured price increases in the range of 0.2 - 0.9 percent.
In the electricity, gas and water generation and distribution sector, which is of great importance in domestic sales of the industry, prices rose by 0.3 percent in August, mainly due to the continued impact of the officially established increase in gas prices since July 1.
In a 12-month comparison of domestic sales in the various sectors of the manufacturing industry, prices rose the most in the professional oil processing sector (32.4 percent).
In the metalworking sector, a 13.2% increase in prices could be observed, and an 11% increase in prices in the production of food products, beverages and tobacco products, which is crucial.
Prices decreased in the textile and textile production sectors (2.5 percent) and in the production of electrical machinery and equipment (0.3 percent).
In other manufacturing sectors, the rate of price growth ranged between 0.6 and 9.1 percent.
Overall, prices in the manufacturing sector have risen by 10.2 percent over the past year.
Prices in the electricity, gas and water generation and distribution sectors exceeded previous year's prices by 18.7 percent.
In terms of sector-by-sector division, domestic sales in August showed the highest monthly price increase (0.7 percent) in the tangible asset production sectors.
Prices rose by 0.3 percent in consumer goods industries, while prices in energy processing and further processing sectors remained unchanged from the previous month.
The largest price increases in August 2008 compared to the same month of the previous year could be observed in energy processing and further processing sectors (16,8 percent).
In the consumer goods industries, we measured a price increase of 6.8 percent, while for tangible assets, a price decrease of 1.4 percent.
Export sales prices of industrial products measured in forints increased by 1.1 percent in August compared to the previous month, down 3.9 percent in the 12-month comparison.
Our domestic currency weakened by 1.7 percent against the euro in one month, then by 7.1 percent against the dollar, up 7.5 percent against the euro and 15.9 percent against the dollar.
Next year to the United States without a visa?
According to Kinga Göncz, there is a high chance that the US-Hungarian visa waiver agreement will enter into force around January 12, the Foreign Minister spoke about it in Chicago in front of the leaders of the local Hungarian community.
In her view, "almost everything now depends on the construction of an electronic system of permitting travel or inspections overseas in a timely manner."
At the same time, she warned that the new system would not include a permit to enter, but tourists would have to register before leaving.
From today, the hungarian diplomacy representative continues negotiations in Washington.
He will meet with Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, who will be addressed by the Middle Cross with the star of the Order of Merit for the Republic of Hungary, and will hold talks with foreign policy advisers of Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama and Republican John McCain.
Both Barack Obama and McCain are in support of the bank bailout package
Barack Obama and John McCain, the presidential candidates of both major US parties, on Sunday endorsed the government's $700 billion bank bailout package, but there are also politicians who are demanding the resignation of the Treasury Secretary.
After a marathon of several days of negotiations between Congress and administration officials, it was announced early Sunday morning: a basic agreement had been reached on a bank rescue package.
The financial package, which aims to rewrite wall street's crisis and frozen credit market, has become a central issue in the presidential campaign.
Both Obama and McCain agree to be more suitable of the two candidates to lead the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the most recent polls, as economic issues came to the fore, Obama regained some advantage, dissipated McCain's lead, which he secured after sarah palin's Republican convention for vice president.
Obama expressed hope sunday at a campaign rally in Detroit that the $700 billion package bill would be quickly passed by Congress.
He stressed that the proposal contains passages on consumer protection, which he also supports.
"We must act now, responsibly (...) your jobs, your savings, your entire industry, the stability of the entire economy," he said in front of a crowd of 35,000.
He didn't miss an opportunity to call McCain's ideas about the economy obsolete.
McCain explained in an interview with ABC: "Everyone's going to be a little bit against it (...) but doing nothing is simply not an easy way."
As the Republican senator said, the proposal includes the establishment of a commission overseeing the Treasury Secretary and the limits on severance pay for top officials that he insisted on.
Obama told CBS News that McCain had no more significant role in the negotiations, but he was in daily contact with the secretary.
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said Sunday that the House of Representatives will vote on the bill as early as Monday.
German language region print overview
The right-wing camp is intact, only the voters within it have become more confident - so der Spiegel analyzes the CSU's weak result in Bavaria.
The Haiders are ready to rule Austria to prevent a red-and-black coalition.
Der Spiegel (spiegel.de)
In the internet edition of the left-wing German news magazine, Franz Walter discusses the causes of the CSU's dramatic defeat in his article entitled "The Bavarian Revolution Eats Its Fathers."
According to a well-known political scientist, csu erosion began long before the sad duo Beckstein-Huber took office.
For decades, the Christian Socialists have restored Bavaria - and now it is these modern citizens who are turning away from them.
The alternation of periods is a problem for the entire Christian democracy, and thus angela merkel.
The debacle was not entirely surprising for the CSU, but on Saturday the process that could have been expected for almost exactly ten years ended: the undisputed hegemony of one state party ended.
Ten years ago, in 1998, the CSU landed at 47.7 percent, below the 50 percent mark for the first time since the 1950s.
This was repeated three years ago in the Bundestag elections in 2005, in the so often-recalled Stoiber period.
This is due to the modernisation that the CSU has consistently implemented in this country, which is eating away at its parents.
Sociologists have been predicting this for 40 years, but they were very wrong in their pace. Yet secularization, education outcomes, the resettlement of Germans from the east and north in bavaria's emerging regions could not be without consequences for csu voters' loyalty.
Modernisation is linked to the growth of possibilities, which also has visible political consequences.
The right-wing camp is intact, only the voters within it have become more confident, more critical, more willful.
It is also clear that in recent weeks the CSU has moved the most away from the classical civic classes; people in a free profession, sole traders, individuals with a high school diploma and a university education.
By doing so, CSU support has already shrunk below 40 percent.
Die Presse (diepresse.com)
The conservative Viennese daily, in its article entitled "Who, With Whom? Party leaders are reticent about coalition issues" attention to the confused internal political situation arising from the Austrian elections.
The SPÖ wishes to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The ÖVP forestes the interference of the SPÖ in its internal affairs.
The BZÖ seems open to all negotiations, the Greens do not want to negotiate a coalition yet.
The elections are over, now everything revolves around the coalition; in a debate held on public television, party leaders did not get much insight into their cards.
SPÖ President Werner Faymann confirmed his wish to negotiate with the ÖVP.
And the SPÖ wants to show that cooperation between the two parties is certainly possible - it exists in some Länder and in social partnerships.
Faymann left open the question of whether he could imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current chairman of the ÖVP, as vice-chancellor.
As he put it, the Schüssel-Molterer course was out of the vote at all times.
Repeating this direction is not an option.
Molterer reacted cautiously to the red offers.
As he said, cooperation will certainly not be successful if Faymann tries to meddl in the internal affairs of the ÖVP.
Whether his party chooses the opposition or enters a coalition is still open in the party, these issues need to be discussed decisively within the ÖVP.
BZÖ President Jörg Haider once again appeared open in all directions.
"To prevent a red-and-black coalition, we are ready to take on government responsibility," Haider said.
Járóková: The vicious circle of poverty and segregation must be broken
The European Equality Summit, hosted this year by France, the current Presiding State of the European Union, began in Paris today.
Lívia Járóková, a Member of the European People's Party for the Fidesz movement, as one of the main speakers of the expert review in her message addressed to the plenary, has turned her attention to segregation in education, as it is one of the most serious injustices affecting Roma children and, moreover, the most serious obstacle to their application.
Xavier Bertrand, The French Minister for Labour and Social Affairs, and Vladimir Špidla, European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities, opened the summit on behalf of the French Presidency.
The meeting was among the invited representatives of governments, European social partners, the most important European rights organisations and civil associations active in the field of equal opportunities.
According to the press office of the Fidesz Járóková GROUP of MEPs, she pointed out that, in addition to the discrimination that occurs in recruitment, Roma are being pushed out of the European labour market mainly because of their low education.
"The vast majority of young Roma do not have a secondary education, and due to the poor quality of primary education, only a tiny part of them can achieve a higher level of education."
Járóková also stressed that education as a fundamental human right plays a key role in the exercise of other human rights.
Investing in early education for Roma children can mean strengthening the economies of the Member States of the European Union.
According to the Member, it is necessary to confirm the awareness of this connection in the broadest circles - between Roma and non-Roma children.
The sooner a Roma student starts school, the greater his chance of becoming a productive member of the labour market; through income taxes and excise duties, contribute to the national budget.
"Roma have the right to their European Union citizenship to ensure the right to quality education and to guarantee the elimination of their poor quality and separate education," said Lívia Járóková.
According to the Member, the coherence of the European Union, with an emphasis on objectives and negotiations, is needed in order to speed up the processes of school desegregation immediately, and proper compliance with existing and planned anti-discrimination regulations is of paramount importance.
"The vicious circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment must be broken, roma children must be given the opportunities given democratic space so that they can participate as full citizens in the future of Europe," Járóková demanded.
In the sign of the 'European Year of Equal Opportunities', everyone is guaranteed the objective of the European Equality Summit, held annually since last year's meeting in Berlin, to provide a separate forum to help achieve the objectives of equality and the elimination of discrimination, set out at european and national level.
Fox in the chicken coop
Life and health insurance companies in America often reject the possibility of signing an insurance contract with a candidate based on people's data on drug purchases.
Data protection experts fear that the data market will become uncontrollable.
'There is a data protection programme which binds the use of prescription data in any case to the authorisation of the person concerned.
It has to be in the hands of someone independent, otherwise we entrust the chicken coop to a fox," the Washington Post quotes Richard Dick, author of a program designed to monitor prescriptions.
Insurance companies make premiums and amounts paid in the event of claims dependent on the health status of candidates and, if the risk is assessed as too great, they will not even take out insurance with it.
Previously, they sent the people for medical examinations and only contracted when they knew their results.
Ten years ago, Dick devised a much cheaper procedure: based on the identification number, the customer easily finds out from pharmacies what drugs the person has bought in the last year and a half, from which the program itself infers what disease it suffers from and what its state of health is.
For example, if he regularly buys a large amount of cholesterol lowering drugs, it refers to the fact that he has virtually uncontrollably high blood fat levels, which immediately put him in a category with a higher risk.
There are several versions of the program in circulation, some of which also determine the risk factor, so that the insurance company has almost no work left besides paperwork, although minor difficulties arise.
Among the disadvantages is that some drugs can be used for several purposes, some compounds are, for example, usable against migraine or hot flashes, but they are also effective against depression.
These represent an important risk-increasing factor from the point of view of commercial insurance companies, whereas the former do not.
In order to request and process the data, special companies have been set up to ask the patient's permission before they can obtain the necessary information from pharmacies.
They are now being forced to do so by the authorities, even if they have not been punished for their negligence so far.
Recently, some companies have been processing the results of laboratory examinations, which they combine with data on the medicines used, thanks to which they are able to provide an even more accurate picture of the health of patients.
More and more companies have access to the data, while controlling their use will become increasingly difficult.
There is a special health data protection law, but its effectiveness applies only to health service providers and insurance companies.
The bill, which will give authorities the power to control even businesses specializing in data provision, is before Congress.
Richard Dick acknowledges that this is not enough: that is why he has developed his programme so that the transfer of data is linked to the explicit consent of the person concerned.
Another thing is that it can hardly deny the permission in question, otherwise the insurance companies will not conclude a contract with it.
So the hens are somewhat reliated on fox's goodwill after all.
CSU: temporary pardon
The fate of the late duo Huber-Beckstein will be decided at the end of October
Despite the shameful electoral debacle, the debate on personal issues has so far been adjourned by the leaders of the Bavarian CSU.
Party chairman Erwin Huber and provincial Prime Minister Günther Beckstein can still remain in their seats, the question is when this pardon will last.
The fate of the tandem, which suffered a disastrous 17 percent loss of votes, will be decided on the last weekend of October by an extraordinary party congress.
In any case, the members of the much-criticized duo said they would not cling to their positions with all their might.
They tried to reassure angry members of the faction and base, who demanded personal consequences the day after the "Bavarian tsunami" due to the loss of an absolute majority.
Five years ago - true, still at the height of Edmund Stoiber's career - the Christian Social Union gained 60.7 percent, but now, a year after the coup against Stoiber, its strength was only 43.4 percent.
The CSU has been a "self-government" in Bavaria, producing 18 percent of Germany's GDP, for 46 years.
While conservatives in the southern federal state, which is crucial to the Hungarian economy, remain in a high position, they will in any case be forced into a coalition in the future.
One of the first signs of reorganization within the party is that deputy and federal Agriculture Minister Horst Seehofer, who is considered a possible successor to Huber, will also be a member of the narrow intelligence team that will begin probing negotiations on a possible coalition between the Munich government and the liberal FDP, or the right-leaning Free Voters group.
Ironically, Gabriele Pauli, who was used by the Huber-Beckstein duo to stage a coup against Stoiber, entered the House of Commons on the Free Voters list, but then made a ruthlessly short process with an ambitious municipal politician.
CSU leaders are now concentrating all their energies on how to stabilize Beckstein.
Stoiber, who has so far been a stringer behind the scenes, will also play an active role in the transition period, calling September 28 the most bitter day of his political career.
On Monday, Huber made some snid remarks to the CDU, which he said would have earned much more support from his sister party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted the defeat as a warning to the CDU and Angela Merkel.
After the Bundestag elections in September 2009, Merkel will not be able to become chancellor unless the CSU, which played a major role in the national success of 2005, somehow get back on its feet together.
According to Merkel, who has struggled to hide her disappointment because of the fiasco, the loss of CSU positions will not have a negative impact on Berlin's grand coalition.
Which, of course, is relative: treating a wounded CSU will not be easier, and the Social Democrats' crisis continues.
The SPD achieved its weakest result in Bavaria with 18.6 percent since 1946.
Lukashenko:opposition - 110:0
Not a single opposition MP made it to the Belarusian parliament in Sunday's elections.
According to Russian observers, this can be explained by the prosperity and stability of the country led by Alexander Lukashenko, but according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), the illegality that occurred in the counting of votes.
The OSCE, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognise the elections.
Although the 110-member legislature of the 10-million-strong country has been lacking the opposition well for a decade, the opposition, grouped under the name of the United Democratic Forces (ODS), seriously hoped before yesterday's elections that Lukashenko, who had his presidential mandate restored for the fourth time by changing the constitution in 2006, would "allow" several opposition MPs to appear in parliament this time.
The ODS also abandoned the previously considered boycott.
Against the backdrop of opposition expectations, Belarus - which has taken credit for Russia's ever-increasing natural gas imports and contributed to Beltransgaz, which owns gas pipelines passing through the country , embeding russia's increasingly expensive natural gas imports - wanted to improve relations with the European Union, where beltransgaz, which is rated as anti-democratic Lukashenko and other high-ranking politicians, is not getting entry permits.
The release previously pointed out that the OSCE had emphasized positive shifts in the assessment of the election campaign, not shortcomings - such as a ban on a third of opposition candidates.
But Monday's OSCE flash report already had reservations about a campaign in which opposition candidates were essentially unable to appear in the press, especially the opposition's inauce of a vote count.
At the same time, according to the opposition, there is an improvement in the political system: political prisoners have been released, and Minsk is willing to engage in smaller confrontations with Moscow by continuing to refuse to recognize the breakaway South Ossetia and Abkhazi from Georgia, even though Russia, with which Belarus is a union state on paper, has considered the two territories independent for a month.
"We have taken two steps forward and one step back, but the most important thing is that dialogue between Belarus and the EU has begun," Aleksandr Milinkevich told our newspaper.
According to the opposition candidate from the 2006 presidential election, it is desirable that this should remain so, even though "the power was afraid to go into the meaningless parliament of a single member of the opposition."
Looking at the results, the opposition is not planning protests, but rather trying to deliver its message to voters about the need for economic reforms.
"Of course, we have a lot of problems with this, we have to print opposition papers in Russia, local authorities are putting obstacles to distribution, but I still see that more and more people, even among the elderly, support change," Milinkevich said, pointing out that the Lukashenko regime, which considers the creation of social security to be its greatest success, does not consider the most officially supported class of pensioners to be right or officially supported.
"Due to the country's indebtedness and the growth of the trade deficit, it is only a matter of time before social security 'induces the silence of the cemetery' collapses," milinkevich says.
Unlike the opposition politician, Russian observers rated the elections as democratic.
Sergei Lebedev, head of mission of the Commonwealth of Independent States, told Russian news agency Ria Novosti that "people do not believe in words, but in actions", so the absence of opposition is nothing more than proof of the maturity of Belarusian voters.
Marseille Global Menu
European Union and India double trade turnover
As the European Union and India are each other's leading trading partners, this topic has dominated the agenda of the ninth summit, among other, largely global, issues.
Today, a Franco-Indian summit will also be held, focusing primarily on cooperation in the field of atomic energy.
The European Union recognises that India is an emerging democratic power that should be given more opportunity to speak in international affairs, but member countries have so far failed to find a common denominator in promoting New Delhi's continued membership of the UN Security Council.
This issue was not even discussed further at yesterday's ninth summit, held in Marseille.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy, as the current President of the Union, and José Manuel Barroso, President of the European Commission, respectively, and Javier Solana, the High Representative for Foreign Policy, welcomed Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, with whom they also agreed that trade turnover would double, or rise to more than €100 billion, within five years.
Given that between 2000 and 2007 the exchange of goods increased from 25 billion to 55 billion, this is not an overly ambitious target.
In a sign of this, twenty-six existing bilateral agreements with India on civil aviation have been legally harmonised, so that air transport has also been given the green light for the future.
By the end of 2009, India would like to sign a free trade agreement with the Union.
Sarkozy promised that negotiations would be speeded up.
The aim is to balance the books, while the EU is India's first trading partner, with New Delhi ranked ninth among EU partners.
The summit also paid attention to global issues.
The situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan, or terrorism - condemned by both sides in all its forms and called for an urgent convening of the UN conference.
They also called for the end of the Doha Round of trade negotiations, although both have a large part in its failure so far.
The European Union has confirmed that it will insist on its energy and climate programme, namely that it would like to reduce emissions of harmful substances by at least 20% by 2020.
India also agreed, as did india, with the need to conclude a global agreement at next year's climate conference and reduce greenhouse gas production by 50% by 2050.
Both sides would also like to prevent food prices from rising and support convening an international conference to analyse the financial crisis.
India's prime minister will travel to the French capital today, where he is preparing to conclude a deal on the peaceful use of atomic energy at a bilateral meeting.
Paris believes french firms will be entrusted with the mandate to build India's 20 billion euro nuclear reactors.
According to agency reports, the agreement would be valid for 15 years.
More than 300 Italian publishers in Frankfurt
Large participation of Italian publishers at the International Book Fair in Frankfurt.
More than 300 Italian publishers will attend the 60th edition of Buchmesse, the most important international meeting for the exchange of rights.
The Frankfurt International Book Fair expects more than 7,000 exhibitors from 101 different countries to take up 171,790 square meters of the fair with more than 430,000 titles to see, with Turkey as guest of honor.
Deputy Minister of Culture Francesco Maria Giro will represent the Italian Government at the inaugural ceremony at the Italian Pavilion: Italy will actually participate institutionally with the Italian Centre (Punto Italia) – on 264 square meters of exhibition space.
There will be a meeting with the press at Room Struktur Buchmesse in Pavilion 5.0: it will be an opportunity to present numbers, tendencies and perspectives in terms of the state of publishing in Italy.
According to the data, the importance of books by foreign authors in relation to the total Italian production is still diminishing, mainly due to literature for children and adults.
Brunetta: "From now on breakfast before work"
It is the first time in the history of Chigi Palace that revolving doors have been introduced when staff arrive and leave.
But from now on, this new measure will work against cunning people, against those who inject and then go for coffee during working hours.
The anti-sloth news was announced today by The Minister for Public Administration, Renato Brunetta, and the Secretary General of the Presidential Council, Mauro Masi.
"Revolving doors - says Brunetta - are a tool for better work, better performance, more attendance and more services" says the Minister.
"Now a new era of accountability and transparency will open up.
This is reformism," says Brunetta.
With chigi palace, we will complete the introduction in all buildings of the Council Presidency.
For Masi, "the choice of revolving door is also important from a symbolic point of view."
There were no objections from the employees, assures the Secretary-General: 'This was a joint procedure with the staff and the cooperation of all'.
In short, no more breakfast during working hours; no more coffee and croissant.
Brunetta smiles and says, "there's nothing better than a proper cappuccino at 7:00 in the morning."
During a conference at the Higher Vocational School for Public Administration
in Rome, the Minister will eventually announce that within three months the absence of public employees for the disease has decreased by 50%, that is, 60,000 more people a year at work".
He will add that italian public administration needs to become more powerful
"its payroll dynamics – the minister explains – have doubled in the last 8-10 years relative to the private sector and are far higher than the inflation rate".
Meanwhile, thousands of public employees have come to reject the standards of brunett's decree in line with a request supported by Codacons.
"While the Minister for Public Administration will today present figures on the lower absence from work due to illness – the Consumer Protection Association writes – the nation of 'diligent sloths' is constantly growing.
In Italy, we have thousands of productive and correct public servants who have gathered to declare war on the illegitimate standards contained in the decree".
Tara will be protested primarily against the exclusion of sickness allowances, which depend on activity; extending the period during which the sick person can be checked within what time limit control visits will be carried out and against other standards included in the new ministerial provisions.
Accidents at work, Napolitano: "Resolute prevention"
Every day, there are 2,500 accidents at work in Italy, three people die and 27 remain permanently disabled.
Inail figures confirm that in 2007 we have about 1,200 deaths due to accidents at work.
These figures show the seriousness of the phenomenon, which remains one of the main causes of death and causes almost twice as many deaths as murders.
To re-attract the attention of institutions, social and information on this dramatic problem, Anmil is celebrating the 58th National Day of Victims of Accidents at Work in all Regions of Italy today, set for the second Sunday in October.
"The disturbing data disseminated by Anmil and the same tragic news of these days confirm the importance of the issue of occupational safety," confirms Pietro Mercandelli, President of the Republic, in a message sent to the President of Anmil, the National Association for the Crippled and Disabled for Work.
The Head of State expresses his vivid admiration for the continued joint efforts for security in jobs, for the protection of injured workers, for helping the families of the victims and for the participation of public opinion.".
"Naturally, an outraged 'enough' has been raised, sincerely shared in the face of tragedies that, in their scale, cause a stir in the media and public opinion participation, but the everyday reality once again offers us dramatic cases, even repetitive in its dynamics".
Napolitano does not hide that "there is undoubtedly a resource problem: it is crucial to invest in training and information.
The numerous initiatives promoted in the field of education are of particular importance in order to give young people facing the world of work a clearer awareness.
It is necessary to draw attention to this phenomenon, not to give up because of its worrying social importance, to apply and improve legislative standards.
Gianfranco Fini, president of the chamber, stressed from his side "how the phenomenon of death from an accident at work creates an absolutely critical social state, insults the conscience of each of us and forces all institutions to make a convincing effort towards the necessary end to this situation."
"As far as accident data are concerned, they seem to show some positive turnaround, but this does not deny that the number of deaths resulting from accidents at work is alarming anyway," said Anmilu President Pietro Mercandelli.
"We wouldn't want this "reduction effort" to lead to less attention, because just as the attention stops, tragedy breaks out.
"We believe that in general too little is being done to stop the problem of accidents, and there are many activities that may have an impact on this problem.
It is essential, in our opinion - Mercandelli stressed - to increase controls and inspections, but also to intervene more strongly in the field of staff training, right from school age'.
"Further efforts are needed - he added - in terms of communication and public participation.
But what is needed is a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers towards a phenomenon that constitutes an exceptional social phenomenon .".
Mercandelli eventually said it was a progressive degeneration of the levels of compensation rights envisaged for work victims and the "postponed support care" that the system has been receiving in recent years."
"So the goal is to give the worker back the insurance guarantee - he added - because the fate of those who get hurt must not depend on spontaneity or endowment from time to time by the legislator".
Mp3 players accused of putting hearing at risk
Listening to loud music for a long time and using portable music devices like Mp3 players can cause permanent hearing damage.
According to a notice published today by the European Commission, which quotes in an official report in Brussels the opinion of the Committee on Health Risks, which has recently arisen and been identified (Csrseri) by the European Union.
"From this scientific opinion – we read in the notes – it follows that 5-10% of those who listen to music with portable music devices for at least five years, more than an hour a day per week and keep the device at high volume, risk permanent loss of hearing ability".
"I am concerned that such a large number of young people who use often portable music devices and mobile phones at high acoustic levels can unknowingly damage their hearing in an irreparable way," admits Meglena Kuneva.
"The scientific findings – the leader continues – indicate a clear risk and a response is needed quickly.
Most importantly, we need to encourage consumers and make this information public.
We must continue to re-examine existing control systems in the light of this scientific finding in order to make them fully effective and to keep pace with the new technology'.
Brussels has asked the Independent Scientific Committee to investigate the problem, given the high use of portable musical instruments and the growing number of young people exposed to noise of this origin.
"Scientists – concluded by an Executive Officer of the European Union – confirm that there is a need to be concerned, and now the European Commission, together with the other members and parties that raised the issue, will examine what measures could possibly be put in place to better protect children and young people from exposure to noise from portable music equipment and similar devices".
There is currently a Safety European standard that limits the noise level of portable musical instruments to 100 dB, but there are growing concerns about hearing damage that may be caused by excessive exposure to similar forms of noise.
It is possible to greatly reduce these damages by looking for solutions such as reducing the level and duration of exposure.
In its opinion, the Scientific Committee of the European Union states that users of portable musical instruments, if they use loud music (more than 89 decibels) for only five hours a week, exceed the currently applicable limits corresponding to the maximum permitted noise in the workplace.
Those who listen to music in such conditions for a longer period of time risk permanent hearing loss after five years.
This problem should affect 5-10% of users of such devices, and their amount can be calculated between 2.5 and 10 million people in the Eu.
Rome, Alemanno leave commission open for future of capital
Today we start, we close in March, in June we will have sums.
Such is the calendar given by Campidoglio to the workers of the "Commission for the Future of the Capital of Rome", which met this morning at its new headquarters behind the Caracalla Baths.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and 49 other members of the commission will draw up manuals for Rome.
When the doors are closed in March, Giunta and the municipal council will evaluate the analyses and projects so that in June they can present a strategic plan for Rome with the "official stamp" of Campidoglio and his councillor Gianni Alemann.
"The Commission is completely independent and includes all political, social and cultural ideas – alemanno wants to emphasise – it will have to secure proposals for the development of Rome, which will eventually be used by the political arbitrators that remain Giunta e Municipal Council.
This is not an exchange of functions, but merely an attempt to have a place to process a large project for Rome.
Work will be completed in March and then dissolved, because this institution must have an exact timeframe.
In June , the mayor announces, we will present a strategic plan and use the work done by the Commission for the Future of the Capital of Rome".
But Alemanno replies to those who accuse the Commission of being useless, given that its opinions will not be binding: "It all depends on the work that the Commission will be able to do and the quality of their proposals.
If they are of good quality, as the Commission's Proposals at Attali, and I am sure of that in Rome, its contribution will be decisive.
Too often, politics is sming on the daily problems and the urgency that occur from time to time.
We, on the contrary, want to look longer and further, in a deeper perspective , to work seriously on the development of Rome and its future.
In addition, the Mayor of Rome wants to stress that 'this Commission is neither an unnecessary enterprise nor a bluff: it is completely free, it will not cost Roman citizens a euro and will serve to think and engage the best intelligence that the capital has'.
For Alemann, in essence, "it is necessary to have a strategic sketch as a starting point, neither definitive nor immobile, in order to allow our city an authentic ascent at the level it desperately needs and to think with a unified spirit about its future."
The future, which, the mayor of Rome states, "will not only be confined to the current municipal borders, but will look much further" not only in the optics of the future metropolitan city and its legal status as capital, but "will also include the role that Rome can and must play as the capital of Europe and the Mediterranean."
Obama? First anti-American president. We already know why
One well-known US president wrote that it was important for him to remain independent: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president."
The first was Jimmy Carter, who, through his decisions, decimated the US economy and maintained relations (both today as a private citizen) with the enemy Islam."
Attacks against Obama are mounting just as the election date approaches.
One lady from Miami wrote on the website: "This man is full of ambition.
But Obama has imperience: he thinks he's going to make it to the highest office of a nation that had two governors and five black senators!".
In fact, these attacks don't say much"; these are attacks of unequivocally racial origin and do not answer voters' questions: will he be a good president? And then we have surveys; Everyone says Obama is going to win, and by a big margin.
Even in this case, there are those who act according to the heart and not the brain.
A newspaper in Mississippi, in the bowels of the southern United States, wrote a commentary: at least once in the voting booth, we know well who an American patriot will vote for.
One aspect of the American mentality that remained sky-long until the last moment will come out.
Say what you want, eventually we'll take care of it ourselves, who to tick, obama or mccain".
There are people who swear: if Obama were to win, we would leave America.
These are things that have never been said before, it seems almost certain that a black candidate will succeed.
But for all these considerations for Democrats, George Bush is the primary weapon.
They asked 1,500 people: what mistakes did Bush make during his mandate? Eighty-nine percent responded: Iraq.
America is changing.
In Vietnam, this nation lost 50,000 soldiers and was sent home with kicks in the ass.
In Iraq, 4,500 soldiers were killed and the Americans were not forced to pack up.
And yet Iraq became Bush's weakness for most.
Whoever takes Georgia W's place will have a huge task to do.
Journalists have also felt the ECONOMIC COLLAPSE of the US: there is an investigation period in the newspapers. And many blame the Internet, the "killer" of printed media.
The PEW Research Center asked 500 journalists about the state of their profession and the assumption about the future.
Well, today, almost all journalists are pessimistic about their future.
However, the respondents did not openly say that they had less to worry about credibility.
They don't feel isolated like they used to.
The problem for American journalists is money, the money.
For these journalists, the crisis of 2008 is a crisis of a broken economic model.
More than that, the cuts made to the newsroom, the room where the editors work to put together the paper, are a huge problem.
According to the journalists interviewed, this is a problem that needs to be resolved if we do not want traditional journalism, as understood by the general public, to change fundamentally.
A clear but complex pessimism permeates American journalists.
Six out of 10 press journalists and senior executives believe that journalism is going the wrong way nationally.
In the local area, the executive group is at 65%.
Printed against broadcast.
It's not difficult for journalists to see where the site is going.
Larger publishing houses are paving the way for the Internet, which many see as a "killer" of printed media.
The "economic pressure" highlighted by journalists has increased by as much as 79%.
Five hundred journalists surveyed admitted that they were resorting to technology in the hope that it would "do something good" for their journalism.
The biggest gap in American journalism is between those who run newsrooms – that is, executives – and the reporters who work for them.
56% of national leaders are confident that their reporters share their values, while at the local level the figure drops to 23%.
This has something to do with "job security" for someone.
Managers who think they will lose their jobs within three years are at 47% nationally.
As far as journalists are concerned, they're at 30%.
When it comes to "certain work" regarding staff (our editors, ndr) in America, it is still the order of the day.
Only 13% of journalists work on a contract.
In a nation as vast as the United States, with a population of 300 million and thousands of newspapers, magazines, radios, TV, and the Internet, employers often offer what they want, so it's a question of taking or letting them go.
Executives almost always get huge salaries, and an editor can earn as much as $10,000 a month in addition to paying for his pension and insurance.
As regards holidays, the argument is complicated: a certain number of days after the first year, a certain number of days after the third year up to reaching fifteen days after a certain number of years.
But American journalists, by their own admission, often get sick within a year.
It is only a matter of climate.
UNIPOL: COURT IN ROME, DANILO COPPOLA REMAINS IN GROTTAFERRATA
The president of the Second Criminal Chamber of the Rome Court, Carmelo Rinaudo, decided to reject the submission of real estate entrepreneur Daniel Coppola, who asked to be moved from his city, Grottaferrata, to an apartment in Rome.
Coppola is under investigation for bankruptcy in connection with a counter-bid to sell Unipol-Bnl.
During the trial at his own expense, he was released from house arrest last week, which was converted into a forced permanent residence in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni e Gaetano Pecorella, have requested that the real estate entrepreneur be able to change his whereabouts from a rural town to the capital.
However, according to the court, this move (which the PM opposed) would allow him to influence his company and access the evidence that immed him.
Elites in danger
This phenomenon emerged a few days ago, when the House of Representatives voted against a $700 billion rescue plan put forward by the White House: a significant portion of Americans were more interested in punishing Wall Street than in saving the economy.
This is confirmed by yesterday's New York Times, which informs us that the current crisis is tearing the Republican Party apart, increasingly divided between its old East Coast soul, softer, welcoming to federal institutions and the business community, and its new soul, which, on the contrary, is conservative, hostile to "those in Washington" and to the world of finance, strong especially in the states of the middle and south.
A soul that has arrogantly manifested itself in the vote I was talking about at the beginning.
But this just-cited thing is merely an example of the changes, big changes that the current economic earthquake is already showing : not only in the United States, but throughout the West, and perhaps not just here.
Both in America and In Europe, this crisis seems to act as an accelerator of the events that have long been incubated, which are tightening in the new climate and finally coming to light.
The first of these events is the re-edification, the extraordinary recovery of the market, the double category state-power in relation to a certain re-nationalization of economics.
Indeed, the crisis is a crisis for financial institutions, which, of course, have strong ties abroad, but which primarily include the budgets of people and families living in a single country, a single state, to the greatest extent.
This has also created a political problem for those who run it: that is, how to respond to the difficulties and protests of people and families who are, among other things, voters.
In short, the crisis seems economically global, but politically almost entirely national.
Political internationality seems to be substantially out of the question, or that it has little to add: the obvious evidence has been given by the European Union, which, as always, is divided between different interests and different national strategies, and which cannot opt for one common political line.
And so everyone expects the intervention of the government of each individual state, rescue plans, market recovery, new rules and, above all, the distribution of funds: at the moment we get into a state of crisis, only states have the economic resources, the amount of financial resources to be able to try to put everything right.
And they also possess the necessary means and authorisations to use them: two sources of immense value, in certain circumstances that perhaps no market and no international organisation will ever be able to possess to a similar extent.
Moreover, this new emphasis, which the crisis places on a state-national element, is in full compliance with the increasing importance that the latest economic advances are trying to attribute to one factor closely linked to it: territorial jurisdiction.
Paradoxically, while we were convinced that we had entered the kingdom of the sita, increasingly sophisticated technology, immaterial, while we were convinced that global finance was already destined to rule the world, all of a sudden we realised that our future would have to deal with little intangent things like water, grain, diesel.
All things that would have been said can be transported from one place on earth to another, but they are in any case connected, absolutely, to a bounded space, territory.
So, whoever becomes their ruler certainly has a lot more cards up their sleeve than who isn't, and who's unlucky enough to live in a place without grain, without oil, and without water.
I come to the second novelty, which, however, foreseses a turning point.
Those who talk about territory, state, government inevitably talk about politics, that is, leadership.
Taking into account the economic crisis, two convergent phenomena appear to be forming.
On the one hand, the realization that there is an objective need for authoritarian leadership, a request for someone who can seize the situation.
On the other hand, a wave of discreditedness towards existing leadership, especially economic leadership, has proved equally unsatisfactory and full of dark places.
And together, something even deeper and, in a sense, disturbing: discreditedness, impatience, a sense of incompetence and absence that seeks to dominate the entire ruling class in more and more Western countries.
For their actions seem to be increasingly spreading in the broad masses of the population of conviction, rather than their actions being the same as those of the hitherto popular elite, as their way of feeling and being, as their culture in the true sense of the word, that the elite has already surpassed its time and is indifferent to the views of the majority.
The demand for leadership simply feeds one branch from the underground, but a strong movement to eliminate the ruling classes and traditional political order is manifested in unexpected electoral "resistance" or unexpected changes in collective sentiment in recent and recent times, from the conservative rise in Austria-Bavaria to the fall of Labour in the UNITED Kingdom, to the rebellion of US congressmen against Bush (and perhaps the victory of the right in Italy).
We have the impression that traditional elites, their parties, their programmes, but also their ceremonies, their newspapers, their accredited intelligence, some would say their format, are having increasing problems to understand, that is, to represent, which, not from today, is being created in the deep layers of Western societies, and that the economic crisis is strengthening again, growing, potentially over-cloading.
Before this, it would be an exaggeration to talk about a permanent "mass musing".
But I'm sure we can't say that means keep your eyes open.
Super glue to walk on walls
Overcome the laws of gravity with super glue and in the future walk the walls like Spiderman.
This is the object of various American research centers, and now a team of four institutes has come very close to it.
Scientists managed to keep the 100-kilogram body glued to the vertical wall using a sticker of only 2.5 square centimeters.
STUDY – The American journal Science has published the discoveries of some researchers at the University of Dayton, Akton, the Georgia Institute of Technology, and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material, invented by a team of researchers, is the development of materials that already exist that use a special carbon structure called carbon dwarf pipes.
Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta explains the basis of the glue as a series of pipes laid out like an orderly pile of spaghetti.
Scientists were inspired by the legs of the gecko, covered with microscopic hairs that allow the animal to ensure perfect adcing.
Tests carried out on various materials such as glass, Teflon and glass paper have shown that the new glue is ten times stronger than the feet of these reptiles and at the same time "simply peels off the wall" explains Liming Dai, a researcher at the University of Daytona School of Engineering.
WALK ON WALLS? -"This material could be useful as a makeshift glue" adds Liming Dai.
Walking on walls like Spiderman, perhaps? Perhaps so, but researchers are thinking of a far less fascinating use as a combination of electrical instruments, because dwarf carbon pipes are conductors of heat and electricity.
Other applications could relate to aerospace engineering .
No super heroes yet.
MORE RESEARCH – The University of Berkeley, California, is also researching new glue.
In an article in the Journal of the American Chemical Society, California scientists presented micro-fiber glue as hair that cleans itself of dust by moving around the surface to maintain perfect adjamination.
Medicines: never with juices
Watch out for grapefruit, orange and apple juice.
If you take these drinks, which are consumed mainly in the summer, because they are refreshing and full of vitamins, along with some life-saving drugs, their ingestion changes the intensification or decrease in effectiveness with serious health consequences.
For David Bailey, a professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, to highlight the risks of juices both ready and fresh in combination with the ingestion of certain drugs, at the american chemical society's 263rd National Meeting in Philadelphia, it raises a new alarm: just one glass of grapefruit, orange, and apple juice is enough to reduce the absorption of some life-saving drugs, to void their beneficial effects and put patients' health at risk.
Grapefruit juice has already been accused of being responsible for increasing to toxic levels the effects of certain antiaritmic drugs, antibiotics, anxiolitics, antihistamine and neurological drugs.
MEDICINES AT RISK– The Italian Medical Agency itself announced this in a newsletter two years ago, arousing doctors and patients not to underestimate the dangers of the mixture and to pay attention to what they drink when they take drugs, such as Diazepam or Methadone.
NOT ONLY GRAPEFRUIT – According to experts, orange and apple juice also contain substances that dampen the drugs.
A long list of effects dampened by grapefruit and other juices.
Hence the call of Michele Carruba, director of the pharmacology department of The State University of Milan: "Such discoveries are usually immediately reported to various international and national pharmacy agencies, which will eventually arrange and exchange drug information instructions.
So always read the illustrative tickets of the medicines you get and if you come across something vague, do not get upset, but ask your doctor or pharmacist for clarification» stressed an expert for Ansa.
Nobel for Economics to Paul Krugman
The Nobel Prize was awarded to American Paul Krugman for his studies of commercial models and localization of economic activities.
Krugman is a 55-year-old NewKen who teaches at Priceton University and is a well-known editor of the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the most important critics of the Bush administration's foreign, economic, and policy actions.
A few months after the September 2001 bombings, in the days after Enron went bankrupt, Krugman predicted in a commentary published in the New York Times that the second event would be far more important than the first in terms of the consequences of the history of the United States.
A prediction that caused a lot of controversy and which had been reproached for years, but which turned out to be accurate.
"I am surprised and shocked at the speed with which collapses like Enron and Worldcom have disappeared from the public interest," Krugman said in late 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi of the Central European Bank's Executive Committee, Krugman is "an economist of great importance," but also a popularizer who has a "very aggressive style, especially critical of the excesses of the Bush liberal administration."
Open Office, we have the third edition of the "anti-Microsoft" package
It's Open Office.org 3.0, an open source personal manufacturing package that aims to reach more and more users, from home to office, from experts to public administration, as a free alternative to the better-known Microsoft Office.
After about a year's work by volunteers, controlled by SUN Microsystem, the new Open Office is showing the general public with various innovations: additional, much more substantial ones will be added to the welcome screen and to the revised and improved opening window, such as compatibility for the Apple Mac OS X operating system and support for the new Open Document Format (ODF) 1.2, the latest standard version of ISO.
The emphasis is also on working with the Office 2007 package, open Office is able to open the document with the new Microsoft extension (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
Interesting are the special features of some models, such as what allows you to reduce the dimensions of a PowerPoint presentation, useful for example for transmission electronically, or the ability to transfer a PDF folder to a graphic design model and preserve the original appearance of the page.
Still from this point of view, we can create documents "PDF hybrids" that resemble typical Adobe graphics and have the properties of a spreadsheet or text program.
Collaboration is an element that has received many improvements within application programs: in Excel, it is possible to work together between different users and avoid conflicts on changes, in a text program, each collaborator is assigned one color to comments to make identification clearer in the revision phase.
Some businesses are also working to transfer some Open Office features to the Web (on the cloud), and should re-create a definitive result in the coming weeks.
The Italian version can be downloaded at http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html, it has been added to the English version, which has been on the mirror since Friday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, as usual, the package is also available for linux operating system.
Also, the installation CD can be sent home or to the workplace on request.
And if the free topic can be a draw to expand in homes, it is the Open Office business area that the package is betting a lot, and it can already count on various projects implemented in public administration and schools.
And there are also offers of training, consulting and assistance services ideal for small and medium-sized companies, which could open up business perspectives.
Open Office consists of five main models: Writer, for video writing replacing Word; Calc is a spreadsheet that aims to replace Excel; Impress for PowerPoint-like presentations; Dbase, as in the case of the more famous Access, is a program that allows you to work on databases; Draw, after all, is a graphic model.
The goal for 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads, and considering that to date we are at almost 3 million and 600 thousand, with the release of a new version, it is possible that this expected number can be surpassed.
Kohl's results are also positive, it's the fourth case of doping
A new positive case at the last Tour de France: the Austrian Bernhard Kohl, from the Gerolsteiner team, the third- classified and winner of the best climber's T-shirt.
The report was quoted by the L'Equipe newspaper.
The 26-year-old Kohl is the fourth racer positive for Cero, a third-generation Epo, after Italians Riccardo Riccò and Leonardo Piepoli and German Stefan Schumacher, as well as him from Gerolsteiner.
Kohl's blood sample results fall into those carried out in recent weeks by the Losanna and Chatenay-Malabra laboratories.
If the inspection analyses confirm the positivity on Cera, the Austrian will lose third place on the Tour and face two years of disqualification.
The report on Kohl's positivity at the Third Generation Epo is confirmed by pierre bordry, the head of the French anti-doping agency, who told the Associated Press that he had already informed austrian government authorities of the result.
The 26-year-old Austrian placed on the podium behind Spaniard Carlos Sastra and American Cadel Evans, and also won the polka dot T-shirt of the best climber.
IMMIGRANTS:THE NEW YORK TIMES ASKS, IS ITALY A RACIST?
Italy "as an emigrant country has only recently been transformed into a priority destination for immigrants" adopted with resistance.
Does this turn a beautiful country into a nation of racists? That's how they're asked in a long New York Times article that devoted this article to a debate on racism in Italy, and began with the case of a young Abdul William Guibre, originally from Burkina Faso, killed last month in Milan for stealing a box of cookies.
This case highlights what the New York Times defines as the "paradox of the North": the northern regions are at the same time those where "more integration and more work" are registered, but also "the strongest anti-immigrant sentiment in the country and the strongest support for the Northern League."
To confirm the rising tensions between Italians and immigrants, the NYT cites cases of intolerance from Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampina and Castel Volturna.
Not only that.
The new legislation required by Lego, which seeks to curb immigration and facilitate the exholation of illegal immigrants, is also cited as an example of the changing climate in Italy.
A tendency highlighted by both the Pope and the President of the Republic: "Giorgio Napolitano, after meeting Benedict XVI in Quirinale, asked that the state and the church work together to defeat racism."
Plane found of Steve Fossett, millionaire who disappeared a year ago
The rest of the plane of Steve Fossett, a millionaire who disappeared on September 3, 2007 while flying over the nevada airbase, was found.
The debris was discovered on a plateau at an altitude of 3,000 meters, in the Mammoth Lakes area of the Sierra Nevada, on the california-Nevada border.
However, there were no human remains inside the aircraft.
Madera County Sheriff John Anderson dispelted the doubts that remained: "The plane was found, we sent a team there, and now we're sure it's exactly what Steve Fossett was flying on the day he disappeared," he said at a news conference.
The sheriff clarified that no human remains were found on the plane or in the surrounding area.
The 63-year-old millionaire has been presumed dead since February.
The U.S. Transportation Safety Board (Ntsb) said an investigation team was dispatched hours after the wreckage was identified, eventually identifying the plane: it is exactly the Bellanca 8kcab, missing since September 3, 2007, when Fossett took off from Yerington, Nevada, for a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, still in California, not far from the Nevada border, some of Fossett's personal items were found by a couple near their mammoth lakes home.
These are two documents with Fossett's name on them, both issued by the Illinois Federal Aviation Administration, cash and one jacket.
The search for Fossett was suspended a month after his disappearance.
The billionaire gained a place in history thanks to a long collection of firsts.
In 2002, on his sixth attempt, he became the first man to complete a round-the-world journey in an air balloon: two weeks of flying alone.
Three years later, he circled the world in a plane without landing.
His many records also include flying at an altitude of 15,445 meters, above the Andes, although with a co-ilote.
Glk, the ad you don't expect
One unusual Suv with original design and precisely defined decisive lines, wide surfaces with precise corners.
This is, in short, the last Glk born of the "compact" jeeps of the star's house, with which Mercedes-Benz tried to bring a serptumite of news to this sector.
Thanks to its unconventional workmanship, the communication that will accompany the launch of the Suv Glk, which will be available in Mercedes-Benz showrooms from next October 17, will also be unexpected and unconventional.
In this way, the advertising campaign that will accompany the debut of the new vehicle will also launch an unofficial way of communicating thanks to the futuristic 3D poster campaign, which is thus used for the first time in Italy for the car brand.
The maxi poster project, divided into three different phases, will dominate Milan's main business street, Corso Como, until November 15.
The first phase of this new type of communication will begin with the introduction of the car in stereoscopic vision, and with the help of special glasses that will be distributed near the Corsa Como, it will be possible to see the new Suv in almost real dimensions and in three-dimensional format.
Indeed, when you look at the picture, you will get the impression that the car will come out of the poster.
Then, thanks to the use of innovative Elumina8 technology, the new Glk will be illuminated at different moments in all its little things, so that it will then re-fold into a single image.
Mercedes is undoubtedly trying to introduce something new into the stereotypical area of automotive communication with this ad.
Will he be able to arouse the interest of future customers in this way? We'll see.
Now we know who the Italian hooligans are.
From Trivenet, they're risking Daspo.
Who are the 150-200 boys and girls that Italy is now ashamed of? They are part of the "Ultras Italia" group, which has been following the Nazionale azzurra for years and which, in truth, has never caused excessive problems.
She's never even met her opponent's fans.
The group's orientation is right-wing.
The founders come from Trivenet.
Verona, Padua, Trieste e Udine.
In Sofia, they were joined by groups (in fact, few groups) from Campania and Puglia.
They have tricolor flags that show the cities of origin of those involved: on Saturday evening, they removed them so that they would not be recognized.
They're inspired by English fans.
In Bulgaria, they found real Nazi fans, Levski.
Figc made 144 tickets to the match available to Italian fans: all in their name, easily controllable.
And Viminale actually checked them all: among those who went to Sofia was no one with daslo in progress, no one banned from visiting stadiums.
Four blue fans who had previous stadium violations were denied tickets and banned from the match.
Now Viminale is waiting to read the reports that will come from the Bulgarian police, then he will take action: In this case, it is possible to give Daspo for five years at least to fans who have been arrested or those who have been identified during the riots.
International Daspo, which prohibits visiting not only Italian stadiums, but also throughout Europe.
Our hooligans, in short, won't set foot in a single stadium again.
Lucky.
But now there is a fear of emulation: that is, more than one hundred and fifty will be added to the more.
"We must put out this fire now and not justify those who behave in this way," they confirm from Viminal.
So, "eyes wide open, especially for the national game on Wednesday in Leč".
There's a small core of supporters in Puglia.
Tomorrow the Osservatorio will meet, on Tuesday Casms, which can count on one part of Aise, this is the secret service that is in charge of the problems in the stadiums.
"Choral Leader-Leader and taut arm during Mameli's anthem? It is not a crime in Bulgaria...".
Such is the idea of Domenico Mazzilli (expressed in a really unassus way), who for a few weeks is the director of the Viminál Osservatorio (he got a job that was formerly francesco tagliente and then Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli was formerly the Bursar of Trieste, home to the core of ultras italia supporters, founded in 2002.
It is true, as Mazzilli says, that it is not a crime to glorify a leader in Bulgaria, but of course the behaviour of these 150-200 fans is a disgrace.
"I am not a sociologist - adds Osservator's number one - crimes are attributed to the country in which they took place.
So far, this group has stayed within bounds, now we're going to take a good look at what happened and evaluate it for the future.
But let's also talk about whistling during Mameli's anthem: it's not even a crime, but if you don't mind, it's a ernous thing...".
Students victims of expensive rents - up to 900 euros per room
The renting market for university students knows no crisis.
According to the latest research by Sunia, a union for tenants, renting a single room can cost a student up to 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples, 600 in Rome.
"The phenomenon has already reached such proportions that entire classes of students have lost their right to study because of the overall excessive prices that their families would have to endure – explains Sunia's head of studies, Laura Mariani – in this city, great demand from students has distorted the market in such a way that it has stimulated a process of price increases that has spread to residents".
In most cases, rental offers contain several infractions: free contracts, unregistered, no limited rent, associated sub-leases.
What is needed for Sunji is an extraordinary intervention that could regulate prices through a tax overhaul.
Looking at the details of the research, we will see that in Milan, in the Brianza area, about 450 euros is needed for a single bed, a single room is paid from a minimum price of 650 (Bande Nere zone) to a median value of 800 (Lambiate, Udine and Fiera zone) up to a maximum of 900 (in the Vittoria zone).
In Florence, one bed costs on average 350/400 euros, one room about 700.
In Bologna, where students concentrate in zones near the university, 250/280 euros is required for a bed in a double room, from 370 to 500 in a single room.
In Rome, in the central university zones (San Lorenzo, piazza Bologna) they want about 600 euros for a single room, 450 beds in a double bed.
Values are slightly lower (550 euro for singles) in zones near other universities (Ostiense and Cinecittà).
We will save only if we move to peripheral areas: 300 euros per bed and 450 for a single room zones prenestina, centocelle and the like.
In Naples, a bed is 300/450 euros, a room from 400 to 600 euros, with the highest prices in the Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei zones.
In Bari they want 250/350 euro for a bed, at least 350 for a single room.
In smaller cities, prices are decidedly lower, but they have greater impact on citizens' economies.
In cities like Perugia, where rents for students from outside the European Union are the most common phenomenon, one other anomaly is finally noted: an increase of about 25-30% of the fee they want from foreign students, compared to Italy's.
Farewell to the old Paradiso cinema, cities cancel historic halls
Cinematographic historical halls are closing in favor of the Multiplex.
"A city without cinemas is like blind, it's like a face without eyes."
The painting offered by director Giuseppe Tornator successfully documents what is happening in italy's large urban centres, as well as rural towns.
The process of restricting cinemas, the birth of large multi-rials in the suburbs and the subsequent demise of monosals in the central zones of cities is one of the events that seems inevitable and irreversible, but also has all the hallmarks of true cultural crime.
Often, historical places full of memories disappear," it's as if we lost a friend, a friend with whom we shared a long way and a lot of emotions», the director of Paradiso, the new cinema director, is felt by the director of Paradiso, a film that won tornator an Oscar and a grand jury prize in Cannes 20 years ago, and which told the poetry of a village cinema and sadness about a way of life that cinema probably lost forever.
The values obtained by Anec, the main association of operators, are clear: in the last five years, 316 cinemas of the traditional tip have closed their doors, and the highest bill was paid mainly by halls in the most important cities: 10 less in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 fewer in Torino, 5 in Palermus.
Among the regions most affected by the closures, Emilia-Romagna comes first with the loss of 82 cinema halls, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
And proof that the first responsible for their disappearance is the arrival of the multiplex, these three Italian regions that have registered the highest number of new cinema multi-series: 195 more screens in Lombardy in the last five years, 81 more in both Tuscany and Emilia-Romagna.
"The Italian process has evolved irrationally," says Paolo Protti, President of Aneca," it is useful to create new structures, but it would be necessary to guarantee that the existing ones will survive, because when one cinema in the city closes, not all of its visitors are willing to move to the multiplex.
Then let us not even talk about the insufficient subsidy for the fund for the benefit of operators: the previous national debt is about 10 million euros.
From a moral and ethical point of view, it is a shame that the government does not respect existing laws.
Between EUR 16 million and EUR 18 million per year would be needed to support the sector¢.
Interesting is the Bologna case, the first Italian city to worry about closures and which decided to find a way out by signing a protoculus between the municipality and Anci, the first of its kind in Italy to protect and promote small cinemas in both historical centres and the suburbs.
Among the planned standards are steps of tax breaks in favor of operators and benefits for the audience in terms of mobility: spectators will be able to enter the limited traffic zone and will have special prices to stop and in some parking lots.
"I like this initiative" says Giuseppe Tornatore", and I hope that other cities will follow Bologna's example by introducing other measures».
However, it is certain that in order to oppose the great power of the multiplex, traditional halls must improve the quality of sound and image, because today's audience is more demanding.
Defending traditional cinema is a theme that has always been important: the closure of the Super Cinema in Bagheera, the site of my childhood and adolescence, was the spark that convinced me to start the "New Cinema Paradiso", which I had been thinking about for 10 years.
I have lived in Rome for 25 years, and when I walk in front of the already closed Rialto or Quirinal on Nazionale Street, where I have shared so much emotion that I do not have to look at the inscriptions blackened with dust, I turn to the other side».
Link between politics and mafia group 'ndrangheta, mayor Gioia Tauro in prison
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was willing to adjust the elections of the municipal office according to the interests of the Piromalli mafia group".
The charges brought by the Calabria Mafia Directorate against The Mayor and Vice Mayor of Gioia Tauro Giorgio, Torrione e Rosario Schiavone, and Rosar Carlo Martelli, who was arrested this morning for external cooperation with a mafia organization, are heavy.
Also in handcuffs were Gioacchino Piromalli, an old mediator between the clan and the public administration, and his grandson a lawyer, the namesake of the boss, already accused of committing mafia crimes, sentenced to pay 10 million euros.
"They ignored all legal and moral norms, as well as common sense," prosecutors write, as two local governments expressed their willingness to pay for the consultations with piromalli, the lawyer.
"This would allow the mafia group – the judges write – to officially enter the city authorities and facilitate the already huge possibilities of control and management of public administration".
Agazio Loiero, president of the Calabrian Regional Commission, does not hide that "collusion between local institutions and the organized criminal underworld is a lot in his region: "There are areas where mafia concentration is stronger than in others, where collusion is inevitable.
But we also have many local politicians who resist the pressures of 'ndrangheta, heroes who are still immaculate'.
This morning's arrests follow the arrests in July last year, which showed that the Piromalli mafia group had been hit in the final throes .
Since the end of April last year - the city council of Gioia Tauro has been dissolved since 1991, the reason for this was the then supposed link between organised crime and local government - local politicians have been relieved of their positions in the municipal administration.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, leader of the Christian Democrats, who at the time of dissolution was elected head of the center-right coalition after a narrower election in May.
He screamed about the scandal when the Prefecture ordered the dissolution of the municipal council.
He called the then Deputy Interior Minister Marco Minniti accountable, accusing him of plotting everything for political reasons, but the judges explain in the arrest order signed this morning that the mafia group had even gone so far as to ask for the A3 motorway project to be changed.
Further hearings ordered against Dal Torrion, the public prosecutors write, showed "a willingness to shift the claims of a businessman, a representative of a larger group very close, as is commonly known, to Piromalli and to adapt public administration elections to the interests of the mafia group."
When energy is born from waves, the big ones come into play.
It is an infinite deposit that covers more than 70% of the earth's surface and is now being discovered by the world's major energy companies.
Waves, currents, tides are new sources of inexhaustible energy that have caught the eye of colossors like Chevron, which is now trying to put its hands on those resources.
The possibility of generating energy from sea movements has been studied for more than a century, and in the 1970s, in the context of the first oil crisis, research intensified.
When the price of oil fell around 1980, the idea of using marine energy went sideways. But now environmental organizations and a new increase in the price of oil have given the sector a new impetus.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London said in 2007 that about 15 percent of the world's electricity consumption could be covered by the use of sea wave movement.
this amount would be twice the energy currently produced in nuclear centres.
In addition, there are currents and tides.
The giants are attacking.
the company that bet on marine energy was Enersis, which agreed in 2005 to build a facility in northern Portugal.
When this plan was announced, it seemed like a huge revolutionary move.
After two years of betting on marine energy, there are more and more companies that bet on marine energy rather than traditional energy.
"Chevron is studying ocean energy technology -- a spokesman for a company linked to the United States oil colossote told the Wall Street Journal -- and they're thinking about working with us."
The cooperation we are considering concerns obtaining the permit from the U.S. Energy Commission, which is necessary to start a marine energy project in Alaska.
We cannot underestimate this signal, especially considering that it is in Alaska that the US continues to extract oil, and recently President Bush came up with a plan for new drilling.
In addition to Chevron, Verdant Power Inc. is following the sea energy footprint. New York and Ocean Power of New Jersey, and the sums invested so far, though not known in detail, show growing interest, according to observers.
The technology that needs to be developed.
Experts talk about technology that is still in its early days, because it is not known what impact the use of marine energy will have on the environment.
So far, facilities in Portugal and some in Scotland are small dimensions and do not seem to be causing major ecosystem problems.
However, for greater energy production, technologies with a greater impact on dilute must be used.
The methods are different: Ocean Power, for example, uses a fear system that is interconnected with each other.
The wave force that moves with the buoys up and down is changed using cylinders and cylinders to the hydraulic pressure inside these buoys.
The pressure spins the turbine, which supplies power to the generator.
Power's coming ashore through submarine cables.
For now, there are four facilities of this type in the project phase that are only awaiting federal approval, and some of the energy could be used for military purposes.
Verdant Power, on the other hand, already generates power for the mall and parking lot by using six offshore turbines in New York's East River.
The movement of water during high tides causes turbines to rotate, which feed the generator with this rotating movement.
Verdant said they have a long list of clients waiting for the necessary authorizations due to the possibility of using this energy.
By the waves, by the tide, and by low tide.
The potential for tides deserves special interest at this point, they say at the Institute for Electricity Research.
Although this is an incoherent factor, tides are more predictable than wind, sun or waves, and thus more reliable as a source of energy.
It is in the tidal energy that states like New York, Maine, and Alaska, along with other coastal states, have already invested $7.5 million in 2008 and predicted investments of up to $35 million for 2009.
