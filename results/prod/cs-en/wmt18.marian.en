The Movement for Civil Rights issued a travel warning to Missouri
The National Association for the Advantageating of Colorful People (NAACP) has published a warning to colourful people travelling to Missouri on the basis of the state's discriminatory principles and racist attacks.
"The NAACP's travel recommendation for the state of Missouri, with effect from 28 August 2017, calls on African-American passengers, visitors and residents of Missouri to take increased attention when travelling across the state as a result of the series of disputed racially motivated incidents that are currently taking place across the state," the association's statement reads.
The NAACP said it had taken this step on the basis of the current Missouri State Laws, which make it difficult to defend racially motivated acts in court, as well as the conduct of law enforcement authorities that disproportionately target minorities.
"There are violations of civil rights.
People are stopped by police officers just for the color of their skin, they are attacked or killed," NAACP president for Missouri Rod Chapel told the Kansas City Star.
"We'll be massing the largest number of complaints yet."
This is the first warning of its kind issued by the organization to the US state.
Among the incidents cited by the organization were racially motivated abuse directed at black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, a man of black from Tennessee.
Sanders died under contentious circumstances earlier this year after he received gas while traveling across the state and was taken into custody by police without charge of committing the crime.
The travel recommendation also draws attention to a recent statement by the Supreme Prosecutor's Office of Missouri, which states that black women drivers have a 75% higher chance of being stopped by the police.
"The purpose of the travel recommendation is to alert people and warn their families, friends and co-workers of what might happen in Missouri," Chapel said.
"People need to be prepared - they should bring in money to pay bail, or alert their relatives to travel by the state."
According to the FBI's current reporting of hate crime figures, there were a hundred cases of hate speech in Missouri in 2015 in Missouri, placing the state in 16th place among all states.
The travel warning is also in response to the new Missouri law, which makes it difficult for the company to be sued for discrimination in the provision of accommodation or employment.
The US Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued a travel recommendation for Texas and Arizona after states passed an immigration law that allows state officials to detain people on the basis of a violation of this law to improve racial profiling, according to the ACLU.
Travel recommendations are usually issued by the State Department for Foreign Country, but recently advocacy groups have resorted to these measures in response to specific US laws and trends.
The model was killed by a chef.
Her family doesn't have peace after 12 years!
The murdered is model Sally Anne Bowman.
A girl originally from Croydon was murdered in 2005 by chef Mark Dixie in the restaurant she worked in, who inflicted stab wounds.
The victim and the killer were to have sex and smoke marijuana, then killed her.
The killer then sat in a nearby cafe, watching the meticulous forensic forensics of the crime scene.
Dixie, a former chef, was sentenced to 34 years in prison in 2008 for the murder and rape of model Sally.
He admitted only assaulting the juvenile in court, and the lawyer claimed that his client had already found the girl dead lying in the street.
After three years he was convicted by the police.
Dixie claimed that Sally and her ex-boyfriend, Lewis Sprotson, were arguing on the fateful night.
The killer said, "He was really angry and the girl started screaming after his attack."
"She even attracted the attention of the taxi driver," he said falsely.
The girl, according to his testimony, should have resisted as best she could, but to no avail.
Lewis was supposed to stab her in the street.
Dixie's version was proven to be a lie and accused him.
After the confession, Dixie spoke of his horny and taste for the girl.
When he dressed her after sex, he felt satisfied and had to smoke marijuana.
Before the incident with Sally, he was at his ex-girlfriend's house, drinking alcohol and taking cocaine, Dexie himself told the police.
He said he felt adrenaline.
Sally started screaming for help, so he attacked her from behind and put his hand over her mouth," Linda added.
And after twelve years, the family faces further attacks from vandals destroying her grave.
He's been damaged four times in the last six months.
There are such cruel people on the loose who are digcing these graves.
"So our daughter is no longer there," the late girl's mother, Linda, told the Mirror about the disappearance of the ash urn.
Linda was waiting for the attackers, but they always had to attack when she left the cemetery.
Designer vibrators cost tens of thousands.
"Czechs are not prudish or conservative," says Martin Ráž, who runs the Intimity boutique in Prague.
In it you will find design and luxurious erotic devices.
Including those by Czech designer Anna Marešová.
It started quietly, about 12 years ago.
Martin Ráž and his friends went cycling around Moravia.
One of them brought not only a bicycle, but also a box full of unusual-looking vibrators.
"Different mole and dolphins and dolphins, and it was all green and yellow and just completely different," he tells me over lunch.
His friend and one other companion decided to work with the German manufacturer of the design erotic devices Fun Factory, which intrigued Martin, so he offered to help out with marketing.
When the companion left to pursue another profession, he replaced him.
Today, he runs the boutique Intimity in Prague's Benedictská Street, where he sells erotic aids in the way luxury handbags or shoes are usually offered.
And why would they?
These are also design items.
Wait, wait, you're talking about this at lunch, you're thinking?
Come on, don't be such puritans!
It was Berlin's Fun Factory store, designed by acclaimed designer Karim Rashid, that served as inspiration for the Intimity boutique.
It was opened in 2010 and it was a completely different concept of erotic commerce than everyone here is used to.
No covered windows, all made in a beautiful, subtle style, the products displayed more as in a perfumery.
Martin and his business partner Zdeněk Šebelka began to consider how to accommodate the Prague store, where he should be and what his name should be.
The name Intimity was to both.
"It has to do with intimacy, after all, and it is, be said, tender," he says.
It was followed by the purchase of an internet domain and a search for a suitable space that went in parallel with various interior visualizations.
In the end, the option that laid out the shop in the pleasure garden and the bedroom dominated by the bed prevailed prevailed.
It was prepared by Dagmar Štěpánová from the FormaFatal studio.
We found the area in 2013.
At first, he didn't seem exactly ideal to us because he's not on the main street, but it suited the name of Intimacy.
It's intimate.
It's in the alley next to the main one, so no one is eyeing customers," says Martin Ráž.
We wanted to be first.
We wanted to do a store that was different, with designer nice goods, in an environment where women, who are mostly our customers, feel comfortable.
And not to be ashamed of entering such a deal in the first place.
When I entered the Intimity boutique half an hour ago, the streets came empty.
Plus, I didn't even feel like I'd go to the erotic device store.
Right at the door, I was surprised by the pure elegance of the interior I know from the fashion boutiques.
Even if there is only a female attendant in the store, the fact that women don't be afraid to ask for help doesn't mean the man's foot doesn't come in.
For the most part, gentlemen come here to shop for gifts for their girlfriends.
"Men usually can't guess the right size and choose to be bigger," Martin smiles at the frequent mistake.
These are the preconceptions, the experienced cliché that women need some big aids, and it's not true.
So a man in good faith chooses, perhaps, an unnecessarily large vibrator.
Likewise, men choose mostly black lingerie, whereas the woman usually gravitates towards pink.
The absolute bestseller is currently a product aptly called Satisfyer.
It must be clear from the look on my face that I don't know which one is beating, because Martin immediately explains how it works.
It's kind of a clitoris-free stimulator.
I have an adolescent need to chuckle in admiration at the serious tone with which I am being given the interpretation.
It's like you're not fuming.
And it doesn't really fumor.
It is at a good price and has the perfect user reference.
We didn't believe he'd be so well received.
This is some sort of revolutionary novelty.
The first revolution was caused by a vibrator in the shape of a sepic horse.
He took the care of women becoming more interested in the design of such products.
The second was a vibrator for the We-Vibe steam.
He completely demolished the taboos that may persist in some men, and that he sees competition in the erotic aids.
"Different options are made," he continues.
With one engine, with two engines, with a remote control.
That's a favorite category.
In a love conjunction, a woman can have a control in her hand and determine the intensity of vibrations.
On the contrary, a certain flop is the category of staging vibrators.
At least for us.
Czech women, it seems, prefer multi-purpose aids and buy classic vibrators, even though they may only use it externally.
Yet in Western Europe, especially with younger customers, it is very popular.
What about the men?
It is hard to say whether a similar concept would work exclusively for men.
It would have to be a little different.
The question is what to offer men," Martin muses.
"We, too, have aids for them, but to a limited extent." The most sold is mainly a masturbator, in this case from the manufacturer Tenga.
It does not look like an anatomical imitation of the vagina, but "more like a shower gel or as an egg or a futuristic object.
He focuses a lot on functionality and experiences in use.
In Japan, things are very different.
It's astonishing in me.
I thought Japanese women were very fond of erotic aids, I object.
"That's the Internet reality," it's explained.
The mundane one is completely different.
Here in Europe, erotic aids are more associated with being used by women.
In Japan, they are perfectly normal for men, and on the contrary, they are taboo for women." Just for the sake of interest - what the Japanese brand Tenga, which is represented in the Intimity boutique, sells worldwide, still accounts for about half of what is sold only in Japan.
In our waters
Czechs and Czechs are not prudish.
On the contrary, we are a fairly accommodating nation.
Certainly unlike countries like Catholic Poland or Italy.
The typical client of the store is between the ages of 35 and 50, and "is having some experience of both sexual life and some kind of aid.
She will come for something nice, of a better quality to complete her partner life, or for herself." Martin Ráž and his business partner Zdeněk Šebelka take care of each product to see if it is perfectly functional for each product.
We also don't want to go into specialities like bondage and latex, because we don't have the space for that, and it doesn't come out here.
Such things could discourage the ones we're trying to target.
Which are people who have always been shy about going to the sex shop because they were afraid of something like that peeking out at them.
A lot of the products on the shelves are really appealing.
This is also due to the selection of renowned renowned brands.
Some of them have even won design awards, including the Red Dot Design Award.
The first ever awards were the aforementioned seahorse "and this triggered a change in the whole industry.
It began to abandon cheap materials and, on the contrary, work with the wholesomenisclait, started to produce other designs, different colours...
The nice thing is that the Czech, the popular designer Anna Marešová, is behind the design of some.
I have to say that I was quite pleasantly surprised by how many people buy those design stuff of Whoop.de.doo from Anna Marešová, even though they are relatively more expensive.
There are customers who go directly for the Venus balls by Anna Marešová.
She did a really huge piece of work by presenting exactly what we are trying to present in the Czech Republic and abroad - that erotic aids can be done differently, nicely, with a story.
Anna's story began as a school job.
Now it is a finished product, which is also produced in our country.
I wanted to control the production process and I also wanted to know from what materials and how Whoop.de.doo products are made.
Because it's not a large-scale production, but a small series, it's certainly more expensive than the big series.
I may be going up the tide a bit, but it seems important to maintain the development in the Czech Republic.
It could well be that in a few years we will no longer be able to produce anything," Anna, who agrees with Martin, later describes the situation to me that our company is becoming more and more open.
It is not a negative or negative attitude.
At most, people are said to be embarrassed.
"But they, too, will then start to smile." Currently, Anna Marešová has a vibrator on offer to have a personal message, and this year she is also planning her own lubricant.
In the year more, vibrating eggs and other novelties should be added.
Branice of healthy sex
I'm interested in where the line of what's okay lies.
Is there anything that Martin Ráž doesn't sell anymore?
It's so hard to define.
What comes normal to one, another may seem completely abnormal, so we are more likely to define ourselves by the range of branded manufacturers.
None of them go into any extremes.
Before we say goodbye, I have one last question: What was the craziest demand they received?
Just now in the week came an e-mail in which a lady was asking for a masturbation aid for her friend with a naturalty twenty-eight centimeters long.
So we had to write to that, that we don't have one of these.
There's a question of whether we were made fun of," Martin says, with a suspicious look.
That, too, happens from time to time...
A dunk for Karel Gott.
After two Alzheimer's cancers!
His friend Karel Štědrý is battling a serious illness.
Karel Gott's best friend is battling a disease that steals people's memories.
"Yes, it's unfortunately true," the singer himself confirmed to the sad information.
I know about my illness and so far, given the circumstances, I'm pretty good with it.
"I take medications to slow down the accompanying phenomena of the disease," he added, thanking the loved ones for their support.
The entire extended family came together to make it easier for Karl to make his life easier.
Wife Eva tries to be at home, as far as she can go, her dad's home on the White Mountain is also commute to the home of Zuzana and Tereza's first marriage, the son Karel is named Karlas.
Generous, he battled cancer twice and passed on his experience to Nightingale to support him in his difficult treatment.
He's done with sixty chemo treatments.
He was able to return to his work and the tennis court and the ski slopes.
"I have a prior to my astrologer from being here by the time I'm 90," Karel told Lightning.
He's a fighter.
He's still eager to sing.
"I keep repeating the words of the songs so I don't forget them," Karl admitted.
The same disease is now being fought in the institute by the actress Květa Fialová.
Do you have a Alzheimer's patient in your family?
Look at how to treat him.
The Chilean parliament has lifted the ban on abortions, the law will be considered by the CPS.
Chile still has an absolute ban on abortion of abortions, so it must not be carried out for health reasons either.
"I am sorry that legislators have filed a complaint with the Constitutional Court and that now ten people will decide what we have been arguing about in parliament for more than two years," complained Socialist Senator Isabel Allende.
The Constitutional Court in Chile has ten members and should receive a new president at the end of August, who is close to the opposition, according to AFP.
The law aboliting the absolute ban on abortions, initiated by current President Michelle Bachelet, was passed by the Senate on July 19.
The right-wing opposition then announced that it would challenge the law in court because it believed it violated the unborn child's right to life.
Members postponed the vote on the bill last month until it was being analyzed by a joint parliamentary commission.
On Wednesday, members approved the proposal, and after that the Senate did so again.
Under the new legislative amendment, abortion should be punishable in three cases: if a woman's life is at risk, if the fetus has no chance of survival, or if the pregnancy originated from rape.
Similar exceptions had existed in Chile since 1931, according to the Spanish newspaper El País, before the women were granted the right to vote there in 1949.
The absolute ban on abortions in 1989 was imposed by right-wing dictator Augusto Pinochet, just a few months before he left the presidency.
Chile is one of the few countries in the world where there is an absolute ban on abortions.
The others are Nicaragua, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Haiti, Malta and Honduras.
In El Salvador, for example, there are now about 20 women behind bars who are serving up to 30-year prison sentences for abortion.
In many cases, according to human rights activists, it was a spontaneous abortion, which the court called a murder.
Is there anything else sacred?
The target of Trump's White House is now the Statue of Liberty
The unmistinct sign of regime change is the criticism of the statues.
The Americans could tell about it as well as everyone else's - see the carefully staged overthrow of the statue of Saddam Hussein in Baghdad's Firdos Square in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key supporters of the Trump regime, surely knew what was coming about when, in a heated debate with a CNN reporter, Jim Acosta, on the president's proposals to drastically restrict legal immigrants, he set off with a symbolic axe on the Statue of Liberty.
It's fitting that Miller didn't attack the statue as such.
For that, he would be lynched by a crowd of cruise ship owners and imitators of the Statue of Liberty.
However, he attacked its significance, specifically the fact that in 1903 a plaque with the famous poem Emmy Lazarus was placed on the pedestal, and up to 17 years after the completion of the monument.
Miller reprimanded Acosta by saying, "I don't want to go down in history here, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that shines light on the world.
The poem that was placed on the pedestal afterwards, and to which you refer, is not part of it."
Miller is actually right, but as he put it, this is not about history.
These are the striking words of Emmy Lazarus, which resonate today - invites them not only immigrants, but the poorest of the poorest:"Let me come to me who's down, who's down, who can barely breathe freely, who's a miserable worm in the middle of the full cities."
And it is in modern times that we can better watch these "inhable worms" on our screens.
Miller didn't try to criticize poetry - he wanted to make it clear that these people were not welcome in the US.
This conflict about the meaning of the statue is part of a comprehensive political and cultural war: it is essentially a conflict about the importance of America.
Emma Lazarus, like her friends, who had sought to set up a plaque with a poem on the base of the statue after her death, well knew she was embroiling a high political game.
The statue was meant to express the merger of the French and American Republican governments by representing the classic theme, the female embodiment of freedom.
Emma Lazarus has altered this meaning: in her poem, the female character is not abstract, but has her own voice.
She also has a very different name: the mother of the exiled.
The fuses to the poem with the idea of a woman is a brilliant feminist move and a devastating attack on American nativism.
And in the same way that Emma Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, the followers of the right have long sought to avert this meaning.
The renowned commentator Rush Limbaugh - Jana the Baptist on Trump's rise to power - argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty does not actually invite anyone to the country, but represents an early neo-fictureism, bringing the American flame to the backward world: "The Statue of Liberty is struting forward.
It carries the torch of freedom from the United States and offers it to the rest of the world.
The march is not meant to illuminate the journey to the United States."
Surprisingly, Limbaugh is alluding to an important point.
The meaning of the sculpture depends on the point of view.
Emma Lazarus describes the statue from the point of view of an exhausted and damned passenger who often arrives after a long and terrifying ocean cruise with hope in his heart to a new land.
This is literally a view of the world through the eyes of people seeking refuge and a chance for a better life.
From this perspective, the statue expresses hope and listens to their needs.
And that, of course, is a perspective that neither Miller nor Trump will ever recognize.
Their torch is not to illuminate the path, but to stir up the hatred that is their only source of power.
World Athletics Championships 2017: Neil Black sings praise for Scottish members of the British team
Eilidh Doyle recalls the days when the British team had only two Scottish members
United Kingdom Athletics Federation director Neil Black said the strong skit of 16 Scots in the World Cup team would be a "enorman contribution to the team."
For the World Championships in London 2017, which starts on Friday, a record number of Scottish athletes has been selected.
Black believes that "something special is happening" in Scotland, and British athletics could learn a lot from the Scots.
"We are trying to understand this and adapt to it - we will work on it," Black said.
"I've spoken to the people of the Scottish Sports Institute, and they think it has something to do with what they've done.
Scottish athletics officials think it has to do with what they've done.
British athletics: it has something to do with what they did.
People on the streets think so, too.
Whatever it is, it's absolutely amazing."
Several Scottish athletes will be looking for medals, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will compete with Sir Mo Farah in the 5000m race, while Eilidh Doyle was elected as the team captain.
"Eilidh is modest.
Her opening speech was amazing,' Black said.
"Several athletes, whether Scots or athletes of other nationalities, came out of the room with a sense of great pride and motivation.
The passion and undisguised feelings Eilidh spoke to were unrepeatable."
The silver medalist at the Commonwealth, who will compete in the 400m hurdles at her fifth World Championships, said she was "unbelievable" that there are 16 Scottish athletes in the British team.
The previous record from 1983 and 2015 is seven.
The midfield runner, Muirová set five British and two European records in the last year alone.
At the World Championships he will take part in the 1500m and 5000 m.
Another of the great Scots is Chris O'Hare, who will run the 1500m track. He has won the British team races and the Annual Games this season.
Doyle recalls her first championship, which featuring Lee McConnell the only other Scottish member.
The team captain led the team to be "very proud" of the fact that not only a large number of her colleagues made it to the team, but in many cases they will also be attacking the final and the medals.
"The extraordinary thing in the post of team captain is that I was elected by the other members of the team. It was a great honour for me, but the knowledge that I was elected by the team members is all the gratifying," she added.
"I'm obviously very proud of all the Scots who made the team.
It proves where we've moved.
They are athletes who will think of the front spots on the podium.
And my opening statement?
Yes, I think it worked.
I merely drew attention to the fact that we can be proud of this year's championship because it takes place on home soil.
It is important to take advantage of the support of the home fans and to rejoice in the fact that we are back at the Olympic Stadium.
I've been given a second chance to race and I'll enjoy the incredible atmosphere."
Blocking critics on Facebook: Don't contest public office unless you bear voter criticism
The father of our country knew about his criticism.
The Americans loved George Washington, but it wasn't long before the paper began to criticize him for anything, from domestic politics to his political views.
Yes, this criticism did not leave him cold.
But he didn't try to silence the critics.
Because in 1783 Washington said, "Freedom of speech can be taken away from us - and we shall be guided as sheep to slaughter."
That brings me to Maryland is Governor Larry Hogan, for his work to start acting like Washington.
Hogana's employees blocked and deleted the posts of at least 450 people who freely expressed their views on his official Facebook page.
This week, he was sued by the American Civil Liberties Union for these acts.
The governor's staff dismissed the suit as groundless, and there were many views of "who cares" about the online commentaries.
"It's just Facebook," said many users.
Still, it matters.
Especially the moment it's about people like Hogan.
In an absolutely democratic state, he is a hugely popular Republican governor.
He boasts the second highest favor with all 50 governors.
Hogan is not an ort!
As you can see, it guides its state with certainty of its own and strictly adheres to the principles.
It turned out to be deft in using Facebook as the main means of association with its constituents - the first photo with his head was not the exception to post-grading chemotherapy.
Blocking the people who visit the governor's site - which is a public forum, labeled official and administered by his employees paid with taxpayers' money - is pointless and ultimately dangerous.
In an interview with the Washington Post, Hogan's spokeswoman, Amelia Chasse, defended the governor, saying that the commentary blocking was from a position to host the posts.
But to use the image of internet trolls, spamer or angry people is too easy.
The Washington Post interviewed several real people who had their posts deleted.
And that is precisely what they are - the real people who speak to their elected leaders; the teacher, the businessman and the pastor, the trolls.
As they all said, their comments were polite and considerate, not blasphemous.
In his commentary, the pastor quoted the Bible, appealing to Hogan's Catholic faith.
Bowie Lakshmi Sarma's lawyer, Md. asked about hate crimes, but her comment was not hateful.
"I commented in a form that I was disappointed by his lack of response to hate crimes and other up-to-date news," she wrote in the Washington Post's notes section.
"I don't like the idea that once a certain number of people comment on the same subject, they are labeled by some people as a promotion of so-called collective efforts, instead of being recognized as a larger group of interested citizens."
What the governor's staff called "focused spam interest" would probably be called "obhape."
The modern Facebook era allows us to easily manage posts by blocking critics or deleting negative comments.
It is much more convenient than in the past, when the same procedure would require staff to be taken to the streets, to collect and burn all the copies with criticism or arrest or silence the Protestants.
And that is exactly what is happening, only in digital form.
Hogan is not the last public official to be criticized for defunction of Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is facing legal action from Twitter users who have been denied access to his account.
One of the first major regulations was born in Virginia last week.
The chairwoman of the Loudoun County Board of Supervisors violated the first amendment in Alexandria, according to District Judge James Cacheris, where she prevented one of the voters' access to her Facebook page.
Governor Matt Bevin (R) from Kentucky also received a visit from the ACLU to use it on Facebook and Twitter.
This should not be so difficult.
In the days of Washington, the low cost of postage had virtually the same impact as the Internet.
Between 1776 and 1800 the number of daily newspapers quadrupled, and his position as leader was questioned by many anonymous scrists.
And even in those days, Washington had to deal with anonymous trolls.
People who, writing under pseudonymous as "Juricola", "Valerius", "Belisarius" and "Portius," wrote letters to newspapers and questioned Washington's decisions.
According to historical documents gathered by the people of the online project Papers of George Washington Project, petitions were hoarding in his office to criticize his position against the Treaty of Treaty of Amity, Commerce, and Navigation with Britain.
But he did not silence them.
Freedom of expression, disapproval and intimidation lies at the very foundations of our nation.
And the real leader must accept it.
Czechs quickly used free roaming, using more data abroad than at home.
Abroad, Czechs use more of their tariff than at home.
They are most likely to move in Austria, but the consumption of data in the summer season is dominated by Croatia.
On holiday, they both have more time to browse the web, under the umbrella, and under the parasol they tend not to be able to connect to Wi-Fi.
Beach, bathing and smart phone in hand.
This is the typical Czech holiday in Croatia after customers can use the services of the local operators at the domestic prices.
This is clear from the fresh statistics of O2.
Thanks to the new roaming rules, most Czech travellers abroad have more data available as a flat rate than at home.
It is therefore no surprise that in Croatia, where a minimum of us travel over the winter, data consumption has risen 50-fold this summer season.
Italy came second in the ranking of the data consumed.
The Czechs are summoning the most minutes from Germany, where many go on business even during the summer.
According to data from the Association of Czech Travel Agency, Croatia is visited by 800,000 Czechs a year, so it is our most popular holiday destination.
However, people here traded the book to share experiences using a mobile phone.
The record was July 7 this year.
"Tens of a million photographs would fit into the transferred data," said Silvia Cieslarová, director of the O2 mobile segment.
Although Croatia leads in the volume of data, the highest number of Czech users are in neighbouring countries.
Austria is in first place, followed by Germany and Slovakia.
Croatia are fourth and Italy sixth.
We go to Austria for hiking and an active holiday for which we do not have as much time to browse the internet.
"In addition, the Czechs are heading for the Adriatic because of Austria," Cieslarová explained.
While data has seen high year-on-year growth in data after loosening of roaming charges, growth is much lower for telephony.
The number of minutes proclabled in roaming has doubled compared to last year.
With a huge lead over other countries, Germany dominates here.
"The call in roaming is more used by corporate customers on business trips," Cieslarová added.
Ronan Rafferty hopes for home atmosphere at Renaissance Club
Former golf number one Ronan Rafferty will hope for a relaxed atmosphere at the Renaissance Club in the Scottish West Lothian district of the Scottish Senior Open over the next three days.
Ronan Rafferty, who hails from Northern Ireland, lost to Paul Eales on the nearby Archerfield Links golf course on his way to the final this year. This year he will perform the role of ambassador of the tournament by club founder and CEO CEO, Jerry Sarvadi.
"I watched the Renaissance Club slowly grow up in front of my eyes and this year's tournament will show the world its beauty," Rafferty said.
"Players will be able to enjoy the first-class quality of the pitch.
Jerry did a great job.
He is a zealous advocate of this game and is proud of his achievements.
This year's tournament is in the right hands."
Englishman Eales will defend the championship for the first time, despite winning both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour during his 32-year career.
"I feel good about it," the Southport golfer said.
"I had no way to defend my victory at the Extremadura Open because a year after my victory, the tournament was cancelled.
Returning to this part of the country is magical.
It's a beautiful place to play.
I remember last year when for me and my wife, Sharon, the win was a really big win.
It was a beautiful time I won't forget."
Gary Orr returns to his home ground, joining the European Senior Tour after turning 50 from the region this year.
This event will be his first appearance since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"I'm always happy to play on home soil," Orr said of Helensburgh.
"You want to see you thrive and feel a lot of pressure.
I really enjoyed playing again and I think I'm doing well.
I'm happy with the result so far."
The trio of players will also be joined on the pitch by former Masters winner Ian Woosnam and senior tournament winners Paul Broad Broadst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are among the six Scottish players on the pitch; the others are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
Admission to the tournament is free. Parking is 5 £ per car with one passenger and £10 per car with two or more passengers.
All profits will be donated to Prostate Cancer UK.
Poverty and death in the Indonesian land of gold
When Bardina Degei cooks dinner, she doesn't use the stove.
In fact, he rarely uses a pelvis.
In her wooden shack, located in the capital of Paniai Enarotali in the Indonesian province of Papua, a woman usually simply throws a sweet potato - in the language of the local "nota" - directly into the fire.
After half an hour, he takes the potato out and he relish to enjoy it with unwashed hands.
Bardina sits on the muddy ground - the cottage is not equipped with furniture - where he also performs his daily work, such as washing laundry in cloudy water from a nearby swamp.
A bucket in a room without a roof substitute for the toilet.
As the youngest of her husband's four wives, she was not assigned any field to cultivation.
Polygamy is common here.
Working until the late hours of the night poses a danger: most of the village's men are unemployed and often drink alcohol. In addition, the village is home to soldiers.
"From the afternoon after five o'clock, no one dares to wade around the village," Bardina says.
It is a rare glimpse of everyday life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony that was declared part of Indonesia in 1969 after a controversial referendum, when just 1026 elders were forced to vote in the form of a public hand-up in the posting army.
The current movement protesting against the Dutch rules quickly turned its anger back to the Yartch government, which controlled the entire region, with the exception of foreign journalists or civilian-laws overseers.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua - the independent Papua New Guinea occupied the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is such a distant and devastated city, which takes place after a 90-minute flight from the capital of Jayapura province to Nabire, and then a five-hour gushering gushering.
Mass transport is not working at this point.
The city, with a population of 19,000, consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences, roofs of woollad tins in shades of grey and rusty.
There were very few Indonesians, let alone journalists, and virtually no foreigners, to see the place.
Before the arrival of Christians, the locals worshipped a god named Ug Tame.
And that's not all.
"We weren't used to wearing these dresses," says Bardina, pointing to his colorful, hand-knitted turban, dark T-shirt and a shiny skirt.
"We used to carry only leaves."
Papua is Indonesia's poorest province - 28% of the population lives below the poverty line, and the local infant mortality and literacy is one of the worst in Asia.
But it is also an Indonesian land of gold.
Grasberg, the world's largest and most profitable gold mine, owned by Phoeenix, Freeport McMoran, of Phoeenix, is only 60 miles from Paniai - a rocky province of approximately New Jersey, which is home to about 153,000.
In 2015 alone, Freeport mined $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper here.
In addition, Papua supports logging worth an estimated $78 billion.
Nevertheless, these riches are a source of suffering for the Papuans and a guarantee of oppression by the powerful Indonesian army.
An investigation conducted by the New York Times in 2005 shows that Freeport paid local military officials and troops about $20 million between 1998 and 2004, including $150,000 for one officer.
Papaners calling for self-government threaten this golden goose and are therefore harshly suppressed.
According to human rights activists, more than 500,000 Papuans have been killed since 1969, and thousands more have been raped, tormented, and imprisoned by the Indonesian army.
Mass murders in the tribal area of Papua during the 1970s were equal to genocide, as reported by the Asian Human Rights Commission.
Last year alone, Indonesian police arrested more than 3900 peaceful Protestants in the region.
We Will Lose Everything, a report by the Archdiocese of Brisbanka in 2016, describes the atrocities that occurred last year as extrajudicial executions, torture - according to another report, the most popular electrocution and execution are particularly popular - and the brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrators.
"It is difficult to calculate the number of victims because incidents occur weekly," said Andreas Harsono, an Indonesian research fellow with Human Rights Watch.
The situation was aggraved by the fact that papuan sources attract colonists to Indonesia.
Of the country's 3.5 million people, 83% claim to be Christianity, but demography is changing with an influx of Muslim immigrants from the Indonesian islands - Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
The Java cantánna sell fried chicken and gado, or a mixture of vegetables with peanor sauce.
Local people are fighting for survival.
"Imigrants started selling chicken and vegetables at traditional markets at lower prices than the local Papuans," explains Abeth You, 24, who was born to Paniai and moved to work in the provincial capital of Jayapura.
"The original inhabitants of Papua - mama-mama (women) - have lost their jobs."
In his 2014 presidential campaign, Indonesian President Joko Widodo, who is dubbed Jokowi, promised to address inequality and rights violations.
The former carpenter secured and secured his trip to the presidential palace in the Presidential Palace in the jakarta of 27 of Papua's 29 districts, including Pania.
But in PNG, very little has changed, and the locals feel betrayed.
"Our heart was broken because in 2014 we voted for the Jokpwi with the hope of heing our call for justice," You said.
The fact is that just two months after the inauguration of Jakowi inauguration in October, Paniai had a major shock.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children sang Christmas songs at a campfire in the town of Enarotali when two Indonesian soldiers on motorbikes emerged from the gloom of the night.
Two of the surprised children were told to turn on the lights.
One of the soldiers was touched by this rebuke and the tone she was told and later returned with four other soldiers, local vicar Yaved Tebai said.
Two of the soldiers in the drunken state chased a group of children and beat them with the stock of their weapons, the victims and witnesses of the event said.
One of the soldiers then fired at a group of children.
One of the children, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was beaten so hard that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, someone set fire to the nearby electoral commission building, and the following day, things got even more to the next.
About 1,000 young Papua men and women gathered on the football field in front of the local police station and army headquarters, demanding justice.
They came with the ceremonial hunting bows and performed the waita dance - in which it is run in a circle and the singing of the birds is imitated - the Papuan tribe of Mee Pago.
Several Protestants began throwing rocks at the buildings.
With escalating tension, the soldiers were ordered to the radio: "If the crowd tries to resist at least three times, you have permission to shoot," the official document, the content of which was never published in the local media, according to TIME.
Yeremias Kayame (56), the head of the Enarotali district, recognized the imminent danger and urged residents to disperse their homes.
But no one was heeded of his words.
"When I turned around, someone shot me in the left wrist," he told TIME on the porch of his brightly painted wooden house.
Kayame does not yet know who the shooter was, but he said the bullet belonged to one of the soldiers present.
"There were a lot of people all around and there were a lot of shooting," he added.
One of the locals, Alfius Youw, was hit three times, according to his cousin, who witnessed the shooting.
"I ran to the body to see if it was him," Yohanes, who uses only one name to TIME, who, like many Indonesians, uses only one name, said.
"I saw that he was dead . . . I kissed him."
Papuan Police Inspector General Yotje Mende told the newspaper that his officers were merely "ensuring" the station under attack.
"We must defend ourselves when people threaten us with death," Papuan Police Press Secretary, Commissioner Pudjo Sulistiyo, said in 2015.
"It's a matter of life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five protesters were killed and many escaped injuries.
The news of the murders was lost by the jakart media the following day.
Three weeks later, Jokowi gave a heated speech in Jayapura and expressed his understanding of the victims' families and promised to deal with the violence in Papua.
"I demand an immediate solution to this problem so that it can never be repeated," he said.
National Security Minister Wiranto announced in October 2016 that he would introduce an out-of-court mechanism to resolve the violent acts that had taken place in the past.
But almost immediately, excuses began to be heard.
"Most of the violent acts occurred a long time ago.
Some of them occurred in the 1990s and some at the beginning of the 21st century.
I mean, we are determined to punish these acts of violence, but it will not be an easy task," he said.
However, in an interview on June 5 for the weekly TIME, held in Jakarta, Wiranto claimed that he did not plan to implement any measures in Papua.
Instead, he said that "all the cases will be referred to the court."
Wiranto, whom the UN has accused of "crime against humanity" on the basis of more than one thousand people killed during the independent elections of 1999 in East Timor - said that 11 human rights violations in Papua have been settled so far, including the Paniai incident.
The families of the victims of the shooting in Paniai welcomed his claims with disbelief.
"I've been asked four times in the last three years, but I've never done anything until now," Yohanes said.
"I'm tired."
As he says, he still lives in fear for several years afterwards.
"I'm afraid," as he claims.
"I'm afraid the army will arrest me or be shot."
His brother, Yacobus, confirmed the view of many residents of Paniai, who are afraid to speak out about the incident.
In his words, he was beaten by members of the army after helping to bury four of the victims.
"After the body burial, the army started looking for me," he said.
And the shooting is not yet up.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police fired on villagers in neighboring Deiyai.
The scuffle in which one person died and another 17 were injured occurred between villagers and a construction company manager, who refused to provide assistance in transporting the man unconscious to the hospital.
Ravianus Douw (24), who drowned while fishing in a nearby river, died on his way to the hospital.
Angry villagers protested outside the company building.
According to police, the villagers threw rocks at the members and were answered by the warning shooting.
However, local residents claim that the mobile brigade (Indonesian paramilitaristic police) opened fire in the crowd and killed one person.
"A panic, we were afraid of retribution," 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lives near the hospital, told TIME.
"I didn't leave the house two days."
Deiya's parliament demanded the punishment of the police officers involved and withdraw the mobile brigade from the area.
Paniai has always been a thorn in the Indonesian government's eye.
The lack of meaningful development only exacerbates the separation of the tribes of the Mee, Mona, Dani and Damal tribes, who live in the central highlands.
Many of them have joined the P Papuai Liberation Movement (OPM) - an army of rebels that protects the rights of the Papuans by attacking and abusing Indonesian police officers.
Some of the OPM leaders come from Paniosia. They are among not Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
As a result of the attacks, the military has arrested and arbitrarily detained thousands of residents of the Paniai in recent years, all under the pretext of "ensuring national sovereignty."
Some of them will never be seen again.
Paniai is known among the people of Papuai as a "tragic and forgotten place."
Oil pets poverty in the fire.
The few rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for the locals.
And bread is unattainable anyway.
The inhabitants of the local grow their food: mainly sweet potatoes, fruit and leafy vegetables.
Women work in the fields; each of them cultivates four or five fields of sweet potatoes.
Most of the harvest is for the needs of the family, the rest they sell on the local market.
Ten of the sweet potatoes cost just 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Since Nabire Airport opened more air routes and new immigrants began pouring into the country, economic inequality between native-born Papuans and immigrants has been increasing.
As few jobs are usually occupied by more educated and richer immigrants.
Papuans rarely have the necessary capital and education to go into business.
"Young people are moving out of the villages because of a lack of job opportunities and money," said John Gobai, chairman of the tribal council of Paniai.
Thanks to the isolation, Papua province is hidden from the world.
This is also due to strict rules for foreign journalists.
At the beginning of this year, two French journalists - Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp - were expelled from the papua for "lack of cooperation with the authorities" all this despite the fact that they were given such a rare permit to film.
In his election campaign, Phelim Kine, deputy director of the Asia branch of Human Rights Watch, promised to abolish the strict rules for journalists and achieve transparency and development.
"Frontier journalists who work in the best-sourred easternmost areas of Papua and West Papua are at great risk: visa recognition and blacklist recognition," he said in a statement.
The lack of news from the offshore's penaries means that the international pressure on Indonesia's case in the Papua case is largely limited.
In March, six Pacific nations - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - urged the UN Human Rights Council on the investigation into "distinct and widespread violent acts" in Papua, including the Paniai shooting.
These countries have also supported OPM in the past.
Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesman Arrmanatha Nasir shook off the charges when he told reporters in Jakarta that: "A democratic system is still in place in Indonesia and the media is free, so it is difficult to disguise evidence of human rights violations."
Local people are calling for the participation of foreign governments.
When the official delegation from the Netherlands, headed by the Human Rights envoy, Kees Van Baar, visited Jayapurau on 4 May, local people were hailing, according to a source who also attended the meeting but wanted to remain anonymous, the slogan "we want to have freedom."
There are other elections for 2019 in Indonesia, but the Papuans say they will not vote for Jokowi.
"Jokowi is a man with good intentions but is surrounded by people associated with the shooting in Paniai," said Gobau, the tribal council chairman.
He wants Jokowi to know that the people of Paniai - in addition to living in constant fear of a robbery army - were rolling in poverty, miserable education, and the health system.
Gobai argues that the people of Paniai, like the other Papuans, regard their vote as a "lust" that the Jokowi must repay.
"They don't want money, they demand justice," he added.
Despite the threats and intimidation of the family of the victims of the Pania shooting, they continue with the latest symbolic act of defiance: they bury the bodies of the victims on the property opposite the police and army stations.
Knowing that justice will never be done for enough, at least he will not allow the persons responsible to forget their crimes.
"A member of our family was killed," Yacobus said, his head down.
"What can we do?"
The French Navy intercepted a huge cocaine shipment to Australia.
The French Navy intercepted a yacht in the Pacific carrying 1.46 tonnes of cocaine worth about $256 million.
The shipment was headed for Australia.
The intervention arrested the four-man crew of the ship, which appears to be made up of people from Lithuania and Latvia.
The yacht, named Afalina, left South America, and was dragged by police after being detained to a port in the city of Nouméa, the capital of the French overseas territory of the New Caledonia in the Pacific Ocean.
The Australian Intelligence Agency said it would seek, in cooperation with its international partners, to determine exactly where and where the drugs were directed and where and where to identify the "Lithuanian syndicate."
"We are grateful to the French authorities for the measures that have stopped a large number of drugs bound for Australia," said its executive director, Col Blanch.
The drugs were destroyed in Noumée this week.
Australia is an attractive target for their smugglers because of high street drug prices.
The country is also facing the problem of the growing number of people suffering from drug addiction.
The current bust is thus not the first in recent times.
Last month, three men were charged with transporting large amounts of drugs from the United States to Australia, which they attempted to smuggle across the Pacific Ocean in a small plane.
Seniors don't feel thirsty, drinking has to be remembered.
The problem may be in homes for the elderly, the solution, according to the doctor at the Geriatric Clinic of the General University Hospital in Prague, Pavla Mádlová, could be an infusion of saline, which is injected with a thin needle under the skin.
But these are only applied in medical facilities.
The older you get, the more water in your body drops.
"Moreover, they lose their thirst, so seniors generally take in less fluids and dehydrate very quickly," said Madi.
Two grand should be drunk for sure.
"But getting so many fluids into the old person is a big problem," she added.
In homes for the elderly, she says, no doctor often does.
In hospitals it routinely addresses dehydration with infusions.
"I think that it should be gradually introduced there, too, to allow them to receive subcutaneous infusions," she said.
In a day, she says, up to two pint bottles of saline can be delivered to old people.
Fluid deficiency can cause malaise, headache and reduced performance.
Dehydration will prove to be a complete loss of self-sufficiency.
"One day, the old man says he can't get out of bed, he talks in confusion," she added.
In the case of neglect, it can result in a stroke.
The blood thickens and clogs the blood vessel in the brain, and there is also a risk of kidney failure.
Lying patients should not be covered with a blanket, a maximum of cotton sheets.
The problem may also be one-on-one diapers.
"It's more nursing, but the ideal would be to uncover the patient from time to time and let the skin air out," the doctor said.
Dubai was on fire for the second time in the skyscraper The Torch
In Dubai, one of the world's largest residential skyscrapers went up in flames on Friday. Firefighters had to evacuate all residents of the 337-meter-high and 79-storey buildings.
This is the second fire in this high-rise building in the last two years, which bears the fitting name The Torch (Morch).
All the residents of the building were evacuated and there were no injuries. The cause of the fire is unknown.
"We got asleep and the alarm woke us up. We heard the screams.
It took us ten minutes to run down from the 50th floor," Geroge, one of the skyscraper's residents, told Reuters.
Dubai's civil defense said firefighters managed to get the fire under control around 4 a.m. (at GMT), then continued to cool the building.
Government officials added that they provide alternative accommodation for the affected residents.
The incident could once again spark debate over the safety of the materials used to lining high-rise buildings around the world.
The results of the investigation launched by the Torch skyscraper management after a fire in 2015 showed that the most damaged was the lining and external panels used for decoration or isolation.
British police said the system of isolation and panelling of London's Grenfell Tower could have contributed to the rapid spread of the fire in a fire in the June fire that killed nearly 80 people.
The survey results showed that more than one in five passengers to the US were delivering banned items on board the aircraft
A survey of passengers showed that more than twenty percent of them consciously or unconsciously made banned items through the U.S. government checkpoints of the U.S. Transportation Security Administration on board. At least six percent of passengers boarded planes with a knife or other sharp object.
Less than one percent of passengers say they were belatedly found out that they were traveling with a firearm, ammunition or an explosive.
The results of a survey conducted by the airline Stratos Jet Charters Inc. - to which more than 1000 interviewers replied - showed that younger passengers were more likely to be violated.
Of the respondents who admitted to having attempted to knowingly travel with a subject banned by TSA, 19.7 per cent of passengers were with several thousand hours of flight compared to less than 15 percent of Generation X members.
The most common items that have leaked TSA's attention are food and alcohol.
More than three percent of respondents knowingly made a sharp object through security, while 2.2 percent of the women surveyed and 3.7 percent of the men surveyed also admitted that they had deliberately brought banned drugs on board the plane.
The company said it had conducted research among passengers around the world to find out how many of them randomly made unauthorised items through airport security and how much they did so on purpose.
Not surprisingly, most people who have transferred unauthorised objects - whether consciously or unconsciously - travel by plane very often.
As the company pointed out, the TSA directives are somewhat complicated and confusing.
People often don't know what fluids and how much they can make on the plane.
It is no surprise, then, that TSA confiscated the most just-banned liquids.
For a time, people thought that TSA would handle books in the same way as smuggled goods.
Fluid-weighting is permitted within domestic flights, not international flights.
EPA chief Scott Pruitt on postponement of planned directives to reduce emissions by the Obama administration
After the Environment Agency was sued by fifteen states, its chief, Scott Pruitt, dismissed his earlier decision to delay implementing the former Obama administration's plan to reduce carbon dioxide emissions.
Pruitt introduced changes to his plan, responding more briskly than previous governments to the needs of state environmental regulators.
However, he did not mention a legal appeal against his previous position in the federal appeals court.
This concerns the last deadline, which was set for 1 October, when states should start implementing the 2015 regulation to reduce the minimum ozone.
Pruitt announced in June that he would postpone the agreement by one year and order a more detailed study of the plan to avoid "interventions with local decisions or impending economic growth."
Pruitt, who held the position of state attorney general Oklahoma before being reinstated as EPA chief to president, was for a long time serving as a reliable opponent of stricter environmental regulations.
Since settling in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly shifted or delayed regulations proposed by the chemical and fossil industries.
The sudden turnaround of Wednesday is the biggest legal failure for Pruitt's regulatory agenda.
Last month, a federal appeals court in Washington ruled that the executor of the EPA had exceeded his authority in an attempt to delay the inclusion of the Obama administration plan, which required diesel and gas companies to reduce methane leaks.
In a statement issued on Wednesday evening, Pruitt proposed his version of ozone standards and strengthened the EPA's commitment to cooperate with states through complex processes and the fulfilment of new standards within a given timefrase.
"Under the government of the previous administration, the EPA often failed to meet deadlines and waited for it to be sued by activist groups and others, agreeing to settle and further set up plans," said Pruitt, who filed more than a dozen lawsuits against the EPA in his previous position.
"We do not believe in regulation through litigation and we take the deadline seriously.
We never joke about the statute and authority that implies."
However, the EPA statement states that Pruitt may use at a certain point the "permit of delays and all other legally available authorities" to ensure that regulations "based on sound policies and the most affordable information."
Republicans in congress are pushing for a more detailed transcript of ozone rules.
The White House budget approved last month seeks to postponrate by implementing the 2015 rules for at least eight years.
The measure has still not passed the Senate.
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who headed a coalition of states that sued the EPA this week, said the group did not intend to allow legal pressure.
"The EPA's views - following our lawsuit - is an important victory for the health and safety of the 6.7 million New Yorkers and the more than 115 million Americans directly affected by air pollution," Schneiderman added.
New York was joined by California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, and Washington, D.C.
Ground-earth ozone is produced when normal harmful substances emitted by cars, power plants, oil refineries, chemical power plants and other sources react in the atmosphere with sunlight.
The resulting smog can cause serious respiratory problems in sensitive people and thousands of premature deaths each year.
Public health advocates and environmentalists acknowledge Pruitt's sudden change with wow.
"It is worrying what pressure the pressure needs to be exerted to change the minds of those responsible and protect the air we breathe," said Lori Ann Burden of the Center for Biological Diversity.
"We must continue to wrestle with the ideological campaign of the Trump administration, which seeks to help polluters and special interests."
He doused the man with acid, yet according to the court he is not dangerous.
You never know what might happen to you.
One minute you're at home with your family and you're laughing, the next you suddenly change your whole life from the ground up.
And the worst part is, there's nothing you can do about it.
A similar fate befell Andreas Christopher of the UK, whose face was crippled with acid by an unknown assailant who was eventually acquitted.
The information was reported by the Reuters website.
In December 2014, someone at Christopheros' door knocked on the door.
Andreas got up to go open.
He thought there was probably a courier behind the door who was supposed to deliver Christmas gifts for the family that day.
Instead, he was surprised to come at a harsh surprise.
The man he had never seen in his life poured acid on him immediately after opening without warning, saying, "That's for you, my friend."
The pain was indescribable.
My clothes fell apart on me like nothing and I felt only an incredible pain on my skin," Andreas said.
The family rushed him to the hospital, but his loved ones learned the terrible news - he had no chance of surviving, according to the doctors.
A few weeks after the incident, doctors were constantly worried that their patient would succumb to an infection that threatened to penetrate his wounds.
His injury was very serious.
Ninety percent of the face was hit, which doctors tried to put together with the skin of other parts of the patient's body.
A major complication for Christopher was the loss of the eyelids.
It's probably the most heating thing I've ever had.
"You can't hide from unexpected light, you can't close your eyes," he said, describing his misery.
Today, Christopheros has had twelve surgeries behind him, which are far from the last.
The injuries suffered by victims of the attacks with acid may require hundreds of surgical procedures and years of treatment, according to plastic surgeons.
Even after a demanding and long-term treatment, the victims of the tissue have scarred for the rest of their lives.
"Sometimes people don't recover and fight for the whole life against deformity and disfigurement," said Professor Peter Dziewulski, a spokesman for the British Association of Plastic and Aesthetic Surgeons.
The attacker was wrong.
As for the attack, Christopheros is certain the unidentified man must have mistooped him with someone.
The perpetrator believed he was taking revenge for a man who sexually abused his close person.
Police duly investigated the case and eventually found the attacker.
The man was originally sentenced to at least eight years in prison.
However, later, the verdict changed fundamentally to the astonishment of the Christopheros family.
"Three judges eventually concluded that the punishment should be lifted as the man is not considered a threat to the public," said Christopheros.
Over the past few years, the numbers of corrosive agents have increased considerably.
The country's Interior Ministry has commented on the issue as planning to provide new guidance to prosecutors on the classification of corrosive.
These should be classified as dangerous weapons.
However, the victims of such attacks are not about to be surrendered.
They are demanding that the UK government push for tougher and longer prison sentences for people who attack their surroundings with acid or other corrosive substances.
They also require tightening controls on the sale of dangerous substances, which are often commonly available in different shops, as these are different cleaning products.
In the largest city of the United Arab Emirates, Dubai, the famous skyscraper The Torch, which is one of the largest residential buildings in the world, was on fire last night.
According to Dubai's civil defense, the occupants of the 80-story building were evacuated in time and no one was injured.
According to a Dubai police spokesman, a fire broke out on the ninth floor and spread up.
According to several residents of the house, however, it was the other way around.
"It started on the 67th floor, this is how they told us," said one of the tenants.
Also, according to another tenant cited by Reuters, the fire broke out at the top floors and spread down with falling hot debris.
We slept.
We woke up the alarm, people were screaming.
"We were going down the stairs, it took us about ten minutes from the 50th floor," the tenant, George, described the events.
Another witness to CNN estimated that about 40 apartments had engulfed the flames.
On the ground, the fire destroyed at least two cars when burning parts of the building hit them.
After about two hours, according to a civil defense communication, the fire was brought under control.
The cause of its creation is not yet known.
According to witnesses, the current went out in the surrounding buildings.
The large fire was damaged by Dubai's skyscraper The Torch in February 2015, also destroying over a hundred apartments.
There are about 680 apartments in the entire building.
No one was hurt at the time either, as the residents were evacuated in time.
The Torch skyscraper was built in 2011 and then became the world's tallest residential building with its 352 metres.
He was set for a record the following year by another Dubai skyscraper.
The bodybuilder had an astonishing 14 doping substances in his system.
He didn't win anyway.
According to the Corriere della Serra, a sample of 23-year-old Ippolito contained a diverse collection of illicit remedies - from steroids to diuretics to drugs for Parkinson's disease or anorexia.
Paradoxically, even this wild mix did not help him to the title, finishing fourth.
Now the bodybuilder faces a four-year suspension and prosecution.
The record was 11.
Last year, Italian rugby player Davide Vasta tested positive for 11 doping substances, a record amount for athletes caught up to that point.
The third-tier player, he said, began taking steroids the year before when he fell into bodybuilding.
Lucka Vondráčková in the Czech Republic.
She embraced passionately with her former lover!
No sooner had Lucka Vondráčková set foot in the Czech Republic, she is in one round.
And it also draws attention wherever it comes.
The last time she was in the arms of her ex-lover, Michal Dlouhý, with whom she had lived for three years, fell into her arms.
The actor was 12 years older then and already wanted a family.
Lucie was only 19 years old at the time, and she certainly had no desire to hang up on her career.
So they went apart, but they remained friends to this day.
Which they also proved at the TV Prima press conference, where they met after a long time.
By coincidence, the two of them matched into a blue color.
At first they ignored each other, but then they got close, and Lucie laughed at Michael's jokes, to her stomach.
After a hug, they took a hug and posed willingly for the photographers.
Their meeting, however, was no accident, as the couple's lover in the new series Prima, Captain Exner, will play together.
The Islamists were given life in the UK for preparing an assassination.
A British court on Thursday sent four members of the Islamist cell to prison for life, calling the Three Musketeers and planning a terrorist attack against the police and the army, according to the prosecution.
The four men, two of whom attended a training camp in Pakistan and had previously been convicted of similar acts, were arrested last August.
Authorities at the time thought he was going to attack immediately.
In the car of one of the men, security agents found a partially finished pipe bomb, knives with inscriptions that mean "unbelievers" in Arabic, and a mock-up of a pistol.
It happened when an MI5 Secret Service agent was placing a listening device in the car.
"Recent assassinations have shown the horror of the defendants if they were not stopped," said prosecutor Sue Hemming.
Three convicts, aged 28, 25 and 33, may apply for release after 20 years.
The fourth convict, who is 38, can do so after 15 years behind bars.
During the trial in London, the men claimed to be innocent and that the guns found in the car were placed there by an MI5 agent.
The court also heard from him, but then rejected the defendants' claims.
Thursday was the hottest day of the year.
Hodoninsk measured 38.3 °C.
Tuesday's 37.3-degree Celsius temperature record remained at the top for only two days.
With 38.3 degrees Celsius, which were recorded in Strážnice na Hodonínsko, it was surpassed by Thursday, which thus became the hottest day so far this year.
This was confirmed by the staff of the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute.
Compared to Tuesday, however, there were not many temperature records on Thursday.
On Tuesday, records were broken or set to 35 of the 145 weather stations measuring over 30 years.
On Thursday, only nine long-term long-term long-term stations recorded record temperatures.
For example, in Strážnice, Thursday's temperature was the same as the previous record from 2013.
In Lednice, Břeclav on Thursday's 37.4 degrees, it surpassed the original maximum by four-tenths of a degree, and in Pohořelice on Brno the current 37.1 degrees exceeded the record by three-tenths.
Both records, as with Strážnice, came from 2013.
In the west, it was ten degrees lower.
High temperatures occurred mainly in the south and east of Moravia on Thursday.
After Strážnice, the heat was in Dyjákovice in Znojmo and Brod nad Dyjí na Břeclavsku, where the mercury climbed to 37.8 degrees, but did not surpass the record.
By contrast, for example, in western and northwestern Bohemia, Thursday's highest temperatures so far were only around 22 degrees Celsius on Thursday.
"The temperatures started to grow there only later in the afternoon," the meteorologists said.
The current heat in the Czech Republic will gradually subtract, according to the ČHMÚ, and more significant rains could come on Sunday.
In most places of Moravia, however, the high temperatures will remain on Friday and in southeast Moravia on Saturday.
China lacks tourists.
Beijing is losing billions to visa policy.
China has been trying for decades to pursue its influence without using power.
He spends $10 billion a year to support language schools and build universities abroad, pushes his entertainment industry to foreign markets, and tries to attract Western tourists.
But Beijing is failing.
The country's state media are talking about a plan to make tourism the driving force of economic transformation and modernization.
But the number of arrivals grew by only 3.8 percent last year, and some 80 percent of tourists to China came from Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan.
This is due, among other things, to the fact that, despite all its global aspirations, China does not welcome foreigners with open arms, evaluating the situation in the world's most populous country in the world's most populous country, a professor of economics at the University of Beijing, Christopher Balding in an article for Bloomberg.
An example that speaks for everything is the Chinese visa policy.
Only 13 countries have visa-free travel with China, the citizens of the others have to process their visas in advance.
At the Chinese authorities in the US, the crowds are therefore comparable to the Chinese New Year celebrations.
A visa costs $140, but if you don't want to wait for you for long hours in line, you have to pay $100 or more for the extra services.
Such restrictions are building significant economic barriers.
A study by the Journal of Economics and Finance showed that the need for a visa reduces the country's number of visitors by 70 percent.
In 2015, only two million Americans visited mainland China, while Hong Kong, which accounts for less than three percent of China's gross domestic product and lives with less than one percent of all residents, was visited by 1.8 million Americans.
China often exacerbates the problem itself by using tourism to pursue its political goals, such as disputes with Taiwan and South Korea.
In the spring, when China cut back on transport to South Korea as part of a spat over South Korea's anti-missile system, the South Koreans hit back and avoided China.
In May, the number of visits fell by 42 percent year-on-year, while Japan was up 85 percent.
All of this affects macroeconomic stability.
According to a recently published report by the US Federal Reserve, as a result of foreign travel from the Fed, China was able to abandon China as a result of foreign travel, while China receives about $35 billion annually as part of its currency sales to incoming tourists.
According to official figures on the balance of payments, China had a deficit of $217 billion in tourism last year, equivalent to 44 percent of China's entire surplus in the goods trade.
So the small number of tourists are hitting a very painful blow to the country scrupulously blocking the outflow of capital.
However, the aforementioned factors are only one manifestation of more general restraint towards foreigners.
In many places in China, virtually no one has heard of immigrants.
As recently as 2013, there were fewer than a million foreigners living across China.
More are in the United States and some of the individual cities.
Even Japan, which is not exactly a crossroads of immigration, has double that.
Meanwhile, many scientific papers show that immigrants tend to revive economic growth, entrepreneurship, and innovation.
But you can barely find them in China.
It will be politically challenging to solve these problems, but the move to be offered is to simplify the visa apparatus.
Other Asian nations, in particular India and Vietnam, have recently made great efforts to simplify and make visa-enarialisation procedures.
If China wants more foreign tourists and their hard currency, it should be easier for them to get there.
At the Pilsen Zoo, they reproduced the deadly poisonous reptiles.
The Plzeňská Kingdom of the poison can be enjoyed from the cubs of three rare, deadly poisonous reptiles.
In the exhibition, visitors will see only all nine newly born Turkish vomits.
This species is in northern Anatolia, even at an altitude of 2,000 metres.
"It also grows in meter lengths," said zoo spokesman Martin Vobruba.
The chicks of the other two species, the lethal and the red cobra, will be gaining strength in the garden's breeding grounds.
We can't tell when people will see them yet.
"We would not like to lose them," said nurse Miroslav Dohnal, noting that it could take a year or two.
Eight of the Australian deadly saints were born, the offspring of a breeding pair native to the population around Sydney.
"The individual that visitors can see in the exhibit is one of the deadly deadly Perth," Vobruba said, noting that in human care, it is necessary to winter for the deathly to the deathsonos at a temperature of 13 degrees Celsius.
The 100% success was accompanied by a clutch of the African spitning red cobra.
The couple at the Pilsen Zoo was lick out of four eggs by a total of four chicks.
"The incoubation took 65 days," Vobruba said.
This species in nature is sprayed by poison on its victims, up to a distance of up to four metres.
He is aiming for the eyes, it can cause a permanent blindness.
The cubs of all three species feed on the zoo's mouse shave.
Within 40 days in the garden they are still expecting to hatch the cubs from the table of the mamba black, the eggs are stored in the incubator.
According to an unalified rewrite of a telephone conversation, Trump is putting pressure on Mexico to pay for the border wall
The Washington Post has released a transcript of President Trump's phone calls to leaders of Mexico and Australia.
In a January 27 telephone interview with Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto, Trump urged him to stop publicly proclaiming that he would not pay for the construction of the proposed wall.
The US president reproached him for publicly condemning the construction of the wall, supposedly saying, "You can't speak like that in the press."
As part of his campaign, Trump promised to build a wall along the southern border and proclaim that Mexico would pay for it.
A transcript of his first call to Australian Prime Minister, Malcolm Turnbull, has also leaked to the public, revealing a tense exchange of views.
President Trump told Turnbull that the US surveillance agreement for refugees bound for Australia was "narcendous" and "stupid" insisted that if he agreed to such an agreement - which came under President Obama - it would look like a "drugged" banned from the US.
Trump ended the call after he explained to Turnbull that "this is my most unpleasant call of the day."
Tusk testified again at the prosecution for Smolensk.
"He has nothing to fear," the dead president's brother, the chairman of the governing Law and Justice PiS party, Jaroslaw Kaczynski, said in Tusk's address.
"I have nothing to fear, Kaczyński will not hilow me out," Tusk replied, blamed the country's current leadership for trying to use the judiciary against political rivals.
As he left the prosecution's headquarters, a crowd awaited Tusk, according to TVN 24, chanted by Donald Tusk! and wished the politician a Hundred Year!.
Tusk thanked for the support and assured that he had a clear conscience: "I have nothing to fear and Kaczyński will not intiminate me."
He says he does not blame the prosecutors, but he has no doubt that the judiciary is to serve the current Polish rulers as a tool against rivals, opposition or people they dislike, and I fear that I belong to this group.
He was interviewed for the second time.
The ex-Prime Minister was questioned at the prosecution for the second time, this time the interrogation was to be involved in misconduct in the autopsies of the victims of the unleaning disaster.
Additionally, it was discovered to be a substitution of bodies in coffins.
The families were forbidden to open coffins, and there had to be some reasons for that.
And the reason was that they were afraid of the scandal because it would put a strain on Polish-Russian relations.
"Maintaining good relations at all costs, despite such a terrible event, was intended to serve to Donald Tusk becoming someone very important in the EU," Kaczyński claimed on the Catholic television network Trwam.
He added that a possible conflict with Russia would have thwarted Tusk's chances of winning the most important seat in the union, of which Poland has absolutely nothing to do.
At the same time, Kaczyński said he had warned German Chancellor Angela Merkel that things could be different with Donald Tusk, but she ignored it.
Tusk underwent an eight-hour interrogation at the prosecution as early as April 19.
Even then, he did not testify as a suspect, only as a witness.
Nevertheless, many saw his summons for questioning as part of the Polish government's apparent effort by the Polish government and PiS chief Kaczyński to discredit Tusk as a political rival by linking various scandals.
The prosecution is subordinate to the Minister of Justice in Poland, who performs the role of the Attorney-General.
The summons for questioning came soon after the election of Tusk as head of the European Council, whom Kaczyński struggled but tried in vain to prevent, including during a visit to Merkel in Warsaw.
At the EU summit, only Polish Prime Minister Beata Szydlo protested alone against the extension of Tusk's mandate.
In this case, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán also let Warsaw down.
Both Burma and Senegal.
Where can Czechs vote for?
In the autumn parliamentary elections, registered voters will be able to vote newly to vote on the composition of the House from Burma, Senegal or Luxembourg.
In these and several other countries, the Czech Republic has opened its representative offices since the last parliamentary elections held in 2013.
This follows from a decree regulating the supply of ballots abroad.
The State Department has prepared an update to it, and is currently under comment.
Four years ago, 10,000 Czech citizens voted for MPs abroad.
"Since the last amendment to the decree in 2013, there have been some changes that need to be taken into account in these lists," the ministry justifies its procedure.
"New embassy offices were created in some countries, some authorities were closed, or there was a change in the level of representation," the document reads.
The decree contains two annexes, the first of which lists the embassy on which the paper ballots are supplied.
This group of authorities includes representations of the Czech Republic in neighbouring countries, namely Germany, Poland, Austria and Slovakia.
More than a hundred Czech offices will receive a ballot paper in the press version.
It is their list that the decree changes.
Four years ago, Czechs could vote, for example, at the Czech Embassy in Libya or Zimbabwe.
Today, both embassies are closed.
The Czech Republic has also cancelled its representation in Bamako, Malaysia, and Japan's Kyoto.
There will also be no vote at the Consulate General in Donetsk.
The Czech Republic was concluded in 2014 because of the war in eastern Ukraine.
They are now on the list of embassies in Nairobi, Kenya, the Dakar capital of Senegalese and the Lusace, in the Lusace, in the Emestions list.
In Asia, since the last parliamentary elections, the Czech Republic has expanded its representation to include the Consulate General in Irbil, Iraq, and Chengdu, the capital of China's Sichuan Province.
Voters will also be available for registered voters at the Czech embassies in Burma and Cambodia.
Czechs abroad have had the opportunity to choose from members at polling stations at embassy or consulates four times so far.
Ahead of each election, the state election commission will be designated by the draw with a draw for the county whose female candidates are voted abroad.
The first time was in 2002, when the decision was made between the South Moravian candidates.
At the following two elections, the Czechs voted abroad among South Bohemian candidates.
In 2013, the Central Bohemian Region was selected as well as this year.
The number of Czechs voting abroad is steadily increasing.
At the premiere 15 years ago, some 3,800 people came to vote, around 67,700 in 2006, 8222 four years later.
The early House election four years ago came to the embassies of 10,571 voters.
Moore's Ford Bridge massacre: activists commemorate racist lynching
The 1948 Ford Mercury drove past the onlookers of Monroe, Georgia, and bumped toward the Moore's Ford Bridge.
But before the car with four black-skinned passengers and a white driver could reach the bridge, a group of white men with guns blocked his way.
The leader of the group - a middle-aged man in a striped suit - drew a long drag on a cigarette and looked at the windshield of the automobile.
Inside, the passengers trembled with fear.
"We want the n--and Roger!" the man shouted.
"Trave it!"
The silence is interrupted by the roar of a young black man being pulled from the passenger seat.
Fortunately, this scene is merely a reconstruction of the events that took place on July 22.
But when one of the men throws a noose over the "Roger" neck, the audience sighs with excitement.
Since 2005, a group of activists regularly return to the Moore's Ford Bridge, reconstructing the fateful night of 1946, when two black pairs - Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murra Dorsey - were killed by Kukluxklan.
No one has ever been tried to kill.
"It's a wonder that not a single person has been arrested in all these years - even though we still see them in our community; even though we know their identity," said Tyrone Brooks, who is helping to organize the reconstruction of the event.
"It's a stain on our history and a burden in our souls."
Brooks is a 71-year-old former congressman of Georgia and a lifelong civil rights campaigner.
In his eyes, the reconstruction of the event presents a dramatic challenge to take place. Every year, he reminds the city's community of Monroe that justice has not been done enough.
"We demand for prosecution and the conclusion of the case, we want peace in mind and reconciliation, but justice first," said Brooks.
"Until then, the process of recovery and reconciliation cannot be initiated."
The medical examiner covers one of the bodies of the lynching victims at Moore's Ford on July 27, 1946.
According to FBI files that obtained NBC News, up to 50 men from Monroe and surrounding districts were to take part in the lynching.
However, no one has yet been prosecuted.
Despite the fact that the suspects remain free for decades, civil rights supporters claim that both the reasons for the lynching - the policy and the sex - were known to all residents of the city.
In April 1946, following a Supreme Court decision, the residents of the black-skinned Georgia state were given the right to participate in the elections scheduled for the summer.
And it was during the summer elections, according to the FBI, that black-skinned farmer Roger Malcom was supposed to stab the owner of the white-skinned land owner, Barnett Hester - allegedly because of his wife.
In the city, according to Brooks, it was said that Hester had been commating with Malcom's wife, Dorothy, and brought her to a different state.
According to the FBI, on July 25, 1946, the then-prematist owner of the white-skinned land, Loy Harrison, for Malcom, posted bail of $600.
He was accompanied to the prison by Dorothy and cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
On their return from the prison, just before the entrance to the Moore's Ford Bridge, a group of suspects blocked their way.
"As it turns out, the murders were planned and orchestrated by Harrison," the FBI deduced.
"It is also clear that there was a collusion between the state and local law enforcement officers, who not only participated in the lynching but also got rid of the evidence and withholding the identity of the witnesses."
Brooks commented more briefly on the matter.
"It was a massacre for the right to vote," he said.
"The murders had a clear subtext for all the local black people: 'you'll catch this if you register and vote'."
The annual reconstruction of the event at the Moore's Ford Bridge is organized by Cassandra Greene for almost a decade.
Her performance is figurative, engaging and apt. It shows the deep-rooted racism that many would like to find extinct in modern America.
Watching this reconstruction is not easy and even more difficult to avert avert a blind eye, but Greene says it makes sense.
"No one wants to talk about lynching because we have to face the uncomfortable feelings that are hidden in all of us," Greene said.
"But there can be no relationship between us unless you listen to what I had to go through."
The main rehearsals for this year's renovations began in June, and on the first day, approximately 30 actors - a dozen white people, the rest of black people - flocked to the room where Greene introduced them to a very carefully planned performance.
Wade Marbaugh performs the position of assistant director.
He played the leader of Kukluxklan for many years, but in his words the role is exhausting.
"I have a bad feeling about it because it contradicts who I am," Marbaugh said.
"I think it's very important to be reminded of this part of history on a regular basis, because we never want to go back to that time."
Actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascon, who play the role of Roger Malto, or Barnett Hester, rehearse their roles.
The show begins with a scuffle - Malcom argues with Hester and blames him for sleeping with his wife.
"Get off my property n-e!"
Rascona can't be done.
There's a scuffle.
At that moment, everyone (at least every black-skinned actor) explodes in a laugh.
Greene laughs the most.
"What happened?" asks Rascon.
He's confused.
Was I too rude?
"No," Greene says cheerfully.
"I just don't think the whites said 'n--r' in that tone.'
"Exactly," one of the black-skinned actors blurts.
"You must put more emphasis on R."
The energy in the room is suddenly better; the animosity is replaced by a sense of rapprochement.
Everyone wants the show to be authentic, just to be worth enough of the four victims of the massacre.
The actors repeat the scene.
Rascona emphasizes the correct utter of the word on N.
No one's laughing now.
The show ends violently and quickly.
The roar, the gunshots... and the silence.
A woman dressed in black stands over the bodies of the actors, singing Billie Holiday's mournful song "Strange Fruit."
With every word, there's sadness in the room.
Against the backdrop of it all, a dozen onlookers wipe sweat and tears from their eyes.
The audience has virtually the same number of blacks and whites.
One pair arrived all the way from New York's Ithaca, many onlookers from nearby.
Each of them endures the local damp climate for almost eight hours, and Brooks leads them to the graves of Malcolm and Dorsey in a crowd.
Until now, the murders could have been viewed with hindsight, but now, standing in the same place where the lynching took place, the atmosphere is haunting.
With the last words of the song, Greene challenges the crowd of onlookers to inspect the bodies.
Children kneel to the heads of the victims, watch the fake blood and the motionless bodies, whispering to each of them in their ear.
"They're not dead," the little boy says.
A few minutes goes by and Greene will thank the audience.
The actors clean the rope and wip away their tears.
Bradshaw embraces Marbaugh, the man in the suit, who played the leader of the Kukluxklan.
Nick Rascona hugs his two fellow-actor and cries in their arms; in the end, emotions are upon him.
"It's all right," one of the women whispers.
"We know you're in a go-on.
But you had a reason."
Later that day, the audience meets with the actors for dinner.
At one table, the young white couple are talking with enthusiasm about a black couple with a black couple they met today.
Denise Duplinski was barely out of the words to express her feeling at tonight's performance.
"It's difficult to listen to those ugly words and look at those hideous deeds... that are done by people who look like you and do it because they look like you," she said of the reconstruction.
"It makes me realize that lynching is still a topical issue," she added, "it's just called police scuffles."
Across the room, Tyrone Brooks sits in the courtroom, and he's having a sire of dinner while talking about civil rights.
In his own words, he had already started planning the show for the next year.
"The reconstruction of these events is inspiring, as it describes the fear we had to endure - but it is also a moment to think about," he said.
"If we don't learn from it, who knows . . . it could happen again.
People who do not know and study the history of their country are doomed to repeat it."
I love the instructions for use.
A friend of mine says he only reads the instructions for use.
I disagree, on the contrary.
It is one of the modern forms of art, often pure surrealism.
I remember with nostalgia the days of the long past, where the instructions for using anything were more of a rare phenomenon.
For example, my first gramophone contained only one piece of paper with hieroglyphics showing the involvement of some components, all of which were some secret marks.
Years later, when something inside went wrong, I offered the deed to a shaman who was not afraid to unscrew the back of the back.
With a grin, he advised me on what the labyrinth of the sorcery was appropriate for.
Yes, it was a used tool for chronic depletion of toilet paper.
He gracously found a disconnected wire and allowed me to listen to expensive vinyl tortillas again.
The new era brought new instructions.
Even a relatively simple, fruit juicher, where he simply held up the overfed grep, required about ten pictures.
Particularly good was the kink with the description of how to put one part in the other.
The set was two-part, and a different course of action was simply not possible.
Give it in the opposite way took considerable effort to break off certain plastic components.
My contempt for the tutorial ended with my Seat Leon self-propel.
The year of production 2003 still had such a book with the instructions for minor repairs, which included, among other things, the replacement of the blinker light bulb.
It was easy.
A total of three steps and the work was to be done.
Unfortunately, the author of the instructions neglected to state that while the light bulb on the right really only went to replace in three steps.
1. take the cover.
2. unscrewed the cracked bulb and screw a new one.
3. dry the cover.
The bulwoman on the left had a problem in the form of the location of the battery cover.
At first I thought that by sliding the right upper limb into the bowels of the car, I was finding a spring, a screw that would easily push the cover away and then I would follow the points of the 1-3 economical author of the service book.
Mistakes of the catwalk.
The cover had no place, no space, or no space for Cinderella's slender hand, let alone the obessole Silesian.
I've lost half an hour of my life, without any success.
The condition was exacerbated by my wife's entry into the garage, summoned by the roar and the words he hears from my mouth quite exceptionally.
"What are you doing here?" she asked inelinal.
My answer lasted about 90 seconds, however, if I skip the vulgar terms, there were only two published words left.
I'm niping the bulb.
"And why is it taking you so long?" she said, taking a phrase that may be her last in a long-lasting volume.
I slowly explained the problem to her, placing the main emphasis on the process of the torturous of the author of the manual, where the breeze with the hot iron on the hand that she wrote the instructions, then I will beat her to no longer write anything, was merely an introduction to the wide range of instructions of the Witch's Witch's, including his commemorating commemorating on the top above the Losin Castle.
"How about disassembling the box?" the woman said of the battery.
In sheer desperation, this happened and then the Step 1-3 was as easy and quick as the right side.
I thought nothing could surprise me.
This was until the day I got a call from a colleague who was just sifting from a collapsing condition after checking out two female civil servants of the State Drug Enforcement Administration.
I know him as a balanced colleague who has experienced both the possible and the impossible in the business, and who can also tell wild stories in an underky voice.
"Imagine getting a ticket for not having the hand-done instructions posted," he told me in a weak voice.
Gradually, I extract the whole problem out of him, which was that over the sink in the patients' toilet, there was no picture guide to how to wash his hands.
His argument of the commissioner that adults generally know how to wash their hands, and that it doesn't take pictograms to handle the accustomed activities of decent people, did not have a heal effect and cost him a lot of money.
"It's not just that," she told him.
He understood that the simple rinsing of the soapy palm-homed with water was a primitive act on the Cromanon level, that a modern man, Homo sapiens sapiens, performed this ritual in ten steps.
So it is necessary to say that it is necessary to release water from the tap.
The whole process has a total of eleven points, but at the end it is a joyous realization that one has washed one's hands exactly as the SÚKL hosudar orders him to do.
Finally, I must point out that I have been inspired and I am preparing a detailed plan for the work in the toilet.
On the issue of defecation, the procedure is uniform, there is no problem, for urination, given certain differences between the sexes, it will be necessary to post instructions two.
The problem remains the pictograms, as it also means an accurate drawing of all anatomical details, which could arouse some outrage at the prudish toilet visitor, despite finally being able to learn that he has been mocking the opening in a completely flawed throughout his life.
Pearson to lay off an additional 3,000 employees and cuts dividends in an effort to revive trade
British training group Pearson said on Friday that it would lay off an additional 3,000 employees and cut the provisional dividend by 72 percent in response to another restructuring programme to change the business model.
Another wave of redundancies, which, according to Executive Director John Fallon, will take place at the end of 2018 and early 2019, is followed by the company's previous decision to lay off 4,000 employees as part of the previous restructuring.
Pearson announced a plan to cut costs by an additional £300 million ($394 million) in May under a third cost-reduction program in an effort to resurrect declining trade as a result of the rapid development of digital education.
The company, which last month agreed to sell its stake in Penguin Random House to Bertelsmann, said the outlook for this year remained unchanged after announcing a 1% increase in basic sales in the first half of the year to £2.05 billion.
Attack on Kabul convoy: NATO soldiers killed in suicide blast
A suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in the capital of Afghanistan, Kabul. One NATO soldier died in the attack and several others were wounded, officials said.
Five soldiers and an interpreter were injured, NATO's comments are reported.
According to unofficial reports, three civilians also died in the attack in the city district of Qarabagh.
A bomb attack hit Afghanistan this month - more than 30 people were killed in an explosion at a Hediran mosque on Tuesday.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi Embassy in Kabul.
NATO said in its comments that Tuesday's explosion occurred after a patrol, along with members of the Afghan army, was attacked by a "local person with a homemade explosive device."
The statement also said that all the wounded soldiers are out of danger to life and are located in a U.S. military hospital at the Bagram Air Force Base.
According to the rapporteur's comments, the growing power of the Taliban and the group known as the Islamic State (IS) in the Qarabagh region is a significant source of concern for NATO allied forces in nearby Bagram.
According to the United Nations, at least 1662 civilians died in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, of which 20% of the victims died in the capital.
At the end of July, a car bomb killed at least 30 people in Kabul's Shia district.
The attack was claimed by the Taliban.
On May 31, a major explosion in the city centre killed more than 150 people. This is the deadliest militant attack in the country since U.S. troops overthrew the Taliban government in 2001.
The violence is undermining the already dubious situation in Afghanistan, and US President Donald Trump is considering increasing the number of US troops to assist military troops and police officers in the country.
According to the rapporteurs, the suicide attacks to which the schools in recent weeks were shaken by public confidence in the government, its regulations, and especially in the reputation of President Asraph, Ghanin.
In response to the lawsuit, the EPA reconsidered its decision to delay smoking rules
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency revoked its decision to postponement the Obama administration's bill, which mandated states to cut emissions, just a day after 15 states sued the agency.
In the hours of the night on Wednesday, the EPA announced its decision to refer to the "Fashion Standards 2015" with the words of the undertaking, as presenting the Agency's commitment to cooperation with the states.
"We believe in dialogue with our state-lector partners and hear their views," EPA Director Scott Pruitt said in a statement.
In June, Pruitt announced an effort by the EPA to delay ozone standards - which measures real air pollution in specific areas of the country and, based on measurements, determine the limits to be met by October 2018.
A group of fifteen of most Democratic states, along with Washington, D.C., filed the suit on Tuesday on the grounds that the EPA's actions were illegal.
President Donald Trump's administration seeks to prevent many of the environmental regulations proposed by former President Barack Obama - in Trump's words, in an attempt to kick economic growth.
But the new government's efforts have launched countermeasures from Democrats and Conservative groups that fear the impact of emissions on public health.
The EPA states on its website that the breathing of ozone-containing air "may reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms" such as asthma.
Singer Ladislav Bubnár got hit and blood flowed!
You may have already registered this, a relatively new singer in our country, in June of this year, when this hitherto almost unknown singer held a monstrous event for Czech standards, hosting such leading personalities as Master Karel Gott, Lucie Bílá, Simona Krainová and many others, and the event was not provided by anyone other than Leoš Mareš.
The purpose was simple to show himself to the public and present his music video for the song Sara, whose baptism was performed by the just-listed personalities.
Few people already know, however, that the actual recording of the music video, which took place in Russia, was not without its problems and the singer Ladislav Bubnár himself had to be treated.
It was his first major shoot with the stars of the Russian national ballet, and it was not without any real embarrassment.
The song Sara is very emotional and is based on the unfortunate love of two lovers.
For the drama of the scene, in the music video of the singer's rival, he was to hint at the slapping of the slaps.
At one point, however, he hit him so hard and squarely on the nose that the young singer had to be treated by doctors.
"It was a blow, I didn't expect it, my nose was immediately started with blood," Ladislav commented on the situation.
Colleagues and producers told the situation on the set that it was an accident and Ladislav did not react in time.
Fortunately, the injury was not serious enough to affect the sequel in the next shoot.
We now bring you the young artist's music video, you can also record the punching scene.
The failed version of the blood, however, was not used.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomacenko spoke at the meeting about the possibilities of a mutual duel
Vasyl Lomacenko and Mikey Garcia, two fighters who could stage the most exciting boxing boxing match in the lightweight, met for the first time at a meeting on Tuesday.
Each of them was in a separate room in ESPN's offices in Los Angeles until Garcia - the undefeated lightweight champion World Boxing Council - went down to the hall where he welcomed Lomacenko, the World Boxing Organization champion.
After Garcia's victory on the unanimous decision against former four-time world champion Adrien Broner in Saturday's Showtime match, both boxers made the list of the top five lightweight boxers.
Shutus coiled his right hand and said, "How's it going, Champion?
Good luck."
Lomacenko defends his 19-000s title against Miguel Marriaga at ESPN on Saturday.
Boxers pose for photographers, and manager Lomacenka Egis Klimas adds that a potential boxer fight would be a "perfect test."
"I'm a former featherweight champion," Garcia adds.
"I had to gain weight in the Broner (67 kg) but I'm not that big.
At my 63kg I'm small.
I'd like to get back into the lightweight category.
The Lomachenko has to gain weight back to get on a lightweight... then we can compete.
The fans are craving that.
Why not deliver it to them."
Lomacenko agrees.
"Box would be good for this fight."
Klimas has made a request for a payment for viewing - which is part of his strategy. Lomachenko should make his lightweight debut at the end of this year and next year's matchup with Garcia (37-0, 30 knockouts), who also expressed interest in the match against the winner of the duo Jorge Linares vs. Luke Campbell, who will compete on September 23 for the Lightweight title in the Forum Arena.
"The match should be done in the style of the payment for viewing, that's what the fans demand," said Garcia, who later said that he was open to the opportunity to broadcast the match through a television station that would come up with the best offer.
"We're the main attraction.
No one else draws such attention.
We'll wait for the right opportunity . . ."
Garcia said he recognized Lomacko as an "amazing boxer" and could take part in his Saturday night's match.
But Lomacenko didn't give Garcia the praise of the lulled-down when he said that the champion of the three divisions of Riverside looked "very slow... sorry, Mike, but you're asking for a knockout."
Garcia said his goal was to show strength and then boxing.
Both boxers said they felt the rising tension ahead of the mutual duel.
"You don't forget this fight.
No other fight draws as much attention to itself.
And I will have a great delight to put it in the fire,' said Garcia.
Lomacenko said, "I've been waiting for the best boxers, and this is Mikey."
It's going to be a great match."
The young couple disappeared without a trace 12 years ago.
Their car was found at the bottom of the Volga.
A pair of young Russians, Ilya Zhirnov and Kira Cherkasova, had been reported missing since December 2005.
There was an extensive search for them, only without success.
And the police eventually closed the investigation for lack of evidence.
The lost couple's families were in the dark that they would not know what had happened to the couple.
After 12 years, the sad ending of the story came.
The wreckage of their car was found by a lay diver at the bottom of the Volga River in the town of Cheboksary in Zhewashsk.
Only thanks to the documents left in the car, the officers were able to identify the couple.
The papers survived a decade underwater, without which it would take the police to find out the identities of the found much longer.
The couple was last seen when Zhirnov borrowed a car from his father to pick up his girlfriend from work.
The diver who discovered the car, remains anonymous.
He reported his discovery to the Cheboksar police, who dragged the car to the beach the following day.
Investigators believe the young couple's death was an accident caused by a frozen road that led to the river.
However, the investigation continues, with further details to be released after it is completed.
Latest test results to set the age limit for asylum applications in Sweden
The latest test results for asylum seekers in Sweden, who were subjected to the new age-judging method, show that over 80 per cent of people were over-18s, but not everyone believes in their accuracy.
Sweden's Forensic Medical Agency (RÃ¤ttsmedicinalverket) began conducting the new tests at the beginning of this year.
The aim of the method is to make a more precise assessment of candidates in the evaluation of asylum applications. The measure was taken after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket) was criticised for failing to determine the right age of some of the refugees who lied about their age.
To date, the Swedish Migration Agency has forwarded to 6880 cases for investigation, and the Forensic Medical Agency has now published the results of a total of 2481 tests, conducted from mid-March to 31 July 2017.
80 per cent (2002) were judged to be over the age of 18, while in a further 25 cases the Forensic Medical Agency concluded that the intervieweed was "perhaps over the age of 18.
In another 423 cases, it was decided that the intervieweed was "perhaps under the age of 18.
Tests are only taken when the age of the intervieweed is questionable.
According to Johan GÃ¶ransson of the Forensic Medical Agency, the results correspond with the previous month.
"Compared to last month, the statistics are kept in the run-in and the numbers are very similar," he told The Local.
A higher number of female applicants whose age has been estimated to be over the age of 18 does not necessarily mean that asylum seekers are lying about their age.
In May, the Agency published the results of 581 tests and said that in 442 cases it was found that "the person in question is 18 years or older."
The Svenska Dagbladet newspaper investigated 581 published cases and found that in 243 cases the interglainer said it would be 18 this year.
The medical method of age determination, which includes X-ray of wisdom teeth and MRI, was also criticized by a knee joint scan, which are then assessed by dentists and X-rays.
One of the skeptics is Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute, who, among other things, deals with assessing people's biological maturity to determine the age at which he passed her puberty.
"I had a reason to think about this issue and I don't think these types of age-measuring are correct.
The assessment of the biological age is, in a sense, very uncertain.
If we cannot determine the age with precision, we should not pretend otherwise," Metro told the newspaper.
The Forensic Medical Agency's GÃ¶jansson defended the decision by saying: "In general, the risk of incorrect assessment of a child as an adult is small.
The highest risk is that the person questioned is just under the age of 18, which in this case corresponds to 10 per cent of all interviewees.’
Trump threatened the president of Mexico on the phone.
In a January phone call to Mexican President Enrique Pee Pete Niet, US President Donald Trump threatened not to meet him unless he publicly said that his country would not pay to build a wall between the US and Mexico.
Trump said in the interview that the funding would be arranged somehow, although he admitted that it would have to be secured from other sources.
Trump spoke similarly openly with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull.
This is according to transcripts of interviews published by The Washington Post on Thursday.
Trump has made the construction of a wall on the southern border for Mexican money with one of the main promises in his election campaign last year.
In his first interview with the Mexican president shortly after taking office, Trump chastised Nieto undiplomatically for criticizing his plan to build the wall.
He portlacted a south neighbor as a growing political problem and pressured the Mexican president not to publicly say that his government would never pay for the wall.
"You can't tell the press this," Trump said repeatedly in an interview on January 27, threaten to cut off contacts with the Mexican president if he continued to make defunitive statements.
Funding is said to be devised in some way, and in the end it will turn out well.
"But if you say that Mexico won't pay for the wall, then I don't want to see you gentlemen anymore because that's unacceptable to me," he said, according to the US daily Trump.
He described the Wall as the least important thing we're talking about, but politically, perhaps, it is the most important.
The executive order to build the wall was issued by Trump shortly after the takeover.
Mexico rejects the construction and financing of the wall 3200 kilometers, which has also escalated relations between the two countries.
In late March, Trump said the project would be paid for by the United States for the meantime.
Trump eventually met his Mexican counterpart for the first time at the G20 summit in Hamburg in July.
The Washington Post also reported on Trump's telephone interview with Australian Prime Minister Turnbull on January 28.
The White House official called the conversation ridiculous.
To conclude, he was prompted by an exchange of views on the agreement that Australia would grant asylum to Central American refugees in exchange for the United States of receiving people from internment facilities in the Pacific Island States.
Trump initially considered the deal to be stupid, but later agreed to it.
"You can certainly say that this is not the deal you have created, but you will have to stick to it," Turnbull told Trump.
In some passages, a phone conversation with Turnbull was almost jovial, for example, when Trump praised the Australian refusal to accept in boats as a good idea.
"You're worse than me," Trump joked.
Suddenly, however, the tone of the conversation escaled.
"I hate hiring these people," Trump observed.
I assure you, they're bad.
That's why they're in jail now.
"They won't be great people who will go to work for the local dairymen," he said.
He also noted in the interview that the fugitive could become a Boston bomber in five years.
Trump conducted telephone conversations with a number of world statesmen at the end of January, about a week after arriving at the White House, with a number of world statesmen, often several times in one day.
He eventually called the Turnbull's call the least pleasant one the day.
Before he ended it, he highlighted that he had previously had a pleasant conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Outside the crowd, the Rana Killer was executed.
Her father was also watching.
The execution took place in the square in the capital Yemen, Sana.
Muhammad al-Maghrabi chose as his sacrifice the little Ran Almatari, who lived in his neighborhood.
Al Maghrabi kidnapped the girl, took the girl to his father's house, where he raped her and strangled her with his bare hands.
He subsequently raped her body, which he dumped near the mosque.
The violent death of a small girl has struck an entire country facing the threat of civil war.
Yahya Almatari stood in the front row of the 1,000-strong crowd that had come to witness the execution.
Muhammad al Maghrabi was convicted under Sharia law.
The victim's father told the media of his feelings after the execution.
I feel like I'm reborn.
I'm relieved.
It's the new day of my life.
Other family members were also present, shouting the slogan "Long live justice" with the crowd.
The rapist was brought to the square by a police van from which he was dragged out.
The cops put it on his stomach, tied up.
One of the officers turned his weapon against him and launched fire from point-blank range.
The crowd present celebrated every blow that had been fired.
Mr Al Almatari told the MailOnline website that justice had been done in accordance with the country's legal system.
"Justice, Alah and Sharia law have won," he added.
I stood in the Liberation Square in Sanda and waited for the execution of my daughter's killer.
Then my family and I went to the morgue.
We took Ran's tiny little body and buried him in a nearby cemetery.
I and my wife, Jamileh, are grateful that justice has been done.
Police feared that the crowd gathered in the square would fall into hateful madness, grab the killer and lynch the killer.
The execution was ordered by a court under the administration of the Shiite Houthis.
Originally, however, Maghrabi was sentenced to 100 lashes immediately after his arrest, but his actions aroused such outrage that the judge decided to give the death penalty.
Al Maghrabi was arrested two days after the girl's disappearance on June 27.
Ran's family knew him well.
When police searched the basement of his home, they discovered evidence that the man had planned his actions.
Mr. Almatari described him as a monster.
What could have been his motive?
Even an animal would be more merciful to Rana.
"Our family has no enemies, and the injuries that carried Ran's body were terrible," he told the media.
"Rana disappeared in the afternoon, we reported it to the police that day, we told the newspaper and to all our TV stations, posters with her picture hung everywhere," he continued.
They all believe the police received a tip from the killer's parents, who suspected their son of the horrific crime.
The girl's mother, Jamileh, had to be hospitalized after learning that her daughter's body had been found.
Rana used to play out with the other kids in the neighborhood.
After 10-15 minutes, I went out to see where he was.
We searched everywhere, but Rana was gone.
We walked around our block, our friends took cars and drove around the neighborhood, but we searched in vain.
The people of Yemen were disgusted with the crime and began to gather outside the police station where al Maghrabi was held and demanded an immediate sentence.
A representative of the Ministry of Justice read the crowd present a recording of the investigation to reassure them.
The accused did not seem to have shown remorse for his actions.
Just before his sentence, the officers read him the verdict, but the convict only glanced at his executioner.
The whole event was filmed for national television, but there were many of the footage posted online by the crowd.
West Virginia Governor announces change of political party
On Thursday evening, the Democratic governor of West Virginia, Jim Justice, announced at President Trump's rally that he was moving to another party.
"Whether you like it or not, the Democrats have turned their backs on me," the Justice Governor said.
"Today, after a long prayer and a second thought, I announce to you . . . today as a resident of West Virginia, I tell you that I cannot continue to support you as Democratic Governor."
The encendingers' descent exploded in joy.
"I'll subscribe to the Republicans tomorrow," Justice added.
"As a coach, I can tell you it's time to jump into another game."
Trump had previously promised people an important announcement at a rally in West Virginia.
Trump won in West Virginia with 42 points and Justice did not support Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.
The justice, which according to Forbes magazine is the only billionaire in the country, was elected in 2016.
Forbes adds that the Justice inherited a large fortune from his father and is the owner of several coal mines.
The value of his assets is estimated at $1.59 billion.
Meanwhile, the Republican National Committee issued a statement on Thursday night saying: "The removal of the Governor of the Justice is another blow to the Democratic Party that puts obstacles in our way, rather than doing it to raise our country."
"For a Democratic Party that has only 15 governors and controls the fewest legislative bodies in history, the Governor Justice's announcement is the last straw for an already wrey, leaderless party that seeks in vain to find positive and unifying reports," R&N chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said in her statement to CBS News.
Sebastian Coe praises Russia's 'sincere' apology for doping scandal
Former outstanding athlete Sebastian Coe praised Russia on Thursday for his sincere apology for the doping scandal, but reiterated that it has not yet been the right time to return Russia to the sporting world.
The head of Russian athletics, Dmitry Shylakutin, said on the occasion of the IAAF Congress - which took place on the eve of the World Championships in Athletics - that the expulsion of his country from the world of sport was right and that he was determined to fight doping.
He apologized to "all the athletes who lost their gold and silver medals in this way."
Despite his comments, members of the IAAF Congress voted in favour of maintaining the ban, which came into force in November 2015 after a report by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) revealed that Russia supported doping of its athletes.
"I think we have seen a very sincere response and presentation today," IAAF President Sebastian Coe told reporters.
"All the members of the council and congress were pleasantly surprised that Russia admitted its mistake and was working with all its strength to correct and restore the proper function of the entire federation."
Coe said he was also "a delighted" that Russia had adopted the criteria for its reintroduction.
"I think today has been very successful and we have advanced to the next stage, but the congress supports the Emergency Staff Recommendation to maintain the punishment that has been cast on Russia," Coe added.
"We must do everything we can to stabilise the situation in the coming months.
Our aim has always been to separate honest athletes from the dishonest," he said, ending his speech.
At the World Championships in Athletics, which starts on Friday in London, 19 Russian athletes who have complied with the strict IAAF will compete under the neutral flag.
IAAF's head of emergency staff, Rune Andersen, said on Monday that Russia still had to meet several criteria before it was allowed back.
Drug-turning tests are still unsatisfactory and the expelled coaches continue to do their business, he told reporters in London after the IAAF's presentation.
The state contract CzechTrade was awarded to the company František Savov, whose state is prosecuting.
The public contract of the state pro-export agency CzechTrade was awarded to the publishing house Mladá fronta František Savov.
Officials awarded him a hundred percent of the points in all qualitative criteria.
They did not mind that the Czech state prosecuted Savov for tax fraud and demanded his extradition to the Czech Republic.
The pro-export agency of the Ministry of Industry and Trade CzechTrade announced a public contract in April for the four-year provision of editorial content for the BusinessInfo portal.
The contract, worth a total of CZK 30.8 million, was awarded to the publishing house Mladá fronta of entrepreneur František Savov.
He was accused by Czech police in 2014 of tax evasion and is being prosecuted on the run.
Savov fled to the UK and the Czech Republic is asking for his extradition.
The case was brought to the attention of Aktuálně.cz.
The award of the contract was to be decided by the CzechTrade according to the original criteria of the award from the 60 percent offered price and, of the remaining 40, the quality of the project.
It was Savov's company that helped significantly by the latter criterion.
According to information from Dotyk.cz received one hundred points in all the partial quality criteria.
This is what the result moved her to another candidate, the Vltava Labe publishing house, the Elbe VLM, which offered a better price.
While Mladá fronta operated with an amount of CZK 404,900 per month, the VLM offered CZK 324,350.
Unlike the Young Front, however, it received a below-average rating from the assessors in all the qualitative criteria, a total of 62 points.
The tender was also attended by consultancy firm BDO Advisory and the digital agency R-Media, which, like Aktuálně.cz, falls under the publisher Economia.
VLM issued several objections to the outcome of the tender, saying that its evaluation was considered by the nza unfair and insufficiently reasoned.
After their rejection, it decided to challenge the competition with the Office for the Protection of Competition of the Office of the Office of the COD.
He believes that CzechTrade acted in violation of the law.
"The promoter is convinced that the contracting authority has reached a decision on the selection of a public contract contractor on the basis of a purely subjective evaluation, clearly the favoured participant Mladá fronta, a.s., to the detriment of the promoter and other suppliers," reads the application for the initiation of the proceedings filed at the OHS this week, which was published by the news server Aktuálně.
According to the CEO and Chairman of the Board of Directors of the VLM, Michal Klíma, the scoring of the selection committee seems to be an impreckled and 100% evaluation of the Young Front project for all of its members as extremely suspicious.
"Any independent observer must consider such a miraculous success of one of the competitors to be unlikely and suspicious," Klíma told Aktuálně.
CzechTrade has not yet commented on the situation.
The CzechTrade news agency does not comment on public contracts before they are closed.
All information about the contract you mentioned is published in accordance with the Act in the Profil of the Clien and in the Public Procurement Bulletin.
"A complete written report will be published after the contract is terminated, but we cannot comment on its progress during the duration of the contract," the agency's media representative, Štěpán Dlouhý, told Dotyk.cz.
The young front responded by saying that it considers it extremely problematic that the publisher Economia hit the publisher with an article in Aktuálně.cz in a competition where it has its own business interests.
However, this was stated in that article.
The fact that she was the one providing editorial services to BusinessInfo for the previous four years might have helped her to the BusinessInfo portal.
The contract was first tendered in 2013, when the Ministry of Industry and Trade was led by Martim Kuba ODS.
František Savov is blamed by the police for tax evasion in connection with the excessive VAT deductions of his companies, which caused the Czech state to alleged damage of up to 770 million crowns.
The Czech Republic has been asking the UK for its extradition since 2014.
According to Savov, the head of the ANO movement, Andrej Babiš, whose influence falls to the publishing house Mafra, is behind his criminalization.
A London court last year rejected Savov's appeal against the extradition, but the businessman appealed.
"From our point of view, the case has not moved anywhere since last year, we have not received any notification from the UK in the matter of the legal force of the judgment to date," Štěpánka Zenklová, spokesperson for the Prague City Prosecutor's Office, told Aktuálně.cz.
In addition to owning Mladá fronta, Savov was in the Cyprus-based company Harvestor Limited, which controlled the Samson brewery in České Budějovice, and the Cypriot company Maraflex, which is profiled as an investment fund, buying the assets at risk.
He should also control the bankrupt Heavy Machinery Services, formerly Legios, which owes over three billion crowns.
In the past, Savov was also associated with the transfer of property from the former Socialist Youth League.
The biker drove along the sidewalks and the park, ending up in somersaults.
The biker drew attention to himself by driving unscrupulous in the streets, sidewalks and park paths in Úšovice.
When the patrol began to pursue him, he decided to outrun her in the direction of the Station.
"Police officers chased the man with increased caution through the city when he failed to drive on one of the secondary roads behind Mariánské Lázně and drove the motorcycle into the field where he crashed," police spokesman Daniel Dvořák said.
A rescue helicopter had to arrive at the accident, which transported the injured biker to the Pilsen hospital.
Eventually, officers discovered that the biker did not own a driver's license, the motorcycle registration plates had been stolen, his serial number honed and the production label itself removed.
It's possible the machine was stolen.
The origin of the motorcycle is under further investigation.
"The breathalyzer test was excluded at the scene of the driver's alcohol, but the test found a positive result for the substance methamphetamine," the police spokesman added.
How football's financial rules will affect Neymar's move to Paris
The rules restricting the funding of European football clubs will not interfin at Neymar's record-breaking transfer from Barcelona, Spain, to Paris-Saint Germain, France.
Any penalty for Paris Saint-Germain will be implemented by the EUFA, which oversees European football teams and has the authority to ban teams from participating in the prestigious Champions League.
The Financial Fair Play Play (FFP) rules , introduced by UEFA in 2011 stipulates that PSG will have to demonstrate that Neymar's transfer was not financed without major losses.
Barcelona paid a sum of EUR 222 million alone to buy Neymar out of his contract and Neymar will claim a salary of several tens of millions of dollars a year.
There are several financial terms of Neyharro's transfer to France.
With the PSG team funded by a wealthy Qatari family that made their fortune in energy sales, they can afford to bring Neymar into an already star football family.
Clubs can spend huge sums to buy players, but on the other hand, they have to prove legal sources of income, allowing them to cover the overheads of the business activities related to football.
The FFP was introduced by Michel Platini, following the appointment of a UEFA director in 2007.
The former French player believed that clubs that take on debt in pursuit of new reinforcements ultimately cheat and risk bankruptcy if the banks or the owners refused to secure them.
In 2011, the FFP redirected its attention from club debts to monitoring their losses.
This change meant that the business model used by Roman Abramovich with Chelsea in 2003 - buying a club with potential and spending exorbitant sums on players y to build a global brand - was suddenly not so advantageous.
Under the current three-year trial period, which will end in 2018, the clubs may report a loss of up to EUR 30 million.
And despite Platini's due exit from his post in 2015, his successor, Aleksander Cheferin, is determined to advocate a ban on over-sum spent.
"The FFP rules are still in place and we are committed to strengthening them in the future," Andrea Traverso, who oversees compliance with the FFP rules, told the Associated Press last week.
Although PSG paid the amount for the redemption of Neymar in a one-off payment, it can spread the amount for the purposes of the accounts over the entire duration of the contract.
Neymar has signed a five-year contract, so the transfer can be broken down into €44.4 million each year for five years.
The first wave of the FFP's highest sanctions was hit by PSG in 2014, along with Manchester City, which is owned by the Abu Dhabi group.
PSG took a €60 million ($82 million) fine - which was later reduced to EUR 20 million - and an order to reduce the Champions League team to 21 players in the 2014-2015 season, instead of 25 players.
UEFA is wary of teams that can attempt to circumvent financial regulators by increasing their income through club-related companies.
Thus, even if the Qatari company sponsors PSG, once the funding exceeds the standard market rate, UEFA has the right to prohibit the bill of bill.
A similar measure was taken by UEFA in 2014 after deciding that the amount of funding provided by the PSG Qatar Tourism Authority to the PSG team.
Part of the Neymar's income at PSG could be reimbursed by the 2022 FIFA World Cup Organising Commission in Qatar, according to some reports.
However, PSG and the leaders of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar have denied the fat that Neymat should become an ambassador for the World Cup in football and that such a maneuver would be easily exposed by UEFA officials.
Previous sanctions cast on PSG mean that UEFA will closely monitor any attempt to circumvent the rules,
According to the insider-initiated UEFA on Tuesday, no investigation was initiated in the matter of Neymar's transfer to the PSG.
The source of the report wished to remain anonymous as it is not authorized to comment on the PSG situation, The Associated Press reported.
The latest published accounts show that PSG closed 2015-2016 with a net profit of EUR 10 million and a turnover of EUR 542.4 million.
The accounts for the current financial year have not yet been made public.
PSG expects the arrival of Neymar to be a huge opportunity for sponsors, merchandising and jersey sales.
The club promises to increase its turnover by up to 30 percent from the signing of the contract.
Representatives of the Spanish league, clearly alarmed by the departure of one of the biggest stars, sought to thwart Neymar's departure, arguing that PSG would break the FFP rules.
"This is a clear case of 'financial doping' for both the club and the state,' said the president of the Liga, Javier Teba, for the Spanish newspaper AS, referring to the ownership of the PSG club by the Qatari syndicate.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, whose club is owned by the American sports magnate, shares the same stance for La Liga's funding for the club.
"This is the result of ownership that has changed the football world from the ground up in the last 15 years," Wenger said on Thursday.
"Once the state becomes the owner of the club, anything is possible.
Compliance with the rules of financial fair is very difficult as the state can have different interests in the participation of such players in its club."
Spartan midfielder Rosicky: The changes are painful, but we have to believe.
Sixteen thousand applauding fans on their feet.
Tomáš Rosický is going to the set.
The same sketch as in Sunday's match against Bohemians.
The Spartans midfielder stirred up the game against Cricket, inventing a few goals, but his teammates did not go to the black.
The Leten team, pumped up by new multimillion-dollar reinforcements, is thus out of the opening double-header in the European Cup.
Was it hard to do anything else with the match after the Belgrade goal?
After the goal was scored four, which was difficult for us.
We wanted to at least not lose, to boost our confidence to bounce back from the next few games.
We had some chances.
We have to work together as a team and move our game.
Why couldn't Sparta get into the match for so long?
The game is so worked.
The combination of the opponent was much better than ours.
We didn't get to anything, we shot out at half-time, like, once.
That's an awful little, of course, to win by two or three goals.
The second half was much better, we managed to play with them in the final third.
But you have to push your opponent into such positions more often.
Is the problem a large number of lineup changes?
Of course, it's one of the pains when a new team is being formed.
We've only played three competitive matches and the line-up is always changing.
It's about the coach finding the ideal eleven to sit down.
Is it a boost for you to have played the two matches in a row?
They're still just parts of the match.
I don't know how my condition will evolve and when I can play from the beginning.
Are you still optimistic about the changes that have taken place in Sparta?
We have to be, there's no other way.
It's the same as an injury.
If you don't believe, you can't go back.
Sparta has somehow decided, we have to be optimistic, otherwise the situation will be even worse.
The fans came back in large numbers, but they were leaving in embarrassed terms.
What can you say to them?
There was an amazing visit again, as well as with Bohemia.
I am terribly sorry that we cannot please them with a better performance.
Toric to show something that's going to come for next.
We can thank them for coming.
I don't remember such visits when I played here 15 years ago.
Can a season without cups at least be an advantage for the league?
So far we are fighting ourselves, we are playing, so it is not such an advantage for us.
For an extreme tax evasion, the entrepreneur is to serve ten years.
The Constitutional Court rejected the complaint of businessman Jiří Toman, who is to serve ten years in prison for tax evasion to a significant extent.
The estimated damage amounts to CZK 645 million.
Toman claimed in the complaint that the judiciary had violated his fundamental rights, the factual findings of the courts in Zlín and Olomouc were said to be incomplete.
Constitutional judges, however, ruled the complaint to be unfounded, the Czech News Agency found from the court's database.
The CPS is not another appeals court.
"It cannot, as a fourth instance, assesses as legal errors of fact or of law allegedly committed by the ordinary courts if they do not constitute a violation of constitutionally protected rights and freedoms," according to the order.
Toman was tried as a fugitive.
The verdict has been final since November 2015, when it was upheld by the High Court in Olomouc.
At the time, Toman was in extradition custody in Argentina, where the resolution said he was also in the time of the ÚS's decision-making.
The sentence being sued is at the upper limit of the statutory rate, which according to the verdict corresponds to the damage suffered.
The High Court described the case as an extreme tax evasion that has a macroeconomic impact on the state budget.
The man served as Chairman of the Board of Directors of World Servis from 2005 to 2008.
The CZK 645 million was incurred for the period from January to July, the total leak, according to the expert, was more than a billion.
For procedural reasons, however, it was no longer possible to judge Toman for the entire amount.
According to the indictment, World Servis did not include all invoices in its tax returns.
Instead of the monthly VAT and excise duties of at least tens of millions of crowns, it paid taxes in just the hundreds of thousands.
World Servis and some of the companies with which the company traded a relationship with businessman Radomír Vybíral, who was fined 13 years in prison by the judiciary for the VAT machinations of fuel deals.
His complaint was also rejected by the Constitutional Court some time ago.
The series "Lon the toll to the Unvictour" and "Comrade Detective" play a nostalgic chord
This iteration of the story is nostalgic for the famous '80s characters; and for the filthy '90s (when the geniners David Wain and Michael Showalter introduced the comedy skeleton "The State" on MTV); and, of course, for the modern age, namely 2001, before stars like Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd scattered to larger projects.
As a cultural artifact, it is a light parody and, at the same time, the embodiment of our modern Facebook era of permanent memories.
From the franchise's point of view, however, it looks like someone is running out of breath.
The "First Day of Camp" worked surprisingly well - not just because of its absurd humor (an example, the story of the creation of a talking can of vegetable speaker voiced by H. Jon Benjamin) can be an example.
The authors have moved away from the main funny punchline - middle-aged actors who play teenage horny children - and could not make fun of previous events.
The sequel to "Ten Years Later," in which adults play adults do not push the emotional plane so much and the satire is sporadic in places, including a parody of the '90s thrillers as "The Colon's Science."
At one point, the character finds the Apple Powerbook, a roller skater, and "a lot of other things from 1991" in a pile of junk.
Many of the main storylines are repeated.
The good-hearted Coop (Mr. Showalter), now a writer, has still not transcensed over his love for Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) is still a virgin.
Not to mention the crazy plot that involves Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter), which is being sparled by George H. W. Bush (very well-castled Michael Ian Black).
As always, many incidental stories are the best part of the franchise.
It is particularly amusing to watch the perpetually young Rudd with long hair, aka the character of Matt Dillon from the film Youth, whose once-spectable Andy's once-spectable character is now behind the old peppers.
The Franchise could be kick-started with moments of accidental madness, like the returning "Seven Up" series, until it reaches what I assume will be a logical denouement: "Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later," when in the last scene the group will embar on the premiere of "Léta to Fall to Failor to Overwin."
Meanwhile, "Comrade Detective" appeals to another type of nostalgia on Amazon: the Cold War revivalism of "Such Normal Americans," the film "Atomic Blonde: No Punish" and even the series "GLOW" in which icons of the Eastern and Western Wrestling scenes clash.
The comedy by the creators of Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanak, directed by Rhys Thomas, is to feature a television production: a drama about two Bucharest police officers from Romania of the 1980s who fight for truth and atheism in the manner of Marxism-Leninism.
The roles - the tough Gregor and the idealistic Iosf - are starring Florin Piersic Jr. and Cornelia Street, dubbed the English language of Channing Tatum (performance producer of the series) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
It's a wonderful idea.
Unfortunately, it's not much more than that.
At some of the jokes, you laugh (like policemen watching chess on TV - a parody of American football).
The series was lent its voice to many well-known actors - among them Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny.
But "Comrade Detective" is too focused on the cnon propaganda drama - which includes a Reagan-mask killer - and that's what it looks like.
Six long episodes are too long-dimmorning, and comedy moments aren't enough.
At a shorter footage, the propaganda satire in "Comrade Detective" could work, such as in the scene, with Gregor and Iosef repeatedly visiting the US Embassy, in whose hall two fat men gushers gushers stacked in a large pile.
A clear message for the imaginary communist audience is the fact that Western culture can turn everything into food and orgies.
The Romanian creators were not wrong: we do so with our own culture, as well as with theirs.
Russian athletes were not forthcoming to lift the IAAF launch ban.
At a congress in London, the IAAF International Athletics Federation confirmed an extension of the international ban on the start of Russian competitors due to a state-sponsored doping programme.
Voting at the venue of the world championship, which will start on Friday, was predictably very clear.
166 delegates were in favour of extending the ban, with only 21 votes against.
The main reason for the rejection is primarily that Russia is failing to meet all the requirements for the introduction of the anti-doping system, as the head of the IAAAF Special Investigative Investigation Group, Rune Andersen, noted before the congress.
His group recommended that the ban should continue to take a long way.
Some of the older doping cases remain unresolved, a number of suspected athletes have not yet been interviewed, and coaches are still working in the country with a damaged reputation.
Nor is the Russian RUSADA Russian Anti-Doping Agency, which does not meet the standards of the World Anti-Doping Agency, yet.
Nevertheless, RUSADA can already carry out testing under the supervision of foreign experts and the British Anti-Doping Agency.
"Even though progress has been made, there is still a lot of work to be done," said IAAAF President Sebastian Coe.
The Russian Athletics Federation was suspended in November 2015, with Russian athletes losing, among other things, to the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro last year.
Despite the ban on the upcoming World Championships, 19 Russians will participate, having previously shown that they have been tested outside of the Russian anti-doping system for a long time.
However, they will not be able to start in the national colours in the Championship and will not play them the Russian anthem in the event of victory.
Bank of England to keep interest rate at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce that the interest rate will remain unchanged, followed by lacklustre economic growth and inflation depreciation, which has choked speculation about a sharp rise.
The Bank of England warned that economic growth would remain "in the backside" in the context of maintaining the interest rate - despite the wreek of family budgets.
Political officials of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the Bank of England voted six to two to maintain the interest rate at 0.25%. The results of the vote for the interest rate increase supported by unimpressive economic growth, backed by a weak increase.
In its annual inflation report, the Bank forecasted growth to 1.7% in 2017 and 1.6% in 2018, warning that family budget cuts would continue. The Bank expects inflation to rise to 3% in the autumn.
At the same time, the Bank indicated that growth should be increased over the next few years as a result of inflation caused by Brexit, as well as saying that rents on movables should increase in financial markets more than expected.
Committee members also voted to withdraw part of the mammoth package to boost the economy, which was put into practice a year ago in response to Brexit.
As a result of the above, the Terminating Financing Plan, which will offer cheap subsidies to banks, should start from next February, although the Bank of England said it would now offer £15 billion less than the planned £115 billion.
Just before the decision, the Bank said: "The MCP predicts that gross domestic product (GDP) will stagnate in the short term, along with pressure on real household incomes and a burden on consumption."
On the rate, the Bank said it would be necessary to "tend up its money policy" to calm inflation, and this is "at a higher rate" than markets expect.
Markets are currently forecasting a first increase in the third quarter of next year and a further increase in 2020.
However, the Bank stressed that any increase would be "free" and "restricted."
The Bank's growth forecast for this year and the next year has been down compared to 1.9% and 1.7% predicted in May.
The projected growth in 2018 at a value of 1.8% remained unchanged.
Following the disclosure of estimates, the pound fell against the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell by 0.5% to $1.31 and 0.4% to 1.11 euros.
The decision to maintain the status quo came after the disappointing increase buried hopes for further growth - GDP stopped at 0.3% in the second quarter, compared to 0.2% from the previous three months.
The increase is likely to remain at 0.3% in the third quarter, although the Bank said it should increase slightly towards the end of the year.
The latest inflation report is a slight comfort in households affected by rising inflation and a lousy pay rise. The Bank said the situation would deteriorate even further before the increase.
The report further states that the monetary policy "cannot prevent" revenue cuts in the coming years, but wages are expected to rise "spectantly" towards the end of the three-year forecast.
Economics should also rise thanks to the great interest in British goods due to the weak pound, which will offset a lower percentage of consumer spending.
This decision came a year after rates were reduced to 0.025% last August in response to the shocking vote on the EU's shocking referendum, which caused the pound to fall.
The Bank estimates that the full unification of prices and the economy will take at least four years.
Prior to the bank's decision on the latest rates, many called for a rise in rates, along with rising inflation, which put increasing pressure on households. Three policymakers demanded an increase to 0.5% in June.
Inflation fell back to 2.6% last month from 2.9% in June, even though the Bank said it had expected such a change and inflation was expected to rise again over the next month.
The Bank stated that the excess over the relative to 2 % target was "quite" due to the weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: "Given the recent crash of swap rates, it looks like the competition in the mortgage market will only rise as creditors start competing for contracts to look at a good outlook towards the end of the year.
The market looks particularly good for those who are out of existing contracts and re-emgrowes - there are no-fee options on offer, as are the low rates that are gaining popularity."
NHS prescribes controversial HIV drug to 10,000 patients
Patients will receive access to 'transformative' treatment for HIV prevention from September on the basis of a Supreme Court's decision to fund the NHS drug.
The English National Health Service (NSH) reported that the pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) pre-exposure pill, which is used before sex and reduces the risk of infection in high-risk patients by up to 86 percent, will be offered via the health service to approximately 10,000 patients in the three-year trial period.
The NSH agreed to finance the probationary period after the appeals court supported the Supreme Court's decision last year to comment that the NHS had funds to pay for PrEP despite the statement that the medicine should be funded by local authorities.
The decision, announced on Thursday, was taken by the NHS of England from the mouths of Director-General Simon Stevens as a 'significant intervention', while the National Aids Trust (NAT) described the decision as a 'decisome moment'.
The Sexual Health Clinic in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to start receiving patients. Other clinics will join in October and a full implementation across England will take place by April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is an HIV drug administered before sex to reduce the risk of HIV disease.
The tests showed that PrEP significantly reduces the risk of HIV transmission between patients at risk.
The app for the PrEP before sex means that there are a sufficient amount of specific drugs in the patient's body to prevent infection.
These medicines can be taken every day or at least two hours before sex.
Patients tested include gay or bisexual men, transgender people and people with HIV-positive partners who are successfully untreated.
Clinics will identify eligible participants who sign up to participate in the testing, including men, women, transgender people and individuals with a partner whose HIV status is not yet controlled by appropriate treatment.
People living and registered with the GP in the UK can also sign up at their local sexual health clinic to apply for potential participation in the testing.
The program will cost the taxpayer £10 million and the NHS of England signed a contract this week to distribute medicines following the international public contract.
The test period is proposed to gather clinical evidence and assess the full potential of PrEP, its targeting, use and implementation on a large scale.
Simon Stevens added: 'This important intervention should be complemented and fully weighted out by the ever-expanding and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.
It's another milestone in a more than 30-year quest to stop one of the greatest challenges to human health.'
Deborah Gold, Executive Director of NAT (National Aids Trust) said: 'We are witnessing a decisive moment in the fight against HIV.
If the PrEP is administered correctly and at risk for patients, it will offer the possibility of transforming the English HIV epidemic.
From September, the NSH will offer patients at high risk to HIV infection a new powerful tool that is individually controlled and not subject to the need to cajole the partner, leading to an improvement in the quality of many lives.
We accept this statement with pleasure.'
Ian Green, managing director Terrence Higgins Trust said: 'The number one priority must be the rapid deployment of tests across the country; we must ensure that it is available to each patient.
We now have a PrEP test drug at our disposal and we are well on the way to protecting more than 10,000 people who are at risk of being infected with HIV.'
Shadow Health Secretary Sharon Hodgson said: 'The start of the trial period of the PrEP is a welcome and long-awaited change after months of delays and delays by the government.
Evidence suggests how transformative this drug can be as part of our approach to preventing HIV and ending the transmission of this life-threatening infection.
The subsequent tests will take us one step closer to a full understanding of PrEP's benefits.
It is now important that we start the tests as soon as possible throughout the country, protecting those who are exposed to HIV and together to put an end to the spread of HIV in society.'
A life of the high leg: mezzanome and clever design turned this little apartment into Earls Court into a spacious home
Joanne Leigh, a former real estate banker with a passionate for real estate, traded a large house in Knightsbridge for an apartment on Earls Cour in 2014.
Located on the first floor of the Queen Anne's smart terrace - and is a graphic illustration of the modern design that makes the most of the available space.
"I lived with my ex-manelt in a much larger house in the Knightsbridge district," Joanne said.
"I was looking for a more reasonable price.
I came across this apartment in Earls Court and had the same ceiling height.
I fell in love with him at first, and on the same day I nodded to him.'
Since then, the 1,000-square-metre apartment has undergone a complete renovation.
One-bedroom apartment with a complicated layout - to get into the bedroom, you had to go through the kitchen - Joanne wanted to add a storage space and mezzanate to use the high ceiling.
"I've been hinging on high ceilings, big windows, and a lot of light.
Those were my demands," she said.
To this end, it employed Erfan Azadi of the design and design studio Duck & Shed, based in Notting Hill, and used the nearly four-metre ceiling to create a home that was not just a project but also a place to live.
The ceiling was not enough to reach the height of two gaps climbing above each other - the challenge for the architects was to create an intermediate that could be walked upright on.
Erfan had to engage his creative thinking.
"The steel structure is quite complicated," he explained.
"We had to organize both spaces so that we could walk upright.
It was not only about building a simple platform, but at the same time bending the steel structure to be correctly above and below the ceiling."
This arrangement allowed Erfan to design two full rooms on himself - while adding to the drama.
On the mezzanine, looking down at the gorgeous living room of the old copper window frames in the Retrouvius design.
Mirror furniture in gold, silver lines and retro chandelier by Serge Mouille creates a unique style.
The use of mirrors plays an important role in the drama, space and lighting.
The short corridor is fitted with mirrors on both sides and looks so longer.
The mirror bar in the kitchen looks like a window to the next room.
At the front door there are storage areas equipped with mirrors to store cutlery and glasses.
The advantage of the living room, which gives the whole apartment the impression of significantly more space, is the opportunity to separate it from the kitchen if it is not used.
The folding kitchens are nothing new.
What is unique about this solution, however, is the folding door.
"We had to sort out the technical side," Erfan says of the reinforced veneered door.
"The baby is provided with counter-serious to shovel very easily."
Thanks to the clever use of the space and storage space, Joanne gained an additional 16 square metres, a second room and a better overall layout of the apartment.
"When it comes to it, what you're selling is a living area - or awards of your property," Erfan said.
"The real estate agent basically counts the price of the apartment when he enters the apartment, based on the living area."
In this case, the living area was increased while maintaining quality materials that lend the space a luxurious look.
"The material is very important because you touch it and create an emotional bond with your home," Erfan added.
"You don't have the power lines in the walls.
Yes, they are important, but they will not get your hearts.'
As it turned out, a high-quality design and increase of the living space can turn an ordinary apartment into an exceptional work.
And like Joanne, you can eventually decide to stay.
The United States is disconnected.
The cultural and political diving between blue and red states is widening.
California has announced a ban on its citizens' travel to the state of Tennessee and seven other states.
The state of Tennessee repaid her and declared a retaliatory ban on his citizens' travel to California.
Of course, this is not a ban in the full sense, US citizens can travel freely in all 50 states.
This is because California has banned the spending of state money on the travel of its citizens to eight other states, such as Alabama, South Dakota, Kansas, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, Tennessee and Texas.
Who will stop the madness?
California is strongly for LGBT, and considers any sign of LGBT lifestyle disapproval to be discrimination.
However, Tennessee has adopted the Conscience Resin Act, according to which a psychotherapist who has a moral problem with the therapy of patients from the LGBT community is under no obligation to provide it, but has a duty to provide these patients with another therapist who does not have such a problem.
Texas and other nations have passed laws under which religious charities that have been given to their mothers for adoption are not obliged to provide these children for adoption for adoption by these children.
Because of these conscience reservation laws, California banned funding for its citizens' travel to eight states of the union.
In practice, this means that California professors must not have travel to scientific symposia in Texas, for example, reimbursed from their universities because they are co-funded by the state of California.
Similarly, school sports teams cannot travel to tournaments or competitions to, for example, Tennessee with the financial support of their schools.
They must either receive federal grants for the travel, but it is absurd for the federal government to finance the travel of citizens from the state of A to the state of B, or private sponsorship.
The Tennessee state ran out of patience, and its parliament passed a law with a resolution that it also dislikes California's high-ranking policies of high taxes, high state spending, high deficits, and tolerance for illegal immigrants, but still not imposing a travel embargo on California because of it.
He's in retaliation for the California Travel embargo on Tennessee.
And the same will happen against any state of the Union, which would order a similar travel ban on a different state for any reason.
At the same time, he called on the parliaments of all states to stop this madness.
That's the facts, now the comment.
The situation is toxic.
First, all of this is constitutional, nothing is unconstitutional.
States have the right to adopt conscience-sentit laws, as well as to decide what their money will go to and what they are not allowed to.
Secondly, what is wrong with a conscience reservation?
If the butcher has a religious problem selling pork, why can't he only offer beef, lamb, poultry and fish?
Why, under penalty of punishment, force him to sell pork when there are enough of butchers offering pork?
In the state of Colorado, a baker faces an anti-discrimination lawsuit and a heavy fine for refusing to bake a cake for a gay wedding.
But he also refuses to bake cakes for Halloween or containing alcohol.
Why not punish him and leave him alone and not order the appropriate cakes from hundreds of bakers of the others?
Third, the beauty of the federal system is that the constitutional rights of all the citizens of the federation are guaranteed, but individual states can adjust internal, domestic politics in non- federal powers to their own, i.e. according to the preferences of their populations.
Then there are diversity, diversity, diversity.
California can be California, and Texas can be Texas.
But California wants California to be California and Texas, and seven other states to be California, too!
Fourth, members of the LGBT community once rightly sought to tolerate their lifestyle.
Today, many members of this community follow the rule of live and let live by which all reasonable people should follow, but some activists seek not tolerance of themselves and others, but for extreme intolerance towards others.
According to them, no one must ever manifest the moral, religious, or philosophical disapproval of the LGBT lifestyle, and if they do so, it is to be criminalized.
The mentality of these activists is totalitarian.
They are modern enemies of freedom.
Fifthly, I don't know the situation in American history, when states made such a punk up because of political issues, except for the case of the only one.
Even in the days of the civil rights struggle for blacks, where the North and the West were on the side of integration and the South on the Segregation side, the states did not impose sanctions on themselves.
The only case was the 1950s, the political case was slavery, and the North-South War was about to come.
Of course, there will be no such thing now, but the situation is still toxic.
The cultural and political diving between the states of the blue Democratic and the Red Republican states is deepening, and the US is mentally disconnecting internally.
Illegal agitation.
A critic of Putin was fined in a greasy ticket.
Russian opposition politician Alexei Navalny has been fined 300,000 rubles for violating campaign rules ahead of next year's presidential election.
The court fined him for urging people to participate in the unauthorised demonstrations.
Navalny has organised two major anti-government street protests in the last two months and announced that he wanted to run for the post of head of state in March next year.
The Kremlin's incumbent chief, Vladimir Putin, has not yet announced his candidacy, but he is widely expected to do so and win again.
Navalny said the police came to his house this morning and took him to court.
He fined him for calling on people to demonstrate through videos posted on the online YouTube portal.
The fine is three hundred thousand.
"Lately, we will pull them off the judge's salary," the Kremlin critic joked in a Twitter post.
The Russian Electoral Commission recently concluded that Navalny could not participate in the presidential election because he was previously convicted of embezzlement.
However, Navalny, who is considered a fighter against corruption, considers the ruling politically motivated.
Fines of 300,000 rubles, or 25,000 roubles, were also imposed by the court on Thursday on Thursday by the court on two members of the Navalny pre-election team, Leonid Volkov and Nikolai Ljaskin.
Navalny entered Russian politics as an anti-corruption blogger and gradually became the dominant figure on the fragmented opposition scene.
Authorities are trying to prevent Navalny from the campaign.
In February, he was sentenced to a five-year suspended sentence for robbing the forestry business of Kirovles.
In May the verdict was upheld by the Court of Appeal.
The verdict is thus final, which prevents Navalny from running under Russian law.
Brothers fight over $500 million for empire
The two brothers are now, more than four decades after the founding of the empire, to their Italian family, over one of the most expensive Victorian properties worth more than $500 million.
Former Carlton Football Club and developer Colin De Lutis dwells on Toorak's estate, only three rooms from his younger brother Paul, who has caught up in the dispute over joint property and business assets to the supreme court.
Paul wanted to leave the family business as early as 2014, but the fierce dispute is constantly being lit up in front of the Supreme Court.
He and his mother, Anna, own the brothers own a total of 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars. The first store was purchased by the family in 1973 on Smith Street in Collingwood.
At this point, the family founded the Westco Jeans company, which grew into a chain with 160 stone shops.
In 1999, the family sold the entire company for $85 million.
Other properties were purchased for the money, and the De Lutis family's portfolio now includes offices, construction land in Brunswick and Sorrento, apartments on the Gold Coast and Mt Buller and shopping malls in the suburbs.
Paul owns about one-third of the company's assets, while his father, Colin, who, in Paul's words, is the "significant driving force and dominant figure" of the De Lutis family, owns less than two-thirds of his assets.
The court's writings state that Colin owns $316 million worth of real estate, while Paul manages $176 million worth of real estate.
For Paul, it was the division of assets and funds that became a problem.
"Colina's motion in my eyes sounded markedly in his favour," Paul wrote in an affidavit at the 2015 court.
Last Friday, after several unsuccessful attempts at conciliation, the first meeting of the Supreme Court took place.
The brothers are now also competing to control the existing business - from which he claims to have been cut off by Colin, according to his comments.
Colin contradicts the fact that this is not true and accuses Paul of misdolling some real estate.
In a previous affidavit, Colin said he believed in a successful resolution of the conflict.
"My Italian origin dictates that family is the most important thing of all," he wrote.
The cost of court appearance is on the rise. Hundreds of affidavits, emails and reports from companies, including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, are in-randle-hushering attorneys, including Allan Myers, QC and defense attorneys for both parties.
Mrs. De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who ran dairy bars and delicacies since the 1950s and bought a shop in Brunswick in the 1970s.
With the money raised by the construction of the property, they bought a property in Collingwood, where Colin opened the first family jeans business.
Colin said that when he founded Westco "in his senior year of college, Paul was still a little, about 10-year-old boy."
Anna De Lutis said that he and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped that the transfer of property to his sons would take place in a good way.
"Luigi often used to say he never wanted his sons to end up in court," she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis family group. Colin said that Mark was compensated for $10 million in his departure and Luke $26 million.
As Paul put it, both Luke and Mark were "unsatisfied with the terms of their financial compensation."
Colin has been holding back ever since, despite the fact that he is a former member of the AFL board of directors, as Eddie McGuire, a well-known TV personality and best friend Colin, said in his 2015 autobiography.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul de Lutis and their lawyers on Friday.
Colin replied only through a text message in which he stated that, given the fact that the dispute was settled before the court, "I have nothing to add."
"It's very sad that my brother Paul has decided to settle the matter in court," he wrote.
In a statement in court in mid-2016, Colin said in court that he had tried to adapt to his brother's demands.
"Our father would be very unhappy to see our current situation," he said, adding that he was "alsturating in a successful solution."
On Friday, all hopes were in the outlain.
"Our disputes will be settled by a court hearing shortly," Colin wrote.
The heat in the Czech Republic.
Teachers shower children.
Public transport drivers are getting water and summer clothes.
At the Na Chodovci nursery school in Prague 4, where about 35 children now attend, they only go out in the morning.
The school is renovated after reconstruction and the planted trees do not yet provide a large shade.
There's no swimming pool, but the teachers shower the kids in the fog area.
In the afternoon, the children remain in the classrooms where the blinds are drawn and the drapes are drawn.
The air is being cooled by the air-durifier because they don't have air conditioning.
It is also challenging for teachers and cooks.
"The temperature, which is in the interior and exterior, exceeds the hygienic limits for nursery schools, so we should not actually have an open operation during this period," said the director of the kindergarten, Miloslava Makovičková.
There is a glass corridor in the kindergarten, where it says the temperature is around 40 degrees.
We air out the morning after 6 a.m., the windows close, and we have the blinds on the south sides to protect ourselves.
"But it doesn't help much," she added.
Better conditions are in the forest nursery Na Hrázi v Hostivice, where children spend most of their time outdoors.
We have mature trees on the property, so we're below them.
"We have a beautiful walnut, there's a table under it, and we do things there," said the kindergarten director Barbora Kompanová.
Teachers try to go to the woods with their children, where it is more cool.
Children's caps are wet and have various games with water on the agenda.
"We have a hand-held pressure spray that's used for flower spraying, and we use it to shower children," Kompanová said.
Also, the director of the kindergarten in Novoborská Street in Prosek, Prague, Jitka Vilimovská, said that the teachers try to keep the children in the shade and sprinkle them with water.
"We have a fairly mature garden, so they're under the trees," she said.
He goes out in the morning and then after 3 p.m.
Every child must have a headgear.
Teachers also remind children to drink.
They can choose, for example, a little sweetened tea or a diluted juice, and have a tap with water in the garden.
They also have a vegetable salad to eat every day and always have fresh fruit and vegetables for snacks, which is sometimes brought to them by their parents.
'Maybe today one mother brought about a ten-kilometer melon for the children here,' Makovičková added.
Drivers get water or a summer uniform.
The Prague transport company DPP provides them with water, ionic drinks or summer uniforms on hot days.
The cabs of both tram and bus drivers are in most cases air-conditioned, said DPP spokeswoman Aneta Řehková.
In addition to cabins, some trams are also air conditioned in the passenger compartment.
Tram tracks have not yet been seriously damaged by the high temperatures.
The minor damage occurred in a loop in Hostivař.
At the current high temperatures, we are particularly careful to ensure that drivers have sufficient drinks at their disposal.
"The clear drinking water is available in all loops, rotation points and carriage talls," said Řehková.
In the carriageway and in some alternating places, employees have so-called sodobars, which produce cooled soda.
Drivers also receive soluble protective ion drinks.
"They can also use the summer uniform, which increases the comfort of drivers in their daily shifts," the spokesperson added.
The hot and dry weather of the last few days has resulted in an increased number of fires.
On Tuesday, firefighters in the whole of the Czech Republic disposed of 108, i.e. twice the long-term daily average.
On Tuesday, during the day, when temperatures in the Czech Republic climbed over 35 degrees Celsius, firefighters were mainly busy fighting fire.
"Fires in the natural environment predominate and also those associated with the harvest works," firefighter spokesperson Nicole Zaoralová said.
The relief for the firefighters was not even brought about by an evening change in the weather, when the heat in a number of places was replaced by storms and torrential rainfall.
In connection with the storms, firefighters were riding out on 236 interventions.
It was mainly about removing fallen trees and branches.
"They intervened the most in the Central Bohemian Region," Zaoralová continues.
But the help of firefighters was also needed in Stvolínky na Českolipsku, where they evacuated to safety 60 people from the children's camp due to the storm.
Tropical temperatures also gave work to Prague rescuers.
On Tuesday and night on Wednesday, ambulances were riding out on a dozen cases of carbon monoxide poisoning from the bar.
People should therefore have their water heater inspected, the rescuers warn.
Carbon monoxide is a colourless odourless gas released during imperfect combustion.
Symptoming symptoms include nausea, vomiting, headache and feeling faint.
If the poisoning is suspected, you need to leave the infested room.
Trump's new chief of staff plans to curb the president's media diet
Before him, many had tried, and always failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.
If so, he'll be the first.
Politico reported that the new chief of staff at the White House planned to limit President Trump's information flow - including coverage of the TV news - in the hope of keeping Trump afloat.
Here is a part of the report by reporter Josh Dawsey:
"When the new White House chief of staff, John F. Kelly, met with staffers on his first day of office, he outlined a key problem with the Trump White House, which he intended to correct: the wrong information that the president was getting his hands on.
Kelly told the staff that he had to personally approve all the information - whether on paper or a spoken word - because the President could make a better decision based on the right information."
Kelly's diagnosis actually makes sense, but many of his predecessors cut their teeth at checking up Trump and his media presentation.
Trump's relationship with the media dates back several decades - and now, sitting in the White House, his habit of watching TV news is even stronger.
"If Trump, as a candidate, was upset with honest stories, it was fitting to show him that a lot of other media outlets were talking about him in a positive light, which was easier to convince," Sam Nunberg, a former campaign adviser, told Politico in February.
Tara Palmeri of Politico wrote at the time that "the key to keeping Trump's tweets in check - at least in the words of the six former campaign organizers - is to ensure that Trump regularly follows the media that sing his praise on him."
All right.
But the idea that Trump's tendency to post his views on Twitter was ever "under-control" is ridiculous.
Perhaps these campaign organizers know something the others have no idea - that Trump's tweets would be more outrailed if they weren't checked.
The tweets Trump never sent will most likely never be heard from.
If his employees managed to keep him in check at least several times, then their efforts were not for nothing.
But no one has yet been able to regularly prevent Trump from raising controversial issues.
Part of the problem is that in the White House, which consists of rival factions, people regularly try to strengthen their agenda by sub-tracting Trump's materials - which may or may not be reliable - that support their view of the world.
In May, the Politico portal, which covered the issue, published a report on the tilt of advisers to submit dubious information to the head of state in May.
This is an example of such information from the pen of the reporter Shane Goldmacher:
"Current and former Trump officials say the president often reacts very angry to negative media reports, especially reports of leaks, and he seeks to find their origins.
This situation occurred at the end of February when someone slipped the president a copy of an article from GotNews.com - a website of provocateur Charles C. Johnson - who accused Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh of being a 'source of many leaks' from the White House.
Regardless of the fact that Johnson was banished forever from Twitter for harassment; or that he did not substantiate his claim with any evidence; or that he had already made false allegations in the past and later recalled them.
Trump read the article and started asking about Walsh."
Goldmacher added that then-chiese chief of staff Reince Priebus and White House secretary Rob Porter "worse were trying to implement the system to manage and dossiance information that President Trump would receive."
Would that work?
Kelly is now, three months later, trying to push for the same strategy.
He may turn out to be a more efficient manager than Priebus, but Trump's impulsiveness doesn't just froze, and his helpers are still competing for power.
These unchanging factors will certainly aggravated Kelly's mission.
Tourists negotiate a ditch and return to the 'Millionaire's Quarter'
Once again, the few most affluent homeowners in West Midland are embroiding an eye on the raid with determined tourists negotiating with the local authorities to the right to regain the field for their residences.
Tourists parked 20 caravans in a field at a flourishing street in the town of Solihull, which is nicknamed the 'millionaire's neighborhood'.
Bringing horses, children and an army of caravans, the tourists return after being banished in May. They were not even afraid of the ditch that was dug on the spot under the authorities' orders to prevent their invasion.
The tactic group found gaps in defence and penetrated the field with the caravans unprotected gap that served the journey.
The rabble residents of the district attacked the board of directors of the city of Solihull, saying that it is 'missable to solve the problem'.
One of the residents who wished to remain anonymous said, 'They'd made the place up Monday night after they'd been moved to Bentley Heath Street, where they threw rocks at other people.
The Board of Directors should be ashamed of its inability to solve the problem.
All the tourists had been moved to a different place and now they had returned.
Others arrived last night, and there's probably more to arrive today.'
She added that: 'The Birmingham Board of Trustees knew how to deal with this problem. It was using court orders to protect the parks.
I live on Streetsbrook and I don't intend to continue paying taxes until the board of trustees has come to an upreation with the tourists.'
Another anonymous resident said: 'It's ridiculous. Just recently we were following the last of the departing tourists and now they're back.
And this time there are even more of them, and this time they brought the horses with them.'
The press officer for the city's board of directors said: 'We are aware of the unauthorised stay on the property near Streetsbrobrook Road and, in cooperation with the local police, are taking the necessary legal steps to remedy the problem to resolve the problem.
To gather as much evidence as possible, it is essential that as many local residents as possible report any unsociable or unlawful conduct by the police at number 101.
This will give us the overall picture we will deliver in court.'
The MEP's husband was hit by a car in Brussels.
He was brought in by a government special.
A government special brought the injured Róbert Zhitňanský to Bratislava on Wednesday after noon.
Two ambulances were waiting at the airport and he was under the constant control of Slovak doctors on board the plane.
The long-planned flight was without complications.
Róbert Žitňanský had a serious accident in Brussels earlier in the summer, according to TV JOJ.
He said he was hit by a car and has been in serious condition ever since.
After being transported to his homeland, he was transported to a specialist workplace of one of the Bratislava hospitals.
The economic analyst is the husband of the NOVA Slovak MEP Jana Žitňanská.
She would not comment on the incident.
The couple have three children together.
Italians tighten up fighting NGO rescue ships with immigrants on board
Italy has announced that it will prevent the arrival of NGO rescue ships arriving at the coast of Italy with immigrants from the Mediterranean if the NGO does not sign the new rules regulating their operations.
"If the NGO does not sign the new rules of conduct, it will be difficult for us to imagine that they could continue their operations," said Interior Minister Marco Minniti in an interview with Turin daily La Stampa.
Minniti's warning came a day after Italian authorities were seized by a ship from the German rescue organization Jugend Rettet on suspicion of human trafficking, which has made illegal immigration much easier.
The rescue organisation, which is in its first year, declined to comment on the allegations made by Italian state prosecutor Ambrogia Cartosiose.
"For us, the number one priority is and always will be the saving of human lives. We are very sorry, so we cannot operate in the rescue zones at the moment," the organization said in a social media statement.
"We can only comment on any of the current charges after gathering all the information and assessing the situation."
Italian authorities have been following the Iuventa Jugend Rettet ship since October.
Her crew is suspected of transporting immigrants on the boat, handed over directly by human traffickers, repeatedly.
At least one meeting took place, according to the plaintiff's file, allegedly only 1.3 miles from the coast of Libya. The conduct of the meeting was published by the Italian media.
The ship's crew is suspected of breaking the law and circumventing the Italian Coast Guard, which oversees the rescue operations in the area - of humanitarian enthusiasm, rather than anything else.
The Code of Conduct is established by the presence of an Italian police officer on board ships such as Iuventa to monitor the activities.
Only three of the nine non-governmental non-governmental non-profit organisations involved in the rescue operations have so far agreed to comply with the code: Save The Children, Maltese MOAS and the Spanish Pro-Activa Open Arms.
The latter said on Thursday that the new rules were not necessary but acceptable as they did not constitute any "substantial change or obstacle" as regards the rescue operations.
The adoption of the new code of conduct was also rejected, for example, by Doctors Without Borders (MSF), which is the Nobel Prize winner.
Minniti, meanwhile, has been quoted as saying that the sharp drop in immigrants in recent weeks, who are being divestgrave in Italy as part of rescue operations, suggests that efforts to strengthen patrols off the coast of Libya and cooperate with local mayors are bearing fruit.
"In recent days we are beginning to see the light at the end of the tunnel," the minister said.
He also revealed plans for further negotiations to be held this month with the mayors of Libya on the economic development initiative, as well as with representatives of Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving these countries in the hope of reaching Europe.
Shamedat of Mesarošová: Silicone and cellulite crawled from the jugal!
The hot summer days are all to be tempted to wear only the most necessary to cover up the most intimate parts.
Only Dominika Mesarošová does it the other way around.
The afternoon meeting at the Prague Zoo, where the actors, presenters, singers and all those with dealing with TV Prima were swarming, she was enveloping her little body in a mini-tearal.
And all it took was a few common moves, and the model showed everyone her silicones, but also her bottom.
The overal had cut between the halves a lot of times, and it had been so high that it had to be adjusted all the time.
The attention of the gentlemen and the photographers present was certainly not short of it.
Michelle Carter convicted of sending text messages urging Conrad Roy to commit suicide
The woman from Massachusets was sentenced to prison for two years for inciting her friend to commit suicide by text messages and phone calls.
Michelle Carter, 20, will serve 15 months on the two-year sentence behind bars and then spend five years on parole.
Carter was convicted in June of the involuntary killing of Conrad Roy, who took his own life on July 13, 2014.
Roy's father testified in court on Thursday, "The whole family is devastated.
My son was my best friend."
Carter was left free until a decision was made.
She faced up to 20 years in prison, but her lawyers argued that she and Roy had suffered from mental illness.
Dressed in red pants and a cream blouse, Carter stood in place at the verdict with tears in her eyes, clasped-down, eyes and eyes facing the ground.
"Her actions have killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor told the judge.
"She ended his life to relieve herself.
She could not accept her own responsibility," she said.
"I didn't have any remorse."
Carter's attorney, however, said it was "unfortunate circumstances he deeply regrets about."
Judge Lawrence Moniz added that "her age or maturity or even mental illness do not have a significant impact on its actions."
The applicant read out the statement by Roy's mother, Lynn Roy, "It will not take a single day to avoid mourning the loss of my son.
I want him to be proud of me - I take care of his sisters and together we will endure the immense pain we will carry with us forever," the statement read.
Roy's sister, Camdyn Roy, testified that she was "followed" by the knowledge that she would never attend her brother's wedding and never be his children's aunt.
"The loss of the man I've seen since I was born is the pain I'll carry with me for life," she said.
The state of Massachusetts does not have a valid law to sanction a person who facilitated the suicide of another person, so this case sets a legal precedent.
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found in the seat of a car in 2014 poisoned with carbon dioxide.
The case drew the attention of the entire nation after the release of Carter's text messages that instigated suicide.
"You hang out of a building or stab a building, I don't care," read the text messages Carter had sent just two weeks before his death, while Roy was on a family vacation.
A few minutes before she was a suicide, she wrote to him, "You have to do it, Conrade," and "You just have to get the generator and you'll be single and happy."
Judge Moniz said that Carter wanted attention through Roy's death and ordered her to refrain from making any comments in the press.
The case has raised many questions.
One of the people who sided with Carter was Amanda Knox, who was convicted of the murder of her British roommate in Italy in 2007. Two years ago, she was acquitted.
Miss Knox (30) published a statement in the Los Angeles Times: "Michelle Carter deserves sympathy and help, not prison."
Audi to adjust up to 850,000 diesel vehicles in response to sharp response
Just a day before the Audi announcement, carmaker BMW said it would offer its customers a software update in more than 350,000 vehicles.
The BMW chairman said the company believed that "there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions" in response to European cities - including Munich's headquarters - which are the headquarters of BMW - that are considering banning or restricting diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it would modify three million Mercedes cars across Europe to reduce diesel emissions.
None of the companies called this decision a withdrawal.
European car manufacturers promoted to a large degree in the use of diesel atuomobilises in Europe and the United States to comply with the carbon dioxide emissions regulations.
However, nitrogen dioxide emitted by diesel engines is considered a carcinogen and can cause asthma.
At the same time, the cost of automakers to install the equipment is being neutralised by the gas emitted by diesel engines, making it difficult for cars to become more competitive.
While German car manufacturers are facing close searches, Chancellor Angela Merkel is facing accusations of spoiling powerful car companies and ignoring their problems.
The company is trying to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen, which, in an effort to meet emission limits, installed software in its cars that reduced the amount of emissions issued in testing, but was deactivated under normal conditions.
Several senior Volkswagen officials have been charged in the United States, and others are being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, a former head of the thermal imaging at the engine development department in Audi would have been arrested in Germany.
Former Zaccheo manager Giovanni Pamio is of Italian nationality and is therefore not covered by the extradition, so he may face a trial in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi joined the German police's criminal investigation into the German police in the case of Volkswagen after authorities were accused by the authorities of installing a system to circumvent European emission limits - extending the charges that Audi faces in the US.
Audi's inclusion in the investigation may have a detrimental impact on Volkswagen: luxury carmaker is a disproportionate share of Volkswagen's profit.
The plane made an emergency landing on the beach.
The man and the little girl were killed.
The accident occurred on the beach of Praia de São in the Costa da Caparica area, some 30 kilometres south of Lisbon.
One of the witnesses told the television channel SIC Noticias that the plane had been flying just above the people sunbathing on the beach before landing.
Some people from the beach reportedly ran from danger to the sea.
Unfortunately, two people were unable to escape from the machine.
A 50-year-old male and eight-year-old girl was killed on the beach, according to local media.
"The plane hit them and they were dead at the scene," said local police chief Pedro Coelho Dias.
Their nationality is not yet known.
There were two people on board the plane, both of whom escaped the accident alive and the officers took them away for questioning.
D11 or how not to build a highway.
And are the motorways in the Czech Republic even complete?
I'll give you a riddle.
It's unfinished, even though it started to be built back in 1978.
Even if it's unfinished, it's constantly being repaired.
And it can't be built any further, even if it has a building permit.
What is it?
Yes, the D11 Hradec Highway.
Construction of another of its sections was newly halted for at least a few months by the Children of the Earth movement.
We EastEle's get the highway in pieces, like cutting salami.
They'll go down the wheelbarrow, and then we'll see when and if we'll get any more.
We don't want anything miraculous.
We just want to shorten the journey time and we want to get trucks going to Poland or from Poland from villages and towns.
The endless currents of trucks go directly through the towns of Jaroměř or Náchod, which is not a sensible way to go around.
But the last section of our dream highway was put into operation in 2008, an incredible nine years ago.
Not a coverch since.
Therefore, when the remaining four-kilometre unfinished section to Hradec Králové started to be built recently and on other sections to Jaroměř an archaeological survey began with the construction of construction at the end of this year, you could hear the loud banging of the corks in the eastern Czech Republic.
No one believed it anymore.
Last week it was revealed that construction would not be built this year.
And maybe not next year.
The Children of the Earth-Club movement for sustainable transport from Brno has filed a decay.
Earth's children are repeating their D1 tactics.
They contested the building permit decision in its entirety.
In the appeal they request a review of all binding opinions of all the institutions concerned already issued.
For example, the Municipality of Hradec, the Ministry of the Environment, but also the Ministry of Defence or the Railway Authority.
So far, we are coming down from the D11 near the village with the eloquent name of the Burial.
So we go down, we just drive down the highway and suddenly we stand on a side road and prefer to subsequently get into the motorcade.
The worst thing is that you see such stories all over the country.
Scan-creating, constantly clogs on the Benešov, highway D1 or D8.
Everyone has their Burial.
What do the Children of the Earth demand?
What is the nature of the problems of road construction in the Czech Republic?
And why is the motorway network virtually in the incomplete system?

Lavender of Provence threatens climate change
The Lavender has become a Provence symbol in the area of south-east France, but are now at risk from climate change.
Lavender is dwindling as a result of dry climate and harmful insects, causing consternation to the faces of researchers and farmers seeking a solution.
Eric Chaisse, an expert at the agricultural research institute CRIEPPAM in Provence said: "Pivation of lavender cultivation in Provence is at risk because in the last few years this plant has been exposed to climate change brought with it less precipitation in the spring and autumn.
This affects the lifespan of the lavender.
It is also the fault of the cicadas and grasshoppers carrying the micro-bacteria that thrive in the dry climate."
There's a lot at stake.
Lavender attracts the tourists, and the oil that is made of them is an important component of perfume and cosmetics.
Eric Chaisse said, "Instead of long and beautiful flowers, smaller, unenveloped, and often weak plants grow.
The amount of oil obtained from these lavender is, of course, smaller."
A possible solution may be a more efficient distribution of water and a slowing of water evaporation from the soil, but also spray the lavender with a protective mixture of clay and water and the breeding of more types of dry weather resistant.
Journalist murder highlights mounting threats in Mexico
Riodo's staff members regularly meet every Wednesday to discuss news about the riots taking place in the Sinaloa area involving organised criminals, corrupt officials and relor-minded drug wars.
Today, however, under the strain of recent events, it is mainly due to its own safety.
They learn that it is important for them to change their customs.
Two deserving journalists talk about what would be safer: to take their children with them to an office that was attacked with a grenade in 2009 or left at home.
Safety experts wrote three simple words on the black board: opponents, neutral and allies.
They ask journalists to give names to each word - no evidence is needed, just use imagination and pre-titry.
Choice is something - drug traffickers, politicians, businessmen and journalists are suspected of taking money from the government or the drug cartels - a catalogue of criminals tasked with the cover for criminal conduct.
Violence continues and the bodies are piling up in a pile across the country; journalists among them are constantly increasing: according to the Committee to Protective Journalists, at least 25 have been around since President Enrique Pena Nieto came to power in December 2012; 589 journalists are under federal protection after attacks and threats; and in all seven states, seven have been killed this year.
Among them are the co-founder of the periodicals Riodioce, the editor and inspiration for colleagues, Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is living in Mexico and working as a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his many books on the violence that goes with the drug trade.
Its loss is noticeable, although its presence is all-pervasive - a large photograph of Valdez with the words "Justice" on which the middle finger shows hangs in the front of the building; two journalists - Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez - are over 30 years of age, wearing a T-shirt with a photograph of Valdez on his face, glasses on his nose and a cap of Panama.
The meeting takes place less than two months after his death; journalists speak of mutual trauma, nightmares, insomnia and paranoia.
Despite the fact that a special federal prosecutor's office was set up in 2010 to address the cases of journalists, it has so far sued two suspects, according to the Committee's comments to the Journalists' Protection Committee.
Most of the thousands of murders that occur every year are associated with drug trafficking and organised crime, making it very rare foreners to be in court.
Journalists from Riodoo insist on reporting on the violence that is happening in Sinaloe; even though they are destroyed by gorraisal and the area is currently very treacherous.
Without information about the killers and the vision of justice, the security meeting is irrelevant, says Ibarra.
"It's foolish to waste time on such meetings," he adds.
"If we don't get more information, no one can be trusted."
On the morning of 15 May, Valdez left Riodoo headquarters in Culiacan, the capital of Sinaloa.
He managed to drive several blocks when his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men who pulled him out of the car and killed him with 12 rounds, apparently because of the article's title - which can be translated as the Twelfth River.
The shooters then boarded his car and crashed him not far from the scene.
Valdez died at the age of 50.
He left behind a wife and two adult children.
It seems that in Culiacan the rumors spread fast.
In Valdez's case, however, it is a suspicious silence.
Since the arrest of Guzmán and his January extradition to the United States last year, Sinaloa has become one of the country's bloodiest fighters as the rival faction tries to fill an empty space.
Every day, several people are killed in the streets of Sinaloi, and the cemetery is filled with embroidered two-storey mausoleos for the kings of drugs, many of which are larger than houses.
Forget for a moment that the word "rule" thinks that one drug cartel is controlled by a coastal state with precious ports and important routes through which drugs travel to the United States.
Navrator to this, as well as the fact that Valdez was intimately acquainted with the risks of his job, with Ismail Bojorquez (60), co-founder and director of Riodoce still rescuing that he did not protect his friend.
He believes two misconduct contributed to his death.
The first was the February edition of the interview with Damaso Lopez, the leader of one of the rival drug cartels that fought the war with sons Joaquín Guzmán.
The conciliation could have made the sons angry; the male suspect had bought up all the copies of the newspaper the moment they landed on the shelves.
The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave the country for his own safety after the confiscation of other newspapers in which the same story was printed.
Valdez has become a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his death is seen as an important milestone in the Mexican criminals' fight against journalists.
He had managed to survive so long, and all his friends and colleagues believed that this would never change.
He was a virtual veteran in the Noroeste periodical when he decided to sell his $50 shares in 2003 and start with five colleagues Riodoce.
In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to run journalism and not mention the drug trade," said Bojorquez.
Riodo had, over time, earned a good reputation for his brave and truthful coverage; the newspapers began to flourish.
Journalists liked to go into the search for troubled topics and publish texts without censorship - the reader was fascinated to read stories that no one else dared to publish.
Eight years after its founding, Riodoce won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot for reporting on Latin America.
That same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists for his brave reporting on the Mexican drug trade.
Valdez openly admitted that he was afraid.
"I was afraid for my life," he said in the uproar.
Drug trafficking in Sinaloae is a "creation-life" business, Valdez said in an interview with Rompeviento TV in October last year.
"You have to take on the role of journalist - or play the stupid.
I don't want to be asked, 'What were you doing in the face of death . . . why didn't you say what was going on?''
The employees of Riodoce misses Valdez. The man was known for his joking and his indiscriminate language. He was a good friend who liked to give advice and hugs - a teacher who knew how to survive.
They all relied on his daily routine.
He always wore his hat.
He would often go to the El Guayabo Bar across from the offices and sit at the same table.
Now they ask: was this routine caused by his death?
His death also raised questions about their own assumptions - how to do their best to do their job and stay alive?
"They don't like being involved with their wives, children, clean shops, secret landings."
"These things were forbidden," said Bojorquez.
As a result, there is a high level of self-censorship and self-preservation.
You must trust your instincts.
If you feel something's wrong here, hands off.
The trouble is, Riodoce editor Andres Villarreal said that "an sniff is a sense that can be fooled . . . and then the Javier thing happened."
The old rules, he said, as they did, according to others, no longer apply in Sinaloae - as in the states of Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero, and other states that are home to a toxic mix of lucrative smuggling trails, weak governments, and corrupt politicians.
The landscape is constantly changing.
No cell phones are allowed in the room where Riodo employees meet; a few days ago, spyware was discovered, which was bought by the governments to monitor Mexican journalists and activists.
Outside the building, two police officers find relief in the shadow of a nearby tree in the shadow of a nearby tree.
They were chosen by the state to protect the offices of Riodo, located in a four-story building in the townhab area of Culiacan.
Journalists are teasing about whether these police officers are one of those 50 percent of the law's protectors who, according to the government, are corrupt.
It has been months since journalists went to mountainous areas that essentially control drug cartels.
There are three main stories on this week's schedule.
The first is the murder of the brother of former boxer Julio Caesar Chávez in Sinaloa.
They are also illuminated by suspicious government expenses that took place in the state's home city.
There were also several abductions recently in one of Culacán's most luxurious restaurants, just a block from the prosecutor's office.
Officially, no one reported the identity of the abducted people or the circumstances of the kidnapping, so journalists were wary when they were about to write about what every city dweller knew: that the restaurant was a favorite destination for drug traffickers and politicians.
One journalist read from the public records that the restaurant was registered by a name associated with a politician who is a member of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) who was controlling all the levels of the political scene for almost the entire last century.
Several PRI governors have recently been charged with corruption in high-level positions.
Villarreal asked journalists to write about earlier incidents that had taken place in the restaurant, including an incident in which one of Joaquín's sons "El Chapo" Guzmán had escaped the army's strike force.
A month ago, readers would have read about the subject in Valdez's section, which was the best source of information about abductions.
"Walherez would have deciphered the case," said Villarreal (46), who is nicknamed "El Flaco" for his slender figure.
"Now all the informants have turned their backs on us."
Valdez's office was turned into a sign and labels for protesting protests against journalists' killings. Employees certainly did not expect them to become activists in the press.
Journalist Miriam Ramirez grabbed several signs and set off the next morning to demonstrate in front of the prosecutor's office for another journalist.
Salvador Adame disappeared just three days after Valdez's murder in the western part of the state of Michoacán.
Only the charred body was discovered. Authorities say it is Adamea based on DNA analysis.
The activity of journalists is escalating across the country. Many of them organize protests and scribbles on the sidewalks and buildings "SOS press."
The director of the newspaper Bojorquez is the day on a visit to Washington, where he seeks to gain international support and bring justice for Valdez's death.
In a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa, the day after the murder of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities of stalking journalists and their murders for proclaiming the truth.
In the meantime, she asked to be transferred to another department for fear that her anger might threaten her impartiality.
Valdez has repeatedly stated that Mexican journalists are "beaten" by organised crime, corrupt officials and indifferent public.
In his latest book, "Narco-journalism," he wrote that journalists were dying not only at the hands of drug cartels, but also on the order of politicians and security forces who collaborate with organised crime.
The media surveillance group Articulo 19 has charged police officers and public officials with more than half of all attacks on journalists.
"You're going to die in Mexico because they want to shut you up," Ramirez added.
The murders are obviously working.
No one will forget the death of the blogger Maria Elizabeth Macías, who took place six years ago at the northern border of the Tamaulipas.
Her body was found along with a note allegedly signed by the Zetas Cartel: "I ended up like this for my reports."
Next to the severed head was a keyboard and headphones.
Some branches have decided to shut down, such as the newspaper El Norte, based at the northern border of the state of Chihuahua, in response to the March murder of the rapporteur, Miroslava Breach.
The others are still continuing, just as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after the killing of their director in 2004.
In 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez addressed the drug cartels publicly with an article on the opening page titled "What do you want from us"?
Some journalists have fled their homes or even across the border.
It's a difficult decision.
Finding work in exile is difficult, as is getting rid of the feeling of being haunted all the time.
And journalists are persecuted and killed, such as in the case of Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered in 2015 along with four women in an apartment in Mexico City, three months after fleeing Veracruze.
For those who choose to stay and not give up their jobs, every day poses a great risk.
Ibarra, who wanted to be a poet, admits that writing about drugs scares him.
"Mexico is heading to hell, so I became a journalist," he said.
It's Friday's midnight, and Riodo staff is sitting on the sidewalk in front of the office - the latest editions sent to the printer - drinking beer when the phone suddenly starts ringing.
They learn that 19 people died in a shootout between the gang members and police officers near the beach resort in the town of Mazatlán.
The war is escalating, just as many of the messages left by the syndicate members in the area promised.
Journalists are posting this news from a mobile phone on the Riodo website.
Not a day goes by and the opening headline is changing again.
The sounds of police sirens point to another shootout.
Bojorquez casts a glimpse of the police patrol to see if they were paying attention.
If they're scared, they don't show it.
Under the huge portrait of the fallen co-founder of their periodical - whose middle finger is a telling slogan for the whole of Sinaloe - all Riodo staff follow his steps.
"How could we possibly think of leaving," Bojorquez said, "when an intern, on the same day that Javier was killed, the interns asked me to take to the streets?"
Dinosaurs used camouflage to avoid enemies
At first glance, it looks like a statue, however terrifying.
The researchers have now revealed the findings of the first discovery of an amazing rhino-sized creature whose perfectly preserved remains - which the experts called 'Mon the Liso dinosaurs' - were found by a Canadian miner.
The remains were preserved to such a high extent that experts were able to determine the reddish-brown color of his scales of his scales and stated that the dinosaur had a 'problem past'.
The article in the journal Current Biology stated that it is the 'most preserved armored dinosaur found to date and one of the best dinosaur species in the world'.
The fossil is a new kind of Nodosauridae family. Dinosaurus lived in the Criard, about 110 to 112 million years ago.
His perfectly preserved condition literally shocked the researchers, who described him with the words 'reckomable.'
The armored white-white-strine, according to National Geographic, is still the best preserved fossel of its kind.
Shawn Funk is behind the discovery, revealing the fossil on March 21, 2011, while drilling at the Suncor Millenium mine near Alberta, Canada.
He came across what appeared to be a foreign object and decided to explore it more closely.
The fossil was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
The researchers spent the next six years working to uncover the animal from a huge chunk of land weighing 1100 kg.
After the work is completed, the dinosaur is ready to be revealed.
'Just turn a little to squint and believe he's asleep,' said the work manager, Caleb Brown, and the Royal Tyrrell Museum's naturalist, where the animal is on display.
'It will certainly go down in the history of history as one of the most beautiful and most-greuned dinosaur species - the Mona Lisa of the Dinosaurs.'
Studying his skin, the researchers found that this herbivore - despite being covered in armor and resembling a walking tank - was very likely facing a serious threat from carnivorous dinosaurs.
The heavily armored dinosaur used a red and white camouflage to protect against predators, and used a clocking system used by many animals today.
Experts say it allowed him to merge with his surroundings and avoid enemies. The clocking system suggests that it was a popular diet for the larger dinosaurs.
News of the 110 million-year-old dinosaur of the Nodosauridae family first appeared in newspapers in May. It is currently available for viewing at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
The researchers named him Borealopelt markmitchelli after the museum's technician, Mark Mitchell, who, along with the team, spent more than 7,000 hours carefully uncovering the fossil.
Thanks to the wonderfully preserved state of the fossil, Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists could document the patterns and the shape of scales and armor all over the body.
They uncovered the method of camouflage normally used by today's animals in defence - the upper part of the animal was darker than the lower part of it.
Although this camouflage effect is common in nature, the researchers' findings are surprising, as Borealopelta's size far exceeds today's animals using the same technique.
It is possible, then, that the dinosaur was so many predators that evolution preferred to camouflage in survival.
Many contemporary animals with camouflage - such as deer, zebra and or armadillo - are much smaller and also more vulnerable as prey, suggesting that nosodaurus had to literally fight for its outdated.
'The predictation of the vast and heavily armored dinosaur illustrates the danger posed by the predators in the Cretaceous period,' said Brown.
Chemical analysis of the organic ingredients contained in the scales also revealed that the dinosaur skin was probably red-brown in colour.
Researchers continue to study the animal, searching for further knowledge of its life, including preserved stomach contents, to find out its last meal.
He believes the dinosaur fell into the river after death and was taken to the sea, where it sank to the bottom.
The Alberta area was the same climate at the time as in today's Florida, and the rivers and oceans stretched far inland than they are today.
'This nodosaurus is truly remarkable in that it is completely covered in perfectly preserved scales and at the same time preserved in three dimensions and so we can see its original size,' said Brown.
'For these reasons, the animal looks virtually the same as it did in the Cretaceous.
You don't have to use your imagination to reconstruct it; just turn a little to squat your eyes and it seems like he's just asleep.'
In the Cretaceous period, giant therophores, carnivorous dinosaurs, walked across the Earth, moving on two legs.
Though the king of all the dinosaurs - Tyrannosaurus rex - lived for several million years after Borealopelta, this armored dinosaur might have been a favorite prey for his equally fearsome ancestors.
These include Acrocanthosaurus, a 15.5-metre-long monster weighing over 6 tons.
Researchers whose latest findings were published in the journal Current Biology believe that Borealopelt's body was washed into the sea after it was mummified in the mud.
Shawn Funk, who was discovered by the fossil on March 21, 2011, while drilling at a Suncor Millenium mine near Alberta, Canada.
According to the museum, it is the best preserved armored dinosaur in the world, including leather and armor, which is also complete from the snout to the hips.
The anchor was 5 metres in diameter and weighed up to 1,300 kg.
From his shoulders protruded two 50 cm spines.
Researchers believe this herbivore was cruising the territory of today's Canada until it ended up in the river that washed it into the sea.
His underwater tomb kept the body in perfect condition.
Fossil remains of this species are also preserved to the extent that the armored sheets around the skull still cover the remains of the skin.
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, 'the founding of such a preserved individual can be compared to winning the lottery.
The longer I watch him, the shocking the find seems to me.
Fossil remains of this species are also preserved to the extent that the armored sheets around the skull still cover the remains of the skin.
At his side lies his right front foot, with fingers pointing up.
I can easily count the scales on his foot.'
How did one activist learn the answer to the question: 'Whose Streets?'
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell shivered all over her body.
The day after she arrived in New York, the St. Louis native sat down on the bed in the Airbnb room and went through the Facebook posts on her phone.
She came across a contribution from a high school student.
"Police just shot an 18-year-old man whose body is still lying in the street," he said.
She was surprised that no one else had written to her the post, so she closed Facebook and opened up Twitter.
User @ThePharoah kept her wall posts.
Rapper of St. Louis posted on Twitter his Twitter posts about the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old who was shot by a white-skinned police officer in the town of Ferguson, Missouri.
He posted a photograph of Brown's body lying limp in the street, from which he was not taken after four hours.
"That's crazy," Ferrell thought.
But death was nothing new to her and her community.
She put down the phone to get back to him in the evening, when she watched the tweets about the people who were gathering on Canfield Drive.
She followed photographs of police tapes and screaming people. One of the men claimed to be the victim's father, holding a sign that reads "The Ferguson Police Killed my unarmed son"!
She watched the live news - one of the officers standing in front of a group of protesters holding a leash and a barking dog at the other end.
In another video, another policeman, she put it, he held, a gun with which he aimed at the crowd, yelling, "I'm going to kill you all . . . animals."
"It's not normal," Ferrell told herself.
"This isn't the type of murder we've gotten used to and can be called normal.
I could smell the creeps all over my body.
"I was angry and I cried."
She immediately booked a return flight and travelled home the next day.
After landing at 11 p.m., she picked up her six-year-old daughter from her father and decided to go to Ferguson in the morning.
The story of what happened to the Ferrell and the city of Ferguson over the next three years is described by the new documentary "Whose Streets?" which will be released in theaters on August 11.
It is a story about survival and protest, love and resistance, the power and the dizel of the people living in the community who take to the streets and demand answers.
On her way to Ferguson, Ferrell took a dialogue with her daughter - dressed in a floral jersey and the same flower headband - on a topic they've discussed many times before - "on experience with black people."
"Do you remember how I taught you about how black people had to fight for what they believed in?" he recalls of the interview.
"We're going to Ferguson right now because the police killed an 18-year-old and that's not right."
"It didn't come to the fact that I wouldn't take her with me," Ferrell said later.
"Today's events are the climax . . . that occurred in the past.
She had to know and see for myself and grow up in it.
She needed to develop not only in activism and organizing, but she also had to learn the difference between the different layers of experience with blacks, and what we need to do to free ourselves.
While I am able to provide it with conditions in which she will not experience racism firsthand, he is no different in any way from another black child-woman.
I sense that if I had protected her from this experience, I would only have harmed her."
After arriving in Ferguson, the first stop on the South Florissant Road across from the police department, which became the base of activists' campaigners' words to await Officer Darren Wilson's words about his possible involvement in the incident.
Here, Ferrell and her daughter met a local businessman who was preparing meals for the others.
Together, they prepared food for the bags and helped deliver it to the Protestants.
In Ferrell's eyes, a new type of activism began to be born slowly.
"My activism was turned upside down after August 9th," Ferrell said, adding that while attending college at the University of Missouri-St. Louis University, she was president of the Minority Student Nurses Assn. association and sought to introduce health care and food in black communities.
"I had no experience with the organization.
It was only natural."
A few weeks later, during the evening demonstration, Ferrell met the documentary's later co-cholean, Sabaah Folayan.
Folayan said he and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted to "document" the ongoing events.
But Ferrell thought, "Worrying to a documentary or trying to find a story to be used?"
Such a type of skepticism penetrated the community through many people, often whites, who wanted to profit from pain and decisiveness.
As Folayan explained in the interview he can't say, "We've heard that the voices of people who are born and raised in Ferguson are very often neglected, and we wanted to change that."
Folayan has already established a collaboration with co-director Damon Davis, who is a respected local artist who deals with the subject of prisoners on death row.
She also attended the project with Ferrell, and along with six other local residents, who were watched by the "Whose Streets" team in the years following the assassination of Browne.
"No one speaks for us in this document, but it's our statement," Davis said.
"That was important to me - how these people were represented - because I would be represented in the same way."
While the purpose of the documentary was not to focus on Ferrell's experiences - in an attempt to view that the movement was "no for a savior leader, but a community-savings for a rapprochement," Folayan said - it turned out that she was the one most open to her participation in filming.
The documentary "Whose Streets?" thus describes the very personal aspect of Ferrell's life, for example, how she fell in love with her wife.
"I felt naked," Ferrell said with a smile on her face at the first moment to see the final version of the documentary.
"But I understand that in order to do this job and humanized the blacks, I have to open up."
In addition, Ferrell's story highlights the role of eccentric black woman in the broad broad aspect of the Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the movement's three founders - who created the social media campaign under #BlackLivesMatter in response to the killing of teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012 - call themselves the weirdo.
"The black eccentric women in leadership positions are ultimately behind the movement's preservation," Ferrell said, "because we're constantly fighting on multiple fronts.
Black eccentric women must endure the weight of these events."
Folayan agrees with this statement, adding that "the movement is actually supported by black women and a large number of eccentric black women."
She insists, however, that "this is not a mere affirmative matter" and Ferrell is not the main heroine of the documentary because of her views.
"That is what was the driving force and the source of energy," she said.
"that she, of all people, was in the front lines, was no coincidence, because life at these intersections in the skin of a black, weirdo woman is dangerous.
You can feel the energy rush in front of the screen."
Meanwhile, back in Ferguson, the TV station's cameras have cleared out their positions, but the heavy racial ties between the community and the police persist.
Ferrell is serving a two-and-a-half-year probation for blocking the highway at demonstrations.
The social political atmosphere in the area, which she called home, described as "The mess."
Yet she continues to make her effort to which she has pledged since she took to the streets of Ferguson three years ago.
"It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It is our duty to win.
We must love and support each other.
All we have to lose is our chains."
There was a field on the Cologne.
Dozens of firefighters went to the scene, and a helicopter helped.
Nearby Český Brod in Cologne, between Bylany and Liblice, a field of about 15 hectares was on fire from 14:00.
The fire stopped spreading at about 3:15 p.m., firefighters issued a third fire alarm out of four possible.
According to fire department spokesman Ladislav Holomčík, the fire was also helped to extinguish the air by a helicopter.
At 18:00 the firefighters managed to extinguish the fire, the fire caused damage for CZK 700,000.
Dozens of professional and volunteer firefighters battled the flames at the scene.
The fire was caused by a technical fault in the engine compartment of the harvester.
The fire was also assisted by a helicopter, which carried out a total of six drops of water.
"We handed over the place of intervention to the owner until 8:00 tomorrow, he will be guarded by a unit of volunteer firefighters," Holomčík said today.
A Becoming Resemblance: Artist creates portraits using Chelsea Manning's DNA
In the center of one of the rooms of New York's Fridman Gallery, several faces are placed in the face of different skin shades - white, black and dark - suspended from the ceiling on the wires. Each of them seems to have fallen from the eye of the previous one.
All 30 portraits were made by artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from oral and hair excrement sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent her samples from Fort Leavenworth Prison, where the former analyst is serving a 35-year sentence for illegally releasing secret cable to WikiLeaks.
The new exhibition, which was launched on 2 August, is entitled A Becoming Resemblance.
It is the result of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, which combines its experience with technology, computer science, and Manning - a transgender and a pioneering dissident whose sentence was reduced by Obama three days before his departure from the US presidency.
Algorithmic by analyzing Manning's DNA and using 30 portraits to illustrate what a man with this genotype would look like, was created by Dewey-Hagborg's razor-like, if not intellectual, commentary on the pliability of DNA - as well as the many ways in which DNA can be interpreted - and the inherent determinism of these interpretations, as well as identities.
Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward Manning, has since been told that she considers herself a woman. She was convicted in 2013 on the basis of 20 indictments, including violating six espionage laws, computer fraud and theft.
All of her photographs were detained by prison staff. Only one in black-and-white, of lower-quality black-and-white photography, in which Manning, visibly concerned, sits in the driver's seat in the platinum blond wig with which she is now associated.
In 2015, the positive reactions to the 2012 Dewey-Hagborg project were still fouic by Stranger Visions.
As part of this project, Dewey-Hagborg used various forensic items - such as cigarette butts and chewing gum - to create an image of the possible forms of these people.
And it was at this time that she received an e-mail from Paper Magazine.
"They were in for an interview with Chelsea Manning in prison and wanted to complete the article with a portrait," Dewey-Hagborg explained on the occasion of the opening of the new exhibition.
However, no visits or photography were allowed, so they contacted Chelsea to ask if they would be interested in the DNA portrait.
The artist and her imprisoned muse were made friends within two years through correspondence.
They even created a comic book called Suppressed Images, illustrated by Shoili Kanung, who presented a vision of what would happen if Chelsea were pardoned and could take part in the exhibition in person.
Indeed, a few days after the book was released, President Obama asked for Manning's release, a welcome change after several unbearable years in the Kansas military prison.
Indeed, it is interesting that the exhibition is underway at a time when Donald Trump is waging war with people who are seeking to publish government information and transgender soldiers, while trying to find new ways to stimulate resushes with his tweets in areas he should support.
In response to a question about this particular timing, Dewey-Hagborg stated that "all is happening for a reason."
Under the statement of the artist on one of the gallery's walls, Manning calls out with her huge signature (the letter "i" in her surname is dialed by her heart) after the end of the "sam-action factionalism, which is based on gender, race, sexuality and culture."
On the opposite side are the sequences of her mitochondrial DNA - the cuttem of the letters C, G and A recorded with a pencil.
With the inclusion of 200 letters (or nucleotides, according to the artist's sophisticated scientific vocabulary), Dewey-Hagborg wanted to illustrate how surprisingly similar, at least in terms of the biological, we are all.
"I hope that people will take it out that our genome doesn't matter who we are, and that the genetic data is subjective and everyone can interpret it in their own way," said Dewey-Hagborg. There is also her work Spurious Memories from 2007 on the subject of the video.
"DNA tells many different stories, this is 30 of them."
The last example of the exhibition, located in a separate room, is the only page from the aforementioned graphic amendment.
It depicts Manning emerging in the manner of King Konga from the United States Disiplinary Barracks with a megaphone in his hand.
"As soon as they stop you from speaking, they will win," it reads.
"Never be afraid to be silenced."
"It's a direct transcript from one of the letters," the Philadelphia artist said.
"I think about it, my skin crawl."
Manning has not yet personally visited the exhibition - which was foretold in a comic - but when she does, she will be greeted in the middle of the room with her masks, her own genomic effigies, lined up as a mob of Protestants.
Which was also the purpose of the exhibition, including a nearly 160 cm tall statue of Maning, on which her genetic haplogroups are recorded in pencil.
"They were placed on the walls in the past, but this time I wanted the feeling of the crowd to be made out of," Dewey-Hagborg said of the portraits.
"I wanted to give the impression of a mass movement that takes on the form of Chelsea and liberates it."
Northwest University professor and Oxford University employee sought for murder
These days, a nationwide manhunt is underway for the University of Northwest and Oxford University staff who are being prosecuted for the suspected murder of a man who was found stabbed to death in a luxury Chicago apartment, police said.
A warrant was issued for the first-degree murder on a man named Wyndham Lathe (42) and Andrew Warren (56) for their alleged complicity in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, Cook County reports.
The document says that Cornell-Duranleau (26) died from several stab wounds.
Chicago police said the body of the deceased was found on July 27.
Officers were alerted to this by telephone. Upon arrival at the Grand Plaza Apartments, the victim was found in one of the apartments with several lacerations.
Cornell-Duranleau was pronounced dead at the scene and detectives are investigating the case as a homicide. Meanwhile, police are searching for the two suspects, authorities said.
Lathem has worked as an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at the University of West West since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, the vice president of the University of Public Relations, said in his e-mail statement that Lathem is now on an administrative vacation and has been banned from entering the university's school premises.
"The full matter is now being investigated by the relevant authorities and the Northwestern University is cooperating fully with them," said Cubbage.
Warren is an executive financial administrator at the University of Oxford.
A spokesman for the University of a University of Somerville said in a statement sent by email: "We have been contacted by the British police and we are ready to assist the US police as well."
The statement also states that Warren's colleagues were shocked by the fact and wish he had come forward to the police.
Anthony Guglielmi, the public relations chief of police at the Chicago Police Department, said he was urging the suspects to surrender to the relevant authorities.
"The police have information about their whereabouts, and the search for the suspects is escalating," Guglielmi said.
Guglielmi added that local, regional and national authorities are assisting the police in the search for the suspects.
According to Guglielmi, police received a call from the Grand Plaza manager, who was alerted to the events that were to take place in apartment 1008.
The police described the scene as very violent.
Guglielmi said it was unclear if the incident occurred on July 27.
He added that Lathem and Warren had been caught in security cameras.
"We believe Professor Latham knew his victim," Guglielmi said.
Grand Plaza management issued a statement to all residents: "Police are now working on compiling a timetop and profile of the victim and are investigating various motives, including domestic violence."
"We will complete WADA plan soon" - Deputy Prime Minister of Russia Mutko
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said it would not be long before the rest of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) criteria and re-alignments of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) will be implemented.
"A part of the new plan's criteria have already been completed and RUSADA has already acquired the right to be scheduling and tested in cooperation with the British Anti-Doping Agency (UKAD).
With this fact, the WADA Plan has been updated," Mutko said on Thursday.
The vice-president commented on the second part of the WADA plan to comply with the Code - which describes the criteria for the renewal of RUSADA - which was recently published on the organisation's website.
According to Mutko, the code contains nothing that Russia should be concerned about.
"Enoule has been announced, and everything will be implemented.
The results will be available to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future," he added.
However, one of the criteria mentioned calls for a public announcement of the results of the WADA investigation under investigation by Richard McLaren to the government's alleged sponsorship of Russian athletes.
On this topic, Mutko said: 'We are conducting an investigation, as our anti-doping system has clearly failed.
All measures were taken.
However, there were no state programmes in our country and we cannot therefore confess to something that never existed."
Mutko's words were confirmed by Vitaly Smirnov, director of the Russian Independent Public Anti-Doping Commission.
In an interview with Russian RSport Smirnov, he acknowledged the problems of Russian anti-doping officials, but added: "On many occasions, we said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations.
No one plans to accept the message without reservation," Smirnov concluded.
WADA suspected RUSADU of taking doping controls within Russia in November 2015 immediately before the doping scandal.
Nevertheless, the organization allowed the planning and unification of the testing under the supervision of international experts and the British Anti-Doping Agency (UKAD) in June this year.
Following a visit to the organization's Moscow headquarters in July, WADA CEO Olivier Niggli said that RUSADA was "on the right track" to restore it.
Police have charged three people, one is a juvenile.
Police charged three men with the establishment of Wednesday's fire at a rare wooden church in Třinec-Gutech in Frýdecko-Místeck.
One of the accused is a juvenile, all three are of Czech nationality.
The offence of general endangerment carries up to 15 years in prison.
The Moravian-Silesian Police Director Tomáš Kužel told reporters today.
It was, he said, a deliberate offence.
"This is a very recent issue and the police are currently working on the motive of the matter," Kužel said.
He said the police would discuss the possible remand of the accused in custody.
Further information, according to the director, cannot be disclosed.
"I can't say any more yet, because the criminal police and investigation services and the prosecutor who is supervising the matter are actually working on the matter," Cone said.
The wooden church of the Body of God in Gutech was from the 16th century.
It was a valuable monument with many original furnishings and paintings from the first half of the 16th century.
According to preliminary estimates, the material damage will run into tens of millions of crowns, but the historical loss is incalculable.
Soon after the fire, the reconstruction of the church began to be considered.
Most of the costs should be covered by the insurance policy, the additional costs are to be shared by the Ministry of Culture and the city, a public collection is also being prepared and a contribution of the owner of the monument, i.e. the local parishes, is expected.
A similar wooden 16th-century St. Catherine's Church in Ostrava-Hrabová was also destroyed by a fire 15 years ago.
It was caused by a fault in the wiring.
In its place, an exact copy was made.
The state counts on the citizens in defending the state.
They will support their training.
With financial support for associations usable in defending the state, voluntary shooting training or a team of training trainers, the substantive intention of the Act on the Preparedness of Citizens to Defence of the State counts.
The Ministry of Defence, which has been tasked with its elaboration by the government, promises to increase the physical fitness of Czechs and their abilities, which the state could then use in crisis situations.
This follows on from a proposal prepared by the Ministry.
If the law were adopted in the future, the state would spend hundreds of millions of crowns on the upswing.
The basic aim of the proposal, according to its authors, is to create an effective system that would help to increase the readiness of the population of the Czech Republic to defend the state, apart from the executive conscription and on the basis of volunteering.
For example, the state would support amateur amateur, scorer or cycult associations with a financial or material, and would make it possible to increase the capabilities of their members.
In return, he would get data on people who are willing to come to the country's aid in times of crisis if needed, and about their abilities or material equipment.
Accredited instructors could also be available to help the associations and other candidates in training or training.
It is also expected to organize sessions with war veterans or people who have acted heroically.
One possible option assumes that a new office would be created to administer and coordinate the project.
The authors of the proposal stress that people's participation should be voluntary and the state would use their capabilities only after the state of emergency is declared.
"The whole concept must respect the gradual blurring of previously obvious boundaries between the different types of threats," the project reads, referring to the dangers of so-called hybrid threats.
Ministry officials noted that it was therefore necessary to focus on supporting the widest possible set of capabilities, not just the military ones.
"The basic aim of the intention is to create a very broad base that allows each citizen to respond in a qualified way to situations threatening the sovereignty of the state or the lives, the health and property of persons, to protect themselves, or to contribute to the protection of others, and to prevent misprotect the performance of tasks to the armed forces of the Czech Republic," the intention states.
The adoption of the law would bring significant financial demands.
According to the ministry, their amount will depend on the option chosen.
For example, the Office foresees financial support for projects to prepare citizens to defend the state up to CZK 100 million.
If an administrative and coordination centre were set up, its operation could cost around CZK 60 million per year.
More money would be for salaries or to build an information system.
The proposal also assumes that the remit of the regional military headquarters would have to be expanded, which together would employ an additional 42 soldiers.
Ministry officials have previously said that the law should also help resolve the opposition of some Czech politicians to implement a European Union directive on the possession of weapons.
Its adoption would allow the shooters who will be part of the system to retain some of the weapons that the directive forbidden.
Startups to help your company not become the next Uber
Amy Errette wanted to measure the satisfaction of her e-commerce startup's employees, but she did not find the appropriate survey.
The answers were often inaccurate, unalculaous, or even deceptive.
And while promising the anonymity of the survey, some employees expressed their distrust of the process.
"I was looking for consistency and objectivity," said Errette, owner of the e-commerce of the San Francisco-based hair care company, which employs 75 people.
So she asked for help from outside.
New startups in the human resources industry are constantly appearing on the market to help companies with employee satisfaction surveys.
By creating and licensing software with the specific purpose of measuring employee obligations, startups allow companies to conduct quick voting, target specific teams and demographic groups, as well as offering complete employee anonymity and a hotline for complaints, and in some cases also allow informants to bypass executives and contact directors directly.
"There are tools like the Diet and Fitbit on the market that track your health, but where is the Fitbit for your company?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and CEO of Glint-based startup in Reedwood City.
Errett said that Glint had gained more awareness of what her employees were thinking and feeling in three years.
In addition to quick surveys and the voting of specific teams, Glint offers a company's temperature map and a record of the groups with the highest number of complaints, as well as a low-level overview of low-level managers - allowing the user to work on the remedy.
Companies are beginning to realize the need to take care of the culture of the working environment - in case they become the next Uber - which is in the back of scandals after a former employee posted a post on his blog describing the company's environment and harassment of employees who dare to speak openly.
For startups like Glint, the demand for corporate culture surveys is a lucrative business opportunity.
According to the website Let's Talk Payments, which deals with technical and financial progress, the value of the global control, regulation and compation sector can exceed $118.8 billion by 2020.
Startup Convercent of Denver, Colorado, which helps companies to prevent and detect inappropriate behavior, saw a small increase in interest and activity at the start of the year, just before Uber scandals.
Nearly 600 Convercent's clients include Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Recently, Uber also received under his wing.
Like Glint, Convercent allows companies to send customizable "light-sk" surveys, collect confidential information in real time and display temperature maps of problem areas.
It also offers an anonymous text hotline that allows employees to report inappropriate behaviors.
If the Director-General is involved in the problem, the complaints are sent directly to the board of directors.
"The court of public opinion has mandated regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, Convercent's founder and managing director.
If a company is convicted of misadaccint treatment with its employees or unethical behaviour - and if it does not take action by regulators - it may face costly consequences as a result of customer boycott, staff exhaustion or court proceedings, Quinlan added.
The Ruby Tuesday restaurant network, which employs over 25,000 people across 500 locations, has been using Convercent for more than a year to raise workers' awareness of corporate principles and procedures, and to provide an easy way to contact corporate management.
Previously, if an employee wanted to report any problem, he had to trace a phone number or an e-mail to the company's management, officially file a complaint and hope for a successful resolution.
It was often a deterrent and unpleasant experience, said James Vitrano, General Representative Ruby Tuesday, according to whom there was no reliable way of monitoring staff complaints.
Now that the company is using Convercent, it is ensured to quickly detect and solve problems that have never previously reached managers sitting in offices, miles away from actually dealing with complaints - such as discrimination, harassment or unfair treatment.
"It's coming to a holistic, overall view of the experience of the employees," said Vitrano, who runs the Ruby Tuesday group overseeing the risk management.
"At the same time, we protect shareholders from lawsuit by employees."
Companies stopped taking the ethics, values and participation of employees in the lightweight in 2002 after the accounting firm, Arthur Andersen, collapsed after the collapse of Enron on the abuse of ethical rights of employees, Quinlan said.
But it wasn't until the social media "shaped the whole thing up" that companies began to realize that they couldn't simply hide their skeletons in their closet in the online world.
"Before people started using technology to track the ethics, they were relying on the faith," Quinlan added.
Both Glint and Convercent offer their software in the form of a service for which the company pays regular fees.
It is a business model and an opportunity that is being approved by courageous equity investors that have supported both startups.
The Convercent raised $10 million in total as part of its February campaign from companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, and eventually took in $47 million in capital.
Glint raised $10 million from Bessemer Venture Partners in November and raised $60 million throughout the campaign.
These investments are hardly surprising given the mutual nature of companies, culture and risk capital.
The growing number of research clearly confirms that today's employees expect more from their workplace than ever before.
And in competing markets such as Silicon Valley, the main advantage is not high salaries and interesting projects.
Employees want to see that they are being accepted and appreciated and that they devote their time to a company that seeks a positive mission.
"If people are happy in their work, perceive that their voice is heard, and that their work is rewarding, they are striving for the success of the company," said Nina McQueen, vice president of global benefits and employee benefits at LinkedIn, which uses both Convercent and Glint.
Investors make money if the company is doing well and the companies are thriving if its employees are happy.
And when an analytical tool emerges on the market to ensure the engagement and commitment of employees to the company, it is no surprise that there will be plenty of investors to support this effort.
According to experts in the work culture, it is important to have data on employee satisfaction.
But the data itself is purposeless if the company does not take the necessary steps.
The fact is that once a company requests feedback from its employees, there may be major changes.
And unless the change arises quickly - at worst at all - it can be a disappointment and disinterest of the employees.
"Once you ask for 4,000 opinions, you have to be prepared for 4,000 conversations," said Russell Raath, the consultancy director at Kotter International, which has witnessed many companies that relied too heavily on the data itself.
"Because as soon as things aren't over, the staff will start to ask the question, 'They've even heard me?
They're interested in me?
And if not, then why should I care?" "
Madison Reed, which now regularly conducts a survey of employees every month, is able to solve the problem in one day thanks to Glintu, Errettová said.
After gathering feedback from staff who were frustrated by slow decision-making and the quality of communication, Errett was able to reorganise several teams within the company and start training for communication to a successful solution to the problem.
Ruby Tuesday is gaining a very important view of its staff and hopes to achieve high employment in the industry, which is known for frequent redundancies in the long term.
"If you are not seeking to create a transparent working environment, the staff will not believe you," Vitrano added.
"And as soon as you start losing employees, you lose customers.
And with the outflow of customers, the whole company is in the way of bankrupting."
Thursday became the hottest day.
Thursday is the warmest day of the year in the Czech Republic with 38.3 degrees recorded in Strážnice, Hodonín.
It surpassed Tuesday, which was originally the hottest day of the year with 37.3 degrees.
This was reported by the staff of the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute.
Compared to Tuesday on Thursday, however, there were not many temperature records.
The heat hit mainly Moravia, in Bohemia it was mostly cloudy.
On Tuesday, records were broken or set to a level at 35 of the 145 weather stations measuring over 30 years.
On Thursday, only nine long-term long-term stations recorded a record.
For example, in Strážnice today's temperature was the same as the previous record from 2013.
In Lednice, Břeclav today's 37.4 degrees, it surpassed the original maximum by four-tenths of a degree, and in Pohořelice in Brno the current 37.1 degrees, the current 37.1 degrees exceeded the record by three-tenths.
Both records, as with Strážnice, came from 2013.
High temperatures appeared today mainly in the south and east of Moravia.
After Strážnice, the heat was in Dyjákovice in Znojmo and Brod nad Dyjí na Břeclavsku, where the mercury climbed to 37.8 degrees, but did not surpass the record.
By contrast, for example, in western and northwestern Bohemia, today's highest temperatures so far were only around 22 degrees Celsius today.
"The temperatures started to grow there only later in the afternoon," the meteorologists said.
The current heat in the Czech Republic will gradually subtract, according to the ČHMÚ, and more significant rains could come on Sunday.
In most places of Moravia, however, the high temperatures will remain on Friday and in southeast Moravia on Saturday.
We've had this mischief here.
Billion-dollar people are not satisfied by that same vote in the election as every single person of a person in the country.
They want to make decisions directly, and because not all of them are as rude as Andrej Babiš, who wants to own the state, they buy political parties.
Penta owner Marek Dospiva, along with other fellow under-water fellows Martin Burda and Antonín Frych, is sponsoring Robejšk's Realists.
The second life of the Civic Democratic Alliance is funded by the owner of the insurance company and real estate entrepreneur, Pavel Sehnal, who is also chairman of his party.
Convicted corruptor and king of Czech gambling Ivo Valenta acquired the Private Members' Party.
The political movement Agrofert, as the Andrej Babiš project inadvertently named by the mayor of Kroměříž, Jaroslav Němec, is a chapter in itself.
Their billionaire was also recently caught by the Mayors.
It is Dalibor Dědek, owner of the company for the security equipment Jablotron.
In his own words, he enters politics to do good.
Entrée in the mayor's jersey, however, did not go very well with the Grandpa.
"I never dreamed of small goals," he said at a press conference.
This means that my goal is for the Yes movement to get the Mayors' movement to get 20 percent in the election.
Some smiled a little.
But the grandfather's slip-on is rather symptomatic.
Billionaire Dalibor Grandpa is a man of firm views.
Although he intends to compete for the votes of the Mayors, he continues to support Andrej Babiš.
The grandfather supported Babiš in the last parliamentary elections.
"Babiš is not a seasoned speaker and does not rule the pleasing rhetoric of political snakes," he wrote about him before the 2013 election.
But he certainly does not go into politics because he would like to personally improve.
For me Babiš will remain a hero.
He's willing to step out of his world, which is under control, and do something for all of us.
Shortly after the Mayors presented him as a new addition, he confessed his admiration for Babiš again.
And he said he wanted the Mayors to learn how to imagine possible cooperation with Babiš.
Some may appreciate that the Grandpa does not change his or her views and stands by his or her own, no matter what jersey he or she is wearing.
Others can speculate whether Babiš is sending his B to the Mayors to build someone this clumsy.
Others may ask whether the head of Jablotron, for example, has gone down with the boss of Agrofert in the store in a bad way to defend himself against his business rival.
The first of the Grandfather's public appearances, however, were not only revolt around Babiš.
The grandfather promised to send ten million crowns to the Mayor's campaign.
And if they need more money, they say they'll send more.
A few years ago, it would have been hard to stop at a statement like that.
Indeed, the judicially recognized crook Zdeněk Bakala was throwing millions at all parties before the 2010 elections.
The political division of the security agency Víta Bárta, TOP 09 and the Civic Democrats came together for nearly thirty million.
But today is a different time.
The law prohibits anyone from giving a political party more than three million.
When the Grandpa is entering politics, he could at least study the rules of the game.
He might not have to wonder then why politics has such a bad reputation with us.
The first days in politics were crowned by the Grandpa by proposing a tax credit for families with children studied.
People with a college degree come to about fifty thousand a month.
Those with the base at less than 20.
A man with 50 grand is rich by the standards here.
The one with the 20 poor.
In the Grandfather's vision of society, the poor pay their taxes honestly, and the rich enjoy the benefits of the functioning of the welfare state, which they are not very involved in running.
The rich simply need to be helped to avoid misery with the need.
Mayors can congratulate each other on their new acquisition, and Babiš's hands to be waggle.
The rest of us, thanks to the Grandpa, can confirm that billionaires are not good people.
The question then remains as to who to vote for.
For me, those who know the rules of the game and want to follow them.
Those who do not have members of their party or citizens and citizens of the state as their employees and the country for their property.
Finally, those who want to have a good living in a rich country for all people, not just some.
No one wanted Trump's paradise.
The villa complex had to be reduced by 234 million.
Selling a property is sometimes not easy.
And often he won't be helped by 11 bedrooms, a gorgeous view of the sea, or the fact that the property is being sold by US President Donald Trump.
When selling the Le Chateau des Palmiers's villa complex, the price went down an a whopping £8 million.
This was reported by the website Mirror.co.uk.
The brochure says, "Horin S'it, Donald J. Trump."
E-lean the place like no other.
But even the real estate company's association with the US president did not defend the extreme price tag.
Donald Trump had to cut the price of his Caribbean mansion by an astonishing £8 million.
The original price of the property was £21.5 million, the final price dropped to £13 million.
Even after the discount, the villa complex therefore costs about 76 average flats in the centre of Prague.
And it's no wonder.
The breathtaking 5 acres of the Caribbean island of Saint Martin has 12 full bathrooms, 11 bedrooms, many canteens, gym and other rooms.
It consists of several buildings.
The property also includes a swimming pool and a tennis court.
Dozens of palm trees are planted on the property.
The terrace offers a wonderful view of the sea.
According to real estate experts, the price was reflected in the fact that the association with the president was not enough to attract potential buyers.
Now the property is closer to the normal property prices on the island.
Trump bought the property in 2013.
Speculation says he paid around £15 million.
The property was to be purchased for the purpose of the lease.
Le Chateau des Palmiers was the most expensive property on the island of St. Martin.
But with the new prize, it ranks second.
The property in the neighbourhood was valued at £13.5m.
The NCAA has decided to put an end to two training sessions a day. Long days for the Bruins
The 11th morning is approaching, and UCLA's UCLA's American football players are squeezing the sidelines of the new school playground.
Some of them take off their jerseys and reveal a sweaty back, an unmistaching emblem of the first day of training camp.
For most of the team members of this few minutes of doing nothing, the noon break is supplanting.
Players enrolled in the summer semester will retire to the rooms after a three-hour training session to study for the final exams before returning to the Wasserman Football Center for a meeting that takes place in the upcoming morning at 6:30.
"There's going to be a lot of work for these guys for the next three days," said Bruins coach Jim Mora just before Monday went on Tuesday.
Elegating two training sessions in one day, the NCAA wants to lighten the players - paradoxically, the training days are even longer - at least until Friday, when the final exams are over.
That's why the first three UCLA trainings are scheduled for 7:15 p.m. to be drawn in the already crowded diaries of many students.
For the first time in the six seasons Mora spent Coach in Westwood, the Bruins' training camp starts a week earlier than last year, and the practice sessions are limited for the summer semester. The decision is also to limit the number of training sessions from two to one a day.
A total of eighteen training sessions are scheduled for August 20, with formal preparations for the first game against the Texas A&M team, which takes place in September.
Mora has been quoted as saying that he supported the NCAA's decision, even though it added another item to an already charged player diary.
"Three or four days, the players are under a lot of stress and it's very exhausting for them," Mora said.
"But nobody gave up, everyone's trying. They're great.
I think Saturday, when we have more time, things will calm down."
UCLA will be closed after the training camp is over, which will not be easy to see the clear lines of the surrounding land from the adjacent parking lot and the luxury Luskin Center, which was occupied by the players after the protection net was harvested behind the goal pole.
The Bruins players should occupy the hotel from this week, but Mora acknowledges that when the rooms are emptied during the season, there could be a problem.
"The land will be guarded by the security service," Mora added.
"Safe is taken care of, but it's possible that someone can rent a room and record our training sessions.
Such material is well traded.
Fortunately, the hotel will be guarded by security, as will parking Lot 8.
We will use our resources to the maximum.
I believe everything will be all right.
Everything's planned."
Facebook plans to check more thorough facts to limit the number of fake news
Facebook will send more potentially fake articles to check third parties and view findings under initial posts in an effort to combat so-called "fake news," the largest social network said on Thursday.
The company writes in a statement on its website that it will start using updated machine learning to detect possible hoaxes, which it will send to third parties for verification and potentially display the survey results below the original posts.
Facebook has been described as one of the main sources of fake news, and many believe that these unconfirmed reports influenced last year's election for the president of the United States.
There is a political debate about the matter in Europe. French voters are inundated with an avalanche of false news about the presidential election in May, and Germany plans to impose a fine on the social media network in advance of the September elections if it does not quickly remove angry contributions.
Facebook said in a further statement issued in Germany on Thursday that it is preparing to launch a new feature of the fake news check feature in the US, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
"In addition to displaying messages authenticated by third parties, people are asking for more content to be better informed and to make the right choice of best to decide what to share," Sara Su, a product news executive at Facebook, said on her blog.
It added that Facebook was continuing to test the "related articles" feature and is also working on further changes to reduce the number of fake news.
Creating a graphic novel: a story about A Castle in England
Scotney Castle, the small castle, recently starred in the music music video of Squeeze, and Margaret Thatcher also found her refuge in it during the 1970s and 1980s.
But Scotney has witnessed 700 years of a stormy history from his cozy spot by the Bewl River in Kent, Britain, to create a graphic novelty to create a graphic novel by the curly-grass Jamie Rhodes of York County - known for his hobby in historical documents.
"The look at the writing of a man who is 300 years after death fascinates me," says Rhodes, with a straight face.
"When I hold the letter in my hands, I feel a personal connection."
The graphical A Castle in England documentes the lives of families who have been living at the Scotney Castle since the Middle Ages to the Eduardian period. Each story is illustrated by a different British artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
But it is not Rhodes's first book inspired by the archives: he is also the author of the Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories (2014), a collection inspired by the documentaries of the British Library - a project that was very emotional for him.
"I was intrigued by a thumbprint on a letter written by a double agent in the '70s who worked for the Yakobites,' he said.
"That's his thumbprint!
And the letters always smell like smoke, because in those times you had to light a candle to read.
When I sniff the letter now, 300 years later, it's like I'm back in time.
How I love the archives!"
For someone who is so fascinated by the old papers, support from the National Trust and the Arts Council England and the possibility to dwell for almost four months in the castle is almost like a dream. ("To tell the truth, I have extended my stay a bit longer.")
Rhodes spent his time exploring the Victorian "new" castle, browsing the archives and studying many treasures and curiosities, such as the head of the hyenas on the wall and bottles that had been dumped for centuries in the moat.
He walked around the property and explored the ruins of the old castle, talking to the gamekeepers, the gardeners, and occasionally the artists who worked on the illustrations for his book.
At night, he "drings whiskey and wrote."
Scotney's trusting history is relatively largely unknown, as the National Trust did not acquire access to the documents until 2006 after the death of the last heir, Elizabeth Husseys.
When Rhodes arrived at the post ten years later, the staff were only beginning to infiltrate the archives Rhodes described in the words that "the aetrons of many centuries throw up their hands with their hands, saying, 'Trott it in the attic.'"."
The journals, letters from the time of the British Empire, maps depicting the property: "Maybe you think the land dispute is boring," Rhodes said, "but I've come across a case where two families tussled over a razor.
Stop it, people!"
Some of the stories in the book use the castle as a stepping stone and plunging deeper into English history, including a story called The Labourer, which follows the man who will leave the newly built castle to join the English uprising of 1381.
"I found a record of the 1380 castle rebellion, which was called the Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex in the book," Rhodes said.
"The English uprising actually began in this area, and it occurred to me that rebellion was a good starting point.
Maybe they're connected after all."
Other stories are firmly linked to the history of the castle - for example, The Priest, which tells the story of a Jesuit priesth who was hidden by Darrell's family for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or The Smuggler, about an 18th-century smuggler named Arthur Darrell, who allegedly staged his own funeral when he filled the coffin with stones (which was not discovered until a few years later after the coffin was uncovered).
Rhodes's favourite family is Darrell's: "I was intrigued by the men's generation - the men of the time were always in debt and they spent money on things they could not afford.
Different generations of the Darrell family dealt with it by marrying rich or old misses - I imagine they were handsome gentlemen who liked to be headheaded by heiresses.'
With the end of his stay at the castle, Rhodes searches for more adventures.
He recently returned from a two-week gig in the Finnish wilderness, where he was sucking in to inspire himself for his next book on the Elämänmäki, a former sanatorium from the early 20th century that was absorbed by nature.
But it's a special place for Scotney.
"I was sad when I left," he said.
"I thought, 'Now to get the hell back to real life.'"
Washington changes the terms and conditions for awarding the green card
The media published the words of President Donald Trump about a new US immigration plan that will also make a green-card change.
This is expected that the number of legal immigrants will fall by 50,000 year-on-year as a result of stricter rules on the granting of temporary work visas and family visas restrictions.
The new rules are proposed by Republicans and the president.
The bill will soon be submitted to Congress.
"This bill will reduce poverty, raise wages, and save billions of dollars in tax payers. We will do this by changing the rules for issuing green cards to the residents of other countries.
The law will limit the number of immigrants and replace the current scheme.
The new application process will prioritize English-speaking applicants who are funded and will show capabilities that will benefit our country," Trump, a quoted media.
Sexual robots are on the rise - we should be on the lookout
Just when it looked like 2017 couldn't be more bizarre, a report will appear online about the technological development of sexual robots.
Yes.
Sex robots are really popular at the moment.
The Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) recently issued a statement on the development of sexual robots within the next five to 10 years.
In the words of the former professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at Sheffield University and the co-founder of the FRR Noel Sharkey, the rise of sexual robots must be seen seriously.
Customers can choose the color of the eyes, the shape of the nipples and the appearance of the robot's nails.
"People are making fun of them, but sales are growing and we must be prepared to see them more and more often," Sharkey said on the occasion of the release of the report.
Modern sex aids are transformed from inflatable pan-machine to robotic women with silicone skin, who are pleasantly warm to the touch - of course, the artificial intelligence that mimics a person's behavior.
The user can "edit" the robot in their own image - from the color of the eyes and the shape of the nipples to the appearance and colour of the nails.
What is very disturbing, however, is the fact that many robots have their own "personality" that would also shame the Stepford missus.
Modern inflatable dolls have evolved into robotic women with silicone skin.
The owner of the RealBotix robot can set up different character traits to his surrogate woman, among them shyness.
And then there is True Companion's sexual robotic wife Roxxxy Gold, which is supplied with pre-programmed personalities, including "frigid Farrah," which is characterized by the shy nature and "wild Wendy" with a "adventurous" nature.
"The passenger of Roxxxxy Gold is set up to suit your personality as much as possible," reads the True Companion website.
So she likes what you like and vice versa.
It's even mood, just like the people.
She may be tired, talkative or "in the mood."
The rise of sex robots is alarming for several reasons - not one of whom is not a substitution for actual interpersonal relationships. What is more worrying are the inferior female character traits and forcible innuendo - such as frigid (read defiant) Farrah.
True Companion on its website likens Roxxxxy to a vibrator for men.
"If a woman can have a vibrator, why can't a man have a Roxxxxy?" the page reads.
But sex robots are not just a fetish or a sex aid.
Their emergence and almost perfect sophistication point to something darker and deeply rooted in our culture - a move away from ideal or sexual equality towards the desire for captivating sex with an optional premium.
Most men, of course, do not buy a robotic woman, and while FRR talks about their growing popularity, sex robots still remain on the fringes of interest from the general public.
However, this marginal interest may become a mirror set by the current modern age.
And most people are not weird or violent until they have a free market excuse.
It is no coincidence that these sophisticated sex robots appear at a time when women around the world are making their rights for themselves and the White House is sitting in the White House by a president who is often very derogatory to the woman's address.
The most horrific aspect of the Handmaiden's Tale is not what we see - hanged bodies and hollowed eyes, as the reality of these visions.
The book-or-rector's Presector's Tale is a step in the right direction, but at the moment it seems to be a small step.
Sex robots should be as similar as possible to real women (albeit with the rates of a porn actress).
Their creators construct them to be pleasant to the touch and appear at first glance like a real woman.
But when it comes to their "personality," the robot cannot replace the real woman.
They can't break up with their partner or just leave.
They have no job or no history. Nothing to inspic their independence or to disrupt their devotion to its master.
In other words, they are pleasant slaves.
Speaking of the 21st century: maids.
NBA star on the green arm.
Curry is fighting for a cut in California.
Star basketball player Stephen Curry, despite a botched first-ever shot, was not lost in his first start to professional golfers.
The two-time NBA Most Valuable Player Award winner has played the lower Web.com Tour's first round on 74 rounds at the Ellie Mae Classic in the California-based Hayward tournament and will fight for the cut.
The Golden State quarterback, who won his second NBA NBA title with the Warriors this season, started off very nervously, and his first tee-up ended up in a beverage bracket parked at the fairway's.
Even then, he was not as accurate between the holes as he was under the basketball basket, yet he left a dozen professionals behind him with a four-shot record over par.
"It wasn't the ideal way to start, to have to call the referee right after the first hit, but then it fits a bit," Curry said, noting that he was hit with huge stage fright.
It was very nervous to hit the first shot in the tournament, but it was all I'd hoped for.
"If you'd told me I'd play 74 in the first round, I'd take it immediately," he added.
If Curry manages to make it through the cut, which is likely to be set for two shots under par, he will become the first representative of another sport to do it on the Web.com Tour.
"I want to play better next time and now that I have got rid of my stage fright, hopefully it will work," said the enthusiastic golfer, who has played in celebrity tournaments and mixed competitions for amateurs and professionals in the past.
He is in Hayward's first start in a tournament that falls under the PGA.
He received a sponsorship exemption to participate in the Ellie Mae Classic and retained his amateur status.
The Web.com Tour is one category under the elite PGA Tour.
Trump's big victory?
Against this, Mitt Romney is the embodiment of common sense
The unmistminded feature of the Trump era is becoming political divisions that divide American voters and, on a micro-span, break entire families.
Over the Christmas and Thanksgiving period, the American newspapers were swarming with advice on how to deal with relatives who voted for Trump.
We're reportedly just waiting for our nerves to get the nerve.
But less attention is paid to Trump's ability to bring the family together.
I'm talking about it because my cousin came to see me in New York this week - a poet and a fan of the left who lives in Chicago and who has been paying for a Republican fool in our family for a long time.
She reminded me that the togetherness in the face of a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
Now, with Trump at the White House, the whole family is suddenly - including all the Republican siblings she's bickering about politics for years - on the same page.
It's a good thing at a family table dinner; but it's striking me that it poses a significant risk in a broader context.
Trump is strengthening the left, but the negative effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right.
If we're talking about "normalization" and Trump, we refer to the terrifying possibility that his antics may one day lose their attractiveness.
But there is an even more horrific long-term scenario in which Trump "normalizes" right-wing Republicans who, contrary to his standards, will suddenly embark on what might be called rational.
In these today, with nostalgia in my heart, I remember Mitt Romney and his version of the crazy dealings - the dog on the roof of a car, a 14% income tax (at least we were aware of his tax return) - both of which look like very mild offenses compared to Trump.
After Trump's departure, it is enough for the subsequent Republican candidate to be at least normal, which will be an immense improvement.
We took advantage of my cousin's visits and took the children to Central Park for the biggest carousel run by the New York Parks department - you won't find a better use for your $3 if you don't need caffeine.
The horses are huge, the centre roller is covered with fiberglass - clowns and animals are filmed and stare at their own shoulders in horror - a completely gloomy view and tinkling music, surprisingly, reminiscent of public transport.
Many clichés soon get tired: the view from the high-rise buildings, the sky will be relays, instead of breathing on you through the atmosphere, and the realism of the city does not get your imagination.
Thirty-five years later, I still didn't get over the fact that Swiss Cottage was not really Swiss cheese - not including the Ye Olde Swiss Cottage themed-but the London Underground.
Nevertheless, the carousel in Central Park provokes a remarkably magical experience, to the point where two two-year-olds are having a great time, as well as two mature women.
If I could evaluate the carousel, he deserves the maximum of points. Fortunately, no one is asking.
This week, I had a similar experience in the store when I was asked to pay with a credit card to evaluate my "experience" on a scale of one to five.
It's the same in a cafe on the corner of my street, with the difference that I can throw a 15% tip for something I buy behind the counter for an assessment.
Not only does it slow down the otherwise quick sale, but the waitress is thus forced to wit into the gene of shoppers when it is not needed.
The woman at the store was smiling and I was apologizing when I reluctantly assessed my five-star credit card to be handed over.
Oscar Pistorius was taken from prison to hospital for chest pain
This is the second time Pistorius has had to be taken to hospital.
Last year, he was treated for cuts to his wrist wounds, which the prison said he had self-inflicted after falling in a cell.
Pistorius was convicted of murder following an appeal against the original murder sentence.
He killed his girlfriend Steenkamp with several gunshot wounds through the toilet cupboard door in the early hours of Valentine's Day in the early hours of the year of 2013 at his home in Pretoria.
Pistorius claimed he misthel wrong with the thief.
Prosecutors announced their intention to re-appeal, this time against Pistorius' six-year sentence, which they say is too lenient.
The National Prosecuting Authority said it would appeal to South Africa's Supreme Court and the trial would take place later this year.
If successful, Pistorius faces an extension of the sentence to up to 15 years.
In South Africa, the death penalty does not apply.
For the first time in history, a baby was born captive to a bred panda who had matured in the wilderness.
For the Panda Rescue Program, it is a huge success.
The centre is trying to expand the pandas gene pooled in captivity.
The center's worker, Zhang Zhong, told the New China news agency that there was a major risk of breeding pandas stemming from kinship interbreeding.
In fact, only 471 pandas lived in captivity at the end of last year.
Only two thousand survive in the wild.
The attempt to savage captured pandas with the wild ones is thus the first step towards the breeding of the panda to help protect this species.
Cchao-cchao, 15, was released into the nature reserve at the start of the panda's mating period on March 11.
Thanks to the tracking device on their necks, scientists could observe her every move.
She met her chosen man, Cchao-cchao, 12 days later.
The sexual intercourse with the male's panda lasted a minute and a half and landed successfully.
This, too, can be considered a minor miracle, because the Panda males are not considered the most successful lovers of the animal kingdom.
Males are quite miscalciled at the time when the female is ready, and they are often confused and have no idea what to do.
The cub was born healthy and, even as Chaochao had an extraordinary appetite during her pregnancy, weighed 216 grams after the birth.
The average weight of a newborn panda is 70 grams lower.
For illegal camping in Greece, two Bulgarians detained
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced the detention of two Bulgarian tourists in the territory of Greece for illegal camping, the comments quoted by BTV.
A group of tourists, including two Bulgarians, was detained by the Sithonian police in the early hours of August 1.
They were all released on the same day, but the investigation continues.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs told bTV that Bulgarian tourists were later released.
The Greek authorities have tightened the rules on free camping and are imposing strict fines on anyone caught at a place where camping is not allowed.
Checks will take place all season.
The ministry said the court could impose a fine.
Spilková is in 50th place after the first round of the British Open.
Golfer Klára Spilková ranks in a share of 50th place after the first round of the British Open major.
The play-field at the Kingsbarns, Scotland, was rounded off with a one-stroke score, playing three birdies and two bogeys.
The 22-year-old Czech player is thus hopeful of making the cut at the famous major for the first time.
Entering the $3.25 million grant contest, American star Michelle Wie made the best of her first round in a 64-shot record, eight under par.
Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands are pulling millions of toxic eggs from the market.
The Netherlands itself has already temporarily closed 180 poultry farms due to the incident.
The Dutch NVWA Food Safety Authority told Reuters that it is investigating 20 percent of all Dutch poultry farms, which it says is that 80 percent of the eggs on the market are safe.
The Authority stressed that the risk was only a limited number of egg types that were discernible according to specific figures.
According to the German authorities, the amount of the toxic substance in the eggs is small and does not pose a danger to adults, but it is a potential threat to children.
Czech JRC spokesman Petr Majer said that eggs and chicken eggs from the Netherlands and Belgium, where the authorities have also approached the closure of breeds, have not been adjorated in the Czech Republic recently.
However, veterinarians will take random samples of eggs and chicken meat originating in Belgium, the Netherlands, France, Italy, Germany and Poland, the markets of which the problem insecticide brands have emerged.
The eggs from Belgium were on the Czech market for the last time in April and eggs from the Netherlands for the last time in May, according to the veterinary administration.
Chicken meat from Belgium last appeared in the Czech Republic in June.
In the Czech Republic, however, there is a certain amount of chicken meat from the Netherlands.
Fipronil is a substance that is usually part of flea products, everything and ticks.
However, it must not be given to animals whose meat is consumed by humans.
The WHO, the World Health Organization, considers the preparation to be slightly toxic.
His high doses lead to a feeling of nausea and dizziness.
Riga is beautiful, I will miss him, says goalkeeper Sedláček and is looking for an engagement.
I'd like to catch ten more years.
"Maybe I'll go back there one day," said 27-year-old Sedláček, who could start the season in the Zlín jersey.
It depends on whether he gets an engagement by the start of the new year.
What were the four years you had in Latvia?
If I had to rate it like I did at school, three.
The first year I didn't catch much, I had an experienced goalkeeper in front of me.
I was a tin.
The second year I started catching.
Before the third season, I thought they would give me more space.
But they brought in a new goalkeeper, with whom I took a rotation again.
Last year, I assumed I'd be catching all the time.
But in the opening ten games, we only got maybe five points, so the coaches started to shoot it.
By the end, my colleague was catching more.
But that's how it's done.
They wanted to play it for next season.
How was life in Riga?
Beautiful.
It's a small Prague.
A beautiful, European, historic city.
I'm gonna miss him.
I found a girlfriend there.
We're together for the third year, we're getting married next year.
So I brought something.
How demanding is the KHL for the goaltender?
The first ten teams are really good.
Then there are the teams like us or the Slav, who have to change their playing style against them.
The skills are on the other side, so you have to replace it with something.
That means playing backwards, fighting more.
In the width of the pitch, I didn't see the problem.
The difference is the Russians want to play to the empty.
They shoot a slight shot, and even though they have a half-empty goal in front of them, they prefer to record.
There are more shots in the Czech Republic.
Didn't you have a problem with travelling and moving over seven time zones?
If you don't have a family, it's not a problem.
He can get some sleep in peace.
The program is usually made so that you play, like, four matches out there and then you have two days off.
How do the Latvians feel about their club in the KHL?
As a national team.
All of Latvia watches hockey, along with basketball it's a national sport.
They all cheer.
Even when things weren't going well, a lot of people came.
Did Dinamo's KHL's tenure help to Latvia almost advance to the quarterfinals at this year's World Cup?
The KHL has been playing since 2008 and Dinamo has been there since the start.
And from the same time, their World Cup results began to go up.
At the 2014 Olympics in Sochi, they fell to Canada in the quarterfinals just 1:2.
That was an incredible result for them.
The KHL brought them to a higher level.
More Latvian players are heading to the Czech Extraliga.
Roberts Bukarts came through in Zlín and before signing the contract is Ralfs Freibergs.
Why does it come in so many?
They're not B's players, they're really quality.
The teams here are looking for cheaper and younger players from abroad, the Latvians are among them.
It's a natural direction.
The KHL starts in three weeks.
Why are you still without an engagement?
I knew at the beginning of February that I would not continue in Riga.
That's how we started looking for something.
Sparta was on the table.
But because they didn't have a goalkeeper's budget, we didn't make a deal.
Then it was a classic.
We talked to different teams, but they decided for someone else in the final.
So I'm training at home in Zlín and I'll wait for something to show up.
Aren't you nervous about it?
That was when I left here four years ago, not knowing what was going to happen.
The current situation is not the best, on the other hand I am at home after a while.
I caught something in the KHL, so I'm taking it the other way.
The question is when and where I'm going to sign.
How real is the option of starting the new year in Zlín?
Anything can happen.
We'll see what happens in a month, where what will go.
Now all I can do is wait to see what the agent will finish.
Do you prefer a competition?
The past season was not enough to be able to choose.
So I'm waiting for the phone.
The government fling at Leto continues.
In January this year, in an article with the care of a proper housekeeper? I also wrote about the camp at Lety u Orlík.
The essence of the problem remains the same, so I would like to recall the core passages of the article.
The camp at Lety has been talked about for many years.
For readers who don't know exactly what's going on, it's probably best to look at, for example, the official website of the cultural monument Pietní místo Lety.
There, in the introduction to the historical overview, they learn that the camp stood two kilometers east of the village of Lety, that it had served as a labour camp since 8 Aug. 1940, it was a collection camp and from 2 August 1942 it became a Gypsy camp.
The next text describes the course of life in the camp, including inhumane conditions, until March 1943, when the first flyers were assigned to the Auschwitz transport.
On 4 January 1943, the largest transport to the extermination camp was transported by 370 people.
There were 420 in total.
A very sad history of the immense hardships of human beings, which were again caused by human beings and perverted ideology.
There is no dispute that it is necessary to constantly commemorate these events.
Nor is there any dispute that the commemoration should take place at the memorial at the site of the experience of these people's ordeal.
The problem is elsewhere.
Under socialism, the camp was somehow forgotten a bit, and in the 1970s a pig farm was built near and part of the former camp.
The history of the camp was accidentally discovered in 1992 by the American Paul Polansky, who was unveiled at Lety in 1995.
In the mid-1990s, the government promised to buy and demolise the pig farm, but it has not yet done so.
In 1998 the memorial was declared a cultural monument and since 2009 its administration has been under the Lidice Memorial.
In July 2013, the UN Human Rights Committee called on the Czech Republic to close the pig farm.
So much for very briefly the facts of the postwar fate of the camp.
It was not until last autumn that the government approved the purchase of the pig farm and decided to have an expert report to determine the price be drawn up.
According to the Minister of Agriculture, the government will then buy the pig farm.
According to Culture Minister Herman, "some numbers exist, but I'd probably be thwarting the intentions if I went public with them."
We'll see what the expert opinion brings.
According to some unofficial estimates, there may be hundreds of millions, while others say the price may reach a billion.
Either way, it's by no means a cheap proposition.
And yet there is a memorial to the former camp, in whose modification the state invested almost ten million crowns in 2010.
Even if the full transaction were funded by the UN Human Rights Committee, which is unlikely to be imminent, I think it would be a throw-out of money anyway.
Doesn't the government have other priorities?
The memorial, a dignified reverent place, stands by the will of history practically in the immediate vicinity of the tragedy, and anyone who wants to can bow to the memory of the suffering and the murdered.
I see no reason to change this!
Let's leave it to the way it is, and keep the reverent place with the utmost care.
The entrusted property, including the taxpayer's money, should be handled by the responsible person, in this case the government of the Czech Republic, with the care of a proper householder.
At least with the one, like in your own company!
Of course, the Minister of Finance and the Deputy Prime Minister is not the whole government.
Even so, from the point of view of the above, I see the slogan of the leader of the ANO movement only as an empty pre-election proclamation.
In May this year, I went to see the place directly.
Very decent driveway, landscaped parking, replicas of wooden camp houses.
In one exhibit, in the other an integrated toilet with running water.
A small natural amphitheater with seating and overlooking its own remembrance site, which is made up of stones located on a gentle slope.
Lots of flowers and wreaths.
All attributes corresponding to the meaning of this place as appropriate.
Archaeological research is currently underway at the site of the original camp.
It would be sensible to consider whether, for example, part of the uncovered foundations could be preserved and at least visually accessible in an appropriate way.
This is the direction could be hinged on his efforts by Culture Minister Daniel Herman.
In the event that he succeeds in the government to buy the pig farm with state money, it will be just another unfortunate step in his already problematic tenure as Minister of Culture.
Red meat, dairy products and chocolate may relieve symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
For your digestive system, red meat and dairy products can be a nightmare.
But a new study suggests the opposite: a diet rich in animal protein and dairy products could help relieve the symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease.
The inheickle disease, which affects up to 1.3 million people in the US and 300,000 patients in the UK, causes abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
Patients are usually reminded not to use meat and dairy products to relieve the symptoms. However, researchers at the University of Washington found that the essential amino acid tryptophan contained in the protein helps to create immune cells that promote bowel resistance.
Study leader Dr. Marco Colonna explained that the immune cells protect the intestines and ensure the de-escoring of harmful microbes from food.
The number of inflammatory cells is balanced by the number of cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissue.
Once the scales tilve to the side of the inflammation, an inflammatory bowl disease can occur.
As part of the research, researchers found the presence of immune cells supporting the body's tolerance in the stomach of the mouse with a particular bacterium.
This bacterium requires the presence of tryptophan to create cells - one of the building blocks of the proteins.
Professor Colonna said, "We have found a link between one type of bacterium - the Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the intestinal microbiome and the development of cells that promote the tolerance of the body.
The more tryptophan the mice had in their diet, the more these immune cells had."
At the same time, he suggested that if the same thing turned out to be true for humans, then a combination of L. reuteri and tryptophan-rich bacteria would help develop a more tolerant and less inflammatory bowel environment.
Postgraduate researcher Dr Luisa Cervantes-Barraganwas, in the study of a certain type of immune cells supporting body tolerance, discovered that one group of test mice had these cells, while the other group of the same mouse-rehearsed detached cells lacked.
It was inferred from the fact that one group of mice has a different gut microbiome - a community of bacteria, viruses and fungi that normally dwells in the gastrointestinal tract.
The mice was tested by the DNA-mandate method, and the researchers found six types of bacteria in mice with immune cells that were missing from the second group of mice.
Mwes, which were bred in a sterile environment and lacked the gut microbiome - so they did not develop this type of immune cells - was administered by L. reuteri - and created immune cells.
To understand how the bacteria affects the immune system, the researchers grew L reuteri in the liquid and then transferred a small amount of fluid - without the bacteria - to the undeveloped immune cells that were stored in isolation.
The immune cells evolved into tolerant cells.
After the removal of the active ingredient from the liquid, it was shown to be a by-product of tryptophan metabolism known as indolyl-3-octic acid.
When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the diet of mice, the amount of these cells increased by 50 percent. At the same time, the number of cells dropped by half after the splits of tryptophan.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that humans have the same tolerant cells as mice, and most of us store L. reuterium in their gastrointestinal tract.
It is not known if the toppled products of tryptophan from L. reuteri bacteria cause the development of cells in humans in the same way as in mice, but the defects in the tryptophan-related genes were found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan added: "Each of us should probably strive to develop these cells because they check the inflammatoryness of the intestine's inner surface.
Potentially high level of tryptophan in the presence of L. reuteri can increase the cell population."
Jose Mourinho considers signing a contract with Nemanj Matić and his transfer to Manchester United as 'genius'
Manchester United have recruited a "genius" in the form of Nemanja Maticch to their team - or so Jose Mourinho thinks after the midfielder made his debut in Wednesday's game against Sampdoria.
Matic, who signed a £40m contract, made his first match in a 2-1 win in Dublin - the last pre-season match for the UEFA Super Cup, where United will meet with Real Madrid on Tuesday - and impressed with the midfielder alongside Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira.
However, as he did not take part in the team's pre-season Asian tour, Matic did not have form and played only 45 minutes, which Mourinho said needed to be incorporated before the start of the Premier League season.
'He takes time, but he's experienced, intelligent, and he's got a brilliant mind-thinking football,' said Mourinho.
"We'll help him get fit as soon as possible."
Like Matic, his new teammates Victor Lindelöf and Romelu Lukaku also played their first game at Aviva Stadium and Mourinho is slowly starting to shape his eleven for the next season.
The independent source announced this week that Mourinho still wants to sign with three other players, but insists that the club has done a "fantastic job" and brought three of the four most important players to the team.
"Thank the club for helping me recruit three of the four players," he added.
"Four of the four would please me more, but I admit they did their best for me."
Life's challenge to the king of chicken cuties, Ládi Hruška.
He wants a lesson from Pohlreich!
The multifaceted picture began to take shape thanks to a new show on TV Prima's Zdenek Academy.
Pear immediately blew the chance.
"Dear Zdenek, I would like to join your cooking academy by doing this, because I think I can learn a lot from you," he said in a social media video.
And since the two of them have been tiptoeing for several years, Lada has not forgotten to irritate him this time either.
"In return, I can teach you Znojmo from Diet Chicken Cucumber, or invite you to the water and show you why fried cheese is popular," Hruška said.
He is really serious about his participation in Pohlreich's new show.
It is time to move up a level and learn from the master.
"The question is the boss, what the boss said to him," he told Lightning.
But Pohlreich didn't comment because he was filming new episodes of his next show, Chef!.
Only Prima responded to Hruška's participation in the culinary academy, taking the whole affair as his personal activity, which goes off-TV.
A big blow was struck by Hruška Pohlreich in December 2004 with his first cookbook.
Within a few days, it had sold over 300,000 units!
The new show, presented by Prima at a press conference for the autumn broadcasting scheme, is a genuine cooking school.
Pohlreich selects his pupils from the ranks of the audience and introduces them to twelve cooking techniques in twelve episodes.
In the last episode of his show Now, the boss cooks in November 2014 Zdeněk had his T-shirt ironed on the back of his T-shirt.
If he had my face there, I'd have laughed a lot.
"I just smile at the pear - the pear is a healthy fruit and has a lot of vitamins," Lada responded.
Lada's culinary art, he thinks.
"Grea to be able to do, according to Ládi Hruška, is not an option at home, either, because I will not go home to gastropunk," the boss is clear.
I respect Zdeněk Pohlreich very much, even making chicken on honey according to him.
But his recipes will not appear on my show," Hruška said.
He's an asshole!
He's no cook to me, he's a TV clown.
"A gastronomic illiterate or asshole," Pohlreich said of Hruška in a lecture.
"I'm not 20 to be able to wave my hand at them, but I don't deal with them that way anymore," Hruška said in the account of the insults.
The British inventor uses a microchip in his hand to unlock the car and the house with a wave
The British inventor became the first person in the country with a microchip injected into his body. With a simple wave of his hand, he can unlock the door to the house and office and even start a car.
Thirty-3, Steven Northam, 33, has had the tiny chip implanted between his thumb and forefinger and is currently offering the same service through his company BioTeq to companies and individuals who want to make life easier by technology.
The implantation procedure and the treatment procedure are overseen by Dr. Geoff Watson, anaesthesiologist at Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester.
The technology works on the same principle as microchips implanted in dogs and cats, and the entire procedure takes 30 seconds.
The Northam company also offers a microphone-compatible door and car lock replacement service. The price of one lock is £300.
The married one-child father had the technology integrated into his home and his BMW Z4 car, which he starts with a simple wave of his hand.
White House prop cost taxpayers $1,000
The White House's decision to fly the Navy helicopter to South Lawn to mark last month's celebration of the U.S. manufacturing industry, cost $40,000, according to Navy records released by TIME.
The green white helicopter Sikorsky VH-3D, also called Marine One in the presence of the president on board, was the highlight of the July 17 program at the White House, which was a parade of U.S. design programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and several senior White House officials surveyed the product parade from all 50 states.
The Connecticut helicopter was on display next to a Maine yacht, a Wisconsin fire truck and a fork-shaped lifting cart from the Mississippi.
The White House military officer issued the fragmentary order, or FRAGO, and requested the presence of the helicopter less than 36 hours before the helicopter landed at South Lawn as part of an "extraordinary" event, Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1) - the units responsible for managing the helicopter - said.
"I wanted to make sure you had a known interest in such an important event," the HMX-1 commander wrote in an e-mail to his superior, the Navy's Air Force Commander the day before the event began.
The report indicated that the helicopter would arrive at South Lawn on July 17 at approximately 7:00 a.m. to mark the occasion of the parade, which is scheduled to begin at 3 p.m. and will remain in place until the full evacuation of the entire site, scheduled between 6:00 and 9 p.m.
The e-mail also said that if there was a delay in departing from the White House, a replacement crew would be sent for a return flight due to the working time regulations.
The original crew remained in place that evening along with the helicopter, along with a unit of security personnel.
The records - obtained by the weekly TIME - showed if the second crew was eventually sent.
The Hatch Act prevents civil servants from using government property for political purposes.
The records indicate that HMX-1 is investigating a possible infringement of this Regulation.
"We were wondering if it was a violation of the Hatch Act and we were assured that all was well," the commander wrote.
"It's like you've been blocked," the deputy commander wrote back.
This "Made in America" show was designated as an official event by the White House and the Hatch Act would not have covered it.
But even official events have political subtexts.
In his participation in the events, the president pushed for a health-care reform that passed through the Senate and spoke of an effort to rein in the government's regulation.
The use of air transport vehicles such as Marine One or Air Force One for political purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
Presidents use them when they travel.
However, their presence purely for presentation reasons is unusual.
Trump ordered a check in February after the presidential plane was in the background at his first campaign rally in Melbourne, Florida. His Twitter account is overwhelmed by complaints about the use of the presidential plane by his predecessor.
"The White House is pleased with the 'Made in America' parade, which has introduced products from all 50 states made by Americans from American materials," said Deputy Press Secretary Lindsay Walters.
HMX-1 helicopter's crew often practice landing in the Washington and South Lawn areas, rehearsing possible arrivals with the President of the United States in the White House with maximum precision.
While Trump attended the G-20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July, the HMX-1 conducted a 58 practice landing at the White House.
The flight to the Made in America parade was part of the crew's current training session, a state official said.
The helicopter's unit flew the helicopter for another eleven hours as part of "non-presidential support missions" on the same day.
The White House said that no more props were paid for by taxpayers' money.
A Sikorsky spokesman said the company had not been involved in the negotiations to issue the helicopter at South Lawn in any way.
The HMXX-1 does not keep records of the presidential flight budget, and the exact cost of the parade is difficult to determine, according to the navy.
According to the Ministry of Defence, the hourly price for the fiscal year 2017, the reimbursement of DoD's expenditure for VH-3D is CZK 24,380 per flight hour.
The unit's records indicate a time of 30 minutes from the Marine Corps Air Facility Quantico base in Virginia and back.
The White House argues that the helicopter's actual operating costs are well below that amount.
"Placing taxpayer costs based on estimates for reimbursement is very misleading," Walters said.
"These estimates include staff, maintenance and many other hidden costs that are included in the annual cost."
According to the 2015 RAND study, reimbursements for expenses DoD do not include staff costs, but include the cost of fuel, maintenance and contract costs.
The then White House press secretary Sean Spicer advocated the use of the helicopter for the parade.
"The Idea show this week is to present products made in the US," Spicer said.
"I am aware that the Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud of the fact that they contribute to our nation's defense, and that they provide work to hundreds, if not thousands, of people.
I think, like most Americans, that we are proud of the helicopter and the other military facilities, the production of which involves countless American citizens.
It is for the fact to be recalled.’
It is unclear if Trump was also looking at the helicopter while rounding his rounds at South Lawn. All he can say is that he sat behind the wheel of one of the fire trucks.
Back at the White House, Trump approached a Sikorsky company representative and joked with the media about his own product fleet.
"I know Mexico very well," the President said, "I own three of them."
The young woman was stuck in a swamp at Mácha Lake, the police wagled to her.
The girl set off to the beach at about 2 a.m. on Sunday.
Instead of bathing, however, she was trapped in the wetlands.
When she decided to use her mobile phone to ask the officers for help, she had the last 12 percent of the battery.
"That's why the officers soon lost contact with her," police spokesperson Ivana Baláková said.
Several police patrols had set out to the scene, which she had approximately described, but finding the young woman was not at all easy.
"Some of the officers had to wade through reed wetlands hundreds of meters before they smelled solid ground again underfoot," Baláková said.
And so was she, too, missing.
The officers were oriented to the direction her cries for help.
"To avoid at least losing this connection, they agreed with her to count out loud," the spokesperson said.
Officers did not find the woman until quarter to five in the swamps in the Borný locality.
She was on the brink of physical and psychological strength, showing signs of hypothermia.
That's why the ambulance called in her took her to a Czech-leaning hospital.
The connection of the Old Grandfather with STAN?
The in-demand bride becomes a saleable girl.
That's a bit ironic.
With his web project, the po seem to be a billionaire telling voters that STAN is suffering from a deficit of decent people.
He also confirmed that a politically disparate bunch of lesser-known mayors and independents actually had no national agenda for the House election.
Her election candidate will simply become a decent man after her interview with the Grandpa, whatever his political opinion.
Once, this is how Vít Bárta started out and it didn't work out very nicely.
In addition, his hunt for decent people and personalities, who will eventually be replaced by some mayors on the ballot, which even Gazdík admitted, and the president of STAN's favourite argument that the biggest value of the movement is precisely politically tested and experienced mayors, traditionally the most popular politicians and surveys.
These will now be easily replaced by hastily collected unknown personalities.
The total breakup with the people, after which STAN changed the logo and the slogan, was also explained by Gazdík by saying that the movement does not want to lose its identity on the candidates' candidates.
But if STAN was suspected of identity by few then, after the arrival of the Grandpa, even a mere game of identity ends.
Not only Gazdík has long been outspoken against ANO by Andrej Babiš, but at the first joint press conference, Dědek, who publicly praises Babiš, said: "My aim is for the ANO movement, that is, the Mayors movement to win twenty percent in the upcoming elections."
Let's hope he's not mistaken the movement.
The Grandpa is a successful businessman, and a billionaire is certainly no accident.
He often talks about politics much like Babiš, but unlike him, he does not build his own political brand.
For some time, STAN has been more like a reality show than a real political party, and Grandpa's helping hand seems to be making the in-demand bride even more into a shop-and-out girl.
For a while STAN went with TOP 09, then with the Peoples and now for a change looking for decent people.
Let's hope someone calls.
Police dogs trained in Most flights by helicopter
Dogs specialized in searching for explosives and search dogs rehearse today at Lake Most rehearsal with helicopter flights.
The police dog must not be fazed and fear flying, said the head of the police cynologists of the Ústí Region, Petr Tomášek.
The police dog's training takes about two years.
At Most, both the adult trained dogs and those who are undergoing training were trained.
Alongside standard training, in which they were to detect live samples of explosives around the lake and look for a lost figurehead, all 12 animals had to board a helicopter and fly over the lake.
The main purpose of the exercise is to test the dogs in the helicopter.
So that immediately after the helicopter touched down, the dog can go to work so he doesn't have a problem with the helicopter's journey.
"The helicopter will be up to the helicopter, the dog goes and immediately searches," said Tommy.
The dog, which is restless or is unable to start work on the helicopter journey, is removed from training.
"Most of the most part, they are then kept by the dog handlers, for example, in the garden," Tommy said.
Police have 76 dogs with various specializations in the Ústí nad Labem Region.
German shepherds predominance, but there are also more Belgian shepherds.
The handler takes care of him from the puppy.
"He is raising it himself, preparing it for the service the dog will do for us," added Tommy.
The animal undergoes repeated veterinary examinations that may reveal any medical handicaps.
If the dog is healthy and unhazous, he takes his first exams at 20 months.
"He gets into a sharp hit around two and a half to three years," Tommy added.
The length of service in the police depends on the state of health of the dog.
It is usually for eight to ten years.
They then mostly live with their dog handlers.
Trailer for season 3 of Narcos: Pablo Escobar out of the game and Cali Cartel becomes the centerpie of the Netflix hit series
Despite the end of the second season of Narcos, when the killer of Pablo Escobar is revealed, Netflix's series is far from over.
Confirmation from the streaming service has already received the third and fourth seasons - the former has already seen the first trailer and an outrethed of other negative characters.
In the third season, the DEA is focusing on the world's richest drug cartel: Cali Cartel.
Under the leadership of four influential godparents, they operate "as a Fortune 500 ranking company," with the only difference being that they escalate violent acts and bribe multiple government officials.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is the leader of the cartel, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) plays the brains of operations, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) is in charge of the merger with Mexico and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) controls New York.
In the new trailer, Pedro Pascal returns as Javier Peña, the figure recruiting the American and Colombian law enforcement enforurs in the fight against drugs.
Other actors include Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishé and Arturo Castro.
The third season of Narcos will make his debut on September 1.
According to the UN, Afghan democracy relies on women in politics
Elections can only be credible if all members of society, including women, take part, the UN representative in Afghanistan said on Wednesday.
Nicholas Haysom, the UN Auxiliary Assistance Representative official, said hundreds of women were taking part in local council elections, three women were running for vice-presidency, and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters were women.
"You cannot ignore the business of women," he said in his statement on Wednesday.
The elections can only be fully representative and credible if women take part, as well as all the relevant processes involved in the elections.
Local and presidential elections in Afghanistan are held on 5 April.
The Taliban have made several threats against the electoral process that move international combat activities to the second rail.
In this year's elections, for the first time ever, one democratically elected government is handing over its power peacefully to the next government.
Haysom said that the strong role of women would strengthen Afghanistan's democracy.
The Afghan Independent Electoral Commission said they made up 1.2 million women out of a total of 3.6 million registered voters.
The unique brewery is brewing beer again.
A good beer for the re-created brewery.
The enthusiasm and honesty of the new owners brought to life a few years ago the brewery in Lobč u Mšena.
The brewery, first mentioned in 1586, has a Renaissance core and was rebuilt into a steam-rooper operation in the nineteenth century.
It was followed by years of heyday, when the brewery was famous for mainly dark beers.
Unfortunately, production was halted during the Second World War and the brewery was nationalized in 1984.
Since then, the buildings have served the state farmhouse.
The work of the destruction was completed by the owners of the brewery after 1989.
The abandoned area was devastated and dismantled into building materials.
But in 2007, new hope dawned in the form of new owners, architects Jana and Pavel Prouzov.
They began to repair the buildings with the utmost respect for the spirit of the building and every detail.
They have been carefully involved and devote to studying archival materials, trying to preserve the original materials and building elements.
The brewery takes the same form as it did in the nineteenth century, when its golden era kicked off.
Their work was awarded by the brewery's declaration of a cultural monument by the Ministry of Culture, and the building became part of the European Industrial Heritage Trails.
In 2015, they also solemnly renewed the tradition of brewing beer.
To taste a great lobech beer in the picturesque landscape of Kokořínsko, visit the draught in the brewery area.
In brewing beer, they use kokořín water springing from a protected landscape area, malt from the lobbicle fields and the žatecký hops.
In the saloon you will taste the traditional light lager, as well as dark beers and specials.
And don't miss the brewery tour, it takes place on Saturdays and Sundays at noon and at half past one.
The largest artillery fortress of Czechoslovakia?
One of the largest fortresses of its type on a global scale?
Such a unique building was to be the fortress of Stachelberg between Trutnov and Žacléř, at the top of the terrain ridge above the village of Babí.
It was originally intended to consist of up to twelve bunkers connected by large underground.
Here was to be headquarters, barracks, ammunition depots, materials, power plant, engine room and hospital.
However, the construction was ended by the Munich Agreement.
In less than a year, he managed to build a single massive reinforced-concrete bunker and underground spaces were broken.
Thanks to the enthusiasts of the Stachelberg Society, who started to reconstruct the unique building in the early 1990s, you can also come here.
The underground is now 75 percent accessible!
The area includes, in addition to the T-S 73 infantry, with an exhibition and underground and an armed light fortification object, as well as two built-up infantry chibos, trenches and a nature trail of the Opevený Trutnovsko.
Refreshments, a cosy gazebo and breathtaking views of the countryside guaranteed!
This unique and beautiful Czech building has made the list alongside such monuments as the Great Wall of China, Traian's Port at Rome or the Assyrian Palace in Ninive and Nimrud.
The Chotěšov monastery originally from the early thirteenth century, which today consists mainly of a massive four-winged convent building above the beautiful garden.
The list he has made to, but unfortunately belongs to unique structures that are in danger of extinction.
But the enthusiasts don't want to give up and organize a lot of events to support the monastery.
One of them is the next year of the evening for the Chotěšov monastery this Saturday, the fifth of August, where will be performed by, among others, Vladimir Mišík, Ivan Hlas, will perform fencing performances and you will look at the places of the beautiful vast building, which are usually inaccessible.
Mostly, though, you'll enjoy the atmosphere of this great place.
You want to look at the Neanderrts' face?
The exhibition Welcome to the Neanderthals in the Anthropos Pavilion of the Moravian Museum in Brno attracts an unusual excursion to the deepest prehistoric prehistoric times to the Stone Age, to the world of our predecessors.
You will find out how the Neanderthals were able to cope with all sorts of extreme climatic conditions in a perfect way, mainly with alternating ice ages and interleas.
Despite their simple material culture, the predators of their time were extremely successful predators.
You will also learn what they looked like, what their anatomy, their technological skills and their hunting skills were, but also their aesthetic sensibilities.
That you wouldn't have said it to the Neanderrts?
Let yourself be convinced in Brno.
The fourteenth festival KELT & WORLD MUSIC takes place on Saturday the fifth at Veveří Castle.
In addition to great music, you will see the building of the Celtic village, try out the Celtic way of life, including crafts, games for children and adults, the falsical, the magic or ritualistic painting on the body.
There will be no misses La Quadrilla with Irish and Scottish dances, drum jamming, a bagpipe game and an amazing fire surprise performed by Carpe Noct.
What does Moravskoslezsko like?
The seventh edition of the well-known gastro-festival How to Shmakuje Moravskoslezsko takes place on Saturday, August 5, 2017 in the area of the Karlova Studánka mountain spa.
Cooking will be chef Miroslav Kalina, you will taste culinary specialties and regional foods, enjoy music and dance performances, a rich programme for children such as creative workshops, a theatre, a bouncy castle, a smirk competition path and, of course, a number of competitions.
Get to know the plant with one click.
Students with herbarium creation and ordinary plant lovers will be helped by the new free application Pl@ntNet.
When they're interested in what plant they've just come across on a walk, this app will advise them.
All they'll have to do is photograph the plant, and the app recognizes what kind it is.
The new app, which is available for both iOS and Android, was presented on Tuesday by representatives of the CEE Center in the Mountain Park of the Central Ethics and Environmental Education in Bratislava as part of the Secret Life of the City project.
The project also involved pupils from 50 Czech and Slovak schools, who photographed and added plants from their surroundings to the app's database.
The newly created French app is free to download on the Secret Life of the City website.
The main goal of the French programmers was for as many people as possible to contribute to the app with their images, thereby increasing the number of plants that the application can recognize.
"Already children who keep a tablet or mobile phone in their hand can go to the forest," said Ivana Poláčková, the project's coordinator.
Based on a high-quality photo of the flower, leaf or fetus of the plant, the application can recognize its name in seconds, which is then added in both Czech and Slovak under the photo.
The French allowed us to translate the app into Slovak and Czech for the Secret Life of the City project.
It is therefore welcome for users to contribute to the app after opening an account with a picture of a plant that is not yet found in the database.

GMB's concerns about investment in McVitie's factory in Glasgow
The union is demanding assurances from the managers of the biscuit maker McVitie's about the long-term production commitment at the Glasgow factory.
The Scottish GMB union said the company was silent for the time being about any investment in the Tollcross factory.
The factory has more than 500 employees who produce, among other products, the Hobnob and Rich Tea biscuits.
The owner of McVitie's, Pladis, said it had invested more than £5 million in the entire area in the previous few years.
It added that the employees and representatives of the unions would be "between the first informed" in the event of changes to the operation of the factory.
In a letter to the construction company, the Scottish GMB unions expressed their concern that McVitie's would "not get its promises to finance and upgrade production lines."
The GMB's main organiser, Drew Duffy, added: "The fact that we have not received a clear response from the site of the supervisor about the company's needs and the future investment plan in Tollcross is very worrying for our members.
Generations of many families have worked here, and employees come mostly from the local community and the Glasgow area, where working at the factory here is a critical pillar of decent employment in the area of high unemployment and social exclusion.
From a point of view of work, salaries, and utility - and, despite the outlook for Brexit, rising cost of living and falling slow production - the eastern part of Glasgow needs a desperately prosperous producer like McVitie's."
A spokesperson for Pladis said: "The Tollcross manager received a letter from GMB only yesterday and the company will issue a declaration as soon as possible, as we appreciate the continuing commitment to the employees and representatives of the unions.
A regular meeting with the staff and representatives of the GMB in Tollcross took place two months ago and many of the problems were openly discussed at this meeting.
We were talking to employees that, as in all companies operating in extremely competitive and uncertain economic conditions, we assess our operations on a regular basis, which is true for all of our operations so that we can continue to compete successfully with others.
To this she added: "In recent years, we have invested £5 million in the Tollcross area, particularly in production lines and streamlining of operations.
We are very much appreciated by the heritage of Tollcross and the localities and, in the event of any changes in the operation of the factory, the employees and representatives of the trade unions will be informed without delay."
Did PSG warn Barcelona of moving Neymar three years ago?
La Liga may regret his interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain will not allow Neymar to her side in her bid for her side after she has deposited £189m, the amount needed to redeem Neymar from the contract, but did this French team warn Barcelona of their record-breaking raid three years ago?
This sensational transfer has stirred up the waters of the summer transfers. The Ligue 1 Club is ready to surpass more than twice the previous record amount for the transfer of Paul Pogba to Manchester United, which paid £800m for him last season.
After confirming and completing the transfer, Neymar will become the world's most expensive player and, at the same time, the world's highest-paid professional athlete - after tax, he will receive over £500,000 a week from the PSG team.
Barcelona is outraged in the way Neymar drew his contract, despite the fact that a confidential source has confirmed that the club has always tried to accommodate Neymar in everything since his arrival from Santos in 2013.
But was the football world alerted to this fact three years ago by the President of the PSG?
When Manchester City expressed their interest in Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi warned all the club interested in the re-trips of one of PSG's best players.
"I'm not worried, because as soon as someone tries to get one of our players, then we will certainly reach out to one of their players," Al-Khelaifi said.
"We respect all clubs.
But if they are trying to recruit one of our players, they will face the consequences."
Barcelona appears to have crossed the imaginary line when they expressed interest in PSG midfielder Marco Verratti in the summer.
PSG made it clear that under no circumstances would they allow the Italian representative to leave. It is therefore possible that Barcelona is now swallowing a bitter pill for its daring deal with the departure of Neymar.
Who will explain the sanctions?
Does political punishment of widely understood rules?
Donald Trump has given the nod to the anti-Russian sanctions.
The day before, the US imposed sanctions on Venezuelan President Maduro.
And a day earlier, Trump wrote that China was not doing anything about the North Korean threat and that this would not go on.
It, too, is the idea of sanctions like straw from shoes.
Those things can't be lumped together.
Maduro's Venezuela really set off on the path to dictatorship, even totalitarianism.
China is simply not behave as the US president would like.
Russia is a chapter in itself.
But if someone wanted to summarize all of this in such a way that even the ordinary voter, the American, the European, or the other, understood what the system of rules was based on, the policy of sanctions was based on, it would be an almost impossible task.
In the sanctions against Russia, President Trump merely draws in touch with what President Obama has already set, just stamping it.
So why such a fro-up?
Last year, Europe was terrified that if Trump won the US election, he would hug Putin and withdraw the sanctions.
Terrible image.
In practice, however, it is the opposite.
With Trump, sanctions are not loosened, but they tighten up.
But Europe is even more terrified.
German Minister Zypries says the Trump sanctions violate international law.
You mean, are kosher just sanctions approved by the UN Security Council?
But then there are no kosher or anti-Russian EU sanctions.
European Commission chief Juncker, for his part, complains that Trump's sanctions threaten the EU's energy security.
You mean that sanctions are to be used just weak enough to threaten no one?
The regular voter is fumbling.
For three years he had heard that the fate of the anti-Russian sanctions depended only on the implementation of the Minsk ceasefire agreements in Ukraine.
Now he learns that this is about the EU's energy security.
The voter groans and more broadly.
There are sanctions for Russia for being too assembled where it is not supposed to be.
China is being scolded for being assembled in little.
The Venezuelan president is being punished for building a dictatorship within his country's borders.
All those punishments or just considerations have their rationality.
But does anyone see it as a system, an order or a rule?
Andrej Babiš: I am not considering cooperating with Okamura.
Andrej Babiš has married, is cruising the republic with his visionary book and is finalizing the election program.
In addition to the Pardubice Region, it has already completed all the candidates.
According to his words, he did not interfere significantly with them.
He even agreed to have the Moravian-Silesian Governor and shadow education minister, YES Ivo Vondrák.
"But if he succeeds, he will have to choose whether he wants to be an MP or a governor," Babiš confirmed his earlier position.
You have been annoyed by a lot of incumbents and national politicians by their thesis that directly elected mayors and mayors should run municipalities and towns themselves, with only managers.
Are you serious?
It wasn't that.
I am a supporter of direct democracy, we elect the President directly, and I believe that we should also elect mayors and mayors.
In my book I don't mention the abolishing of the incumbents, they might as well be there.
The question is how many there will be.
When presenting your book What I dream about when I happen to be asleep, I heard with my own ears that you were talking about the abolition of the councils.
I don't remember.
I was talking about a direct election and a reduction in the number of incumbents.
New York, with a population of nine million, has five districts and 51 incumbents.
Prague with 1.2 million citizens has 1171 representatives.
And the mayor is blamed for not building enough and not preparing major projects, but she has no competence for it.
The same is true of a government run by only two people in our history, Klaus and Zeman.
Which is not to say they did it well.
But the current prime minister is not running a thing, he is just hosting the debate.
It can't work that way.
That's why you want to push through the majority system?
It would be ideal, but it's hard to get through.
In the program, we only have a change to a one-round Senate election.
We have also proposed a sliding mandate for ministers and an amendment to the House Rules to avoid unnecessary exhibitions by Members who are mainly to work in committees and committees, not to show off at the meetings of the House.
It is certainly not true that I want to destruct the parliamentary system.
But that's exactly what your opponents fear.
That as a dictator, you will run the government, control the House with 101 members, abolish the counties and the Senate, and, through grateful mayors, you will dominate the whole country.
It's definitely not that.
After all, there is nothing wrong with debating the number of Members.
French President Macron has announced a reduction in the legislature by a third, yet there are 57,000 French to one legislator, while in our country it comes to 17,000 Czechs.
But no one accuses Macron of endangering democracy.
Even if someone in the Czech Republic wins the election by the majority, we have mechanisms that would prevent him from making any dramatic changes.
But the consents are a big one for those who have a parliamentary majority, just look to Poland or Hungary.
There is no such threat in the case of the Yes movement.
We just need a team that works for the people in the government, not for our parties or resorts.
I do not understand, for example, why we have not been able to agree that only the salaries of teachers, staff in culture and social services will be increased.
Why did they overrule me and add 21 per cent to the GIBS members, who are already taking 60,000?
You'd take that as Prime Minister?
The prime minister is to intervene when ministers behave uneconomically, confuse the government with the travel agency, and with the state's money, they would like to do business as Marian Jurečka, who wanted to buy forests in Romania and land in Africa.
Ministers are not supposed to argue in the government, the contradictions are to be disproversed outside of it.
The finished material has to go to the cabinet, there is no place for coalition rifts, force voting and business, that's where it's to be decided.
How do you want to have a cohesive team when ministers are mainly party-friendly?
There is a constitutional law over the parties.
When it came to the crunch, Sobotka said the coalition agreement did not apply and set off Babiš from the government.
Any Prime Minister can do that.
But if he is a personality and has managerial abilities, he has no need for such idle gestures.
It measures everyone the same and requires a perfect performance from everyone.
Do you know who you'd suggest for the Chancellor of the Exchequer?
I don't think about it at all, we probably won't be in that government, no one wants to work with us, although I don't know what terrible I did.
So much skepticism is misplaced.
The mayors have won the entrepreneur Dědek, who would like to work with you, with the Peoples' wing of the inclined Jiří Čunk.
I don't think so.
The ČSSD is led by Lubomír Zaorálek, who does not rule out a coalition with ANO, Václav Klaus Jr., who will also not oppose it, will assert himself in the ODS.
I'd leave it to the voters.
Deputy Prime Minister and Vice-President of ANO Richard Brabec said you have many common points with the SPD's Tomio Okamura, for example in the area of economics.
So the Okamuras come to the eye as a coalition partner?
Mr. Brabec says he didn't say that.
Mr. Okamura has his political history, he ran as a puppet of Vít Bárta for VV, then he got money from the Dawn for his company, there was some coup.
He is, of course, a distinctive personality.
But a bit brownish.
If I take his program, he has a wide involvement of people in the management of society, direct democracy, that's a yes agreeable.
I'm not asking you that at all.
I wonder if a man who has xenophobic views is addressed to you at the gallows demonstrations and wants to leave the EU?
We are not considering working with Mr Okamura's party, I cannot imagine.
It is obvious that he went into politics to profit from it.
What about the tacit support of the communists to your minority government?
I can't even imagine it, but the voters will decide.
It will be about negotiating the winner with the second in the ranking, but God knows who will be the winner and who will be the two.
Of course, it is important that they are able to agree on a coalition government's agenda.
Let's go back to your efforts to run the state as a business.
But the government just has to follow, Prime Minister Sobotka let everything be avoided, never decided.
Coalition affairs such as CEB or EGAP did not work.
After all, Sobotka is his puppet, and I think that was also the reason he fired me.
As soon as he did so, CEZ dominated the Czech government.
After all, it is unbelievable that the Prime Minister brought a resolution written by the management of ČEZ, which requires the Minister of Finance how to vote at the general meeting of ČEZ.
If you become prime minister, change your staffing conditions on the supervisory board and replace the top management of CEZ?
Jesus, if I'm the Prime Minister, we'll see.
I'm not yet.
It is being said that ČEZ has already sent signals in your direction.
He would like to trade good cooperation with the ČSSD for an even better one with ANO.
So maybe after the election, everything will go on again.
I don't know anything about it.
I have no lobbyist Pokorny or Růžička, I am a separate unit and I do not deal with this at all.
Then answer directly.
If you head the government, will you seek to replace the management of ČEZ, Czech Television or the General Health Insurance Company, the institutions you criticise?
I would like CEZ to be a transparent company.
So far, he's done what he wanted for years, thanks to commissions for traditional political parties.
All you have to do is find out Mr Schwarzenberg's statements.
Although the state has a majority in CEZ, it has never been driven, it was only there in numbers, which is wrong.
For me, it's a trivial thing.
ČEZ is to take Dukovany, appreciate them, put them in a subsidiary, arrange financing, do a supply competition or get a co-investor and build a new nuclear block.
The concept that the state is to finance and build new nuclear blocks is absurd.
And Czech Television?
Some of her shows are conducting a permanent purpose campaign against me, but I don't have, and I won't have any competence to throw away anyone.
But control yes.
I don't want to control anyone.
I'm just saying that citizens pay fees of around 7.2 billion a year for public radio and television, but they don't really know how these institutions run.
How come they don't?
After all, the House approves a report on their management, which has a direct influence on the positions of CEO of ČT and ČRo.
Look at the news being discussed for the super power pact of Sobotka Kalousek, which has always worked.
This is true both of the current parliamentary commission for leaks from the investigation files, as well as in the lex Babiš.
And Sobotka was so stupid that he let Kalousek push him to get me out of the government, which passed a percentage of TOP 09, but the ČSSD took them off.
They are afraid of breaking up their corrupt system, so they are talking about threatening democracy by Babiš.
No one is immune.
What do you say to the articles describing how ANO First Vice-President Jaroslav Faltýnek is building a power hinterland by installing his son in the supervisory board of Tepláren Brno and arranging the related lawyer Květoslav Hlín's contracts with city and state firms such as the Prague Transport Company or Czech Railways?
We have a lasting dispute in that.
I don't like it, and I reproached him for a few times.
Falloon argues that the lawyer in question works at substantially lower rates and is reliable.
I wouldn't do that.
As Treasury Secretary I had no one.
We, unlike the socans, have never had a corruption scandal, no Pelta, Kratochvilova, Brezina.
If there was any sign of patronage, we immediately fired such a person.
In this respect, I am uncompromising.
If something like this happens, get rid of anyone, it doesn't matter who it is.
