Petr Cech: Transfer at the last minute?
Possible is everything
Today is the last day to jump through the transfer window and make a big transfer.
The next chance will come in the winter.
Petr Cech, currently substitute goalkeeper for Chelsea, is not sitting on a new professional contract in Madrid, Monaco or Paris.
He sits in the Smichov NH Hotel, talks with Czech journalists and is going with the Czech national team for a gaming dress rehearsal with the Americans and subsequently also for the sharp start of the Euro 2016 qualification against the Netherlands.
In goal for Chelsea, Thibaut Courtois is given priority in the new Premier League season, the Czech has been replaced for the first time in a decade at the London club.
Earlier in the day, it was speculated that Real Madrid might be interested in the Czech.
He lost the Spanish Super Cup in the season opener with Atlético and failed to make the start of the league season, losing 2-4 in San Sebastián.
There was also speculation about the interest of Paris SG.
He was relegated to the French league season with two wins and two draws, scoring the St. Etienne 5-0.
Relatively the most pushing the shoe is club AS Monaco.
He has a 1-1-2 record in the league so far and broke up with Lille at a league at a league 1-1 at the weekend.
Reports jumped to the tabloid English websites today that the Czech might want a Czech in Queens Park Rangers.
According to English bookmakers, however, the Czech's last-minute exit from Chelsea is not very likely.
Skybet set him a 4-1 odds.
Peter, is it possible that you will still change the jersey within the next few hours?
I'm not counting on it, but there's never a 100% record in football.
Perhaps during the day there will be an offer that will not be refused.
What would such an offer look like?
(laughs) "Well, I don't know yet what an offer that can't be rejected actually looks like.
There would have to be a consensus from all parties First of all, it would depend on Chelsea's stance on whether or not the club would deal with any offer.
Is it even technically feasible to make such a transfer now that you are in Prague?
Wouldn't it be necessary for you to sign a possible new contract somewhere in the new site?
I didn't think about it.
But in such a situation there are a lot of players today, they are all at the representative meetings and I'm sure a lot of transfers will close today.
So somehow it would be feasible.
How many clubs on the planet that could afford you?
Well, I really don't know.
And you're not pushing for a move?
The situation where I did not play in the first three matches of the new season is new for me after 15 years of my career.
However, there is no reason to panic, to pack and to go somewhere.
I want to continue to participate in the Chelsea goalkeeper's duel and it is up to the coach who he chooses, what decisions he makes over the coming weeks.
What role does the family play in your decision?
I take all the factors into account.
The important thing for me is, of course, the sporting aspect, but I also look at it from the personal side to which the family's needs of course they belong.
Is it possible that you would also be catching for another club in England?
That's a question I thought would never be about.
But in football, anything is possible.
I don't want to rule anything out.
I don't know the answer.
Prime Ministers of India and Japan at a meeting in Tokyo
India's new Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, is in Tokyo to meet his Japanese counterpart Shinzo Abe. On his first major visit since winning the election in May, he is to discuss economic and security commitments.
Modi is on a five-day trip to Japan to consolidate economic ties with the world's third-largest economy.
On the list are first and foremost plans for broader nuclear cooperation.
According to the rapporteurs of India, he also hopes that the two nations agree on cooperation on defence issues.
Police in Karrata arrested a 20-year-old teenager after a motorcycle chase
The bike was stopped after a zone with a maximum speed limit of 70 km/h, it hurtled 125 km/h and drove into the bush to escape the officers.
In Karrata, the traffic police were in Karrato who tried to stop a blue motorbike at the side of the road when they noticed that there were 125 km/h at the exit of the service station on Bathgate Road.
According to police, the driver did not stop and proceeded after Burgess Road and then turned into the bush, so the officers lost sight of him.
The bike and the person matching the driver's description were then spotted at the house in Walcott Way in Bulgara.
Karrath police have charged the 20-year-old with disobeying a call to stop and careless proceedings.
He will stand trial in Karrata on 23 September.
The motorcycle was confiscated for three months.
George Webster charged with rape at hotels in Nairn and Pitlochry
The man will be brought to justice on charges of raping women in two hotels.
George Webster, 28, was briefed on the charge during a hearing at the Glasgow Supreme Court.
He reportedly had 7. June 2013 at Scotland's Hotel in Pitlochry, Perthshire, to rape a woman.
According to the claim, Webster attacked her while she "were not conscious, sleeping and not in a state to give her consent."
In addition, Webster is being prosecuted for the rape of another woman at the Golf View Hotel in the Nairn of the Scottish Highlands on 4 May 2014.
Judge Lady Rae set the trial date for November 17 at the Supreme Court in Edinburgh.
Restoring the very American ideal that labour rights are also human rights
Congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis have proposed a bill to protect the organisation of trade unions as a civil right.
"The way the unions work, the jobs work for the middle class," says Ellison, the Democratic Senator for Minnesota, who is the co-chair of the Congressional Committee.
That is why I am so proud that I can, together with the model of occasional rights, John Lewis, introduce the law empowering the staff.
This groundbreaking legislation will give workers the same legal options to defend themselves against discrimination in organising trade unions, as in other forms of discrimination - and stop the anti-Union forces
To amend the law on labour relations to allow all employees who face discrimination if they want to join the trade unions to sue in a civil court - and sue for compensation or damages - is the right and necessary initiative.
But it is certainly not a radical initiative - at least not according to American standards.
The best way to understand what Ellison, Lewis, and other proponents are putting forward in the law is to re-establish the American ideal.
Despite the trade union struggles that have taken place in recent years - in Wisconsin, Michigan, and other nations - Americans once supported countries around the world to adopt, expand, and respect labour rights.
There were times, and millions of Americans still remembering them, when the country, in the same breath, championed democracy, freedom of the press, and the right to assembly.
When the United States seized Japan after World War II, General Douglas MacArthur and its advisers supported the country to adopt a constitution designed to ensure that the military autocracy of Hideki Toja was replaced by democracy.
They were convinced that the staff and their unions played a role in the shape of the new Japan, encompassing the language and openly acknowledging that "the right of employees to gather, collectively negotiate and act is guaranteed."
When the United States seized Germany after World War II, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his advisers encouraged the Germans to create a constitution to ensure that Adolf Hitler's fascism would be replaced by a strong democracy.
The Germans were aware that the staff would need to be organized and promoted in the new nation, and therefore included a clause that openly said: "The right to create associations that will safeguard and improve working and economic conditions will be guaranteed to each individual and to each profession or profession.
Arranges that restrict this right or seek to damage it will be revoked. Measures leading to such a purpose are illegal.
When former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt chaired the International Human Rights Commission, which proposed the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which was adopted by the United Nations as a global treaty in 1948, the proponents and Roosevelt included a guarantee that "everyone has the right to form and enter into trade unions to protect their interests."
For generations, Americans have accepted the basic premise that labour rights are human rights.
When a country advised other countries on how to create a civic and democratic society, Americans explained that the right to create labour unions - and their participation in collective bargaining with companies and government agencies as an equal partner - must be protected.
Now that these rights are being challenged in America, it is definitely necessary to return to the American ideal that working people must have the right to organize and promote themselves in a free and open society.
As the Reverend's Reverend Martin Luther King Jr said fifty years ago.
History is a great teacher.
Today, everyone knows that the unions have not diminished the strength of the nation, but have expanded it.
They raised the standard of living for millions of people, created the market for industry, and raised production to an unsuspected level.
Those who attack the unions forget these simple truths, but history remembers them.
History does not forget, and we would not.
Formal recognition of labour rights as human - and the extension of the protection of civil rights to prevent discrimination in organising trade unions - is overdue.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis are rebuilding the ideals that have raised America and made it a real promise of democracy.
The judge temporarily blocked a law that could have shut down all abortion clinics in Louisiana
A federal judge on Sunday temporarily blocked the Louisiana law, which the attorneys say would likely close all five clinics performing abortions in the state.
The regulation enacted by the signature of the Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal in June, to come into force on 1 September, would require abortion doctors to have the right to accept a patient in a hospital within 30 miles of their practice.
The judge's order means that doctors can temporarily continue to carry out legal abortions and must obtain the authorisation in the meantime.
"The nominating party will be able to carry out its activities lawfully and in the meantime obtains a permit," reads the order of federal Judge John deGravels.
The hearing will be scheduled in one month for the judge to issue a more permanent resolution on the law.
Activists for the rights to abortion of the resolution, which is the latest in a series of similar measures, welcomed and said it would give doctors more time to obtain a permit.
"Today's decision makes women in Louisiana safe from the tricky law to deprive them of their health and their rights," said Nancy Northup, the president and executive director of the Center for Reproductive Rights, who sought the law from the lawsuit with the lawsuit.
It was not immediately clear whether the decision also involved the doctors from the two clinics that were not among the plaintiffs, and they were also asking for this authorisation to be granted.
Louisiana is among the eleven states that passed similar laws, with the Alabama and Mississippi courts declaring such measures to be unconstitutional.
Key parts of the Texas law that would close most of the remaining clinics in the state were blocked by federal judges on Friday.
Fighters for women's rights to have abortions, together with the Association of American Perciates and Gynecologists and Gynecologists and the American Medical Association, argue that the need to have this permit puts doctors with demands that are not necessary medically.
Opponents of abortion countered that the measures were aimed at protecting women's health, and some also welcomed the fact that clinics would be closed for the measures.
The Center for Reproductive Rights said that only one doctor performing abortion was authorised in Louisiana.
If all doctors in the state were forced to stop performing abortions, this doctor would also, fearing for his safety, stop performing the procedure, the group said.
In response, the Louisiana authorities said they would not punish the doctors who perform the abortion while awaiting the processing of the application for rights.
Due to late diagnosis and poor availability of treatment, ovarian cancer kills in the countryside more often
Angelina Jolie and her brother James released a video of the tribute to their late mother, who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
Women in the Australian countryside are at greater risk of dying of ovarian cancer than in their counterparts in the city.
Researchers analyzed the medical records of more than 1100 Australians diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2005 and found that only 35% lived for a year or so on the diagnosis.
Research director Susan Jordan of the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute said that women in rural and remote areas of the state were about 20 percent more likely to die during the study than in women in urban areas.
MALÁ STUDY: New drugs may slow down lung and ovarian cancer
Researchers followed the women during seven years of treatment.
Dr. Jordan said the chances of survival were influenced by the age of women at the time of diagnosis, the type of ovarian cancer, other existing diseases, and socio-economic status.
The lowest survival rates occurred in older women who were diagnosed with cancer at a more advanced stage.
Women in rural and remote areas of the state were about 20 percent more likely to die during the study than in women in urban areas.
Although the study was not designed to determine why women living outside the city were more likely to die from ovarian cancer, Dr. Jordan argues that the factors may be late diagnosis and poor availability of treatment.
"The disease is best treated by gynaeconologists who are usually based in larger cities," she said.
Despite improvements in remote medical services to cross the distance barrier, the doctor has proposed to help boost the transport service to be able to treat women closer to their homes for specialists and programs to support people who are being treated far from their families and friends.
Dr. Jordan said the study revealed that the long-term survival of ovarian cancers for women is low regardless of the geographical location, highlighting the need for better treatment and preventive programs.
Research funded by the Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer cancer will be released today by the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2012, at the age of 33, young mother Elisha Neave of the Gold Coast was diagnosed with an aggressive form of ovarian cancer.
Garden centres regret reducing the number of homeowners
According to a HTA study published by the Financial Times, the drop associated with the extraordinary decline of homeowners under the age of 35 could lead to the fact that when today's young generation of consumers reaches the "lead age group of gardeners," garden centres will lose up to £10 million a year.
According to the report, people who rent housing spend on average 55% of the amount spent on their own landlords on their own.
As other factors threatening the sector, which makes an estimated £5 billion a year, the increase in the number of people living in very urbanised areas where there are no gardens, the popularity of paving instead of the front gardens is popular with the front gardens, and the shrinking size of the gardens.
In the area of Greater London, where the share of homegrown-owned houses has fallen from 61% to 43% in six years, one household has the lowest expenditure on gardening products in Britain.
HTA and the Royal Horticultural Society have argued that lodging in lodgings or the lack of space does not mean that people cannot grow plants.
Guy Barter, the chief horticultural adviser to the RHS, said: "For tenants, growing potted plants is very popular - when they move, they can take the plants with them."
The HTA report revealed that the "golden age" of the horticultural retail sector was between 1997 and 2005 and was the result of a higher share of homeowners and economic prosperity lasting from the 1980s to the mid-1990s.
He also forecasts a higher sales this year thanks to better weather, which came after adverse conditions in March and April.
When the Eastern dictator preaches about democracy.
After Putin's reunion at the reunion of his youth organization, which reminds me most of all of the Hitler Youth, he rattled out with atomic weapons and basically made it clear to everyone that he didn't care about their views, he gave us a lecture on democracy today.
But I have a feeling that the current regime in Russia exhibits many features of the fascist state.
The great nations have one thing in common, and that is that both tense nationalism can be dominated by them, and that the inferiority complex can transform them into imperialist appetites.
Time passes differently in the east, apparently, than in the west.
While the Western world thought the time of the wars of domineering Europe was long gone, in the east, on the contrary, they think they had been overlooked for a long time and had to be reclaimed for a long time.
Such mood and frustration reigned in Germany in the 1930s, just before the Nazis seized power, followed by an explosion of nationalism unlike today's situation in Russia.
And then the very identical cult of a strong leader, the beating of journalists, the elimination of inconvenient political opponents, the discrimination of minorities and homosexuals, is therefore quite similar.
Vladimir Putin, and certainly a large proportion of Russians, may miss the time when Russia ruled halfway around the world and the other part was shaking in front of them.
I guess Western politicians brought this on themselves, maybe little patting Vladimir on the shoulders, maybe not invited him where he wanted to go and maybe they started to underestimate him, and he just acted like a typical Russian man.
He had put his house in order, pretending that he didn't really want to go anywhere, sharpening his knives at home.
Now he decided to take back the lost position.
He starts slowly, has time.
He's the leader for life, I guess, so what's he'd be in the hurry.
He's trodden the Caucasus, now he's trampling the Ukrainians, then the Baltic's Dwarves are next.
They've been stinging the Russian bear in their fur long enough.
I'm sure it's going to be noticed by China, which is jumping up too much and is certainly making a crush on the far east.
And the Germans are also pretty pissed off by the Germans, how well they're doing, and we gave them a spank at 45.
How about making one new Novorosia in Karlovy Vary?
That would be the base, and our own are there, and as they're being pressured by the dachu, they'd already wanted to demolish some of them.
After all, our veterans still remember how they had in that Czechoslovakia.
Nu vot, their Prime Minister Gospodin Sobotka, who is so soft, can be peeled like an onion and I eat all of their EU.
That would play so much to jump out at the great Russia.
They need to be reminded of where their place is.
And as detonators, we will use our compatriots who live in their territory.
There are enough Russians everywhere, and when they say they're being oppressed, they just oppress them and we don't let that happen, we protect them.
And again the Russian will rule, what else is born to be.
After all, Europe is only as good as a preposition that the proud Ivan can dance to a Cossack.
Turkey summons US diplomat over spy report
Turkey's foreign minister called in the country's highest-ranking US diplomat to explain the report on American and British espionage activity in Turkey.
The Deputy Prime Minister Bulent said the US charge d'affaires and Turkish civil servants had discussed the report on Monday.
The German magazine Der Spiegel and the online magazine The Intercept reported that according to documents provided by the former analyst of the US National Security Agency, Turkey was a priority target for US and British intelligence services.
According to Turkish media, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan downplayed the importance of the report, saying that all major states were watching each other.
The earlier report, according to which Ankara was also targeted by the German intelligence service, sparked a more indignant reaction from the Turkish government.
Game of Thrones presented more tricks of the fourth season
The creators of Game of Thrones are currently filming episodes of the fifth order of the cult series.
At the same time, they boasted about how the fourth series tricks were created.
The most visible are the computer editing of the series environment and the mass scene, when a bunch of soldiers become the giant army of the famous Daenerys.
Magaluf Police Director charged with corruption
On Friday, the complainants presented the Mallor State Attorney's Office with evidence of extortion by police officers and state city hall officials in the Calvia self-government region.
The director of the Calvia police on the holiday island of Mallorca was arrested after being charged by businessmen and bar owners at the infamous party district of Magaluf.
Chief Inspector José Antonio Navarro was taken into pre-trial detention after allegations of corruption against him by several businessmen from Punta Ballena, a street in which most of the bars and nightspots in Magaluf are located.
According to the Mallorca Diario online newspaper, on Friday, the complainants presented evidence of blackmail by police and state council officials in the Calvia municipal council to the Mallor's Anti-Corruption Bureau to the Prosecutor's Office to Prosecutions of Corruption.
Two other local police officers have been arrested by Spanish State Police for links to corruption charges and will be interviewed by a judge and he and Navarre will be interviewed by a judge.
Spain's national daily ABC quoted disgruntled owners of night-time businesses as saying that favouring public officials had serious repercussions for their business.
"It's not about making money anymore, it's about making money," one of the businessmen said in court.
Don't play with our livelihood.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf made the top pages of magazines worldwide after a video of an 18-year-old British tourist who gave oral sex to 24 men during a barn tour, appeared on YouTube.
Island authorities have since tried to oversee drunks and rioters in the ranks of participants in holiday parties in Magafulo by reducing the number of not-so-known alcohol tours in bars.
In addition, the Playhouse club, where the event was given to the granting of oral sex, was forced to close for a year and, together with the organisers of the Carnage-goal tour, pay a fine of €55,000 ($73,000).
The tourist resort Magaluf, which is particularly popular with the British, has also witnessed many alcohol-felling accidents, including the fashion wave known as "balting" in which people jump from one balcony to the other or from the balcony to the hotel swimming pool.
First day of spring marked by rain and thunderstorms that had an impact on the flight at the airport in Adelaide
JARO gave the south of South Australia an icy surprise, coming in with heavy rain and a fierce wind that seriously hit the Adelaide airport.
Another 5 mm of precipitation is expected to fall in the city until 9 p.m. and another 6.6 mm will fall during the night on Sunday.
The last rain was introduced together with a few short showers associated with storm and wind gusts, which began before 8 p.m. and brought almost 4 mm of precipitation in about ten minutes.
After several early doses of spring arrived after the winter last week, temperatures in the city dropped to just 15.8°C again on Monday.
The storm weather is thought to have contributed to the delayed arrival of Virgin Airlines from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The plane was supposed to land moments after 19:30, but was hit by a change in the speed or direction of the wind over short distances and was forced to postpone the landing.
Wind gusts at the Adelaide airport at that time were about 50 km/h on the ground.
Flight data showed that the plane had to drop the second landing and finally touched down at about 8:40 p.m.
The delay of the plane subsequently caused delays for further flights, including an Emirates flight from Dubai and a Qantas flight from Sydney.
The Adelaide temperatures are expected to reach a maximum of 16°C on Tuesday and one or two showers may occur.
Israeli children return to school after the war in Gaza
Thousands of Israeli children from areas near the Gaza Strip returned to school on Monday after spending the summer in anti-combard shelters, while rockets and mortars attacked their homes during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas. However, schools in Gaza remain closed while the territory is recovering from the fighting.
The start of the school brought a sense of joy and excitement to the communities in the south of Israel marked by attacks, but signs of fighting are still noticeable.
In Asdod, a city in the south of the country, the kindergarten staff hit by a missile has removed the remnants of shrapnel from the wall, and are slowly awaiting the children's return.
"We're a little scared, but otherwise we're looking forward to it," said Ronit Bart, a rabbit resident of Saad and an English teacher at the local school.
A lot of kids in this area really need to get back to their daily routine.
Her 11-year-old daughter, Shani Bart, revealed that "it's a little strange" to go to school all of a sudden.
"We've had some tough times and never left the house," she said.
Kibbutz, located close to the Gaza border, was visited by President Reuven Rivlin to offer his support to the residents.
Until the cease-fire ended last week, thousands of residents of border settlements like Saad remained inside their homes or left their homes and went to safer areas farther from Gaza to escape missiles and mortars.
Many residents of Nachal Oz, a village close to the Gaza border in which a Palestinian mortar missile killed a four-year-old boy, is hesitant to return.
The Education Minister said that about twelve families have still not returned.
Their children were temporarily placed in surrogate schools.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited the school in Sderot, a city on the Gaza border, which was heavily hit by Palestinian fire.
He urged the children to study diligently, adding, "We will provide you with education and safety."
Israel and Hamas agreed to an unlimited time last Tuesday.
While the ceasefire led to an immediate end to the fighting, it did not solve key challenges as a demand by Hamas to end the Israeli-Egyptian blockade of Gaza and the reopening of Gaza's airports and ports.
Israel is demanding the disarmament of Hamas and the return of the bodies of the two soldiers killed in the war.
A new round of indirect negotiations is expected to begin later this month in Egypt.
According to estimates by Palestinians and the UN, more than 2,100 Palestinians died in the war, three-quarters of whom were civilians and at least 494 children.
Israel disputes these figures, estimating that at least half of those killed were militants, even though it does not have clear evidence for these claims.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians, including a Thai worker, died.
Hamas and other Gaza militants fired 4,591 rockets and mortar missiles and mortar missiles during the fighting at Israeli cities, mainly in the country's south.
The Israeli military, for its part, has carried out more than 5,000 air raids and other attacks.
The Israeli attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in Gaza, and an estimated 250,000 people hid in a hundred UN schools that turned into makeshift shelters.
Because of the tens of thousands of people still in hiding, and because of the ongoing fighting, school officials postponed the start of the school year last week.
"I hope they will open the school soon so that we can complete our education as well as the Jewish children and other children in the world," said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old boy from the school's largest city in Gaza.
Willow at the reunion: I stand behind Vácha.
And Lafatu is suffering from the temperature
The Czech national football team met before noon in Prague today before Wednesday's preliminary match with the USA and the subsequent opening match of the European Championship qualifier against the Netherlands.
Of the 23-man cadre, Spartan striker David Lafata, who is suffering from the temperature, is in trouble.
David isn't here yet, but Sparta had some problems last week, there were more players involved and David probably still has the problems a little bit.
But we want him to be here and be in order as soon as possible," coach Pavel Vrba told reporters.
"Whether it's two or three days, or he'll be fit tomorrow, that's to be seen by his health, which will be decided by our doctor," he added.
The other players are fine.
"Of course someone has some kind of ache, but it's not like they can't train or take part in the match on Wednesday with the USA," the Czech coach said.
On Sunday night, Vrba called up Spartan midfielder Lukáš Vácha as the last player.
He admitted that it had not been an easy decision to make, and other midfielders had come to mind.
I decided on the basis that Lukas is a promising player who is 25 years old.
It was very difficult to make the decision, but I stand by it," Willow said to Vách.
What about Shural?
We'll see what happens to Latata
It is not impossible that in the event of health problems, the nomination could still change.
At the weekend, a great performance was flashed by, for example, Liberec's Josef Šural, who scored a hat-trick.
Of course, there are players who have been showing form lately.
Let's see how David Lafata is.
In the event that he can't be available on Wednesday, I'm not saying I can't donate to one of the players who impressed in the Czech league," Vrba said.
This afternoon the national team will have training at Strahov, then on Tuesday a classic pre-season training session before the duel with the USA at Letná, which will be open to fans and will be followed by an autograph session.
The match with the Americans is played on Wednesday from 20:15 and the national team will aim for a first-ever victory under Willow.
He had played in two draws in the previous three preseason games and lost once.
The qualifying match with the Netherlands is then on 9 September from 8:45 p.m.
Peshice goes to the Dutch to Italy
Vrba is happy to have more time to train, unlike in previous meetings.
It's an advantage when you have a player for eight days and you can rehearse with them certain things that maybe we didn't have that much time for before.
Now we will only be able to concentrate on getting the best prepared for the Netherlands," Vrba said.
The Dutch will present themselves in Italy on Thursday before the match in Prague and the duel will be watched in person by former interim representative coach Josef Pešice.
He'll give us the information that's from the game.
But it won't just be about him, we'll have the game and we'll have a shot and we'll discuss it.
A new coach is coming to the Netherlands, we will see what the changes will be there," Vrba said of the bronze medalists at the recent world championships.
According to high-profile statistics, prices of flats rose the most in the winter in the last seven years.
According to the apartment value index in the Australian capital RP, CoreLogic Hedonic, housing prices rose by 1.1% in August, the agency said on Monday.
The increase led to an overall increase for June, July and August to 4.2%, the highest increase in the winter months since 2007.
The annual price increase climbed to 10.9%, more than double in one year to August 2013, but the profit was not evenly spread out in the country.
RPD research director Tim Lawless said that the market is led by Sydney and Melbourne.
Figures from the RP The data show that Sydney's apartment prices rose by 16.1% last year, while prices in Melbourne rose by 11.7%.
Other strongest markets included Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin, with price increases averaging between five and six.
On the other side of the scale, Canberra was damaged by a state-mandated expenditure cut, where prices rose by only 1.4% during the year.
Lawless said that now that spring has started, the number of properties for sale will increase in the coming months, which will be a "real test" for the market.
"Given the persistent high level of auction sales, generally high sales speeds and low interest rates, the value of housing is likely to increase in the next three months," he said.
Lenny Henry: My father never huged me.
He never said to me, "I love you"
Henry was born in 1958 as one of Jamaican's seven children of Jamaican immigrant in the Midlands.
He and his father, who died when he was 19 and who worked in the factory, had a colder relationship.
Henry is rehearsing for the comedy, Rudy's Rare Records, which is partly based on an imaginary interview with his father, and which is part of the Radio 4 series.
The soundtrack is a mixture of reggae and rap and the melody is optimistic.
But Henry had to deal with some unpleasant childhood memories.
After his mother's death, Henry went through a "pretty" therapy and now he's thinking about his relationship with his father.
He knew precious little about him.
You've never seen his face before, you just heard his voice: "Stop the noise.
Leave your sister alone.
Move!
I want to watch cricket.
My older Brothers Seymour and Hilton - when I was a child, they were grown-up - they went to the bar with him, discussing things like the shape of a beer glass or the beauty of a cricket blow.
I never spoke to him like that.
Most of my life, he's been a serious guy in a corner reading the papers.
Recently, Henry had visited the Dudley foundry, and although the conditions were better than in his father's time, he looked into the way life must have been for him.
There's a bit more light in there today, but it's still a dark, smoky, gloomy labyrinth where the flames explode and there's a lot of smoke and soot.
Dad always got in the tub and just lay there, then you could hear him singing for himself slowly, because he was washing the foundry.
As I walked by, I realized he'd been doing this for years to support his family, and I'd come to appreciate him more.
Even so, Henry spent his childhood without parental love.
Dad didn't embrace anyone, he said "I like you."
It wasn't until my mom was sick and dying that we started to think "I love you, I love you, I love you."
His daughter, Billie, whom he has with Dawn French, allowed him to experience the love he lacked as a child.
Can you stop with the "I love you"?
Don't hug me all the time!
Dad, I'm 22!
Dawn French.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mom
French, who was married to for 25 years, are still good friends.
Dawn's good.
Why shouldn't Dawn and I be friends?
She's a great mom.
Henry's own mother had diabetes.
It was one of the things that killed her.
So when I was very, very overweight and the symptoms of diabetes were getting serious, the doctor said to me, "You have to make a radical change."
So I started going to a big fitness center, and I also had to go on a drastic diet to get rid of the symptoms.
It's very hard.
And tiring.
Nobody wants to eat all the carrots.
The change in the direction of defending Henry's career may be reflected in his elegant, short-cuts beard.
After receiving acclaim from the criticism of his Othello, he immersed himself in the theatre.
Comedy was followed, full of blunders and the Fences of August Wilson.
It's a different experience than the sitcoms and comedies that filled out his hectic working life.
He started when he was 16 and worked in a factory.
DJ spotted him on stage parodying someone and wrote about him in the New Faces talent contest.
His television career began in the mid-70s: "For a long time, I was the only black impersonator/commerce on television."
He learned as he went.
In addition to the fact that the public had to notice me, I also had to learn how to make up working jokes between 1975, and be a star and appear on TV, and that was really hard.
Lenny in the New Faces in 1975
Since his manager owned the rights to the stage production of The Black and White Minstrel Show, an entertainment program in which the actors dressed up as blacks, Henry eventually performed with his comedy for five years.
My family was already uncomfortable about this.
I kind of wish it would never happen, but I don't regret it.
Although it was a strange and embarrassing position, I worked on the big stages and learned how to work with the crowd.
What was "the years awards to the main product of British television" but was also a "grotesque parochial parody of blacks."
In the 1980s, Henry worked in alternative comedy circles and introduced characters who also ridiculed and celebrated British black culture.
The Lenny Henry Show's first series began airing in 1984, and in the 1990s, he was known as the chef Gareth Blacklock in the comedy series Chef!.
The next decades were taken up by ads, documentaries, TV series and roles in the movies, but after his series LennyHenry.tv aired on the BBC in 2008, he said to himself, "So what are you going to do now, Lene, it looks a little like you're stuck in one place, or you're a little out of the way."
Next up was a documentary show on Radio 4 called What's So Great About...?/What's so great about...?
The first was Shakespeare.
I was really allergic to Shakespeare.
We didn't really learn him at school, and I thought it was something for the white middle class.
So I was so scared of it.
Everyone we interviewed on the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench, said, "You should try it."
Don't get involved when you don't know what you're talking about.
Try a few words and see why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry had made twenty lines of the documentary from Othello's closing statement, and he was in for it.
It made me feel like I could do it.
It's like it gives me the courage.
"That's what it's about. It's a serious matter, take it seriously, learn the lyrics, find out about it.
So the rehearsal was hard, and I'd read the play for months and months before.
And it was a success.
It looked like they were in trouble, which they didn't.
He soon began playing in a Comedy of Errors.
Suddenly I was at the National Theatre. I couldn't believe it.
At one point, I thought, "You've changed."
There was a technical malfunction, and Henry instinctively felt he had to take responsibility for the confiscation of the audience.
"The hull in his head said to me, 'Before he fixes the computer, you must entertain them for ten minutes now.'"
Instead, the theater director announced that the show would continue as soon as the problem was resolved.
I left the stage, and something in me said, "Hm, thank God."
It's not my responsibility.
It could be solved for me by someone else.
"You're playing, so stay in the role."
Henry in Plotts at Duchess Theatre
Learning the fullback text was a challenge.
Panic is pretty good, he adds determination.
The game was also well received, so it's like a sign of God that says, "This is what you should do."
Of course, he says it in a UWN TOWN voice.
So I'm staying with it.
I really like it.
I'm happy to be rehearsal.
Nevertheless, Henry's mind remains the comedian's brain - he interrupts our conversation all the time with humorous performances as he enters and steps up from the role of an imitator.
I decided not to make stand-ups because having the satisfaction of a room full of strangers is a little dangerous, I'd say.
If you're still looking for something, you can get to a dead end.
Sometimes when I want to, I do Live at the Apollo, but I'm not happy about it as I used to be.
I asked if he'd ever organize a stand-up tour again.
The joy of sitting in the same room with the director, who helps to give the outlines of the beginning, the middle and the end of the road - I don't think I ever want to give it up.
So, your new incarnation?
I think so.
I enjoy acting.
It's fun.
You keep telling stories, which is great.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Kenya registers civil servants to shine a light on nonexistent employees
Kenya began a biometric registration of all of her civil servants to try to remove non-existent employees from the government's payroll.
According to the government statement, the employees who are not registering in the next two weeks will stop receiving a payout.
The government believes that thousands of people receive a salary after they left the civil service.
After he took office in 2013, President Uhuru Kenyatt promised to prevent corruption in the state administration.
An audit carried out this year showed that the state loses at the heart of $1 million (£700,000) a month to pay non-existent employees and further abuse of official authority.
The government suspects that salaries continue to be placed on bank accounts even after the death of the employee or after the employee leaves the civil service, said the BBC's Nairobi, Wanyama Chebusiri, a BBC reporter from the capital.
All civil servants must report to the identification centres within the next two weeks, where their data will be biometrically recorded, the government statement said.
He goes on to say that anyone who does not appear without a sufficient apology will be removed from the payroll.
"By storing the real public service staff, this measure will make a significant contribution to its development and will also be used to purify the payroll at both levels of the government, thus resolving the problem of non-existent employees," said Anne Waiguru, secretary of the Ministry of Development and Planning.
Dozens of Turkish police arrested for "conspiracy" against government
Local media reports that a total of 33 police officers were detained in Turkey on suspicion of a "conspiracy against the government."
The police department has not yet commented on the case.
According to the Hurriyet Dail News, there were fourteen high-ranking officials among the detainees.
Some of them were implicated in a corruption investigation in December, which targeted government officials, including four ministers.
In July, several Turkish police officers were arrested for allegedly organizing a criminal gang and telephone tapping.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (at the time the Prime Minister) called their actions part of the actions of Islamic cleric Fethullah Gülen against him and other people in power.
Not all children returned to school in Ukraine
Most schools in Ukraine reopened on Monday (September 1) after the summer holidays.
This day is traditionally important for the families and, like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk took his daughter to school.
On this occasion, he told reporters present that not all schools had reopened, but that they were determined to defend the country for the next generation:
Not at all schools were held in the traditional ceremony for September 1st.
Not all of Ukraine is the peace.
We must fight for peace.
The whole of Ukraine, the combined Ukrainian front, must fight for peace.
Alexan Pastukhov, a teacher at a school in Slavyansk attended by Yatsenyuk's daughter, spoke in Russian.
We hope that peace will finally be achieved here and that children will gain the knowledge that will be useful to them in the future.
The first day of school is traditionally celebrated by the children wearing embroidered shirts, bring balloons and give the teachers flowers.
In Ron Fairhead, the BBC may have found the boss of hard times
It carries with it a cloud of fame from the world of banking, media management, and an internal conclave of the conservative party.
She has experience in the front lines.
She began her career at consultants Bain and Co, then continued through Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and the media world of Pearsons.
For seven years, she was the Financial Times CEO. She resigned when her junior colleague took over the top job at the parent company Pearson's.
They say her severance package was close to £Million.
Its political portfolio is also extensive.
David Cameron was recommended to Lord Browne, the former director of BP, when Cameron in Whitehall needed private expertise: she became an adviser to the Cabinet Office.
Her husband is a former city council member.
In May, I described the work of the director as a chalice of poison.
Not only is the BBC a vast and complex entity at the centre of public life, but there is also an internal paradox in its structure.
The corporations turn in two directions: in the top of the hierarchy of the BBC's own leadership hierarchy, but also out at the voice of the public in times of restlessness when things don't work.
This is an almost unsustainable monopoly that calls for thorough reform.
But what director would risk coming into a company as complex as the Chinese dynasty, dismantling it, and thereby taking his own jobs.
It's a tough challenge.
If it wasn't so hard, a lot of people would like to see the BBC getting smaller - its power, its finances - and how its status is being revised.
As the competition arena expands and the new technology challenges old certainties, the immediate negotiation of concession fees for the BBC carries a great danger.
For a modest amount of £14,50 a year, the British public buys a stake in what is certainly the world's largest media business.
The BBC tells a good story: it claims that its production is at 96% of households, each costing only 40pc a day.
Moreover, the BBC's popularity is clearly rising: to 53% of supporters, up from 31% a decade ago.
BBC services use models have changed: Today, newspaper subtitles are shown on my mobile phone, and I can watch iPlayer on the shows I've missed.
But the BBC remains a very beloved and wonderful institution.
She needs an amazing director - I hope she found one.
Texas Governor Perry says he didn't approve the insulting tweet
A tweet from the official Twitter account of Texas Governor Rick Perry, which was released on Sunday, included an offensive picture of the Democratic Attorney General who initiated Perry's criminal charges for abuse of power.
The tweet was later deleted and another was posted on Perry's account, which distanced itself from the previous one.
A tweet that was not authorized by the post from my account.
"I disagree with the tweet and I downloaded it," he said in another post.
Perry's assistants did not respond to the reports asking questions immediately.
Although the tweets were sent from Perry's official account, it is unclear who is actually responsible for his administration.
The previous tweet was posted by an unflattering, humorous picture of Travis County State's Attorney General Rosemary Lehmberg, who was convicted of drunk driving in April 2013.
When she refused to resign, Perry refused to disburse funds for her office, which brought up Perry, a possible presidential nominee in the 2016 election, before a major jury in Austin this month.
The caption in the tweet read read: "I don't always drive with three times the blood alcohol level as the permitted limit . . . but if there is, I'll sue Governor Perry for holding me accountable."
I'm the drunkest Democrat in Texas.
The investigation against Perry was not conducted by Lehmberg's office.
He was in charge of Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor from San Antonio who was designated by the Republican judge.
Perry was found not guilty and called the accusation a tactical, political maneuver.
His qualified law team has asked the judge overseeing the case to dismiss the charges because the use of the laws to prosecute the longest-serving governor in Texas history is unconstitutional.
Perry interrupted the disbursement of $7.5 million from the state's Public Interest Defending Fund, which is headquartered in Travis County and prosecuted corruption in Texas, after Lehmberg refused to resign.
The rejection was prompted by a formal complaint from a left-leaning group of civil rights activists.
Perry's official account is active - and sometimes he becomes famous.
After finishing fifth on his party's committee in Iowa during his 2012 presidential campaign, Perry responded to speculation that he might be done by now, tweeting with his own photo of him running near the lake, saying, "Here I am, South Carolina!"
According to Berkeley, the housing market is returning to normal "to the norm"
One of London's most prominent developer companies has warned that the housing market has "refuted" to the normal level of activity in the south-east of England.
Housing in the capital was subject to high demand and rising prices and widespread concerns about the credit bubble prompted the Bank of England to impose limits on mortgages in June.
Tony Pidgley, founder and chairman of the developer's investment company for discerning clients, Berkeley said on Monday: "From the start of the current financial year, the market has returned from the top point in 2013 to the normal level of transactions."
The London housing market did well during the downturn, as buyers from abroad flooded the capital.
According to data from the Land Registry, prices in the city jumped by 18.5% last year alone, far overtaking an average of 6.7% in England and across Wales.
Average sales prices for private, affordable and student housing from Berkeley rose by about a fifth last year, climbing to £423,000 at the end of April.
However, because of the strengthening pound, London property has not been so attractive in recent months - some of them have also been intimidated by the introduction of new property taxes and talk of a possible "sublitting tax" that politicians came up with before next May's parliamentary elections.
London real estate agency Foxtons warned last week that the April revision of the mortgage market, which introduced stricter loan rules, would also slow the pace of market growth for property and price sales during the second half of the year.
New data from the Bank of England on Monday showed a decline in the amount of approved mortgages for the month of July, suggesting that the housing market is calming down.
Hamptons International, another real estate agency, has fallen on the basis that home prices have already started to fall, their forecast for a rise in the price of London's properties for 2015 to 3%.
Meanwhile, according to real estate agency WA Ellis, the volume of transactions fell by a quarter each year in London's most expensive neighbourhoods such as Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington.
Still, demand for housing in the capital was a boon for Berkeley, as it increased cash for forward sales to more than £2.2 billion.
Pidgley added, "Demand for the right, good-looking housing in a good location has remained the same, and as a result, the forward sales have been maintained."
In June, the company reported to have sold 3,742 properties from the beginning of the year to the end of April, almost a third more than before the peak of the crisis in 2007.
Annual pre-tax profit increased by 40% to £380 million, yields by 18% to £1.6bn.
Speaking to Pidgley's annual meeting on Monday, he said it was predicted that Berkeley's annual returns would be in line with current market expectations.
Analysts agree that the annual pre-tax profit will be £450 million.
Berkeley's stock stopped at £23.96 in the afternoon on the London Stock Exchange.
Hacker posted pictures of naked Jennifer Lawrence online
Jennifer Lawrence arrives for the 85th Academy Awards.
Photos of Oscar winner Jennifer Lawrence leaked online for a hacker who claimed to have a "list" of photos of hundreds of aspiring actresses.
A spokesman for the star of the "Hunger Games" confirmed that the photos of Lawrence were genuine and criticized the hacker for "obviously a breach of privacy."
Authorities have already been contacted and will prosecute anyone who publishes the stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence.
The hacker's photos, which were originally posted on the 4chan image-sharing site, reportedly gained thanks to a gap in the Apple iCloud internet repository system. The BuzzFeed's alleged list of photos of the hacked victims includes the names of dozens of stars, including Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Mary-Kate Olsen.
It is unclear how many pictures are authentic, however, the star of "Scott Pilgrim against the rest of the world" was also criticized on Twitter by Winstead.
"I hope those of you who look at the photos my husband and I took in the privacy of your home years ago are happy with each other," Winstead wrote on Twitter.
However, Victoria Justice, a friend of the Nickolodeon "iCarly" and "Victorious" series, has denied that the photos were genuine. She posted on Twitter, "These alleged nude photos of me are SUJH, people."
Better to cut it out in the prime. *deliberate pun.
Buzzfeed announced Sunday night that a pop star's spokesman, Ariana Grande, had denied that the alleged photographs were genuine.
An extraordinary sample from Howard Jacobson's affowed new novel about love and the letter "J"
They dissolved, that's the best way to describe it, they gradually unfolded like a cardboard box left in the rain.
Only from time to time did a woman tell him that he was too serious, complex, violent, isolated, and perhaps a little irascible.
And then she shook his hand.
Inexcity, he admitted it.
He could sting like a hedgehog, yes.
The last victim of his ability was an incipient love affair, which more than ever promised to relieve him of the lonely boredom of his life and perhaps give him some satisfaction.
Ailinn Solomons was a frail beauty with a wild-haired mane and a fledgling heart from a village on the northern island that was even more remote and inhospitable than Port Reuben.
To the south, she came with an older companion Kevern thought was her aunt, who had inherited the estate in a damp but beautiful valley called, aptly, the Valley of Paradise.
The house was not lived in the house for several years.
The pipes were leaking, there were dead spiders in the tubes, the slugs with a blind sign on the windows, as if to think they owned the place, the garden was overgrown, and the weeds resembled huge collars of cabbage.
The house looked like a cottage from children's stories, both terrifying and charming, with a garden full of mystery.
Author's profile: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" is on the preliminary list of nominations for the Man Booker Prize 2014.
A shortlist selection will be announced next week.
Kevern and Ailinn sat on the folding chairs in the long grass and holding hands, enjoying the unexpectedly warm spring afternoon, absently tuned in to the public station, which supplied the country with comforting music and soothing messages, when the sight of its tanned crossed legs reminded him of an old song by a long-forgotten black comedian, which his father liked to listen to with the turf-turning rounds.
You have too big legs.
Because of their natural aggressiveness, they didn't play such songs on the radio anymore.
They weren't forbidden - there was nothing really forbidden - they just weren't played.
They were helped to get into desuetod, as well as the word desuetudo itself.
Folk taste has accomplished what regulations and outside the law could never do, and just as people in books choose a memoir in which the poor man becomes a rich man, cookbooks, and love novels, so music is chosen.
Kavern let the bottom down and began to play the imaginary piano and, in a coarse, comic voice, sang to Aill's big feet.
Ailinn didn't understand.
"That was a popular song by jazz pianist Fats Waller," he said, automatically putting two fingers to his lips.
That's what his father always did when he wanted to suppress the letter j before he came out of his mouth.
It started out as a game when he was a kid.
His father told him he played the game with his father.
When you didn't put two fingers in the word that started with the j, you didn't take a penny.
It wasn't very funny even then, and it wasn't funny now.
He just knew it was expected of him, that was all.
He had to explain what jazz was.
Ailinn has never heard one.
Even jazz, even if it was not outlawed directly, did not play.
Improvisation has gone out of fashion.
There was only room in life for one "if."
When the melody started playing, people wanted to know exactly where it would end up.
Same with humor.
His unseeingcability got on people's nerves.
And jazz was a song-like humor.
Although he had not heard of Samma Davisus Junior until he was ten years old, Kevern knew the jazz from his father's semi-secret collection of old CDs.
At least Aillin didn't have to say that Fats Waller was black.
Because of her age, she couldn't remember a time when the popular singers weren't black.
Also without laws or coercion.
The permissan society is one in which each part of it, with gratitude - the gratitude of those who were a lucky accidental to save - agrees with the principle of group gratitude.
People of Afro-Caribibbean were well suited to the temperament and the constitution for entertainments and athletics, so they sang and ran.
People from the Indian subcontinent, as if by nature gifted for electronics, took responsibility for the fact that no family would be without a functional phone.
The Poles who remained were plumbers, the Greeks left were the dishes.
Those from the Gulf states and the Levant, whose grandparents quickly left the country while it was happening TO, WHAT SE STALO, WHEN SE TO STALO - they were afraid of being accused of putting them on the fire, in fact, afraid that the fire would be spent the next time - they opened the restaurants where the labno was sold and smoked with water pipes, they didn't answer for themselves, and inactivity was slowly consuming them.
To each to his talent.
Listening to ballads, Ailinn found it hard to see how the foul language Kavern had just sang to her could produce music.
The music was an expression of love.
"They're not really rude," Kevern said.
Maybe just for people with too big legs.
My father never offended anyone, but he liked this song.
He spoke too much, but the neglected garden gave the illusion of safety.
From behind the soundproofed leaves, no word could escape.
Ailinn still didn't understand.
Why would your father like that?
He wanted to say it was a joke, but he was reluctant to put two fingers to his mouth again in her presence.
She thought he was weird.
"He found it funny," he said at last.
She shook her head in disbelief and shaded Keverno's view.
There was nothing to see in the wide world but a jumble of her raven hair.
He didn't want to see anything else.
"If you say so," she said doubtfully.
That still doesn't explain why you're singing it to me.
She looked genuinely upset.
Do I have too big feet?
He looked again.
Feelings not exactly.
Maybe a little ankle...
You're saying you hate me because my ankles are too fat?
Hate?
That's not true.
It's just a silly song.
He could have called her "I love you," but it was too soon.
"Your fat ankles are attracting me right now," he tried.
I'm a bit creepy.
That didn't work.
He wanted to be funny.
When he wanted to be funny, he was often in trouble, because, like his father, he lacked the magic necessary to tame the cruelty that lurked in the jokes.
Perhaps his father was cruel intentionally.
Perhaps he was deliberately cruel Kavern.
In spite of the kind eyes.
Ailinn Solomons reddened and rose from the couch, dropped the radio and spilled the unfinished wine.
Elderberry wine, so it wasn't the drink's fault.
She looked as if she was shaking in her excitement like palm fronds in the storm.
"I'm sickly drawn to being a jerk," she said...
Except I'm not drawn to it.
He felt sorry for her, both for her unkind words and for the fear she had in her eyes when she faced him.
Did she think he'd hit her?
She had not spoken to him of life on the cold northern peninsula where she had grown up, but he had no doubt that in the foundations it was the same as here.
The same wide and icy ocean was shattered against.
The same deranged men, then, WITH WITH STALO, even even more petty and grumpy than their ancestors, the smugglers and the spoiler, angrily wandered from pub to pub, ready to lay hands on any woman who dares to refuse or laugh at them.
A moron?
If she's not careful, they'll show her their fists!
First, cuddling her - cuddling became the most common term for erotic irritation between a man and a woman: an antidote to the frosting ballads of love that the radio was spewed - first she was anointed, then one of hers.
In Kevern's view, too sophisticated, because the cuddling was an act of violence in itself.
Ailinn Solomons neverbicled for him to leave.
He rose from the lounger like an old man.
She felt cranky herself, but the weight of his sadness surprised her.
It wasn't the end of the world.
They barely knew each other.
She watched as she walked - as if watching him from a upstairs window - the man who had been caught up in the man he had done.
Adam leaving the garden, she thought.
Her heart gripped for him and for all the men in general, regardless of the fact that a few of them beat her.
The man turned away from her, his shoulders down, ashamed, defeated, all the belligerence had left him - why did it feel he knew this look well, even if she couldn't recall a single moment, until today she had seen it before?
Ailinn Solomons, alone again, looked at her legs.
About twenty years after these events, Esme Nussbaum, an intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year-old researcher working in Ofnow, the Neatutte Public Mood Monitoring System, prepared a short article about the persistence of minor and moderate violent acts in the country's areas where it was mitigated or downright halted if enough money and energy were spent on its disposal.
"A lot has been done, and a lot has yet to be done," she wrote, "to be reassured by the innate aggression of the people who have fought in many battles and won most of them, especially in the hollow, hard-to-reach places of the country, where, despite the tips of the church towers, the hostile of human kindness has rarely appeared historically."
But some things are irreplaceable.
It might seem that the higher the church tower, the lower the instincts.
Residents sigh at the sentimental ballads, devour unhappy stories and declare that they firmly believe in the value of marriage and family life, but not only do old brutality hold as stubbornly in the Russian domain as stubborn as in urban agglomerations, but the evidence also shows that new and offensive intolerance is emerging at home, in the workplace, the road and even on the sports pitches.
"Unfortunately, you tend to be too florid," her superior said.
I would suggest that you read fewer novels.
Esme Nussbaum bowed her head.
I also have to ask: are you an atheist?
"I don't think I have to answer that," Esme Nussbaum said.
Are you a lesbian?
Esme once again objected to her privacy and silence.
Feminist?
More silence.
"I'm not asking for it," Rabinowitz finally said, "that I have something against atheists, lesbians or feminists.
We don't have prejudice in this workplace.
We serve unpannounced companies.
But a kind of hypersensitivity that is in itself perfectly acceptable and commendable can sometimes distort the judgment as you have demonstrated.
Apparently, you yourself are biased against the church - the things you call "cruel" and "brutal" others could also interpret as an expression of natural power and energy.
Always solving CO SE STALO, WHAT TO STALO, as if that had happened, if it had happened, yesterday, preparing a country with its basic life force.
While Rabinowitz was talking, Esme Nussbaum looked around.
Behind his head, the light-notenote advice flickered pink, which had been broadcasting to the world of the last quarter-century or more.
Smile at your neighbor, take care of your partner, listen to the ballads, go to the musicals, use your phone, concoct, agree, apologize.
Talking is better than keeping quiet, the sung word is better than the written one, but there's nothing better than love.
"I completely understand your reservations," Esme Nussbaum replied quietly, as she was certain that her superior had quit, "and I'm not saying that the wound was not healed as we tell myself it was healing.
My main concern is that if we are not alerted to this in advance, we will repeat the same mistake that led to the CO SE STALO, WITH THE TO STALO.
This time, however, we will not vent our anger and distrust on the others.
Luther Rabinowitz joined the tips of his fingers.
This was meant to indicate endless patience.
"You're going too far," he said, "when the steps they may have taken and may not have been taken by your grandparents are describing as mistakes.
You also go too far in talking about venting their "breath" and "didrust" on the "others."
I should not be reminded if I were to one that, in understanding the past and in the protection of the present, we are not talking about "us" and "knot."
There was no "we" and there were no "they."
All we know is that these were chaotic times.
'Whether, if we are honest with each other,' Esme said, 'no one is blameless.
I'm not blaming anyone.
Whether it was fair or not, what happened, happened.
That was before.
There's nothing to say about that - we agree on this.
And just as there is no guilt to blame on anyone, there are no things that should be corrected, even if the remedy was appropriate and possible.
But what else is the past for but to learn from it -
The past is there to be forgotten.
If there's one thing I can add to that -
Luther Rabinowitz unplugged his fingertips.
"I'll take your report into consideration," he said, releasing her.
The day after she went to work as usual, she was hit by a motorcyclist who drove onto the sidewalk in a manner described by passers-by as "brutal and furious."
Coincidence is happening.
The Forest Kingdom Army says no coup is planned - the Prime Minister remains in South Africa
Military officers of the Lesoth Kingdom have denied that they have organized a coup to overthrow the government, claiming that they have acted against the police suspected of attempting to arm political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane fled the country and says the army has surrounded his official seat and seized government buildings in the capital, Maseru.
After declaring that he was being threatened with death, the prime minister and his family went to the neighbouring South Africa with his family.
Army spokesman Major Ntlele Ntoi said it was not really a coup, but the army's response to the threat of "political fanatics" that the police were trying to arm.
"This morning, the command of the defense forces of the Lesotha was in talks after receiving several reports to the information service that there were several groups in the police ranks that were planning to arm some of the radical, political fanatics who were about to make havoc in the country," he told The Voice of America.
South African government spokesman Clayson Monyela said the military actions looked like an attempt to overthrow the government.
"Although no one has declared that he has seized government power with the help of force, the actions of the Forest ofoth's defensive forces appear to bear signs of a coup d'état," he said.
Military officials of the Kingdom of Leshoth said the soldiers returned to their barracks on Sunday and the capital was quiet.
During Thaban's absence, Deputy Prime Minister Mothetjoa Metsing will be responsible for the government.
Thabane said that, in his view, he was targeted for his efforts to fight corruption in the country.
Since Thabane suspended parliament sessions on internal disputes in June, there has been tension in Lesotho.
He said that, despite the opposite claims, he did not undermine the government's actions.
Eurozone production at 13-month low
Production growth, according to a closely watched surveyed in the eurozone in August, slowed to a 13-month low.
The final index of e-Guardier's (PMI) from June's 51.8 to 50.7 fell to 50.7 in August.
A figure higher than 50 indicates expansion.
New orders have been declined and the plant's growing tensions between the EU and Russia have been damaged by Ukraine.
The figures come from Thursday's meeting of the European Central Bank (ECB).
Markets will want a clear plan from the bank to deal with the delayed recovery of the euro area as well as the threat of deflation with inflation stagnant at 0.3%.
There has been speculation that the director of the ECB, Mario Draghi, may have indicated this week that he is considering the quantitative easing of the euro area, similar to what the United Kingdom and the US have taken to during the financial crisis.
"Although at least some growth is better than no growth, the braking effect that the growing economy and geopolitical uncertainty about manufacturers are becoming increasingly visible," said Rob Dobson, Markit's chief economist.
Germany's production PMI, Russia's largest trading partner in the EU, fell to an 11-month low of 51.4.
In the zone's second-largest economy, France, the PMI fell to 46.9.
There is concern about France, Italy has gone from the expansion of the stagnation.
Signs that the driving force for growth in the most important industrial areas in Germany, Spain, as well as the Netherlands, has disappeared is not very reassuring either," Dobson said.
The slowdown in the industry is likely to add fuel to the fire for analysts expecting the implementation of further monetary or tax incentives.
One positive report came from the Republic of Ireland, where the PMI rose to 57.3, the highest level since the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, chief economist at IHS Global Insight, said: "The best you can say about the purchasing managers' production report for August is that it shows the sector is still growing."
He added: Eurozone manufacturers currently have a very complex life, because increasing geopolitical tensions - especially between Russia and Ukraine - are adding even more uncertainty to the still challenging conditions in many countries.
This increasing uncertainty has shown a proven impact on the trade - and, above all, consumer confidence, which is likely to cause some orders to be delayed or even cancelled, especially costly ones.
He said that it appeared to be "even more likely" that the ECB would eventually have to implement some form of quantitative easing, "although we expect it to be limited."
Ten years of hell from Beslan survivors: Ten years since the horrors of the occupied school, children are still suffering
Ten years ago, 1,000 people were held hostage by Chechett at a school in Beslan, southern Russia
During the ordeal, which lasted three days and which shocked the world, more than 330 people were killed, more than half of whom were children
We returned to Beslan to seek out some of the victims who escaped death during the atrorose at the school
Exactly ten years after the horrifying cast of the school in Beslan, which killed 334 people, including 186 children, the surviving heroes warned last night about a new apocalypse in Ukraine.
When, on September 1, 2004, at the start of the new school year, fanatical terrorists captured and murdered children and parents, it looked like the deepest bottom of hell.
The resistance to the tragedy united the east and west, leading to negotiations and the future in this disastrous disaster.
Ten years on, we returned to Beslan in southern Russia to seek out some of the victims who had escaped death during the atrocity at the school.
We have found amazing young people who have resisted the misfortune, even if the memory of the inferno caused by the terrorists will live in them.
What is their greatest wish?
That the war that is now destroying Ukraine - and in which children like them were dying - should already be over.
Girl trying to climb back into a ruined school gym
She was captured by leading Russian photographer Dimitriy Beliakov, only trying to climb back into the bombed-out school gym in her underwear after a bomb exploded in it.
Confused, Aida was desperate to find her mother, Larissa, who is now forty.
There were fears that they were both dead, but in fact they survived.
'A woman told me to run and save my life, but I couldn't,' said Aida.
My legs were bloody.
I got up and got back in to find my mom.
She was rescued by a soldier.
After several surgeries, she thought she had made a full recovery, but yesterday she said, "Three months ago, the pains came back.
I'm afraid I'll have to have another surgery.
I was left with bits of shrapnel in my knee.
Her goal is to become a dentist so she can help people the way the doctors helped her.
"This tragedy changed my life, but it certainly didn't destroy it," she said determinedly.
"It just happened to me, and you can't change that.
I go to the gym once a year to remind myself of those who stayed there.
Otherwise, we try not to talk to your friends about it.
The pain is too much.
My best friend and future classmate from the class of Jeru Gapoev were killed there.
We played together as a kid and imagined us going to school together.
"I don't want to get married until I finish school and start a career.
I'll think about the family later.
She says she hasn't forgotten captivity, but the memories fade a little by the year.
I'm glad that so many people around the world still remember what happened, and we're very grateful for the help we got from the UK and other countries.
When I look at my picture online, climbing through the school window, I think a lot of people will see it for the first time, understand the disaster and prevent it from happening again.
The boy who escaped the rain of bullets and believed his mother was dead
It was his first day of school (in Russia, children start school at the age of seven) and survived the three-day siege of the school in the embrace of his mother, Tamara.
At the time, the seven-year-old said, "My mom told me that if there was an explosion, I should lie down on the ground and hold her hand."
After the explosion, he thought his mother was dying.
She said to him, "Run."
He was afraid she was dead, ran, and saw a crying toddler along the way, grabbing the child's hand and running with a spray of bullets.
His father, Vladimir, who caught him outside, said, "Damir told me that his mother was dead."
She says, "I couldn't have saved her."
In fact, Tamara staggered to freedom and lay in the hospital with a wounded leg and, on the contrary, thought her son had died.
After they met again, she said, "I cried with happiness.
I couldn't believe it.
He came in and hugged me.
Damir then flew to London (according to the defunct News of the World), where then-Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife, Cherie, were declared the winner of Bernardo's Children.
"The horror comes back every day, but I wish I could stop thinking about it," he said yesterday.
But I can say that the memories are fading.
I remember right after that, I threw away all my toy guns.
But today I can play the computer games that are shot in, and I don't have a problem with that.
"I'm not afraid to go back to the gym, but I don't think about myself.
I remember the kids I played with in the yard who didn't get out.
We never say they were killed or died.
We say they stayed in the gym.
I remember the trip to London well, especially how I could have picked out anything I wanted in a toy store, and how I drove through a convertible.
But now he is worried about places like Ukraine, where he and his friends are suffering because of the war.
The horror comes back every day, but I wish I could stop thinking about it.
"I am terribly sorry for anyone who has to go through such horror," says Damir, who attended the monastery volunteering last week.
I want to help so much.
I want to work in the police force one day and I hope I'll be accepted to the academy next year.
His mother, Tamara, 48, says, "They killed 37 children from our neighborhood, can you imagine?
I remember the silence right after the attack. There were no children to scream and run around, and the silence took months.
He remembers her journey with Damir to London.
When I told our story in London, people cried.
Then I realized how people on the other side of the world could understand our feelings and how they could express their support.
She was grateful to Cherie Blair and her foundation for the award and the chance to go to London in autumn 2004.
I wish I could call Cherie and say in person that even though it's been ten years, I still remember meeting her and her husband in London and how they helped me and Damiro.
I remember Damir's appetite for borsch, so they called all the Russian restaurants.
I also remember him playing with the waiters in the restaurant, Damir shooting at them with a water pistol, and they ran and played with him.
And that was only a month away from the horror.
I was surprised how the British wanted to share our pain with us and how they supported us.
She said, "I still think the world hasn't changed for the better in ten years.
Now there is a war in Ukraine, people are dying every day and I think a lot of children have been and will be killed.
They're the same kids as ours.
I think for a lot of people, war is just something on the news that they listen to when they're bored or when they're doing something else.
I know what these people are going through, what a horror it is.
I can still feel it.
Nothing's changed, people still want to murder each other, it's so sad.
Damir grew up and is a nice and quiet kid, not at all aggressive or angry.
For example, he has no desire for revenge, he doesn't care about that at all.
I know he doesn't like to remember it, but he's very close to six classmates, and from time to time he goes to the gym and light candles.
When he was smaller, he had trouble with it - I remember sometimes lying down on the couch with his face facing away from us and sometimes lying for hours.
He didn't sleep, his eyes were open.
I also remember he fired all his guns or other toys. The Damiro is 17 today, taller than me, handsome, smart and healthy.
I can hardly believe that I was sure he was dead for several hours and that I would never see him again.
When I recovered from the explosion and got up to my feet, I looked around and saw the inferno, there were pieces of human body lying everywhere.
I was pretty sure my little boy didn't have a chance to survive this hell.
"I remember yelling 'Damir, run, run!' but I was convinced he hadn't heard me.
But he heard her and ran.
So our lives go on, unlike others.
Grigory Ilyin, 17
The boy whose photo taken after the attack became a symbol of the horrors in Beslan
Teach: The Beslan survivor Grigorij Ilyin with his mother Fatima after the 2004 attack, on the right, Grigoriy today
As he ran for his life after a Chechen terrorist shot his classmates, he was intimidated into his bloodied face.
His photo was one of the most shocking symbols of the atrocity in Beslan.
His mother Fatima, 54, a doctor, dropped him off at the school on his first day and rushed to take his older son, Vladimir, to the university.
"I left two minutes before the terrorists stormed the yard, so my little boy was left alone for three days," she recalled.
Not all alone, because we had relatives there, but they all died there.
Only my Grigori survived.
As the date gets closer, it's getting harder to think about and talk about it.
Not a single day goes by that time to remember the tragedy.
It doesn't feel like it happened a long time ago, I feel like it was yesterday, some moments keep coming back to me.
I promise no one will ever forget.
Still returning memories: A photo of Grigory (left) was one of the most shocking pictures of the attack and was immortalized as a statue (right)
I remember when Grigori was really looking forward to school that day, saying he wanted to hug his teacher.
I learned that he was alive when I saw him on TV.
There's even a sculpture of the weeping Grigori.
Grigori doesn't like looking at the photo, and we have it hidden in the bookcase at home.
I get it, but I also think that because of the picture, people around the world know the pain we feel.
Today, Grigory says, "The important thing is that this doesn't happen again.
"I doubt we'll ever know the truth.
Such tragedies are still under investigation, but no one ever finds out the truth.
Now they're investigating the Boeing crash in Ukraine.
Do we ever know what the cause was?
This world is in for something very bad.
"I don't see why this is happening, because if you ask people, no one wants a war, so how is that possible?
Ten years is nothing to do with such pain.
To forget a little, he needs decades.
It had an impact on my health, I can still feel it.
I had nightmares for three or four years because of the attack, but then it got better.
Then, when I returned to school in 2004, I was terrified every day.
I was thinking about my friends and classmates who were killed.
That's why, as September 1st, as I come to the gym.
I want to honor the memory of my childhood friends.
It's hard for me to enter the gym, but I have to.
I don't feel like a victim, this story is a thing of the past.
I won't forget it, but I don't feel sorry for myself.
My life goes on.
This year I finished school and started studying medicine at the University of Vladikavkaz.
I want to be a cardiothoracic surgeon.
First I wanted to join the army.
I wanted to be a soldier, but I couldn't help it because of my health.
I wanted to fight for my country, but I can't.
Grogori Farniyev, 20
The boy who survived despite being held at the feet of the murdering terrorist
A miracle: Gregori Farniyev was held at the feet of the murdering terrorist during the attack, yet he was able to survive
When the attack was in full swing, he was caught trapped in the gym sitting next to the bomb at the feet of the murdering terrorist.
It's a real miracle he survived.
"It feels like it was yesterday," said Gregori, who wanted to become an agent of the Federal Security Service but was unable to suffer from the injuries he sustained during the attack.
It's still with me, it's not something I put behind me.
I'm older now, and it's said that kids can deal with bad experiences better - I have to say it's not true.
"I went to a psychologist in 2006 and I felt a little better, but I can't forget.
And I'd like to forget.
In 2005 - the year after - it was the first and last time I entered the gym again.
I fainted.
I will never go there again, and please do not ask me to show you where I am sitting on the well-known picture.
Survivor: Gregory Farniev today, on laptop with his photo taken in hospital after the attack
The pain is huge and I bring it with me every day.
My friends know I don't like to think about it or talk about it and never ask me about school.
As for physical health, I'm fine.
I have to be careful with my knee, which I hurt myself, but I'm walking normally.
Even so, for the sake of my health, I was unable to enter and study at the FBS Academy in St. Petersburg as I wanted.
I sent them my documents, including medical reports, and they replied that this was impossible.
My next hobby is the animals, so I got in for a vet.
I finished there for the second year.
He learns how to heal all animals from "kick to cows."
He said, "I know I will never tell my children about it.
It's not something that children should know about, and certainly not something they should experience.
His mother, Marina, 42, said, "The pain will be here all the time.
He's inside and getting worse as his anniversary approaches.
I will attend the commemorations.
I know Grigori won't go.
It must be even stronger for him because he was there, unlike me.
I was waiting for him at home and I couldn't help him.
I'm so grateful to God, he gave it back to me. Here in Beslan, there are clues everywhere.
It stays with us.
Gregori is an adult today, but he carries the horror of it.
It's hard to accept when something so terribly unfair happens to you.
He's a kid, he likes sports, but he can't do it for his knee.
He's had several surgeries, he can walk, but he can't exercise.
I'd say he's overcame that horror of about 50%, but you can't go through it completely and you can't forget it.
This terrible experience with us will always be.
A lot of our friends and neighbors were killed during the attack, and that only makes the pain worse.
I lost a lot of people I loved and who were close to me.
My son is with me, and that's the greatest gift God could give me, but it hurts me to lose the dead.
I know families in whom other children were born, but also widows who were not married again.
It's hard to accept that life goes on, even if you don't want to.
I'll never forget my heart almost jumping out of my chest when I saw him in the hospital.
Now I observe what is happening in the world - wars in other places.
What are these people fighting for?
Why are they killing each other?
The war is now approaching our country, which is hard to believe.
We've been one friendly country in the past, so how did we get to the point of fighting with each other now?
People and children are suffering, I am sure that many children in Ukraine have been and will still be killed.
If only we could have taken all the rebels together and thrown away at them as far as I can.
Alyona Tskaev, 10
A child who was taken to safety by a special commando
Saved: Alyon Tskaev is carried to a props-free Russian special commando (left).
She is now ten (right) and she has no recollection of the tragedy
The world gasped in 2004 when little Alyon was carried out in the arms of the Beslan captivity by a Russian policeman.
The terrorists released her, but retained her 30-year-old mother, 10-year-old sister Kristina and brother Makhar in captivity at the school gym.
Makhar, who was three at the time, escaped, escaped, but Alyona's mother and sister died in the massacre.
Her brother Ruslan remarried and he and his new wife, Svetlana, have a little girl named Kristina after the dead daughter.
Neighbors say that Alyona, who is now ten, has no recollection of the attack and has grown into a bright and happy little girl.
A close friend said that "it's a big happy family, and Alyona and Makhar are great kids."
Ruslan is an excellent father and wants to keep the children away from the memories that the tenth anniversary commemorates.
You can understand why.

4 tips on how to get better photos and videos underwater
If you are interested in taking pictures or underwater shootings, you have a large selection of equipment.
The cheapest option is a compact such as the Nikon Coolpix AW120 or the GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition outdoors camera, which costs around $300.
I took these photos at the family party with a few cameras, all of which cost less than $350.
It doesn't matter what equipment you use, but there are several rules to achieve the best results.
Check your gear.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure the batteries and other parts are tightly closed.
Next, set the camera according to what type of photos or videos you will take.
Some cameras and video cameras have a scenic or shooting mode that optimizes the exposure to the dark underwater environment.
And by the time you get started, see how far you can dive with your equipment.
Some of the cameras are only designed up to 5 feet, with another one up to 50 to 60.
Read our guide to the purchase and evaluation of digital cameras in both normal and waterproof design.
Always take a few pictures - a lot of them don't come out.
Compact cameras have an LCD to help you with a composite of photos, but the outdoor cameras don't have it.
Even if you have an LCD, it will be hard to see under the water and the composition of the shot will be unveard.
So always take multiple shots.
If the camera has a bracketing mode that makes a series of frames with a slightly different exposure dispersion, take advantage of it.
Keep close to the surface.
With a deeper draught of light, it dwindles significantly.
If possible, stay close to the waterfront, lake or sea near the surface during the photo shoot.
This also allows you to capture more light in the photos - the deeper you sink, the less color you will see.
Get close to the subject.
This is excellent advice if you take pictures on land, but underwater it is even more important because of the more muffled light.
This is particularly important if you are filming with an outdoor camera: Such devices usually have a firm and wide lens angle, which means that if you want to fill the photo box, you need to get closer to the objects.
Andrew Lawson was a man whose personality strength could change things even in as vast an organization as the NHS.
As an anaesthesiologist, he dedicated his career to relieving the pain caused by both illness and treatment.
His wife recalls that one of the people who sought his help was an MI6 officer who had to live with the consequences of torture that mutilated him.
Lawson understood that while doctors focused on diagnoses and diseases, the patients treated overwhelmingly interested in something else entirely: pain.
But one day in 2007, it was he who began to suffer.
"I don't feel like myself," he wrote in May of that year.
I felt without power.
He struggled with flu symptoms and found that he was impatient and included his wife Juliet with remorse.
He noted, "I want everything to happen sooner rather than later."
When Juliet left for a week on a business trip, Lawson was unusually and inexplicably agitated.
Something was wrong.
A colleague gave him a chest X-ray.
He had skied in the French Alps two weeks before.
The X-ray results came in.
He had a mesothelioma, an incurable tumor that affects the pleura, or the lining of the lungs.
Most cancers are hard to determine what was the cause of them.
Although some smokers get lung cancer, not all patients with lung cancer smoked.
But the Mesopeliom is different.
In almost all cases, it is the cause of asbestos being displayed - a building fibrous material that was previously described as "miraculous," but is now known to be deadly.
For most of us, it was not difficult to ignore the mesothelioma.
Asbestos, after all, belongs to the past.
The most dangerous type of asbestos has not been used in Britain since the 1960s, when the ban on the use of asbestos in industry came into force.
Even when asbestos was used, only certain groups of people came into close contact with it, such as insulation treasurers, builders, carpenters and shipyards workers.
Toxin used in industry in another era now appears to be a cause for concern.
But such complacency is misplaced.
As it turns out, a cancer epidemic is now at the height of the UK.
The number of deaths per mesothelioma is higher here than in any other country in the world.
2,500 deaths from the disease a year are twice as many as the number of victims of car accidents.
Deaths from mesothelioma per year from 1980 and estimated future deaths in the UK
The reason we are only now feeling its effects, even though the use of asbestos has been illegal for years (all asbestos species were eventually banned by law in 1999) is that it usually takes several decades to develop a mesothelioma.
The disaster of mesothelioma is not just about veterans of the construction industry.
Asbestos was, and in many cases, it is still, present, in the homes in which we live, in the offices where we work, in the schools where we learn, and in the shops we shop in.
So the Mesotheome does not respect the social stratum, wealth, profession or age.
Privileged bastions from London department stores to public schools are not a hideout.
Parliament, too, is full of asbestos.
Even the hospitals in which they should treat us are the repositories of this mortal carcinogen.
Andrew Lawson was not old.
Nor did he inspect isolation.
He tried to find out where he might have come into contact with asbestos.
Then he found out.
"It is possible that a lot of asbestos were in the basement corridors of Guy's Hospital, where I spent six years in practice," he wrote.
All of them - students, nurses, doctors, and doormen - used the corridors.
The question is, how many of my contemporaries get the same disease?
Unfortunately, it was a question he could partially answer.
"Of the four doctors who were at the practice of Guy's Hospital and who were then shown to a mesothelioma in the past five years," he noted in a letter in 2010, "I'm the only one still alive."
How many of us get sick?
Andrew Lawson was diagnosed with the mesothelioma when he was 48.
When 17. he died in February of that year, 55.
Surviving with this diagnosis is not usual for so long.
55 percent of people diagnosed with mesothelioma die within eight months of diagnosis.
The disease is always fatal.
So now we can only repeat to Lawson's question: "How many of us get the same disease?"
According to the leading British mesothelioma expert Professor Julian Pete, the best estimate is that between 1970 and 2050, when the asbestos epidemic is taking place in Britain, about 90,000 people will die.
Most of them currently have no idea that they will die in this way.
Asbestos mine in Quebec, Canada
A cursory insight into the files from the archives of the courts, to which the disabled often turn and require compensation, it shows how much the mesotheliomaasm has spread.
For example, this June was admitted by Marks & Spencer to subject asbestos to Janice Allen out of negligence.
She worked for the chain for nine years, from 1978 to 1987, when she supervised two stores in the clothing section - one of the sites being the company's flagship, a shop on Oxford Street.
Allen was only 18 when she started working for M&S.
Today he has two children, who are in his 20s.
"Before it happened," she says, "I've never heard of mesothelioma before, as soon as I knew anything about asbestos.
I never dreamed that he might have involved me.
There aren't many people who know something about asbestos.
In fact, it is not asbestos one substance, but a group of six minerals.
He was named because of his fibrational structure, which gives him strength and flexibility.
Of the six minerals, three were used in the construction industry.
Most often today, chryzotil can be found in the buildings, commonly known as white asbestos.
It was used in roof panels, floor tiles, boiler tights and even brake lining.
It is not as lethal as other forms of asbestos, yet the EU and the WHO see it as a "great health risk" that can cause death.
But the more dangerous is the brown asbestos (amsus) and the blue aesthetic (steyhydolit).
Britain was once the world's largest importer of brown asbestos, and experts say that "there is a conclusive but circumstantial evidence that it was the main cause of the unusually high incidence of mesothelioma [in the UK]."
Marsk & Spencer employee was exhibited at the flagship store in Oxford Street, London
Janice Allen may not consider herself a typical victim of mesothelioma, but Julian Pete's work points out that her story is not uncommon at all.
His patient study alleges that "a substantial proportion of cases of mesothelioma without known exposure to asbestos at work or at home were likely caused by exposure to asbestos in the environment."
Much of this exposure is due to the "current use and zoom" of buildings.
No one seems to be sure she's safe.
The Goddard Consulting report, which examined the Palace of Westminster, shows that even the people of the government on Wednesday may not suspect that they may be on display for asbestos.
In 2009, Goddard published a report saying that service lifts and pipelines are contaminated by asbestos behind the rooms of the parliamentary committee, whose fatal fibres could be broken by something as harmless as the “strong air flow.”
Ministers are often accused of only caring for their own interests, but in this case the opposite may be true.
Although the Directorate of Services of Parliament insisted that the Palace of Westminster be given a "positive medical certificate" now, it is now expected that it will take one million pounds and several years of work to be thoroughly inspected by Parliament, electricity to be modernised and asbestos removed, and that, rather than on the Green Benchmarks in Westminster, MPs will sit on the premises of the Queen of Elizabeth II Conference Centre.
The Goddard report states that "the presence of asbestos is not in line with several regulations."
It is impossible to say whether this mismatch will cost lives.
Everyone can now just wait.
One of those who was never able to determine when they had an asbestos exhibit occurred is Graham Abbott, the doctor.
Like Andrew Lawson, Abbott (50) suspects that he was exposed to asbestos while working in hospitals.
"I worked at the hospital where the presence of asbestos was established," he says, "but I cannot prove it in my case.
It's difficult to remember all the places he worked and when he worked there.
But he clearly remembers the day in early December 2009, when he was climbed by something like a chill.
He was 45, it was evening and he was in the middle of the surgery.
Suddenly I shuddered.
It came at once.
I felt terrible.
I thought I wouldn't get by car home.
Because he was a doctor, he knew the pain came from the pleura, the lining around the lungs.
But like Janice Allen, he had no reason to believe it was a mesothelioma.
He ended up spending a month at home.
Confused doctors had an X-ray of his chest and introduced a chest catheter to remove the fluid from his lungs, which was sent for analysis.
Yet they did not diagnose.
His condition slowly improved and returned to work.
From time to time, however, his symptoms returned, often after he had trained and breathed in.
In 2011, one of Abbott's patients with similar symptoms came to the OR and was subsequently diagnosed with mesothelioma.
Even then, however, Abbott had not linked anything to his own case.
After all, his patient was several decades older and came into direct contact with asbestos at work.
In this case, the connection was clear.
In September 2011, Abbott's condition deteriorated again and his doctor consulted his CT scan and X-ray with the panel of experts.
In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbott began to feel ill, a probe was introduced into the space between the lining of the chest cavity and the lining of his lungs.
I'm optimistic.
I tend to not take much of a thing," he says.
To be honest, I wasn't really worried about it.
But Rachel, my wife, was a concern.
The biopsy results arrived between Christmas and New Year: "They told me it was a mesotheliome."
Graham Abbott: diagnosed with mesothelioma
Abbott began seeing nurses from the charity Macmillan, and one advised him to contact a lawyer.
That was when he realized the scale of the epidemic.
"It turns out that asbestos has been widely used, especially in large public buildings that often have asbestos thermal insulation in the pipes," he says.
The people who have been exposed to asbestos in these buildings are now beginning to show the disease.
So the Mesothelioma is now starting to apply to younger people who do not have risky occupations.
The most dangerous pipes, thermally insulated with asbestos, were in the lowlandings in hospitals, so it was unlikely that they would endanger patients.
However, the members of the staff who crossed the basement corridors between the buildings (like Andrew Lawson) or ate in the basement canteens (as often Graham Abbott) came into contact with the toxic substance.
As it now turns out, hospitals were a place where they could save the patients' lives, but also a place that could have endangered the lives of the doctors who treated them.
Asbestos is still being removed today.
Pupils built Bunsen's Kahan on asbestos pads
And it's not just the hospitals.
Asbestos was often used in offices, shops, libraries and town halls for its excellent insulating and non-flammable properties.
Schools, too.
In fact, many people were exhibited at the school.
Somewhere, in the myriad hours of chemistry, the students were building a Bunsen kahan on the asbestos pad.
There have been a website dealing with the issue of asbestos in schools.
Harmless things like floor tiles or roofs of tool shorts in our homes were commonly included asbestos.
"This is an industrial poison built into a large number of houses," notes Andrew Morgan, the lawyer who represented Andrew Lawson in his lawsuit against Guy's Hospital.
In one case, there was only one contact with asbestos that a woman suffering from a mesothelioma could remember in the 1970s while breaking down a garden house.
So be careful how you're ruining the garden house.
Knowing that the disease is untreatable, the impact of the diagnosis is huge.
"It takes you a while to figure it out," says Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and tried to get on with it, but I found I couldn't focus on what I was doing.
I was in the operating room for two weeks.
Then I realized I'd have to leave and deal with myself.
Well, I won't live to see another Christmas.
One of the most difficult things was going from a doctor's position to a patient position.
As a myriad of patients before him, he remembers how confused he felt about the amount of information he had to deal with.
"It was hard to understand," he says.
"I asked my doctor, "How much time do I have?"
I've been told 12 months.
I remember thinking, "Well, I'm not going to live to see another Christmas.
That's the way it is."
The mesotheliome is particularly destructive because the very mechanism of what keeps us alive - the breathing itself - is what causes the cancer that kills.
Most of the cases of mesothelioma are caused by exposure to asbestos.
Asbestos are made up of small fibres.
When the asbestos is broken and the fibers are inhaled, they can settle in the pleura, the lining of the lungs.
Asbestos fibres irritate the plee's purse and can trigger a cell mutation.
"The problem is inhaled asbestos fibers in the shape of the needles," explains Professor Tom Treasure, a heart surgeon who joined Guy's Hospital in 2001.
To the same hospital where Andrew Lawson was apparently exposed to asbestos and which, paradoxically, is the head of the center in the treatment of mesothelioma.
Treasure knows and has also treated other patients who were exposed to asbestos probably during his experience at the hospital.
Asbestos needles get into the tissue of the lungs, says Treasure, and "the breathing itself pushes them to the edge where the lining is.
By his nature, he has been invasive from the very beginning.
The mesothelioma of the common therapeutic options used for other types of cancer is not working as much.
It is hotly discussed, for example, the effectiveness of the operation.
Some say it would be worth an attempt.
Treasure disagrees.
"You can't remove the pleura," he says.
You can't get a scalpel around it.
Cancer "notes too much to chemotherapy" that "has some effect" but does not cure.
"Sometimes there's someone who can outlive lung cancer," says Treasure.
But in the end, they all die.
Fortunately, some patients live much longer than expected.
Author Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after the diagnosis.
Two and a half years since his own diagnosis, Graham Abbott has been fighting.
After discovering the mesotheliome, Abbott made contact with Andrew Lawson, who, four years after his diagnosis, became individual support and advisor for people equally affected.
When they called, he cheerfully introduced himself, "Hello, you've reached the cancer headquarters."
"He was very positive," says Abbott.
He was diagnosed with the disease four years ago and he was still very active.
At the beginning, Abbott was offered six cycles of chemotherapy that would take four months, and would probably only extend his life by a month.
"I was desperate," he says.
I was gonna give up.
But Lawson "managed to show things in a more optimistic light."
After visiting several doctors, Abbott decided to continue the treatment with Professor Loic Lang-Lazduski of the thoracic surgery department at Guy's Hospital.
"I had the advantage of not having to wait for me to be sent to him, but I just called and they examined me," Graham admits.
A normal patient would have to receive a requisition and would have to be approved for reimbursement.
To get to the best available treatments, the issue of mesothelioma is crucial for patients with mesothelioma.
But when various treatments inevitably fail in the end, many patients face further financial concerns - the future of the family they leave behind.
And that's why they go to the courts and want compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan of Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
"Since 1898, it was known that asbestos is harmful to health," Morgan says.
In the 1960s, however, it was found that even a very small amount of it could pose a health risk.
And here we encounter the negligence of companies.
Andrew Lawson and Guy's Hospital eventually leveled off, but according to Morgan, it wasn't a "full settlement" because Lawson could not finally prove that the mesothelioma was the result of asbestos exposure to Guy's Hospital.
However, following the investigation into the case, a Guy's Hospital spokesman confirmed that "asbestos in the basement section in question were removed in the 1990s."
That was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How to remove asbestos
To see an exhibit of fatal asbestos per company or job place - usually decades after it happened - has proved to be a huge problem for patients with a mesothelioma seeking compensation.
A lot of former workplaces changed hands or went bankrupt.
The insurance records are lost.
And those who are now resisting the charges have time on their side, which their prosecutors certainly do not.
In response to this fact, important new legislation was passed this year, making it easier for patients with a mesothelioma to seek a settlement even if it is not possible to trace their former employer.
The law created a $350-a-humble financial reserve, which is paid for by insurance companies, which is intended for people diagnosed after July 2012, who can prove that they have been exposed to asbestos but have no one to sue.
In such a case, the disabled will receive 80% of the amount that would normally be awarded to them by the court as a settlement - around £120,000.
There are 300 successful applications expected each year.
Andrew Morgan, like the Mesothelioma, thinks £350 million is a “good job.”
"It's an insurance deal for insurance companies," he says, pointing out that the sum is a quarter of what insurance companies would have to pay if time had not intervened and people with mesothelioma would be able to find out to their former employers and sue them in the normal way.
Even Mike Penning, a former secretary of labor and social affairs, admitted that the law "had in gaps."
But both Penning and Morgan admit that, given the seven deaths each year, swift action was required.
"People are suffering too much and need help right away," Penning said in December last year during the second reading of the Mesothelioma Act.
Graham Abbott was in the care of Professor Loic Lang-Lazdunski for 19 months.
After initial consultations, Lang-Lazdunski recommended the surgery, which, unlike Tom Treasura, he thought had a positive effect.
The surgery was followed by radiotherapy and chemotherapy - a triple treatment for which Lang-Lazdunski can boast a survival rate of five years in up to 40% of patients.
Abbott was strengthened.
"That's not the most important thing, of course," says Abbott.
You see it all the time in patients.
There's something that drives you.
If you surrender, your condition can deteriorate very quickly.
Graham Abbott underwent surgery in March 2012.
In late August, he completed the last of six cycles of chemotherapy.
The check-ups showed no symptoms of the disease.
I went to the next check-up in March [2014].
I had a few spots scattered in my chest [cancer].
It was just approaching my 50th birthday.
It's no threat to life.
It's taking him.
Abbott underwent six cycles of chemotherapy again.
There are currently no traces of a tumor in his body.
But it is a physically and emotionally exhaustive process.
You have to think about practical things - financial security when I die, or to show the woman how the alarm clock works on the boiler.
When you learn the bad news, you start to be negative.
You have to look forward.
As for the father of Ellie (16) and Tamsin (14), it's not always easy.
"It's hard for parents," he says.
It's hard to decide what to say and how much to say.
After the diagnosis, I told the girls that my condition meant I would never be old.
Their reaction was different.
Tamsin is very social and wild.
She told her friends, and all of a sudden, a lot of people started calling us.
Ellie was more restrained.
She didn't say much.
Such talks must be faced by all cancer patients.
In patients with mesotheliome, however, such conversations are not relieved by hope or just a hint of a chance for survival.
The disease brings with it (and eventually brought to Stephen Jay Gould) a bleak certainty.
As Andrew Morgan says, "inter-tractor's not a threat to life."

China refuses to give Hong Kong the power to choose leadership - protesters promise revenge
China's parliament, despite the proliferating discussions on democratic reform on Sunday, decided not to allow voters in Hong Kong to nominate 2017 candidates for the 2017 elections.
The move is likely to spark long-promised protests in the business district of Hong Kong, as activists began to organize and prepare just hours after the announcement.
China's People's Congress essentially allows communist leaders to eliminate any candidate who is not loyal to Beijing.
"We weren't surprised, but we were fooled," said lawmaker Emily Lau, the Democratic leader.
That's not what Beijing promised.
People in Hong Kong were lied to.
And it is clear that we are dealing with an authoritarian regime.
To defend China's decision, the Deputy Secretary-General of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, Li Fei, said that allowing the public nominations in the Hong Kong leadership elections would cause a "chaos."
Since 1997, when Britain returned to China's administration to Hong Kong, Beijing has promised that from 2017, residents will be able to vote for executive power.
Chinese leaders presented Sunday's decision as a democratic breakthrough because Hong Kong is allowed to vote in direct, but the decision also makes it clear that Chinese leaders hold firm in the hands of the process of nominating the committee strictly controlled by Beijing.
And under the new clause, only the candidates who "love the country and Hong Kong" will be admissible.
The decision came after the summer months, which recorded some of Hong Kong's biggest and most-watched protests in several years.
Most of the pro-democratic protests in Hong Kong are the Occupy of Central movement with Love and Peace, whose organizers have threatened to close the financial district if Beijing does not grant them universal voting rights.
On Sunday evening, just hours after the announcement, hundreds of supporters of the Occupy Grounds of the Above-Wair rallied outside the Hong Kong administration headquarters.
At the demonstration, organizers said that their movement was entering a new phase of civil disobedience and that it would launch waves of protests in the coming weeks.
However, they did not provide any further details, apparently to avoid problems with the authorities.
In their online statement, the organizers said that the movement "assumed the occupation of the Central only as a final step in the event that all the possibilities of dialogue were exhausted and there would be no other choice.
We regret to announce that all the possibilities of dialogue have been exhausted today and the occupation of the Centralis is inevitable.
Authorities in Hong Kong have been preparing for Beijing's announcement for days, and on Sunday they strengthened the protection of the seat of the government and deployed police and barricades.
The impelling of the unrest, according to many Hong Kong residents, is a sign that it is slowly losing control of the city.
The surge of landfors is increasing competition for products and services.
There are also growing concern that values such as democracy and freedom of speech are bending against increasing pressure from Beijing.
Some have criticized the Occupy of Central movement, saying their demonstrations threaten the trade - the Hong Kong lifeboat.
"The protest he's talking about could cause much more economic damage, depending on how many people attend and for how long," says politician Regina Ip, who has long criticized the movement.
We do not want to see a rise to the fear that Hong Kong is getting out of control.
Such perceptions could hurt investment.
Chinese state media have also come up with reports in recent days that portray Democratic activists in Hong Kong as subversive agents run by the West.
In the summer, activists organised an unofficial referendum on voting rights, attended by 780,000 participants - more than a fifth of voters in Hong Kong.
And in July, tens of thousands of people took part in one of the largest pro-democratic demonstrations in the area's history.
A pre-election agitator?
The league in Jihlava is named after the political movement
The small soccer play by approximately 1,600 amateur athletes in the regional city of Vysočina.
And their top-flight is now called Together for Jihlava League.
It was named after one movement that goes to the local elections in October.
In addition, the ten on his ticket is the head of the small soccer in Jihlava, Jan Mráka.
"There was a general meeting where there was no problem with it," Mráka said.
The situation surrounding the first league of small soccer was already addressed by lawyers at the Jihlava City Council and recommended changing the system for distributing subsidies.
The little soccer got around a million crowns last year, according to the city's website.
This year, too, the figure is in the hundreds of thousands.
In the legal opinion, the procedure of small soccer is not contrary to the law or to the Municipality's directives.
However, the situation is an incentive for the Office to modify the rules for awarding grants and subsidies," said Municipality spokesman Radek Tulis.
Drawing subsidies from the city and at the same time expressing support for a small soccer support in the elections of one political party is unlikely to be possible.
The highland "great" football has yet to come to a similar request from politicians.
That the ČSSD regional champion, the ODS division or the KDU-ČSL 1 would be formed.
And the class and the competition like that?
I wouldn't be in favor.
On the contrary, I would like to see us approached by company sponsors," said Miroslav Vrzáček, chairman of the regional football association.
The head of small football will not let another party and the movement into the league's name
According to the players of the small soccer, the sport in Jihlava deserved its own area with six playgrounds, changing rooms and sanitary facilities.
"For example, the Na Stoupách pitch is not ours, we are rented there," said Ondřej Lapeš from the Starlet Jihlava club.
The most suitable location would be the Czech Mill.
But there will be, for example, a meaningless area for skaters, of which there are about fifty in Jihlava, will be built there," Mráka pointed out.
The mayor of Jihlava, Jaroslav Vymazal (ODS), responded that the small soccer playgrounds with artificial grass in the streets of Rošický and Na Stoupách, which are in the possession of the city.
We want to build such playgrounds that have the maximum use.
We are preparing to upgrade or build sports venues at schools that will be accessible in the afternoon.
I think there has been huge progress for a small soccer in the last few years," Vymazal added.
Other political parties in the names of the leagues will not appear, according to Jan Mráka.
We have limitations.
If someone from one field enters the partnership, we don't put the other in there," he explained.
"The political movement in the name of the league, I consider this to be at least an unfortunate step," said Karel Voldán, a member of the town hall commission for sport.
"But let the voters assess whether Mr. Mráka is using the association Malá knacka Jihlava and the city's subsidies for political purposes or not," he added.
American tradition infiltrates university life - freshmen can fly jettroon
We are pleased to be able to respond to the demand by launching the first luxury travel service for students in Britain.
In order to give the best impression of arriving at the university, the company also offers transport options, including a private jet or Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Martin or McLaren P1 cars.
Stewart also stated that the service had a security page.
Service is an ideal option for students who would otherwise have to drag their stuff across the state in a dangerously loaded car.
We look forward to ensuring that with our VIF (very important fresher - a very important freshman) variants this year, students arrive at the university with a minimum of nervousness and the maximum of luxury.
A spokesman for the company said that, since the services were just being launched, they had no reservations yet, but added, "Students will start making reservations within the next few weeks."
The company also said that although students pay annual tuition fees of £90,000, the service expects the service to find its place in the market.
Compared to students ten, twenty, thirty, or forty years ago, today's students are different about expectations and wishes - it's more important than ever to make the right first impression, and the VIF program is exactly the appropriate way to do it.
But the National Union of Students criticized the service as unattainable.
Megan Dunn, the vice president of the Union for Higher Education, noted: "For most students, such a project is unattainable.
Many students who are entering the university this month have to come to terms with the financial crisis before throwing out £000 for something as simple as arriving at the college, because the financial support available in the form of loans and grants cannot keep up with the rising cost of basic needs.
Feminists oppose racism and police behavior after events in Ferguson
At the beginning of the month, a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, killed an unarmed teenager.
Those waiting for the funeral with their hands up chant: "Hands up, don't shoot!"
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Missouri over the shooting of unarmed teenager Michael Brown, blogger Miriam Zoila Perez noted a shift in online discussions by white feminists.
She found that when it comes to promoting reproductive rights and income equality, white feminists favour the sex over the race.
With increasing tension in the Midwest, which drew the attention of the national press, Peréz noted that the white woman's reaction was 100% focused on the race.
Compared to the reactions of black women soon after the shooting on August 9, personal articles with titles such as "white-been reflection on Ferguson" or "Feminism is not just about the oppression of women" occurred relatively late.
According to Pearza, however, this represents an important change.
"I don't think there are many people in the feminist movement who talk about race and privilege at that level," she said.
People felt that they had to comment on what had happened.
It is characteristic of the crisis we face, because [the situation in Ferguson] is so racially reserved that they had to draw attention to it.
According to the professor of English at the University of Ohio, Koritha Mitchell brought to light the problems that African women have to face every day, which are not seen as "women's questions" in the cultural sphere.
"I can post funny stories about life with my partner on Facebook, and it's going to get 150 likes from people from all over the world," Mitchell said.
When I write something about the fact that the coloreds are trapped in their own country, it's a dafening silence.
"How is it possible for a woman to speak publicly about relationships, but not about security in the public space?" she asked.
For black women like Mitchell, who have addressed the issue of race, gender and sexuality in American history, there is no rine question and the sex of dichotomy.
The blacks, she said, could not have the luxury of sharing these problems clearly: they live in this mixed reality every day.
Although white women are now coined with the issue of race and gender in mainstream feminist circles, Angela Hattery, a female-speaking professor and gender studies at George Mason University, says their predecessors did the opposite.
Between 1865 and 1890, at least 10,000 blacks were lynched, and the reason was the rape of a white woman in almost all cases," Hattery said.
To justify the lynching, you needed the cooperation of a white woman.
According to Hattery, the split between white women and black women came when a campaign fighter like Susan B. Anthony explored the terrain at the end of the 19th century and realized that only one group of people - women or blacks - could have the right to vote.
"They decided to bet cards on women's voting rights and to focus on the right for blacks later," Hattery explained.
When we realize this, we get an important insight into why colored women don't trust white women.
We didn't do a good job.
We never helped black women to protect their husbands and children.
Even after women were given the right to vote in 1920, it took ten years to organize against lynching at the Southern Women's Association to Prepare Lynch.
The group was formed 40 years after the blacks first asked for help.
According to Mitchell, the surge in the white feminists' reactions to the questions that events in Ferguson have brought about - the question of police behavior, racial discrimination - reflects a time when white feminists had to "cover up" the questions that black women faced generations.
"Wouldn't it be great if the activists in these spaces of [the traditional feminism] took the right to raise a child as seriously as they took the right to contraception?" Mitchell surged.
The second wave of feminists to make a career fight for reproductive law and access to contraception are now investigating what that means.
Major feminist activists like Gloria Steinem took Facebook's attack two weeks after the shooting of Michael Brown, where they posted a Guardian column of Rebecca Carroll, which demanded that white Americans protest more aggressively against racism.
"I hope that women who have different but nevertheless similar reasons for understanding the danger in society - and the views on the race that differ significantly in the opinion polls - will seek change," Steinem wrote.
Although Steinem espouses inter-sectoral feminism, which includes both race and gender issues, her comments on the issue of race in America confuse some people.
American Enterprise Institute expert Christina Sommers, author of "Who Steals Feminism?," she told She She The People that young men in the United States, especially young colored men, are "much more vulnerable than their sisters," but Steinem's remarks by the Ferguson party have faced the criticism it has drawn up before.
We now have hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but almost none for boys.
But when the White House launched a small program, My Brother's Keeper, to help vulnerable young blacks and Hispanics, many feminists, including Gloria Steinem, provoked furious reactions.
The police's relationship with the black community is not the only problem that comes to the forefront of mainstream feminism.
After US border police detained nearly 63,60,000 unaccompanied teenagers in the southwest of the country this year, the issue of reform of immigration laws - this time a female issue - has reiterated the issue.
Andrea Mercad, co-chaeled We Belong Together, the organization mobilizing Women for the Reform of Immigration Laws, said that in order to raise the issue as a necessity for women, all she had to do was share the stories of immigrants.
"He speaks for himself," says Mercado.
With most work permits for men, women who come with them find themselves in a position to be vulnerable in terms of domestic violence and abuse.
"These stories are echoed by the women's organizations," she said.
The occupation of a pig in Ipswich for sale
The real estate agency removed the picture of the house for sale in Suffolk - when it was published, a pig was resting on it in the living room.
The one-bedroom single-handed house, which is for sale for £120,000, is on a private trip in Ipswich.
The information photos included a picture of the living room in which he rested with his head on the pig's sofa.
The Real Estate Office Connells said the pig in the photograph was a pet of the owners.
"The photo was there by mistake, and that's why it's already been removed," the office spokesman said.
In the property's information, the real estate agency, Connells, described the former prayer house as a "single standone one-bedroom house."
Although the office has already removed the photo from its website, it still appears in the promotional material.
The sale of the house sparked interest on social networks, where some asked whether the pig was included in the price.
After winning the lottery, the city of Harvey has a recent millionaire in the southwest
The lottery player in Harvey gets a million.
A search for a new millionaire in southeast Perth is underway, with one lucky man taking home $1.1 million from Saturday's lottery campaign.
The Harvey Traffic was lucky for the second time in five years, the last time it was a $1 million win in November 2009.
But the lucky winner has yet to sign up.
Store owner Steve Forward said the entire city in southwest Perth was talking about the win.
It's the main theme, and everyone is upset.
We thought a similar win was to the touch.
Eight winners in Western Australia split one win last month, completing a happy few weeks.
Last weekend, a player in Canning Vale became one of the five millionaires in August, and just weeks earlier, the couple had won a whopping $7.5 million in Belmont.
The winning couple had been betting for twenty years and said the prize would allow them to travel the world and buy a new house.
The millionaire of Harvey is the 59th lottery winner in Western Australia this year, winning a total of $85 million.
The Deutsche Bahn trains will not start in the evening.
Train drivers want higher wages
In a press release, GDL called the protest a cautionary strike for which he deliberately selected time outside of rush hour.
With the chosen time of the strike, GDL takes into account the many people who are returning to the rail from the weekend only on the first working day.
At the same time, we are also thinking of commuters during the day," the trade union said in a press release on Monday morning to announce the strike.
"Our first strike should be hit primarily by freight, less by passengers," the GDL said.
DB has yet to release an official response to the strike announcement.
Nor is it clear how the protest action will affect international railway connections, including with the Czech Republic.
The union is demanding a five per cent increase in train drivers' wages and a reduction in working time by two hours per week.
Currently, the average salary for train drivers varies between 36,000 and 46,000 euros (998,000 and 1.27 million crowns) a year, depending on the years worked.
Train drivers work 39 hours a week at DB.
DB refuses to accept pay rises in the event of a reduction in working hours.
They stress that the wage valuation of train drivers must be developed in the same way as for other railway personnel, for whom DB does not provide for a shortening of the working week.
Krest's car was in danger of catching fire.
That's why he quit the Barum rally
What exactly happened?
It was a material defect.
The car was brand new, so it didn't even occur to me that something like this would happen.
Could the exhaust not be repaired provisionally and continue at a slower pace to the service, where would the mechanics replace it?
If we'd just headed in, yes.
But there were two more stages ahead of us, and we couldn't.
There's a high temperature in it, and the risk of the car starting to burn was a big one.
I can't afford to do that.
At full pace, you've done five stages.
What was your impression of them?
Very good.
I felt like I was young.
We were fast, yet I didn't drive through the vint.
It was all caused by the fact that we had been piping the car for more than half a year to make it level.
The race showed that we did it.
You've run it so you could realistically be thinking of winning.
I prepared myself and the car so that we really had to win.
Work has not come to nothing.
On the other hand, the result we could have been thinking about did not materialize.
But it's Barumka.
Unfortunately, the technique said no.
You weren't the only one of the top guys who stepped down prematurely from the fight for the first place.
Foreign favorites Breen, Abbring or Lappi also dropped out.
Were you surprised that so many favorites resigned?
Yes.
It was a pity for the spectators, especially, because the race ended prematurely.
Jaromír Tarabus, to whom you are preparing a car, moved to the top.
But he paid the price to fly out of the track and take a nearly two-minute shortfall.
How satisfied were you with his performance?
It's a shame, because he could have repeated the podium.
He was running the first second time.
But even Mira confirmed that we had prepared the car well.
He was going very fast.
Exactly one year ago, you announced the end of your career, yet you appeared at the start of the Barum rally.
Can you feel good about the ride again to make a regular rally racer?
Certainly not at this moment.
I said last year that Barumka was my last race and I didn't keep it up anyway.
I decided to go it again.
It was my 19th start to start here, and if there's a chance again in a year, I think I'll go for it.
But I don't think about anything else.
A lot of people came to the track just for you.
Did you enjoy it?
To a certain extent, we started for them.
A lot of people, acquaintances or acquaintances, kept asking if I was going to go.
I wanted to make them happy.
What's next for you after Barumc?
The team continues on.
Next week we will go to Vyškov, where Robert Adolf will race.
I hope he didn't do much damage the car here.
In addition, he wants to borrow the Fabia of Honza Sýkora from us for this race.
Mira and I are in for a European double race in Switzerland and Corsica.
To do that, we'll have to get things ready for next year.
Can you give me a hint?
No, nothing's decided.
When the Rally of Corsica was in the World Championships, you reached your best in the series with fifth place.
Aren't you tempted to try out the tracks there again?
Not tempted.
An oral agreement with the employer may be a problem
Unfortunately, you did not have a sick leave certificate issued by the doctor, which serves as evidence for the organization that you cannot perform workke ways for medical reasons.
Moreover, you did not immediately notify the employer of the absence.
There was then an agreement to register the days as a holiday, but the agreement was only taken orally.
Although the Labour Code does not require it to have the employer's consent to take leave in writing, in practice this has worked well.
If there is only an oral agreement, you do not have a confirmation agreement.
Later, the alleged consent to the take-off of leave, as in your case, can be denied and absent from the job considered to be a long-term unexcused absence, therefore a reason for the immediate termination of employment under Section 53 of the Labour Code.
In the event of a lawsuit over an appointment with your employer, you lack demonstrable evidence.
However, the employment relationship with you was not cancelled under § 53, only the days given are given in the credit note as an unexcused absence.
The unexcused absence from the credit note does not have the same consequences as Section 53 (e.g. the impossibility of receiving material unemployment security), yet the possibility of seeking a new job is made more difficult.
We recommend you to see your doctor again and have you confirmed in writing that there was indeed an accident that left you unable to work (this is not a so-called "incompetition" documented by the doctor).
When looking for a new job, you can present the document and explain the situation.
In practice, it is advisable not to underestimate both the issue of a written medical certificate of incapacity for work and an early notification to the employer or to request written consent to take leave.
You avoid any complications.
Tony Stewart's accident on his return to the track
The return to the track ended for Tony Stewart just a short distance behind the Atlanta Motor Speedway race.
Stewart hit the boards for the second time after his right front tyre blew up in the 172nd lap, and the race was over for him.
Stewart drove the wrecked car into the garage, did not comment on the reporters, and left.
His team's chief executive, Chad Johnston, said the No. 14 is disappointed, but will now concentrate on the race in Richmond, Virginia, which will take place next weekend.
"I want us to have a better performance and a better finish," Johnston said.
We'll go to Richmond and hope we do better there.
Stewart crashed into the fence for the first time in Sunday's evening race after a collision with Kyle Busch, which required the right side of his car to be repaired.
"We had hopes of a good finish in today's race," Johnston said, adding, "It just didn't work out."
Not long after the second crash, Stewart's car was loaded and the team packed and ready to leave.
After hitting and killing another driver at the race in New York, Stewart missed three NASCAR Sprint Cup races.
He decided to return this weekend and needed to win either the race in Atlanta or the next race in Richmond to catch up with the spot in the table.
He returned to racing during an investigation into the tragic accident that left 20-year-old Kevin Ward Jr., who drove Stewart into his path during the race.
Authorities said the investigation into the cause of the accident would take at least another two weeks.
It has not yet been decided whether Stewart will face any charges.
The three-time champion got warm cheers before the race.
Stewart started in 12th place, worked his way to the 10th at the start of the race and then even to the 4th.
Then, at the start of the 122nd round, with Busch's No.
18 got out of control, came out of the second corner and crashed into Stewart, sending both cars to the fence.
Stewart continued, but withdrew to 21st.
Prague to select new taxi station administrator, earns 12.3 million
Prague has completed tenders for new taxi service post administrator.
It will receive around CZK 12.3 million for 103 parking spaces annually.
Until recently, it collected CZK 150,000 annually for the same driver's taxi drivers for the same seats.
This was reported by Councillor Lukáš Manhart (TOP 09).
Previously, the city used draws to select administrators.
The winner then received a lease for a flat fee of CZK 1,000 per year.
But the rules have changed.
The level of the offer currently decides.
"A year from the termination of the original lease agreements and the initiation of tenders, the new rental system has been shown to be far more advantageous for Prague and, overall, fairer," the councillor says.
The most expensive spot is on Perštýn
The highest price was offered by those interested in the post in Na Perštýně Street.
They pay CZK 2.1 million annually.
Approximately CZK 1.5 million were paid by the new administrators for seats in front of the Municipal House or on Wenceslas Square.
The new rules for the lease of taxis were adopted by councillors in the autumn of 2012 and were terminated by the original lease agreements in the summer of last year.
The selection procedures were held in four waves and the new administrator found 29 stations.
For the second time this year, we had to clean the well.
We released it all each time, creating a practically second pond around the cottage.
Then we poured the Savo in.
Unbelievable smell!
Our well in the cellar always provided plenty of beautiful fragrant water.
And she wasn't very expert at that, Grandpa scooped it out on his own.
Long ago.
She was just on three scrubs and generally quirky, as was everything in the cottage, but, as I say.
The water was great.
Until this year.
When we started the season, of course we exhausted the water.
When she stood there for a number of months, she deserved it.
But even then, it seemed to us that the water didn't smell.
We wondered if something had fallen in.
In the place where the pump passed, it was possible with a bit of bad luck, there was not quite a stretch of sound, so the hole was sewn by a piece of brick.
Our inspection confirmed that the brick was moving.
Otherwise, you couldn't see anything in the water, and we shone through it to the bottom.
So we released it again and cleaned it.
Of course, we upgraded the improvised seal around the pump pipe.
In the cellar, we noticed but strange things.
There was a sticky package on the ground with some bones.
At least that's what it looked like.
And one step away, another.
Now it looked like a drewn-on mouse.
At the ceiling, in places where there are vents, Grandpa's invention, there were leftover fish!
And hard to ride!
Our basement is quirky, too.
Some would say Grandpa just scratched the cottage.
And he would not be so far from the truth.
The walls and the floor are only packed with sand, only the ceiling is undergrown.
It's mostly the boats.
And wheels.
And deck chairs for the beach.
The gates with wide gaps were mostly open, as someone went there all the time.
At the ceiling, several of the aforementioned vents.
No netting, so birds routinely float and nests on their rafters.
It is pointless to mention mice.
Grandpa wanted it to be flogged, and it did.
Now, of course, the luft didn't help.
The whole cellar stank.
So we cleaned the whole cellar.
Especially the fish on the beam was nutritious!
We threw out the things that were around: boards, heckle, and so on.
Our cottage at a distance greeted passers-by with a disinfectant odor.
We were wondering who could have brought the disgusting remnants to us?
The nearest cat lives two kilometres from here in the village.
She'd have a hard time coming to us to snack.
Grandpa was attacked by a neighbor who's not quite right.
Did he, the Franta, didn't he swap the nastiness in the vent?
He's practically been here all year round, stupid ideas, he's the one.
We decided to keep an eye on the cellar and the well and check it regularly.
After a few days, everything was fine.
We started using the water again, so far just for washing and washing, before the tests are ready, but it was already good.
Dragging water from the forest well is nothing I've wanted to do for a long time.
We once heard the terrible anxious barking of our bitch.
Mom looked out of the balcony and saw a long, thick black hose in the grass next to the porch.
Réza bounced over her and squeezed like a fool.
Her mother scolded her because she thought Réza had dug out the sink hose from the sink.
Suddenly, however, the hose was partially rolled into the ball and partially straightened up.
The balcony was hissed.
Réza had a hysterical fit.
We ran downstairs.
The snake, well over a metre long and as fat as a bull, was about to swallow a huge toad, and Réza prevented it from doing so.
It was unclear if she wanted to save the toad, or if she wanted to eat it herself, but that was irrelevant.
When the snake saw the outnumber in the form of our entire family, you probably told myself to eat it when we're so hungry, and stretched gracefully through the vent to the basement.
We flew after her.
Like a bolt of lightning, she jumped behind the well.
By the way, we've recorded another stinking package on her record.
The smell is probably a fish.
The day before yesterday, she wasn't there!
Our new security around the pump was a bit of a scourge.
And we locked the basement in the day.
That he would...
We went out and there we went to one of the vents.
We didn't wait long.
It ruminated behind the well.
First there was a flat head with yellow moons on his neck.
Then the whole snake rose to the well.
She wrapped around the pump and began to break in.
The fired employee retaliated, bought laptops for the company and sold them
The jilted employee, after being released, purchased computers from the company and then sold them.
He managed to spend the money he raised before being detained by the police.
In a short time, the man had purchased a total of sixteen computers for more than two hundred thousand crowns in twelve cases.
"He took the notebooky to Olomouc after the takeover, where he sold them in the bazaars," said the head commissioner of the Šumperk police, Rostislav Brückner.
The motive for the fraud was revenge on the employer for dismissal, as well as the profit of the money.
"In the interrogation, he told us that he had used the money to repay the loans," Brückner said.
Police also found that the impostor was a pathological gambler who had been repeatedly treated in a psychiatric ward.
The money could also end up in slot machines or video lottery terminals.
"The fact is, we didn't find any money with him," the commissioner said.
The fraudster, who has already been convicted of theft once, now faces a prison term of one to five years.
Officers have yet to say whether the punishment is also facing a penalty for the bazaars, which have bought undirected laptops and continued to sell them.
"It is true that they were taking over brand new goods, which is at least suspicious," the commissioner stated.
None of the bazaar's owners have yet been charged.
Come, a little more, you'll do it or how I enjoyed We Run Prague
This year, the organizers have prepared several changes for us.
The biggest one was the change of route, which brought the destination to the float, rather than leading back to the Yellow Spa.
I was looking forward to the race with the rest of the Rungo.cz team, but I was going to live it a bit from the other side.
With the whole team, we decided to personally greet our readers at the booth, where we took pictures and made videos together.
To perfect my view from the other side, I took on the role of a personal conductor.
Together with our friend Katya, we obediently joined the end of the corridor for 60 to 70 minutes just before the start.
We greeted our friends, who were passing by us to the sector for faster runners.
There wasn't much time left.
A few sidekicks to warm up, turn on the sports testers, countdown and start!
Shouts of cheers, but instead of a quick start, the scurrying to the starting line followed.
After five minutes we walk to the gate, turn on the measurements and break off at a pace of ten.
Weave with the yellow snake of runners, who, like Katya, run their first race.
So far, everyone looks fresh, with the slowly descending sun in the sky giving the view of Vyšehrad an almost kitsch-shaped tinge.
The pearning mass stretching along the waterfront looks as if the whole of Prague is running here.
Traditionally, on the waterfront between Vyšehrad and the National Theatre, it is traditionally beginning to show who has how many strengths.
A light hill in Palacký Square forces many runners to slow down or go to their walk.
Just before the run-up to the Theatre I see a police escort and right behind him Vítek Pavlišta flies to the finish line at an incredible pace.
I hear the admiring fuzzi of other runners' sighs.
I'm moving to the edge of the track, cheering him on, he's going to slap me, but just before that, my leg gets sprained and our hands just miss each other.
With the Story Street, it gives a chance for a short rest and breathing.
It is needed, there are places ahead of us where the views will take my breath out.
A turn on the Mánes Bridge shows Prague in the whole beauty of the setting sun.
I'm not breathing and my legs are almost carrying me alone.
Behind the first refreshment, there is a moment of truth.
As the road runs over, Katya stumbles against the curb and performs a leap in a swim.
I'm looking to see if she needs help, and I'm running a series of encouraging words to keep her from having time to think about the pain.
It rises and we continue with Goat's Lane, it's one of the narrowest places of the track, there's no such rush at this stage of the race, but it's still a good look for the surroundings.
I have no idea yet that the term of the narrowest place will gain its true meaning later.
Beyond the Powder Gate, we are frenetically encouraged by the tourists and friends of the other runners.
I try to claví myself with anyone who offers a hand, and I advise Kata, because ten clap with fans is like half an energy bar.
It really works, we are speeding up again and although we have fallen quite significantly, now the pursuit has started.
We're getting dozens of runners, passing someone particularly tired, trying to cheer them up with a few words: "Come on, a little more, you'll do it!"
After the last refreshment room, no one is overtaking us, we are speeding up.
So far we've run for an hour and a quarter, we're adding, there's nothing to wait for.
Three kilometres to the finish will hurt, but you need to really work.
The sun has already set and the end of the day is symbolically shutting down the race.
The last run to the bridge, the turn and just the straight to the finish.
The pace we're running at amazes me, where does that come from in that girl?
"Come on, we'll go under the hour for thirteen, we're working!" I call.
We're trying, we're sprinting, and there's a goal.
An hour, thirteen and six seconds.
Well, what can I do?
The coach entered the limit for an hour of twenty.
So seven minutes to plan.
Which is a great result.
Just behind the goal, Kata's legs are buckled, helping her to the railing, where she rests for a while.
You can see the exhaustion, but also the luck of a well-done performance.
After a while, I slowly lead her out of the target area.
Euphoria doesn't give us thinking of the crush in the passageways to the dressing rooms.
You can see here that Goat's Lane wasn't the narrowest of place.
That's where the float is behind the goal, which is packed to the snap on the onslaught of nearly ten thousand runners.
If someone doesn't like crowds, it's not a place for them.
After a while, I too am losing my head and wondering if the gorgeous views and the more interesting route compared to previous years was worth what was happening at the finish.
I know from my own experience that hosting a race is no joke.
If it is added to ten thousand people, a rich accompanying programme and the closure of the entire centre of Prague for all transport, it is a huge challenge.
This year's route change showed runners many interesting places, but it also brought some really unpleasant surprises.
The excellent atmosphere piled up in the Yellow Spa was carried between the runners and in the race itself.
The organizers around the track and the casual spectators stepped up it on every metro of the track.
Unfortunately, during the city's run through the historic centre, obstacles must be taken into account, which cannot be removed, but I do not consider the target of the mass plant in the place, which is bounded by a wall on one side and on the other by the river.
If I tell myself that the race ended with a finish, I rate it as very hilarious.
Behind the goal I was a little worried about the health of those involved, but in the end everything turned out well.
Write to us in the discussion if you liked the route and what do you say about the situation at the finish line.
Prison guards in Bulgaria to organize protests
Hundreds of prison staff across Bulgaria attended a national protest rally before the Ministry of Justice in the capital Sofia.
At a peaceful demonstration, they reiterated their request to reintroduce the original working conditions, which have recently changed.
The list of requirements to be discussed with the interim Justice Minister Hristo Ivanov also includes higher salaries.
Peacekeepers symbolically protested against the new hours of business for a month, demanding a return to the original 24-hour shifts.
Although the union of the prison guards and representatives of the Ministry of Justice met, they did not agree, the Bulgarian State Radio (BNR) reported.
"Negotiations are still ongoing," said the head of the General Directorate of Prison, Rosen Zhelyazkov, at the BNR.
Protests by prison staff are also expected to be joined by members of the Federation of Employees' Trade Unions at the Ministry of the Interior.
Why the universe can be of more size and we can't see them
Physicists don't usually write bestsellers, but Brian Green of Columbia University hit the jackpot in 1999.
His book The Elegant Universe became the most accessible way for laymen to penetrate the thicket of problems that a number of theoretical physicists today discusses - to unify two superbly functioning but mutually incompatible discoveries of the 20th century: quantum theory and the theory of general relativity.
One of the causes of the success of the Elegant Universe is undoubtedly that the search for a unified physical theory is not a boring story.
Physicists have solved the basic problem between two key theories (after all, our universe is de facto divided into two worlds with different laws) was solved and solved so imaginatively that it stands by it for retelling even to the layoffs.
Moreover, Greene had dealt with the complex material so freshly and engagingly that he could not be blamed for how much of an interesting thing he did not include in his book.
In addition, he made up for the most part of his "mistake" in the next two books: the Structure of the Universe and Hidden Reality.
Apparently, even the author would not object to his book becoming obsolete more quickly, but the fact is that, even after 15 years, the Elegant Universe still provides almost everything essential that an informed layman with the ambition to understand the world to know about this important part of theoretical physics.
It is quite likely that in the coming years it will be a bit more vivid in this area after all (for example, because the LHC accelerator will finally go on a "full-gas"), and so it is a good time to enter Green's non-violently open door of the world of modern physics.
How many dimensions can our universe have?
The idea that our universe may have more than three spatial dimensions may sound foolish, fantastic, strange or mystical.
Yet it is concrete and completely acceptable.
To understand this, let us for a moment turn our eyes from the universe from the universe as a whole to something of a more mundane, specifically to a long and thin, watering hockey.
Imagine dragging a 100-meter garden hose from one side of the canyon to the other and watching the entire scenery from a half-kilometre distance (as in the picture and on the following page).
From such a distance you can easily detect a long stretched hose in a horizontal direction, but if you are not suffering from the sharpness of the sharpness, the thickness of the hose is hardly a clearer.
Given your great distance from the hose, you'd think that an ant forced to live on a hose has only one dimension to walk in: a left-right dimension along the hose.
When someone asks you where the ant was at any given moment, you answer with just one particular indication: the distance of the antex from the left (or right) end of the hose.
All we want to say is that from a half-kilometre distance, a long piece of hose looks like a one-dimensional object.
In the real world, the hose has a thickness.
If we enlarge everything, we suddenly see a second dimension - a widening hose in the shape of a circle.
In such an enlarged view, it is clear that the ant can actually move in two independent dimensions: in an already well-known left-right dimension along the length of the hose, but also in "dire between/agranie/agreement-moving clockwise" around the circular cut-off of the hose.
You begin to understand that you must enter two numbers to determine the position of the small anteat: how far is the hose is from the end of the hose and where the hose is fanning on the circle.
This reflects the fact that the surface of the hose is two-dimensional (recommended. Experts will notice that this chapter focuses purely on the disorder theory of strings.
Non-protection aspects are discussed in the 12th and 13th chapters.
The hose surface is two-dimensional: one longitudinal dimension is shown by a straight arrow, a dimension in the direction of the circumference, marked with a circular arrow, is short and coiled.
There is, however, a clear difference between the two dimensions.
The size along the hose is long and easy to see.
The dimension-encrying circuit of the hose is short, "worth-growth" and less noticeable.
To be aware of the existence of a circular dimension, we had to examine the hose with a significantly better resolution.
The example in question illustrates an important property of spatial dimensions.
That they are divided into two groups.
They can be either large, large and therefore directly visible, or, conversely, small, coiled and much less observable.
Of course, in that case, we didn't exactly pretend to reveal the "wine" dimension of the hose's faded thickness.
All you had to do was take the binoculars to help.
But if the hose were thinner - like a hair or a capillary - we would only have detected the coiled dimension with great effort.
Kaluza sent his article to Einstein in 1919 in which he drew the astonishing thought that the spatial geometry of the universe might have more than three known dimensions to all of us.
Kaluza justified his radical assertions on the grounds that the additional dimension provided an elegant and convincing framework in which Einstein's general relativity and Maxwell's electromagnetic theory could be woven into a single, unified conceptual structure.
Immediately asked how this observation of Kaluza goes together with the obvious fact that we see just three dimensions of the space.
The response Kaluza quietly assumed between the lines and which was clearly stated and clarified by the Swedish mathematician Oskar Klein in 1926 stands and falls, claiming that the spatial geometry of our universe may have both large and coiled dimensions.
This means that, as well as dimensions in the direction of the length of the hose, our universe has a large, vast and slightly visible three dimensions, the existence of which we are aware of at any moment.
But, by analogy with the circular circumference of the garden hose, the universe may have additional dimensions, tightly coiled into a space so tiny that they have so far remained hidden from our most sophisticated experimental apparatus.
To get a clearer picture of the nature of Kaluza's remarkable design, let's stick with the hose for a while.
Imagine drawing a fairly dense number of circles on the circumference of the hose with a black color.
From the stand, the hose still looks like a thin, one-dimensional line.
With the telescope, thanks to the drawing, we will now reveal the coiled dimension even more easily, because we will see the theme from Figure 2.
We can clearly see that the surface of the hose is two-dimensional, with one dimension large and almost unlimited and with the other short and circular.
Kaluza and Klein came up with the idea that our universe has a similar structure, but apart from one small circular dimension it has three large spatial dimensions, a combined four-dimensional dimension.
It is difficult to draw an object with too many dimensions.
To help our imagination a little, let's note the illustration on the picture.3; it shows two large dimensions and one small circular dimension.
In the picture, we magnify the view of the geometry of the space in the same way that we magnified the surface of the hose.
Each subsequent level represents a huge increase in the geometry of space from the level of the previous one.
Our universe may have additional dimensions (we see them at the fourth level of magnification) if they are coined to a small enough space; we explain not to observe them directly yet.
The square net depicts the commonly known "large" dimensions, while the circle is a new, tiny and coiled dimension.
Just like loops of thread in a densely woven carpet, these circles also exist in each place of the usual size - we just drew them into the intersect in the square network for the sake of clarity.
The background of Figure 4 shows the commonly known space structure - the ordinary world around us - in such common scales as meters, viewed by the side of a small square in a square network.
In each of the following images, we focus on a small range of the picture beforehand; we will enlarge it to become visible.
At first, nothing special is happening, as we see at the first levels of magnification.
However, when we advance on our journey to the microscopic properties of the space's geometry further - to the fourth level of magnification in Figure 3 - we suddenly see a new, shaped circle of coiled dimension, similar to the loops of a thread in a densely woven piece of carpet.
Kaluza and Klein came up with the idea that the additional circular dimension exists in each place in the direction of the large dimensions, in the same way that the hose has a circular circumference at each point in its length.
For the sake of illustration, we drew the circular dimension only in some of the regularly spaced points.
Figure 4 Kaluza and Klein's image of the microscopic structure of the space's geometry is summarized.
The similarity to the hose is obvious, although we also see important differences.
First, the universe has three large, far-distorting spatial dimensions (of which we drew only two), whereas the hose has only one large dimension.
The more important difference is that we are now talking about the spatial geometry of the universe itself, not just an object within the universe, like our hose.
But the basic idea is the same.
If the additional circular coiled dimension is extremely miniature, recognizing it - like the circular circumference of the hose - is much heavier than observing the obvious, large and vast dimensions.
If the size of the additional dimension is small enough, it will actually be detected beyond the strength of our state-of-the-art augmentation tools.
But the most important thing is that the additional dimension is not merely a rounded bump inside of normal proportions, as the two-dimensional illustration mistakenly suggests.
The circular dimension is a new dimension that exists at each point of three common large dimensions.
It is a dimension on the other three dimensions independent as the dimensions of the top-down, from the left-right and from the front-to-back independent (and perpendicular) to each other.
A rather small ante could move in all four dimensions, and we would need four data to determine its position, in addition to the usual three, a position in the circular dimension; if you count the time, the data five, in any case one more than we would normally expect.
Are you interested?
You can buy the book of Brian Greeen's Elegant Universe at the book.idnes.cz.
The price for the e-book is 149,- CZK.
To our surprise, then, we find that, while we are aware of the existence of only three dimensions of space, Kaluzo's and Klein's thinking shows that this does not preclude the existence of additional coiled proportions, if they are small enough.
The universe may well have more dimensions than we can see with the naked eye.
How small should they be?
The most modern technical equipment can recognize the structures of the large billionth of the billionth of the meter.
Smaller coiled dimensions can hardly be seen.
In 1926, Klein combined with Kaluza's original idea with several ideas from the emerging quantum mechanics.
His calculations indicated that the additional circular dimension could be in size of approximately one Planck length, a size far beyond the distinctive capability of today's devices.
Since then, physicists have called the possibility of additional small spatial dimensions Kaluza-Klein theorial.
Wohnout Honza Homola advises on how to practice on electric guitar: episode 5
The whole essence of the "twelve" lies in a 12-act harmonic form, which you can freely repeat.
Those who groped in music theory will find its principle detailed here.
Jan Homola, or Honza Homolka Tobolka (1976)
By educating the puppeteer and puppeteer, whose Facebook profile can be tracked here, has made his living as a graphic artist since graduation twenty years ago.
He is the guitarist of the band Wohnout, from which, unfortunately, you can't leave.
The guitarist is the father, as is Brother Matej, the leader of the Wohnouts.
Start coaching on one string.
"The rhythmic model is up to you, you can invent anything, just apply it to a harmonic model of the 12," says Honza.
If you add another string, you can change the figure again.
Just listen to it and watch Honza, what can be thought to devise with the 12-horse harmony on two strings and how pretty it is starting to sound.
If you bring the third string, you can already flirt with the melody of a song.
When you finally add a fourth, beware of the change in the tuning, Honza points out in the video.
Next time, Honza will return to the pentatonice and try to put it together with the twelfth.
So practice it honestly.
As best you can read in an interview with Jan Homola at the first lesson of his school's play on electric guitar here.
Another goal without waiting?
It's not for a big celebration, acknowledges Hradec Dvořák
We take the point and we are happy for it.
The first half we had more chances, the second the home side," said the striker, who scored from the penalty spot this time.
Weren't you nervous about his mess, was he accompanied by a huge whistle?
I didn't particularly notice it, although it would have been worse for the second goal, where the home fans are.
You equalised with the penalty after half an hour, but you also scored from the penalty spot after less than four minutes.
What happened?
We overslept the start, we were passive, it was a corner that came from and then a penalty.
After that, you got up and the first half you were the better team with more chances.
Why did that change after the break?
Hard to say.
I agree that we played well after the goal scored a goal well.
In the booth we said we wanted to keep the pace of the game after it, but we couldn't do it.
To tell you the truth, I can't even explain why.
But it is probably also true that the home side said something about their game at the break, they probably weren't very happy with it.
You only scored for the first time on the pitch of the opponent, while at home you might not have scored a goal.
Why is it so different?
I wouldn't say it makes that much difference, it's up to us to deal with it.
We started well in Brno, but then it was bad for us, Plzeň, that's a different category.
Four games you waited for a goal, weren't you worried that it could be similar after the last game?
Not really, but of course we are glad that since the last game we don't have to listen to talk about waiting for a goal.
Now we've added more without waiting, but there's still only three in six games, which is not yet the big celebration.
Iceland - lava comes from a kilometer away crater.
Lava flying out into the surface in the Holuhraun area, near the Vatnajökull glacier, flows through an underground tunnel from a kilometer away in a crater.
It is located under the glacier, as is part of the aforementioned underground lava tunnel.
This fact now worries scientists the most...
The situation remains unchanged for the time being.
Since yesterday morning (318.
2014) still fowls from the fissure of approximately the same amount of lava.
However, compared to the original estimates, its amount is lower, not 1000 m3, but "only" 300-400 m3.
Compared to the previous eruption from 29.8.
2014 is up to 50 times larger.
However, scientists fear that the lava tunnel could also be opened in places where it is found under the ice.
If it did, with a similar intensity to the current eruption, it would be a huge flooding, both on the Jökulsá á Fjöllum river and on other rivers.
There is a strong smell of sulphur in the vicinity of the eruption, clouds of steam and gases rise from the crack.
It is certainly not an eruption suitable for tourism, as was the case with the Fimmvörðuháls eruption in 2010.
This is much bigger and there are also many more gases," says volcanologist Ármann Höskuldsson.
However, the weather has improved considerably since yesterday, with almost nofter calm in the area in the morning.
The traces of the sandstorm were washed with rain.
Scientists can continue their work.
For air traffic, the orange stage (second highest) applies to Bárðarbungu and yellow (third) for Askja.
The sky above Cheb was the brave Lady Peggy.
She walked the flanks
Aerial Day in Cheb.
The Boeing Stearman PT-17 was introduced to the aircraft acrobatka Peggy Walentin, who climbed out of the cockpit to the trapeze on the upper wing of the biplane on the upper wing of the biplane, as well as between the wings.
There it is confined to the strength of the muscles.
The aerial day in Cheb was held for the fifth time this year and the organizers again managed to prepare some interesting aerial bits.
The premiere at the oldest Czech airport was not only "walked on the wings" by the German acrobat Peggy Walentin, but also the legendary P-51 D Mustang fighter or the Beechcraft 18.
He drew attention to himself with his shining cover.
The acrobatics called Wingwalking originated in the US.
After World War I, many former war pilots were thus trying to assert themselves.
But because of the large number of fatalities, it was forbidden.
Today, however, he is slowly returning to the air days program.
Peggy climbs out of the cockpit to the top wing after takeoff.
There he performs various exercises.
Towards the end of the performance, it will move into the space between the wings of the aircraft, where her show continues," described Luděk Matějíček from the Cheb Ultralight Club and the organizer of the air day.
The pilot of the Boeing Stearman 75 E aircraft is her husband Friedrich.
If Peggy's performance was the main highlight of the program, then the next performance of the Mustang fighter was a famous icing on the cake.
The legendary fighter rushed to the area with the Grippen of the Army of the Czech Republic in tow (so-called numbers).
Such a line-up could be seen by aviation fans in the Czech Republic for the first time.
The pilot Miroslav Sázavský then demonstrated to everyone the breathtaking acrobatics with the aircraft from 1945.
It was made during the war, but he probably never participated in it.
He was listed in the army reserves.
From 1963 he worked in the civil sphere.
Even as a racing aircraft.
Today he has his home hangar at the airport in Munich Hradiste.
There is also another pearl of Cheb's Air Day, the twin-engined Beechcraft C45H Expeditor.
The airport did not miss the massive machine.
His polished aluminum cover glowed in the distance.
The Max Holste MH 1521M Broussard, in the colours of the French Air Force, also gained an aristocracy.
The small airliner was taken aback by the rendecessed Turbolet and brought part of the German delegation from Hof, Germany, for an air day.
German neighbors in Cheb performed with the renovated aircraft of the Yak, as well as the three-man formation of Bücker Jungmann biplanes.
Lucie Borhy: A dramatic return to the camera!
Parental worries were traded by Lucie Borhy at least for the work-related ones tonight.
Stress or nervousness - the blonde presenter evidently doesn't know any of this.
The TV news showcase was going well, as if she hadn't stopped with him for two months!
It's only been two weeks since the blonde's six-week-old ended, in which women experience the most stress after giving birth.
Lucie, however, will not be shown regularly in the main news bulletin of TV Nova.
She will not be a regular return for a month, according to news server Blesk.cz.
After all, her daughter Linda now needs her more than the TV audience.
Lucie Borhy returned to the TV screen and it was a hit.
Exhibition for a year in Prague?
The hall would sell out, plans Jagr's farewell
It would be dignified if something like this was done during the World Cup.
But it depends on how the union goes about it," he said in Jihlava after an exhibition called the Golden Match, in which the stunning Nagano team met again.
Even the players who participated in the golden hat-trick.
Players would like to have a taste, wouldn't they?
For sure.
It would simply be a good idea to do a farewell to the golden generation during the Championships.
I think you can find one or two days during the tournament when it's a full day off and where you can mix such a match.
We'll tell Gum (Jiri Šlégrovi) or Yogi Shcherbane (organizer of the Jihlava match) who would take charge of it...
The arena would sell out.
But what if you play the New Jersey playoffs?
Well, if I come in...
You don't want to play in the national team.
Or did the Jihlava meeting alter your decision?
Representation and exhibition matches are two different things and performances are crucial in the national team.
It's one thing for people to like to see me there, but the performances are crucial, especially at the World Cup.
There should be players who have it, and not because they have a good name.
My decision has not changed.
How did you enjoy the Nagano reunion, anyway?
The meeting with the players alone was great.
You've brought up stories and have had a lot of fun.
It was a great experience not only for the fans, but also for us hockey players.
Most importantly, however, was a tribute to Ivan Hlinka.
And it's good to be reminded of the history of our hockey and that is that one generation is leaving that was really worth it.
Slavomír Lener, Vladimír Růžička and Petr Čechmánek on the bench.
Do you still remember your first representative match?
You don't forget that stuff.
It was against the Calgary Flames and the three youngsters: I, Robert Holík and Robert Reichel, came on in one three.
It was the first representative start for everyone.
But that we would have dominated in some way, that's impossible to say.
In Jihlava, Dominik Hašek was catching for a long time.
What did you say about his performance?
Hashan will never surprise me on the ice.
I wanted to give it back to him with the criticism, but I can't (Hasek criticized Jagr for the reasons he decided to quit the national team).He just played very well.
Even Hnilička performed brilliantly.
He was trained with me one night, and there was a doom.
And now he was catching famously.
First the USA and then the Netherlands, the Socceroos start qualifying
The Smichov NH Hotel was visited by prominent guests on Monday morning.
People could see, for example, goalkeeper Petr Cech from Chelsea, the national coach Pavel Vrba...
And there, the figure in the black baseball cap, that's Tomas Rosicky!
The Arsenal midfielder and the captain of the national team arrived at the meeting around 11:30 p.m.
We have a lovely match against the Netherlands.
Who wouldn't be looking forward to it?" said when he had already appeared before the press in the representative set.
Programme of the Czech national team
Monday, 1st September: start of the reunion, first training session
Tuesday, 2 September: Training open to fans (18:30, Letná) Autographed (20:00)
Wednesday 3 September Czech Republic - USA (20:15, Letná)
Tuesday 9th September Czech Republic - Netherlands (20:45, Letná) end of reunion
Rosicky and Co. can be supported by fans before Wednesday's game against the USA (20:15).
The team opened for them for Tuesday's training, which starts at 18:30 at Letná.
And it will be followed by an autograph session, at which neither Rosický nor the Czech will miss.
Otherwise, of course, this national team reunion will be quieter.
Which is praised by coach Vrba, who just complained about the number of social events in the spring.
Finally, we will focus on what we want to do.
Now we're going to focus on the Netherlands.
It's an advantage when you have a player together for eight days.
We will have time to rehearse things that there has not been so much time for so far," said Vrba, who has officially led the national team since January.
The Czech national football team will be accompanied by a Musketeer image when entering the new qualifying cycle.
The team has three matches under Willow, all the preliminary.
She drew with Norway and Finland 2-2 and lost 1-2 to Austria.
However, these results have not yet been important.
That's now.
The match with the Netherlands will kick off the qualification for the 2016 European Championships.
Of course, it would help the Czech team to handle the dress rehearsal against the USA.
The first six months were to be seen.
The results are important now.
We have to think about being successful," Willow agreed.
The only player in the 23-man nomination to have health problems is forward David Lafata.
He's worried about the temperature.
Should he fail to recover in Wednesday's match against the USA, coach Vrba would have called in one more striker.
Genetic disorders are often misdiagnosed
A woman from Britain describes how, after a bad diagnosis, she thought she would die for many years.
After being diagnosed with another disease, Karin Rodgers spent most of her adolescence thinking she only had a few years to live.
In fact, it was Charcot-Marie-Tooth Syndrome (CMT) - a group of hereditary disorders that damage the nerves outside the brain and spine.
The charity CMT UK said that a bad diagnosis is a common problem among people with CMT, because very little is known about the disease.
It is believed that around 23,000 people in the UK suffer from CMT, which can manifest symptoms in motoring such as muscle weakness, clumsy walking and twisted toes.
Insensitivity or pain may also occur in the afflicted, the condition is untreatable and progressive, which means that the symptoms deteriorate over time.
When Rodgers was thirteen, she thought she was suffering from Freidreich ataxia (FA) - a condition that had a very poor prognosis.
She believed that by the time she celebrated her eighteenth birthday, she would be confined to a wheelchair, and dead before she was thirty.
The mother-of-two, who is now 51, says, "As a child, I knew I couldn't do the same things as the others.
I fell every day and it took me longer.
I could never ride roller skates or skateboards with the other children, and I was bullied at school about the way I used to walk and run."
When Rodgers was thirteen, and after several surgeries to release her Achilles' tendons and straighten her feet, she took advantage of her doctor's leave of the room and looked into her documentation, where she learned that she was suffering from the FA.
"I felt guilty because I was stalking, so I didn't tell anyone, but when I got home, I looked up information about the disease in the library and wrote to the FA Association," she says.
When they answered me, I was in shock, I totally panicked.
I thought I'd end up in a wheelchair by the time I was 18, and by the time I was twenty-five, I'd be dead, and in the meantime, I'd gradually lose all my powers.
I was on my own and I was planning a funeral."
When she was seventeen, she realized that her gait's ability had not deteriorated as much as she had assumed, and asked her surgeon.
He just got up, hugged her, and said, "Golden, I don't think you've got the disease, or you'd be in a wheelchair.
I think it's something a lot less life-threatening."
After passing several genetic tests, it was found to have a CMT.
"When he explained to me what the CMT was, I thought I was a lucky child," she said.
The charity CMT UK launched a month of informing the CMT to draw attention to the disease.
Entrepreneurs in Washington: with economic turnaround rising taxes
The growing economy means more customers, higher sales and new jobs.
And higher taxes, too.
According to a new survey published last week, state and local corporate taxation in the country increased slightly last year, with the resurgence of the economy accelerating, and companies in Washington were no exception.
Entrepreneurs in Maryland and Virginia, collectively, diverted $27.6 billion to the 2013 fiscal year for the 2013 fiscal year to the Treasury and the local coffers, up 3.8% higher than the $26.6 billion collected in 2012.
The tax burden - both state and local - rose by 4.3% to $671 billion last year, compared to 3.9% last year, and was the third consecutive year in a row in 2009 and 2010, when taxes were falling.
According to a study conducted by the professional firm Ernst & Young and the political grouping Center on State Taxation, state taxes increased faster, by 4.3% than local levies, by 3.9%.
More than half of the district's tax revenue, 56%, is on a business tax, and 36% of Maryland's income is from a company.
Virginia, at 28%, shows the smallest tax revenue from business in proportion.
Researchers argue that the majority share of tax revenue growth comes from an increase in the value of properties belonging to firms, which increased property taxes by 3.7% this year after three consecutive years with a rise of -1%.
Although most of the profits come from the big states like California, New York and Texas, the situation seems to be the same in Washington.
Companies in D.C., Maryland and Vriginia last year paid over $10 billion in real estate and local property taxes, an annual increase of 4.2% compared to $9.6 billion in 2012.
However, the apparent increase in the value of real estate does not drive up the state and local tax revenues in Maryland, where the property tax represents less than a fifth of the company's taxation.
For companies in Virginia and D.C., the property tax represents almost half of state and local taxation.
"In Maryland, a lot of real estate companies own, primarily the tax base around the D.C., the government, or non-profit organizations that don't pay taxes," explained Douglas Lindholm, the CEO of Center on State Taxation.
So Maryland is forced to rely much more on income taxes, for example, to pay for the same services that are in other states.
The recent increase in business tax revenue cannot be attributed solely to the healing real estate market.
According to the data, business revenues also appear to be increasing.
Companies in the region published a corporation tax of $2.3 billion that increased from $2.1 billion from 2012's 2012 income tax.
Maryland withdrew $1 billion in corporate income taxes, the most in the region.
Although they are moving in the same direction, the local tax burden on entrepreneurs is not growing just as quickly in these three places.
The growth rate in D.C. was at the national average, at 4.3%, while Maryland's growth was significantly higher, 4.9%.
In Virginia alone, the increase in taxation was below average, to 4.1%.
Virginia has the lowest taxation of the company's income tax of the three districts (all of which they have the same taxation).
The taxation rate of companies in Maryland is 8.25%, while the D.C. average remains relatively high, at 9.975%.
A similar study conducted this year by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce showed that Virginia has lower state and local taxation and a more favourable tax climate overall than Maryland.
D.C. didn't rate the study.
Despite this advantage, Virginia faces pressure from the competition from the south.
North Carolina recently signed a law lowering company tax from 6.9% to 6%, as did Virginia, and next year the tax will be reduced to 5%.
If the state continues to meet the revenue targets in the coming year, the statutory income tax rate could be reduced to 3% in 2017.
According to a recent study, retail entrepreneurs in Washington are doing better, so they pay higher state and local taxes.
A trade-making tax paid by small business owners as a tax on personal income - the price-incrementation structure by raising the prices that most firms are organized - in D.C., Maryland and Virginia, rose by 20% to $2.4 billion last year, much faster than other taxes.
Researchers argue that the trend and nationwide growth in trade tax are likely to continue next year, with total tax revenues from sales for both state and local governments to increase to 6.2% compared to the same period in the previous three years, compared to the same period in the first three quarters of 2014.
But Washington may lag behind others, as cutting state spending is taking its toll on the labor market.
What you missed: Europe's head will be Tusk, Putin's Novorum and Lafat's scissors
Will there be a new state in Ukraine?
Putin calls for negotiations on Novorum
Russian President Vladimir Putin mentioned the possibility of creating a new state in southeastern Ukraine, where government troops have been clashing with pro-Russian rebels since April.
He also warned European firms that, following the current regime of anti-Russian sanctions, they would have a difficult return to the Russian market.
The support afforded to the West by the warfare of the Ukrainian army in eastern Ukraine, according to him, contradicts democratic values.
The end of the conflict, he said, depends on Kiev, so he cannot say when the Ukrainian crisis will end.
More sanctions for Russia?
Czech Republic wins right to disagree with part
The European Commission, along with diplomats, is to propose a further tougher on anti-Russian sanctions within a week, the EU summit decided last night.
The permanent chairman of the meetings of the member countries, Herman Van Rompuy, told reporters.
According to Czech Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka, concrete proposals for the postponement of the sanctions are to be prepared as early as Monday.
Tusk will be the new Union's "President."
Van Rompuy to be replaced in December
At the European Union summit, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk was elected to head the European Council, the so-called EU president, who directs the member countries' summit meetings.
From December, he will replace Herman Van Rompuy for two and a half years.
European diplomacy will be headed by Italian Foreign Minister Federica Mogherini.
The Italian woman, who will thus become vice-president of the future European Commission, has yet to be confirmed by the European Parliament.
Assisted death is a reality in the Czech Republic, it is just not mentioned
Help the incurable and long-term suffering patient with the departure from life?
In Czech conditions, where laws do not allow euthanasia, this is not legally possible.
Yet the comments made by the doctors who approached the LN show that they are hearing about such requests.
ALS: The Hardest Chapter for Neurology, says doctor about sclerosis
Approximately three hundred people suffer from the Czech Republic in the Czech Republic with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), 21 patients undergo experimental stem cell treatment in Motol, Prague.
We definitely don't know if it will be successful.
But if we don't try, we won't find out," says Radim Mazanec, a motolan neurologist.
It shows the manuscript of the CIA, they needed a war, writes Huml about the downing of flight MH17
ČSSD MEP Stanislav Huml is clear about who shot down the Malaysian plane over Ukraine.
According to him, it is clear that "the hilarious sanctions that were announced with regard to the downing of a civilian aircraft with nearly 300 dead were deliberately caused by the Ukrainian army."
According to the lawmaker, it's also the CIA's handwriting.
Unfull promises.
Elections are coming up and the parties are again offering the impossible
The end of the homeless on the streets, parking for each family and the funicular above Prague.
It is repeated before every election: the parties promise the impossible.
Also, with local elections looming, with the forthcoming local elections, politicians are racing to see who the voters will like more.
Lidovky.cz has selected the impossible promises of the present and past.
70 years ago, the Czechoslovaks landed at Dunkirk.
A fierce siege has begun
It was 30 August 1944 when the Czechoslovak Independent Brigade moved to France.
Its commander, Alois Liška, consistently asked for the addition of technical equipment and dispatch to the front.
The British side eventually complied and listed the ground unit as one of its forces in the siege of the port city of Dunkirk, which remained in the power of the German troops.
SUMMARY: Plzeň leads the league in front of Prague's "S", Liberec declassified Baník
Viktoria Plzeň is the new leader of the Football League, led by one point ahead of both Prague's "S".
The changes at the top of the table were caused by the Slavia 1-2 defeat in Mladá Boleslav.
After two defeats, Sparta recovered in the domestic league, beating Jablonec thanks to two Lafatov's hits.
Liberec claimed a record win of the year, scoring 6-0.
62,000 spectators at the volleyball?
Poles say yes
The introduction to the Volleyball Championship in Warsaw brought a spectator record.

How to survive the return from vacation?
Take your time and sleep
The last days of the holidays are ahead of us.
Get used to getting used to the sunny beach or the cottage on a normal work pace can be a nut for a while.
It may even be accompanied by depression.
Fortunately, there are proven tips on how to cope with the changed situation: not to rush to get in and indulge in quality sleep.
Joan Rivers' family: 'Fingers toe'
Joan Rivers has been unconscious for three days, ever since she was brought to the New York City hospital, but her daughter said today that she was not losing hope of the 83-year-old comedian's recovery.
"Thank you for your greeting and support," Melissa Rivers said in a statement today.
Fingers crossed.
Her mother was brought to Mount Sinai Hospital on Thursday after a call to the emergency services, according to which she received a cardiac arrest on a Yorkrant endoscopy at the Upper East Side, according to the source.
Doctors deliberately keep her under the influence of sedatives and under strict supervision until they are sure of her condition, which remains "serious."
The responses were not long in coming, including the surreal support on the Internet from personalities like Donald Trump, Montel Williams, and Kelly Ripa.
Reality is distorted headlines
That the media is distorting reality with their headlines is (unfortunately) no news.
I know the headlines are "sold" by newspapers, but unfortunately I also know that many are so-called "readers" who don't read anything else.
And that's a fact that's been bothering me very much lately, the word is more apt.
This applies in particular to articles on the conflict between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip.
The headlines "Israel attacked Gaza" are quite common.
Only in the text will you read that the Israeli "attack" was a response to the fired rockets from the Gaza Strip, often at the time of the declared ceasefire.
This will then appear as headlined "Both sides violated the truce."
Does the journalism community realise that, in this process, it is directly involved in the anti-Semitic attitudes that are growing across Europe (and not only there)?
Less than sixty years have passed since the end of World War II.
So far, there are survivors of the Shoah.
When I saw the videos from the Federal Republic of Germany, where the crowd shouted the slogans "Jewish swine" and the like of a mess, I got choked.
Does the world want to finish what Hitler failed to do?
Do our journalists realise the fact that after the Jews the Slavs were destined for the liquidation?
Ladies and gentlemen of the journalists, please take a little more care of your work.
You are often referred to as the "watchdogs of democracy."
So defend her.
While he's here.
And defend the right of the only truly democratic state in the Middle East to protect its population.
How would you like our government to behave if one of our neighbors decides to eliminate the Czech nation and remove the Czech Republic from the map of the world?
Perhaps you should also be aware of one more fact.
Nearly 20% of Arabs with Israeli citizens live in the state of Israel.
And they're comfortable there.
If you ask them, why don't they go between "the "yem," like to Gaza, by answering you, why would they do that?
In Israel, they have jobs, social security, and top-notch health care (I've seen with my own eyes how to the top private Hadassa Hospital, which is funded by the sponsorship donations of Jews from all over the world, and are, of course, treated there).
Hamas is also attacking its Arab brothers with their missiles.
The only real aid to Gaza, and thus to this troubled area, is to rid it of Hamas and disarm it.
And not condemn Israel, albeit indirectly in the headlines.
Inform about the practices of Hamas, about its abuse of people as human shields.
Inform that Hamas is to liquidate the state of Israel at any cost.
Even at the cost of the death of innocent Arab children.
Notify that Hamas is on the list of world terrorist organisations.
To inform that in nine years of self-government in Gaza, the area may have been thriving through humanitarian aid from around the world.
Even from Israel, which supplies water and electricity there, for which the Gaza administrators, of which the governors of Gaza do not pay and even fretted that the power supplies are sometimes interrupted at this time.
If Hamas had not invested money in the construction of underground tunnels so that suicide attackers could infiltrate the territory of Israel, but perhaps in the construction of apartment buildings, hospitals, and schools, its Arab brothers from Gaza would have lived considerably better.
Amazon buys $1.04 billion for Twitch
AMAZON just confirmed the information's claim on Monday morning: An online retailer - a video producer and hundreds of other things - buys the video streaming service Twitch for $1.04 billion ($970 million).
The announcement came as a surprise not because no one expected the Twitch to be bought, but because the buyer was expected to be YouTube.
Three months ago, Google's $1 billion Twitch sales looked certain, and that connection looked natural.
Twitch, founded by Justin.tv just three years ago, was on the move to become a widely used video streaming service - a live version of YouTube.
Instead, it quickly became a platform for players who broadcast online broadcasts from games to it - the words of Business Insider "YouTube for live-streamed gaming."
Interafation Twitch.
The "Let's play" video, the species where the sages (mostly the older) are already popular with Mystery Science Theater games.
The fact is that YouTube comes up a lot when you're describing the Trashitch, so the news that YouTube is buying a TWitch didn't excite much, it was a textbook example of how the established company would pay off possible competition.
The mystery is why the YouTube deal didn't work out, even though the company was willing to pay the same amount as Amazon.
All we currently have at our disposal is the statement of Twitch's CEO Emmet Shear: "We chose Amazon because they believe in our company, it has the same values and a long-term vision and wants to help us deliver it faster."
Another mystery is - frankly - the incredible achievement of Twitch.
For snobs like me, who say they'd rather do sport than watch, it's hard to understand what's so amazing about just watching the games instead of real playing.
It's one thing to look over a friend's shoulder at 3:00 in the morning, playing Resident Evil, and another thing is to watch a stranger get 20 hits to the head in Call of Duty.
All the games you could just watch.
Another problem is that a lot of today's, most popular games are from the player's perspective, so looking at their record without being able to control the perspective yourself is a pretty good recipe for getting a headache.
I admit that the speed run games in which the Rogers Bannisters of our electronic time will complete the game in record time are entertaining.
But if someone is not a master of gaming or humor, their Twitch channel is unlikely to be very interesting.
But what do skeptics like I know?
Twitch has 55 million monthly visits and is fourth at the height of internet traffic.
How exactly will Amazon take advantage of this?
It's hard to imagine Twitching to Amazon Instant Video as elegantly as it could have been swallowed up by YouTube.
But the Twitch has something that every company would like to attract: hordes of young men that advertisers want.
As Twitch's director Shear, both Amazon and Twitch have said, "believes in the future of games," and the media don't seem to be reluctant, or as - swallowed - by viewers.
The second basic lie of creationism.
Another Czech translation of the American atheist vlogger Aron Ra.
This time on the theme of "Hossen Scriptures are God's Word."
Attaching the original video.
The second basic lie of creationism is the belief that the sacred texts were written by God and not by real human authors.
When believers debate one of the many things that contradict their religion, they often confront us with the question: Who will you believe?
The alleged word of God or the word of man?
As if human exploration were completely trivial compared to the authority they imagine that their doctrine has.
But when they say "human," they talk about science.
And when they report to the "word of God," they report to the myths of God written by people.
If, indeed, there is an intelligent one with a creator with a purpose, then he is the one who created a fossil record that reveals evolutionary history, and it must be he who invented the genetic formulas that match it, and it must be he who supplied other pieces of evidence that show exclusively to the evolutionary conclusion to the last detail.
Why else would all these things exist?
Seems like he's trying to tell us something!
The people couldn't create any of those things.
But people can tell stories, fabulously.
And it was the people who wrote all the lyrics that pretend to be the word of God.
Every supposedly holy teachings of any religion in the world describes itself as written by men, not gods.
People who were "moved" or "inspired" by their favorite gods, or perhaps listened to the dictates of the angels, but those texts were not written by no one but mere mortals with a certain degree of imagination, not angels, and certainly not gods.
If there really was one real god, he would be an integral part of all the gods of all religions, the über-galactic supergennius, the ultimate entity of the whole cosmos.
If a creature of this size had ever written a book, there would have been only one such book, the only script of the saint.
It would be known all over the world, without its predecessors, parallels or alternatives in any language, because mere human authors would not be able to match such a work.
And people would not have to believe it in sight, because it would be consistent, backed up by verifiable and truthful evidence, and would reveal deep morality and wisdom far beyond all human limits.
It would permanently inspire every reader to unity of the common faith.
If it had been written by God, we would have expected nothing less.
But what we see instead is the exact opposite.
Instead of the one religion leading to the final truth, we have many different religions with no conceptual origin, and all of them are constantly disintegrating into more and more separate denominations, seeking questionable truths, and each of them somehow claims dividing the leadership of God, regardless of the continuing dissolution and separation in every direction.
The Jewish Torah, the Christian Gospels, the Islamic Qint-i-Akdás, the Christian Goalag, the Arabasthuhrov's Avests, the Sikh-Adi-Granth, the Mahabharata Bhagavad-Gita, the Book of Mormon, or the book of Urantia are all considered "absolute truth" and the "revected word of the only true god" and the relevant believers of each of them say that the other ones are awning out of the aft, and the other believers say that the other ones are awning outwardly the other ones are awneduberments..
The only logical explanation, probably, is that everyone is astray to some extent.
None of the aforementioned books have any advantage over the others.
None of them have the evidence support, and none can be historically confirmed.
My name is Dr. Paul Maier, and I'm a professor of ancient history at the University of West Michigan.
I'm not saying I've proven that the Bible is reliable and historical accurate.
Of course it isn't.
You must still have faith.
All of them require faith, as well as apologies (obhajoby), because they contain inconsistencies, absurdities, and primitive images once considered true that have already been overcome.
So it cannot be argued that they are proof of divine wisdom.
Many of them promote heinous atrocities instead of morality, and many of them are claimed to have been confirmed by the fulfillment of the prophecy - with any of the fact that they can also contain prophecies that have not been fulfilled.
Leading theologians admit that all the sacred texts of any religion were written by human hands and are therefore the subject of interpretations, impressions, and views of their primitive and often prejudices bound by politically motivated authors, thus explaining many of the contradictions and inconsistencies in these books, especially those in the Bible.
I wouldn't call it contradiction, rather the comments made.
We must once again point out that here we have two different authors whose work was somehow mixed together during some editor's review.
He is right that Genesis has more than one author and is certainly not the narrative of an eyewitness!
Some experts now distinguish four different sources for the Pentateuch alone, i.e. the five Books of "Meso Jesus" and do not attribute to Moses the authorship of any of them, because it almost certainly did not exist as described in the Bible.
Experts agree that Genesis was composed (probably by Ezra) from several unrelated oral traditions less than 2,500 years ago.
The other documents were filtered at the same time and are all attributed to human authors.
The Bible is by no means as old as her believer thinks.
The Dead Sea Scrolls are the oldest archaeological findings of the texts known for their unfinished foundation of all Western monotheistic beliefs, yet they are many centuries younger than the roots of zoroastrianism, Buddhism, Hinduism, Hennism, Druid cults, or Egyptian religions.
Christianity began as a Gnostic faith, followed by the doc and ebionites and their very different insights into Jesus, which eventually combined in a kind of compromise called orthodoxy.
Other Christian groups like the luciferians were dispersed and discredited by further revisions of the Bible.
One of these arrangements refers to the King of Ugarit, who ruled 3,500 years ago.
Because his followers were a major threat to the young mosaic religion, the authors of the New Testament decided to ridicule and Ba'al Zebula, "The Lord on the Mountain" changed to Beelzebub "Lord of Flies."
So the Bible was deliberately and fraudulently altered for both religious and political reasons.
The remainder of what happened to the New Testaments were canonized in the 4th century A.D. in a series of commissions decisions at the Nikai Convention.
The four Gospels were accepted, and sixteen others were rejected by the simple-maintain of the handshake, as if the fact of the matter could be accepted or rejected by a vote.
The way the canon evolved depended on what was read on Sundays in the Christian centers at the time.
What was read on the second Sunday after Easter in the Jerusalem Church?
What about in the Roman Church at the same time?
And they gradually discovered that they were approaching the same Gospel stories.
And so the core of the canon evolved from the tradition of the primal church.
So the council simply accepted as the gospel any relevant stories that circulated among the uneducated masses at that time.
But they also consciously took more than ten books from the Bible, though they were reported by books that had been approved.
Among the rejected items, we find the writings of both the Apostles and the Prophets.
Why should the word of God refer us to books that are just the words of some people and/or are no longer available?
Who was the real editor here?
The Bible often mentions human authors.
But how could it be approved in this way if the god was the real author of this random mixing of legends, parables and psalm lyrics?
The Bible was certainly written by the people and certainly not by the enlightened, rather the opposite!
That's why so much of its content is historically and scientifically quite wrong, easy to go, almost from start to finish.
We are talking about people who believed that snakes and donkeys could speak, believing in spells, bloody sacrifices, ritual spells, enchanted objects, fiery potions, astrology, and five elements of magic.
They thought that if they used a magic rod to spray someone with blood, it would cure them of leprosy.
We're talking about people who thought rabbits were ruminants, and bats were birds and whales were fish and they know it's an integer.
These people believed that if they showed pregnant cow striped patterns, they would give birth to striped calves.
How could anyone say that about genetics?
The authors of this book, of course, did not know this.
If the Bible had been written by a higher being, then it would not contain the mistakes it contains.
If it had come from the pen of a truly superior being and was intended as a literal history, then it would not have contained any of the contents of it.
As a moral guide, it totally fails because, most of the original Hebrew writings were written by uneducated and bigoted savages who overlooked or promoted cruelty to animals, incest, slavery, the abuse of slaves, the abuse of family members, the abuse of children, violence against children, abortion, looting, murder, cannibalism, genocide and prejudice against the race, the nation, religion, gender and sexual orientation.
To defend their inhumanity by claiming that they were doing God's will.
But the creationists are still ignoring all this.
Some of their websites admit that if any fact is at odds with the Bible, then the reality must be ignored!
And why?
Because if the creationists didn't have their beloved books, they wouldn't have a god.
In their world, one and the other is the same.
Ironically, they reject God's "work" as "worshipping creation instead of the creator."
But they themselves see the word man as the word of God and God himself, and even insist that the rebuttal of their supposedly "holy" books somehow refute God as such.
Not their version of the god but all versions of God.
Kreacionist Christians think that if the Bible is wrong, then God is lying.
They cannot accept that God might exist and the Bible could be wrong at the same time, because they cannot separate the doctrine from the deity.
So it's a kind of idolatry where believers worship man-made compilations, as if these books were the god themselves because they think they're the word they're the word.
But God never wrote or dictated any of the writings of any religion.
Everything people approved or rejected into their supposedly "unwessword" of any god was invented, assembled, grouped, translated, interpreted, edited, edited and often also intentionally altered and twisted by mere erring people.

Participant of the bucket challenge dislocated her jaw
As she poured iced water on her head, Isabelle Roberts from the UK shouted so hard she had damaged the facial bone structure.
This bucket challenge didn't work.
The woman was hospitalized after she screamed at the bucket call to dislocate her jaw.
As she poured icy water on her head, Isabelle Roberts was shouting so intensely that she damaged the bone structure in her face.
"The water was so cold I had to scream, but my jaw started to stiffen," she told The Mirror.

I tried to shut my mouth, but I couldn't, it was stuck, and I realized something was wrong.
Then it came to us and my sister, they might have been bursting with laughter, but I had to go to the emergency room quickly."
The 20-year-old had to be hospitalized to return her jaw to her original location after attending a fashionable viral wave on Tuesday.
The video became an online sensation, with thousands of people sharing it on Facebook and Twitter.
Attacker stabbed nine people at Chinese school, three of whom died
A man named Chen, according to the New China news agency, violently entered the building of the primary school in the morning and attacked around 10:30 p.m. local time.
Three of the nine people he stabbed later died in hospital.
Chen eventually killed himself by jumping from a height, New China said, referring to the regional government.
In recent years, China has seen a series of similar attacks in schools and against children.
The public is therefore calling for more security measures and better protection for children in a country where many married couples have only one child in line with government policy.
Zeman showed first-time students in Lány how he had to sit at the school
The smallest schoolchildren were taken by ninth-graders to their classroom, where he and the teacher were waiting for the president to come.
He then demonstrated to the children how he had to sit alone in the school.
"We had to sit with our hands behind our backs, that doesn't expect you anymore, you are already free people," Zeman told the children.
His wife then presented the first-years with a conundrum as a gift.

Education Minister Marcel Chládek started the new school year at a private sports school in Litvínov.
"This year I want to connect Czech education with Czech sport more closely," he said, explaining one of the reasons he went to the north of Bohemia on the first day of school.
The school's management approached him at a hockey match in Litvínov some time ago.
"They were the first, so I accepted the invitation to attend the start of the school year," the minister added.
Education Minister Marcel Chládek (ČSSD) started the school year at a private sports school in Litvínov.
This year, 115,000 first-graders entered the first classes.
A total of over 850,000 children will attend primary schools and over 405,000 students will be educated in secondary schools, the Ministry of Education estimates.
Nova's new artte director of news is David Fiala
The new art arts director of news and journalism for Nova's news has become David Fiala since 1 September.
He succeeds Alan Zárubu, who led from 1. June the creative department of the entire Nova Group.
David Fiala previously served in the graphics department of the news television Z1.
For the past two years, under the leadership of Alan Záruba, he has been involved in the realization of a complete visual transformation of the news broadcasts Televizní noviny, Střepiny, Bang! and other publicist programmes by Nova TV.
David Fiala has a very good command of the synergy of communication between editorial, studio management and graphics department, the essence of the work of the art director of news.
It has a flair for typography and a clean, elegant design, which is the way we want to take further course of action in Nova's eyelet," says Nova's creative director, Alan Záruba.
Apple iCloud reportedly succumbed to hackers, releasing nude images of celebrities
Screen screenshot with a listing of leaked files
Meanwhile, an anonymous user on 4chan is publishing nude and pornographic images of American celebrities, Mashable.com, a US website, has pointed out.
They were allegedly obtained by unauthorized access to user accounts on Apple's servers, where disabled users uploaded them by automatically backing them uploaded to images from iPhones and iPads.
Apple has yet to comment on the problem.
Some celebrities reject the films as falsified, but several of the affected authenticity of the images have already been admitted.
They include actress Jennifer Lawrence, an acquaintance at the title role of Katniss in the Hunger Games film series, or Mary Elizabeth Winstead, who starred in the 4-0 Die Hard.
The aim of the hacker is to use the acquired images and videos to enrich.
American magazines reportedly showed interest in the footage, but according to reports on 4chan, the hacker wants money from the community instead.
According to The Next Web, this is very likely a weakness in iCloud's security.
In fact, a tool appeared on the GitHub server two days ago to get passwords to user's accounts through brute force, i.e. by automatically repeating login attempts with different passwords.
This tool was demonstrably working, but Apple closed the security hole after two days.
What is certain, however, is that potential attackers had plenty of time to gain access to various accounts before the instrument was published.
iCloud users should thus change their password associated with the Apple ID as a precaution.
The length of the password is important, not its complexity.
The length of at least 12 characters is suitable.
The leak of nude images of celebrities to be considered a reminder of the safe use of online services.
Although the servers of companies like Apple, Google or Microsoft are much better secured than computers in homes or smaller firms, upload of sensitive photos in an unprotected form is an unnecessary risk.
If you want to back up-to-do with explicit photos or any other sensitive content online, first encrypt the files before upload.
It is also sensible to set up the automatic backup of photos from your phone so that it takes place only on wi-fi and when connected to the charger.
This way, you'll be able to move the sensitive images "to safety" in time, and most importantly, you'll have the space to delete the missed images, so they won't take up space in the online repository.
Instructions for how to encrypt files and communications on the internet are offered to readers of HN and IHNED.cz in the form of an electronic book by Michal Altaire Valášek in the PDF format.
A smart way to save on a college script
With the price for college scripts for many students exceeding $1,000 a year, the upcoming second-year student came up with a smart way to cut costs.
He devised a system of renting books from classmates from senior classmates with an offer of nominal compensation to delay their divestment back.
"I earned a book for calculations that normally cost $180 for a semester for ten and for chicken nuggets," says Schroeder, 19, who is a student at the Covenant College in Georgia.
The books required in his last semester would cost $430, he says.
He spent 120.
According to the university board, the average student spends more than $1,200 a year on textbooks and aids, but students have different options to manage these expenses.
The preferred choice of students is becoming online shops and creative solutions like Schroeder's.
Textbook lending is on the rise, allowing students to use the book for a semester, often at a significant discount rather than buying it.
Neebo Inc, which operates more than 250 bookstores in campus venues, says that book lending has doubled since 2011.
A survey in the sector shows that around a quarter of the books in the university bookstores were borrowed in the last spring semester, says Vice President Neebo Trevor Meyer.
Less than half of the teaching texts are bought in university bookstores, according to the National Association of University Businesses.
Here's the 101st of the best ways to succeed.
Shopping online
Prices for some new books may be up to a third lower online than in the university bookstore.
The recommended award for the ninth edition of Rone Larson's "Calculus," and Robert Hostetler, is nearly $290 available for purchase a new one on the Internet for $2390.
Buy used
If you don't mind other people's comments or wear and tear and vandalism, the appropriate option is the use of curriculum.
On Chegg.com, "Calculus" sells for $93.49.
Matt Casaday, 25, a senior at Brigham Young University, says he paid 42 cents on Amazon.com for a used copy of "Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business" .
The new one sold for $48.
University teacher Ingrid Bracey, head of the University of Massachusetts Amherst's College Without Walls, suggests that students at their teachers check to see if older editions are acceptable.
Sometimes the changes for working in semen aren't important.
If so, older releases can be sold at a fraction of the price of the last version.
In addition to Chegg and Amazon, eBay Inc's Half.com is a popular alternative for buying used books.
Borrowing
It is also worth considering lending textbooks, if you treat them well, remember to return them and you don't need to have them even after the end of the seminar.
You can save up to 80% of the cost of a new book.
For example, a student could borrow "Calculus" for the entire semester for about $20.
Meet the terms and conditions of the store in which you borrow the book, including a penalty for notes, highlighting or wear and damage.
Keep in mind: If you don't return the book in time, the fine may be higher than the price of a new book.
E-books
Another option is to get an e-book instead of a normal book.
Sometimes these books are essentially lent in the form of an electronic licence valid for a certain period of time from distributors such as Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc.
Chegg lends "Calculus" for six months for approximately $61.
According to Bracey, the students of literary courses can find the most advantageous offers, as many classics are now available for free downloads, while science and technical texts can be very expensive.
In any case, go around the shops.
Joe Gault, 29, who will be joining the Pepperdine Law School soon, recommends following the ISBN because it guarantees that you are buying the right book.
Before you order the book online, make sure it's really in stock, advises Gault.
He made sure of it firsthand.
The book he had bought was sold out for four weeks, and had to pay the full price for a book from a university book.
Mud, all mud.
And then they found in the well of a torso of a rifle from the end of the war
The well is a short walk from St. George.
We uncovered the foliage around and began to haul out an aged hilt - about a meter and a half of mud and rotten leaves.
As we approached the clay day, we came upon the barrel," said Radomil Novák.
We pulled it out, cleared it, and found it to be the torso of an assault German rifle used by SS troops.
The discovery is reportedly unusual.
According to my information, such rifles were made only towards the end of the war.
And there were about three hundred thousand of them," Novak added.
All the wooden design items have broken down over time, so it is unusable.
Her body, however, is well preserved - it holds its shape.
How did it come to be in the well?
There is an explanation.
It may have been thrown in by people who needed to get rid of the weapon used by the SS units, probably for fear of being relegated.
Fascists on the run probably wouldn't do that.
They were dumping their weapons in the woods," the finder thinks.
The rifle was the only thing the enthusiasts from the Rainbow of the Jeseníky Movement found in the well.
"There could have been hand grenades, there were a lot of them around here once, so we slowed the excavation work, we felt the mud carefully to avoid some misfortune, but nothing else was down there," Novák said.
The discovery will end up in the museum's depository at the castle in the nearby Silesian Rudoltice.
Ukrainian general: I have not freed the Captured Czech yet
Aktuálně.cz's exclusive interview with General Colonel Volodymyr Ruban, who liberates Ukrainian soldiers from the captivity of the pro-Russian separatists.
Kiev/Prague - "Excuse me, I have to take it... they're calling me from Donetsk," excused the Ukrainian Colonel-General Volodymyr Ruban, otherwise the director of the Centre for the Liberation of War prisoners there, apologized for an exclusive interview with Aktuálně.cz.
The Colonel Secretary Volodymyr Ruban in a televised debate.
At each such interruption, it was impossible not to hear from the names of the people, their numbers, or where they were - or should be - which Ruban specifies with his counterpart at the other end of the phone.
"That's it - go there," he concluded one of the lightning discussions with Donetsk, again addressing ours.
Volodymyr Ruban is a reserve general, a former fighter pilot and an active participant in the Maidan anti-government protests.
Yesterday - when we were arranging an interview - he was in Donetsk.
The liberation of Ukrainian soldiers from the captivity of the pro-Russian separatists is devoted to twenty-four hours a day.
Aktuálně.cz: You may know that the Czechs are also fighting on the side of the pro-Russian separatists.
Our counterintelligence estimates their numbers to be in their 30s.
But there could be many more.
Have you met any Czech prisoners in your negotiations?
Volodymyr Ruban: I have already freed the captured Serbs, the Dagestani, the Chechens, one a Swede, a Georgian... but not yet a Czech.
But I do know who to turn to in Prague if we came across your captured countryman and can rescue him.
Ukrainian soldier captured by separatists
A.cz: What do you advise the Czechs who are joining the pro-Russian separatists and will the Ukrainian soldiers capture them?
They should understand that if, as Czechs, they are fighting in the Ukrainian battalions of volunteers and the separatists capture them, they will be shot without mercy after being questioned, as will any other foreigner.
The separatists see these men as the rent of mercenaries, who, according to them, deserve nothing but death.
But if, for example, Ukrainian soldiers capture a group of Donetsk separatists - and thus a Czech among them - put him behind bars and treat him like a prisoner of war.
The guy just survives.
The Ukrainian side also behaves like a state in war.
A.cz: And how many of the Ukrainian prisoners have you managed to save?
As I understand it, in exchange.
Some sources say it has long exceeded a hundred men.
We've long since stopped counting how many people we've helped.
But we just freed them... they couldn't save them from the war if they decided to continue the fighting.
The rescuers are doctors in the war, the surgeons, but we certainly aren't.
That's it.
And every day, more and more come.
We'll save someone every day.
Sometimes one, sometimes a quartet or a five.
And it doesn't always have to be a trade.
Sometimes, even a human plea is enough to release the prisoners.
A.cz: It is rumored that in a few months you have won great authority and even trust with the pro-Russian separatists... as well as in Ukrainian society.
How did you manage to build the respect of the two warring parties?
Tough question.
One of the officers in Kiev gave me the nickname "a madman general with steel balls."
It's not offended.
And perhaps it captures the essence of our work.
As head of the Ukrainian Committee of the Officers, I had gained some authority before.
I never catch, cheat, and always keep my word.
Whatever happens, I act honestly and I tell the truth.
Even when it is the Ukrainian government, or the Donetsk or Luhansk very unpleasant one.
If they torture and kill people?
So I simply tell them that they are tortured and killed.
And that they're crimes.
I often risk my life, I was even captured in the prisoner exchange... this job can be the end for me at any time... I don't have to come back.
A.cz: How many executions and torture of prisoners do you know about?
... (long pause)... to torture the prisoners, both Ukrainians and separatists are resorting to torture of prisoners.
Unfortunately.
And the executions?
These take place only on the Donetsk side.
I do not have information that the Ukrainian army is also executing prisoners.
Nor hints about the Ukrainian military committing such a thing.
We have an idea of the number of executions, but I cannot and do not want to give the numbers.
A.cz: Describe to me the characters and motives of the pro-Russian separatists.
Among them are officers, but also veterans from Afghanistan.
They are striving for autonomy and possibly democracy in Donetsk or Luhansk - that's what they say.
They don't want to play games with Ukrainian oligarchs anymore.
The separatists are fed up with the oligarchs and are their imploring opponents - to the death.
As we say - they've gone over to their throats.
The same dreams and ashes were made clear in the Maidan, by the way.
And now I'm doing a little towel: Russia is backed by the separatists, and the West, on the other hand, by the Ukrainian state.
I consider one speculation to be great and the other one, on the contrary, to be small.
But this line of mine already holds an impreckable contradiction.
A.cz: For example, how do you find one of the toughest leaders of the pro-Russian separatists, Igor Bezler?
Every time I cross the line of the war front, I'm unarmed and show soldiers or militants their bare hands out.
And I've always got both sides of the two or three hundred yards in the sights or the fiber optic sight.
The faces of the people who point their way at me, I can see well every time... and they can pull the trigger of their guns at any time.
A paratrooper, an experienced colonel with both German and Ukrainian ancestry.
He is considered a Russian officer, but his family - his mother - lives in Ukraine.
He believes that Ukraine should not exist.
And if so, just as a small governor in the big Russian Empire.
In any case, he talks about this constantly and sees Ukraine as a kind of misunderstanding.
Such a state should not even exist.
At the same time, it is an implacable enemy of all Ukrainian oligarchs.
A.cz: Speaking of characters - in a discussion show on the Ukrainian television's discussion show, you called your Prime Minister, Arseniy Yatsenyuk, a weak, clueless and weary "leader" who would do best if he left quickly.
In those three hundred yards of walking, I get scared at least five times.
So why should I be hiding with the notion that Yatsenyuk is a very weak prime minister and that he is hurting our country?
A.cz: Do you think he has a part in the war in Ukraine?
You may know that the Ukrainians of Yatsenyuk are nicknamed "the rabbits."
And the rabbit is not, in the eyes of Ukrainians, an animal that would be afraid of, or would have respect and authority for others.
His behavior directly follows the behavior of the rabbit.
He may be a good economist, but as a prime minister, he has no right to cry in parliament in the war, to beg him, to play with him in the intrigue, to threaten to lay down the post ... he must run the country, administer it and protect it in times of war.
At the threat to the country, the prime minister is not entitled to family, his comrades, rest on tearful emotions.
He is the first of the ministers of Ukraine.
And Yatsenyuk?
He acts like a teenage girl.
Yes, he is tired, but also weak, because he was never strong... he does not fight for Ukraine, he just complains about everything all the time.
He should therefore leave.
The sooner the better for Ukraine.
Why the Guardians of the Galaxy failed to save sales
The insubable 3 of Sylvester Stallone returned less than $30 million from a $90 million budget in the US, and Sin City: A woman for whom I would murder return only $12 million from a $70 million budget.
The film Sex Tape with Cameron Diaz grossed only $14.6 million on its first weekend, as well as films for children such as How to Train Your Dragon 2 were a disappointment to the cinema.
According to an article by film critic Robbie Collin in the Telegraph, the quality of children's films is to blame.
Collin called 2014 the "worst" year of children's films, and he called How to Trainate Dragon 2 a mere "functional" sequel.
When it comes to films put on a slightly older target audience, it seems that the problem is not necessarily in the quality of the films themselves.
In July, Entertainment Weekly compared CinemaScore and Metacritic servers and their average rating of summer film premieres aired in at least 2,000 cinemas between the Victims of the War and the 20s. July in 2013 and this year.
The results, which take into account the view of both viewers and film critics, suggest that this year's film crop is of similar quality to last year's hits.
According to some commentators, a change in viewers' access and the higher popularity of internet sites like Netflix may be to blame.
Director Jon Favreau, who is currently working on Disney's treatment of the Jungle Book, told the Hollywood Reporter website, "I think times are changing."
We have to admit it and not try to chase at what was already.
Unlike the current crisis in Hollywood's box office, Netflix's profit was $1.2 billion on online services, almost twice as much as last year's $837 million.
Last summer, director Steven Spielberg criticized the studio for relying on comic book rights too much and predicted the "grinning" of Hollywood.
In light of the current slump, some commentators claim that there may be something to it of its catastrophic prophecy.
With the launch of possible major box office hitters in the summer of 2015, including Avengers: Age of Ultron, Outside and Jurassic World, other numbers are more optimistic in the film industry.
X-Men producer Simon Kinberg recently described the drop in sales as simply "cyclical." For the Hollywood Reporter, he said, "Next summer will be the summer's biggest box-office blockbusters in history, and no one will worry about the sale."
DPRK threatens Seoul again, launches more short-range missile
North Korea has launched another short-range short-range missile into the sea, Seoul reported.
The alleged missile test took place shortly after the completion of the joint military maneuvers of the United States and South Korea, which Pyongyang sees as preparation for the invasion.
The province of Chagang lies in the northwest KDLR at the border with China.
A spokesman for the South Korean Defense Ministry told the DPA news agency that the missiles were launched from a site in the northwest of the DPRK and reached a distance of roughly 200 kilometers.
As a result, North Korea apparently first launched a missile from the province of Zhagang, South Korean media reported, citing army circles.
The province is said to have an underground launch pad for Scud rockets.
This is another in a series of similar trials that the isolated North Korean regime has conducted in recent weeks.
North Korea conducted an unusually large number of missile and artillery tests this year.
NATO Summit: First Protests in Newport and Cardiff
Over the weekend, protests were conducted by protests from the NATO summit in Newport.
On Saturday, hundreds of people gathered in central Newport to take part in a march against NATO.
And on Sunday, about 150 people came to the town hall in Cardiff at a meeting that was described as an anti-summit.
Stephen Fairclough watched the situation over the weekend and spoke to the protesters who had come from Bridgend to Belgium.
Teenagers had to be airlifted from the Blue Mountains
TWO teenage tourists were picked up by plane and taken to safety after spending the night in the Blue Mountains in New South Wales.
A 16-year-old girl and an 18-year-old man went on a hike to the Govetts Leap in Blackheathu after noon on Sunday.
When they did not return home, the anxious relatives called the police around 8 p.m.
A search crew, including a local police and a rescue team, were dispatched, and the couple were found near Bridal Veil Falls at around 11pm.
The girl injured her knee and the man fell and hit his head in the process.
The police stayed with them overnight and were picked up on Monday morning.
In a stable condition, they were taken by ambulance to the Blue Mountains Hospital.
Olomouc brought only a point from Opava, the win was on the leg of Vasicek
The 23-year-old forward was the one who could have made the decision, but failed in the two-whest chances.
After the goal, the goal was called mainly by a shot from close range three minutes before the end, but instead of the net, it ended up on the Opava goalkeeper Josef Květoňovi.
It was on my leg, I have to give those chances.
I'm mad at myself," Vasicek said, pouring ashes on his head.
"I guess I should have put it higher under the lid, it got a little bit of a slip," he mused.
Sigma's defence did not allow Opava much, with the exception of Mikul's 11th-minute drive, which was covered by the goalkeeper Reichl.
Then the Hanáci started to push, but they were not allowed to the chance in the block defending the home side and shots from a distance were caught by Květoň.
We were comparing ourselves for 15 minutes, then took the initiative.
In the second half we were better, we had more of the game and Opava only threatened us from standard situations.
But the outright chance was not changed by Vasicek, and it ended 0-0," said the coach of the Hanák team, Leoš Kalvoda.
Opava also took the point because of absences from the line-up, where in addition to the pair of injured, Petr Vavřík and the three-goal scorer Petr Ševčík, who are hosting from Sigma in Silesia, were missing.
Unlike her earlier policies, this did not allow them to take over.
Substitutes deserve discharge.
Sigma was more football-wise, but except for one standard we didn't let her do anything," said the Silesian coach, Petr Baránek.
There was a lot of emphasis, aggression and vigour.
The draw is probably well deserved, the point is a good gain for us," he added.
Sigma drew to four points, which means 13th place.
Nothing that could satisfy the club's chief executive, Josef Lébro, who, after defeating Znojmo, made his million-dollar contribution to the coffers conditional on vastly different performances in the next matches.
"We were aware of Mr. Lébro's warning, so there can be no question of the boys not wanting to fight," Kalvoda noted, adding to the sleeping shooter Vasicek: "I believe it will come and when he scores, he will start to drop it.
But after the first shot, I'll replace him right away to save goals for the next games," Kalvoda laughed.
Al Pacino twice thrilled Venice.
Film festival is experiencing a crisis in the face
After the huge enthusiasm for the opening film, Birdman, whose director Alejandro González Iňárritu suddenly became one of the serious candidates for the Golden Lion, the next few days suggested the impression that interest in the 71st Venice Film Festival had subsided somewhat.
Whether because the number of seats in the largest room has risen to fourteen hundred, or because Birdman was followed by critics recognized, but less appealing to the audience, as a documentary about the genocide in Indonesia of the 1960s, A Scout of Silence and Other Social-Themed films from American 99 homes to Iran's Stories, in cinemas, in cinemas, simply remained empty seats.
Heroes from the Comics
Even the red carpet in front of the festival palace has not yet worn the crowds as in the past, and it has reportedly stopped getting the problem of getting a last-minute hotel job.
The crisis is more talked about in Italy than elsewhere, and it is no wonder that it has suffered even as esteemed institutions as the Biennale and the world's oldest film festival.
Fortunately, the crisis does not manifest itself in a lack of personalities, but those present exclusively in connection with the films.
While younger fans longed for the autographs of comic book superheroes Michael Shannon and Andrew Garfield, who had quite successfully performed dramatic roles in 99 homes, the main event for all generations was a visit by the legendary actor Ala Pacino.
He also starred here in two films.
In the story of The Invitation, performed out of the competition, by Oscar-winning Barry Levison, based on the novel by Philip Roth, the 74-year-old Pacino has a role to play close to him: an actor at the height of fame who suffers from depression from the end of his career and his personal life.
But seeing him the very next day as the eccentric owner of the country town's hardware store in the film Manglehorn, made by David Gordon Green, was a truly unforgettable experience.
The Volpi Cup for Best Actor should not miss it - but does the Pacinova-size artist still need awards?
Perhaps the greatest satisfaction for him is the love of the audience, and the Italian one in particular, for although he was born in New York, Al Pacino is proudly committed to the country from which his grandparents come.
Points for the Italians
Indeed, it is the Italian film that is doing very well in Venice this year.
The black souls, directed by Francesco Munzi, became the first film rewarded with a rewarded long standing ovation after Birdman.
The Calabrian offshoot of the Mafia is viewed by the view of the family's relationships between the clans, which struggle for each other's power and money, and the director has been able to reconcile all the prerequisites for a good film: a quality screenplay, a camera, music, and actors.
He was also intrigued by the Lucicus Psychriller of the Smooth Hearts, who was filmed by Saverio Costanzo with Alba Rohrwaracher in the role of a woman who nearly kills her own child with her misguided anxiety.
In contrast, French competition films received a warm welcome either the Fame Prize, or 3 hearts, both works clinging to the traditional model of consumer films that rely on the popularity of the acting officials.
But, after all, two really excellent films, Birdman and the Black Soul, are not so few at the first half of the festival.
And while the festival's films have mostly depressing themes, Peter Bogdanovich's new film, She's Funny That Way, a witty comedy out of competition in Venice and shot in the style of American '40s' crafts, was able to boost the mood for more than a day.
Police officers catch four meth manufacturers in Prague, brought in drugs from Poland
"Detectives have detained three men in the past few days, aged 42, 42 and 37, and a 25-year-old woman who produced and sold the drug of meth in Prague 9 from last November until this August," police spokesperson Jana Rösslerová said.
First, on Tuesday, August 12, a SWAT team in Cihlářské Street caught a 42-year-old organizer and dealer in one person and a young woman who was in the group as a drug buyer in Poland and a benefit salesman.
The following day, the detectives detained another member of the group, on the basis of the prior approval of the prosecutor, the 37-year-old.
The last of the four officers were caught in the mains on the premises of the picturesque incinerator in the main hours of 20am on the morning of August 20," the spokesperson described.
For transporting drugs from Poland, the woman received a third of the drug
The main organizer had a wide field of effect.
In the workshop of the air-raid area, in the garden house in Horoměřice, in the apartment in Koneěvova Street and other places in Prague 9, he produced meth, procured various aids and chemicals needed to make it and provided the transfer of pseudoephedrine drugs from the Republic of Poland.
He weighed the manufactured drug, divided into plastic bags and subsequently sold the meth.
With the transfer of medicines from Poland or the sale of drug addicts, he was helped out by a 25-year-old, hitherto unpunished woman.
For this, she received a reward from the organizer in the form of a third of the drug produced," Rösslerová added.
Criminals also carried out several house searches on the judge's orders, where they secured the drug, industrial chemicals, digital scales, pay bags, syringes, tubes and other aids and objects that, according to the experts, can be considered as a complete feature for the production of methamphetamine.
The dealer has been convicted seven times since 1995
"From the available records, the officers discovered that the main organizer had been convicted of property crimes in total seven times since 1995, the woman was not being convicted," the police spokesperson said.
The last detainee was in 2006 suspended for the offence of sexual abuse, and the 37-year-old mechanic who is being prosecuted at large has been convicted nine times since 2009.
For him, too, it was mostly for property crimes.
The investigator charged three men and a woman with committing the crime of illicit manufacturing and other handling of narcotic and psychotropic substances and poisons, punishable by up to 10 years in prison.
For three persons, the investigator eventually filed a motion to the prosecutor to present the arrest, where the judge eventually placed them," the spokesperson said.
The fourth accused, a 37-year-old repeat offender, ended up at large.
His position and role in this case were not as essential as those of the other accused.
The officers continue to work with this man anyway.

The abolition of grammar schools and secondary schools makes no sense.
The Czech Republic has few generally educated people, and statistics show that grammar school students have a good application.
The start of the school year is here.
In the last fortnight, the schools have undergone major preparations.
Most are routine matters, like bringing the pots from the summer repository back to the classes and getting chalks.
In the grammar school in the grammar school, they'll be a little bit more busy.
A few days before the start of the season, they are looking for furniture, computers and other technical equipment for the library.
There was no robbery or embezzlement, the four-year grammar school in Hořice opens and renews its activities after three years.
Not on a public, but on a private platform.
The lack of material equipment is not due to the founders being so incompetent.
They had to wait for whether the school's existence would be confirmed by the enrollment in the school register of the MŠMT.
"French Socialists should shut up and fix France," says Francois Hollande's key ally
Valls calls on the highly fragmented left to "show her support" to a belligerent socialist president whose re-division of the posts has not met with the approval of the majority of French.
The president deserves universal respect, he deserves loyalty, he deserves our support.
"Our duty is to stay by his side," he said, drawing applause.
As a conciliatory gesture, the Prime Minister insisted that his government would not question the controversial French 30-hour working week, despite the heated conjecture of conversation by Emmanuel Macron, the new Chancellor of the Exchequer, who proposed to relax the rules at the beginning of the week.
On Saturday, Hollande asked the Socialists to remain "comrade-in-the-mill" with the government.
But Christiane Taubirova, the Minister of Justice, drew a line under his budget when she appeared at a meeting of rebellious Socialist MPs, where she criticized the Socialist Party for "Francouzi losing faith in the future."
Marine Le Pen, the leader of the extremely conservative right, laughed at the incessant internal disputes among the Socialists when she said she did not anticipate that the new Valls government would last for more than a few months.
Emperor Francois Hollande is naked and Prince Manuel Valls is also. They were forced to form a new government when the previous one did not last until the end of the summer.
"And the new one won't last until the end of autumn or winter," Le Pen told her supporters.
It reiterated its party's call for the dissolution of Parliament, saying that it believed that the party could win an early election and that it was ready to run the country.
The French ruling party suffered a defeat in the municipal elections in March, and in May the extremely conservative right succeeded in the European Parliament elections.
According to a poll by the Journal du Dimanche, 76 percent of French people think that the Socialist Party runs the risk of being divided into several rival factions before the end of Hollande's term of office in 2017.
Pascal Perrineau, a political scientist at Sciences Po University, warned that the French would soon run out of patience if the new socialist government failed to improve the economy and reduce record unemployment.
"It's a limited space for an opportunity, but public opinion must think that there are changes in the situation," he warned.
Otherwise, the situation could get worse.
Hazard and street art will no longer be curtailed by Prague until the election
Amendments to the relevant decrees should be prepared and approved by the new capital city management.
Other gambling establishments will not disappear from the streets of Prague before the local elections, and the city will not restrict street art.
Nor will the dog walk be restricted.
Prague will not be able to prepare and approve changes to the relevant decrees in the council by the October elections.
"Moreover, the decision on the changes should not be made by the current city leadership, which is ending its mandate in a few weeks," said Councillor Lukáš Manhart (TOP 09).
The elimination of gambling on its territory has been decided in the past few weeks by several town halls, such as Prague 5 and 7.
But the gambling hall will not disappear, the gambling decree will not be changed yet.
It is the task of the new leadership of the city after the elections.
Now we would not technically do so, given the deadlines for submitting comments and the like," Manhart explained.
He added that the latest meeting of the current council, which must approve the amendment to the decree, will take place on 11 September.
A referendum on the blanket ban on gambling is planned on the local elections on the local elections of the city districts of Prague 1 and Prague 8.
There is currently a ban on gambling in Prague 2 or Prague 12.
The decree will not be changed for the same reasons in the case of street art, so-called busking.
This is particularly complained about by Prague 1, which has already sent the city hall a proposal for places to extend the current list of banned places.
The musicians are also not wanted by Prague 5 in the vicinity of Anděl.
The decree regulating the walk of dogs is planned by the city for several months, not yet completed.
The location of gaming rooms and the issue of busking are dealt with by the city ordinances.
They can be issued or modified only by the city council.
Councils have only a consultative vote, they are not allowed to issue ordinances themselves.
Last week he placed victory for proponents of Scottish independence at the fingertips' grasp
The Scottish independence campaign was in the danger of making this mistake a third time when it almost put the question of whether the Scots wanted to be rich.
But you don't get to the hearts of Scottish voters by appearing on their wallet, nor do you get their respect when you start threatening them.
The Morality of the New Testament is still alive in Scotland, although few Scots still go to church today.
Scots have a much greater tendency to drive the money-godder off the temple than to have them dictated how to vote.
The head of the Scottish nationalists, Alex Salmond, knows this, which is why he repeatedly asked his opponent, the Unionist Darling, in a televised discussion, whether he was willing to respect the 'sovereign will of the Scottish people's people's 'sovereign' if Scottish voters voted for independence, and to start supporting the single currency for both Scotland and England.
This forced Darling to choose between Scottish civil society and London financiers, and he fell into this trap with a grimace.
Of course, Darling will not support the mandate of the Scottish electorate.
However, the discussion about Scotland's currency would have been more or less neutralised.
What really motivates Scottish voters is the fairness, job opportunities and the defence of the state health service that citizens have for free.
Darling supported London's bankers in the currency and also gave the impression that he would not protest against the privatisation of health care.
The way Salmond said it, "getting into bed with the Conservatives."
This is a very dangerous position for any Scottish politician.
Every Scottish voter knows that Scottish businessmen are in bed with the Conservatives.
This was confirmed by David Cameron, who in Scotland spoke not to voters but to the association of "bosses," to the Confederation of British Industry.
It is becoming clear that Cameron's refusal to debate independence with Scottish Prime Minister Salmondo was a serious mistake for the Unionist campaign.
Cameron thus looks like a cowardly absentee homeowner.
Scots would respect him if he came to the debate with the Scottish Prime Minister.
At least Cameron could say that Scotland could be a "successful independent country."
Alistair Darling can't say that, it's almost a physical pain.
What he says is clear: Scots are not supposed to jump out, and they have to accept what is.
The longest year is 10 months.
Pessimistic start of school according to Miloš Urban
Illustrations for the shortest year
Miloš Urban The longest year
The end was the best of the holidays, the last week that wasn't going anywhere and we were just lying around and wallowing in with the Indian summer, the silence before the storm, the calmness before the stress.
New clothes when you could get from Tuzex, boots from East Germany.
Reading the Fast Arrows, for the fiftieth time, whirring on a bicycle up the mountain by the Imperial to the back of the Vars, somewhere near the tennis courts, no longer hot, the sun stroking its back and shoulders, tapping the farewell rays.
In the evening, a mild nervousness, still a holiday regime, not to sleep until 10:30, in a week it would be worse, the moment before falling asleep would stretch from a few minutes to two hours, then to get up at six-thirty in the morning.
Monday will come.
It doesn't usually rain, on the contrary, summer sneers mischievously sneer in front of the school.
To be mined in the ghostly light on a patch and feel like a plastic figure in a glass paperweight, there's the school, the A.
Zápotocký with monstrous pink plaster, and in front of it old familiar faces as well as a few new ones, boys more oozing, girls more boorish.
There are thugs over there, to avoid them, it's still interesting how infallibly they keep together and how early they are here.
And these mature-looking girls who came in for the jinx are laughing at something now, I guess something has changed in their lives over the holidays, whereas with me everything is the same.
And the new first-graders, some of the nervous and the others, why are they coming in at all?
Because they have to, the educational military obligatory.
So inward, the cool dampness of the floor and the light smell of disinfectant, the poisoned janitor with the mop, unfortunately, the same one that is said to lend the pupil to the tin cabinet key, where you can leave the textbooks and which are still so little.
For a bottle.
The smell of the locker room remains in the memory, now it is not held, it is airy, but in a week it will be worse.
The very idea is the stomach's clenching and a headache.
A head that finds it even harder to embrace the maths curriculum, that diabolical game for the elect, which I'm not one and never will be.
Again, the threes and fours, the nickname fag, hide from rehearsal, fit in from the bench and best be dug up, be there even if it weren't, to exist only as a name in the classroom, and to dream stories of the nicer girls and nicer buildings, about antennas in space, where no one competes with anyone, is atnooning, and undermining anyone's leg.
The longest year is ten months.
And it's only the first day, now as it was years ago.
She let her daughters born die.
She faces exceptional punishment - Novinky.cz
The first birth took place in March 2012 in the public toilets in the bus station in Jihlava.
Without any help, her baby girl was born, which she wrapped in a prepared blanket after cutting the umbilic, hid under her jacket and carried her to a road feeder, where she placed it in the bushes located a few dozen meters from the road.
She gave birth on the way to school
It came to me a little earlier, I guess.
I was on my way to school.
On the bus, I felt the need to go to the bathroom, that's where I gave birth.
She was born alive, looking at me.
I cut the umbilical cord with scissors, which I wore to school," the defendant described, stating that she was said to be ashamed of her pregnancy.
"The following day returned to the site, put the body of the child in a backpack and took it away, removed the body from the backpack, wrapped it in a black plastic bag and hid it and left it under the staircase in her grandmother's house in Havlíčkův Brod," the lawsuit reads, noting that it is not entirely clear when the death of the newborn was taken.
It could have been in tens of minutes, but also a few hours after giving birth, as we wade by covering with a blanket, or putting under a jacket, hypothermia, or bleeding from a unbound umbilical cord.
A similar scenario was repeated next spring.
The woman at the undetected time from February to 12 April, when the child's corpse was found by accident witnesses under the bush at the pond in Havlíčkobrodsko, was again secretly born.
This time in the bathroom of the attic apartment in the family home.
Without checking to see if it had been born alive without cutting and disguising the umbilic that had been wrapped around the neck, she put the child in several plastic wrappers, including a plastic bag, and left it in the bathroom.
He was then taken to the pond in the afternoon with his partner at the time.
She was eventually given in by a friend
The father of both children was the defendant's friend, who was allegedly unaware of the partner's pregnancies.
For that reason too, he is not now in court, only he has been punished for a transgression against the Funerals Act.
He was also the one who later turned to the police.
I don't like the fact that he's not being punished as an accomplice.
He manipulated the child against my wishes.
I know my solution was wrong, but it felt human at the time," the defendant, who was allegedly subject to and fear for the man's relationship, did not hide the outrage.
In the course of her testimony, the young woman spoke quite evenly.
Tears into her eyes were only brought to her eyes by the moment she spoke of a relationship with her parents, from whom she had gone when she reached her age.
She said she didn't want to kill
"They come to me every 14 days to visit, they do everything for me, even though I know I don't deserve it," she sobbed.
I didn't get a kit because I didn't want kids, I felt young.
I was always going to put him in a babygrow, but I don't know what happened that I didn't do that.
I can't explain that to you," she said to the judge.
However, she denied that she acted with the thought and intention of killing the newborn.
In addition, the second child was believed to have been stillborn.
Even in pregnancy, she did not stop drinking alcohol.
But I limited it.
And she didn't drink hard.
I have also restricted smoking," she said.
Although the pregnancy was visible in both cases, she told everyone, even to repeated questions, that she had a medical condition, that she was waterlogged.
And my friend.
The main trial will continue at the court in Hradec on Tuesday with testimony from forensic experts.
By Wednesday, a verdict could be handed down.
The woman is at risk of a sentence of up to 18 years in prison, or even an exceptional sentence.
Norwegian Cruise approaches $3 billion buyout to Prestige Cruise
According to sources briefed on the matter, Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings s.r.o. (NCHL.O.), the third largest cruise liner in the world, in the negotiation of the purchase of Prestige Cruises International Inc. for approximately $3 billion.
Trade by Norwegian Cruise, a market value company of $6.8 billion that competes with greater competition from the Royal Carrebian Cruises s.r.o. (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N), gave access to the luxury cruise ships of Prestige Cruises and the wealthy clientele.
The deal may be made public as early as this week, a source revealed on Sunday, but pointed out that the negotiations still may not end successfully.
The owner of Prestige Cruises, the private investment company Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N), also owns a 20 percent stake in Norwegian Cruise.
Sources did not wish to be named because the negotiations are not public.
Representatives of Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to the requests for comment, a spokesman for Apollo declined to comment.
Norwegian Cruise, based in Miami, operates thirteen cruise ships on cruise in North America, the Mediterranean and the Baltic Sea, Central America and the Caribbean.
The company's revenue in 2013 was $2.57 billion, 13% more than in 2012.
Prestige Cruises operates under the Oceania and Regent brands, which together own eight cruise ships sailing to Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
The company announced sales of $1.2 billion in 2013, 6% more than in the previous year.
The twenty-nine billion-dollar segment of cruise cruises is expected to profit from the rise of the middle class in growing economies like China and India in the coming year.
Companies compete to become the preferred choice of cruise sailing for these customers.
Prestige Cruises registered its first public offer with the US regulatory authorities in January 2014.
Apollo has had a majority stake in the company since 2007 of the deal worth $850 million.
Norwegian Cruise has been in existence in its current form since the merger with the cruise operator owned by Genting Bhd (GENT.KL), a consortium of leisure and casinos-drinkers controlled by Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thay.
In 2008, Apollo invested $1 billion in Norwegian Cruise.
Norwegian Cruise listed the shares on the stock exchange in January 2013.
According to the registration with the regulatory authorities at the end of June, Genting held a capital shareholding of 28%, Apollo 20 % and the private investment company TPG Capital LP 8%.
According to the registration dossier, the first public offers include a combined 82% of the volume of North American passengers.
Pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong provoke Chinese authorities the day after vote decision
Nearby, a group of people loyal to Beijing were standing around who were waving the Chinese flag.
The Permanent Commission of the National People's Congress approved on Sunday that only two of the three candidates should participate in the 2017 elections in Hong Kong.
All candidates must first receive the support of the appointment committee, which is likely to be made up of members of the faithful Beijing.
Because of this decision, it is almost impossible for opposition Democrats to get on the ballot and get pro-democratic activists to renew their promise and cripple Hong Kong's financial center with the protests of the "Opening of the Centre."
In Hong Kong, political reform is the main cause of tensions, with Chinese leaders fear that the demand for democratization will be extended to other cities.
After Beijing released a detailed report outlining China's official authority in Hong Kong in June, Democratic activists held an unofficial referendum on the elections in a special official district, and hundreds of thousands of people marched into and occupied the city's business district.
The press conference, which will be attended by Prime Minister Li, is organised by the government in Hong Kong and the Chinese Liaison Office in Hong Kong.
During the day, the vice-chairman of the Standing Committee of the Legislative Commission, Zhang Ronghsun, and the Deputy Director of the State Board of the Hong Kong Affairs and Macau Feng Wei, were also scheduled to speak at several press conferences.
Studensk activists said they would gather in front of the Hong Kong government's office in the afternoon.
Until the last days of the colonial government 150 years ago, Britain has never mentioned democracy in Hong Kong.
Putin asks Kiev to begin negotiations with eastern Ukraine on "state sovereignty"
According to a Russian newspaper's description of events, Russian President Vladimir Putin asked on Sunday for the Ukrainian government to halt fighting with the separatists in the east of the country and immediately launch negotiations on the "state sovereignty" of the secreted areas of the secreted regions.
His spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, later explained that Putin's remark had no intention of indicating that the areas of eastern Ukraine under the control of the separatists would become part of Russia, but that their status within Ukraine should be overturned in order for the Russian-speaking area to be given the power to protect its rights and interests.
Putin's call to the Kiev government to deal with pro-Russian rebels as equals responds to an apparent strategy that follows it since the unrest broke out five months ago: Help the separatists to occupy the territory and give the Ukrainian government to give the newly declared Novorum to effectively independence so that it can ally with Russia instead of the West.
In an interview with the first channel of state television, Putin condemned Ukrainian military actions to reclaim the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, which were taken over by the separatists in March and April after Moscow annexed the Crimean Peninsula belonging to Ukraine on March 18.
The Kremlin and the separatists described the recently occupied territory as "Novorjsko" or "New Russia," a term that refers to the famous pre-revolutionary days of the Russian Empire.
The Russian Itar-Tass news agency published Putin's words that the "prisoner of the Illusions" is anyone who believes that peace negotiations are on the horizon because Ukrainian politicians started the parliamentary elections on the table. October campaigns, while government troops are attacking the civilian population in areas controlled by the separatists.
"In the interest of the people living in these areas, we must immediately launch meaningful negotiations, not only about legal matters, but also about the political organisation of society and the status of state sovereignty of the state of the southeast of Ukraine," he said.
Peskov said Putin's allusion to state sovereignty was meant in the context of broader autonomy, which has been discussed with Kiev's leadership for months, to alleviate the concerns of the Russian-speaking areas of endangering cultural and linguistic rights.
Peskov said that only the Ukrainian government could grant the necessary autonomy to the eastern regions.
This is not a matter of negotiation between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov said, "because this is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but an internal Ukrainian conflict."
The Kremlin spokesman's action to correct the "unitly interpretation" of Putin's remarks highlighted the approach of Russia's leadership to address the separatist uprising in the east, which is different from the open seizure of Crimea, where most of the two million-strong population of originate rank as ethnic Russians.
Moscow would have much more difficulty in annexing Donetsk and Luhansk in eastern Ukraine, as most of the 6.5 million people are not Russians, and the opinion polls that took place before the conflict showed broad support for remaining in Ukraine.
The autonomy that Russian diplomats discussed in international fora would give regional governments in Ukraine the power to determine their own trade agreements and international relations, essentially giving the Kremlin effective control of the territory that would link the Russian mainland to Crimea.
The Black Sea Peninsula annexed five months ago is the seat of Russia's main naval fleet, maritime trade facilities and historic coastal resorts.
The areas between Russia's Rostov and Crimea are also a centre of mines, factories and foundries that produce important components for the Russian military.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko during his inauguration speech from 7. In June, he proposed that Ukrainian lawmakers - after the new elections - consider changes to the constitution that would give diverse regions more control over their finances and language statuses.
But this vision of autonomy differs greatly from that of the Kremlin and the separatists. Moscow is accused of arming and inciting violence.
Putin's final call for Kiev to deal with the separatists as equals followed the rebels' next move last week after Russian troops and tanks from a previously quiet area across the Sea of Azov.
The separatists, reinforced by the Russians, have taken control of Novoazovsk with such force that the Ukrainian security authorities fear that this is a campaign to occupy the strategic coastal territory as far as Crimea.
This hastened the huge civilian and military effort to fortify Mariupol, a port with metallurgical combinations of 500,000 inhabitants, which lies between Novoazovsk and the narrow entrance gate to the Crimean Peninsula.
Poroshenko spoke at the European Union's leading meeting in Brussels on Saturday, urging action to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, the former Soviet republic, which has been independent for the last 23 years.
"We are approaching a point from which there is no return," Poroshenko warned.
Ukraine now houses thousands of foreign military units and hundreds of foreign tanks.
The EU summit has not taken any definitive steps - leaders are calling for additional sanctions to be taken against Russia in the event of an unspecified escalation of the Ukrainian crisis.
Colonel Andriy Lysenko, a spokesman for Ukraine's National Security and Defence Council on Saturday told reporters in Kiev that Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Ilovaysk after two columns of Russian armored vehicles and 1,000 military units infiltrated the Donetsk region to support the besieged separatists.
The first of the 63 reported Ukrainian soldiers who were captured in Ilovaysk in the Russian invasion were exchanged on Sunday for 10 Russian paratroopers captured in the hinterland of Ukraine a week ago, Lysenko said on Sunday.
In the scandal with the exposed photos, Australian celebrities and Gabi Grecko are also involved
Geoffrey Edelsten expressed his disgust at the hackers who probably stole intimate pictures of his fiancée Gabi Grecko and other influential Hollywood stars.
Tinseltown is in shock after a series of explicit photos of Jennifer Lawrence's, a series of explicit pictures of Jennifer Lawrence went online in the biggest scandal of hacked photos.
Hacker claims to have sixty photos with the nude star Hunger Games Lawrenc and other stars, including Kate Upton and Cary Delevingne, singers Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Ley Michell, and actress Kirsten Dunst.
The escape from iCloud reportedly made public images by Australian actresses Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovski and Melbourne actress Grecko.
There are 101 celebrities on the list.
Edelsten, who proposed to Greco last month, told Confidential magazine, "It's disgusting."
All private correspondence and all private images should remain private.
It is a shame that personal information can be stolen and disseminated to the public.
Greco, now in New York, told online newspapers, according to the online newsagent that the hacking was "shameless" and those who have become his target "seem humiliation."
The hacker is believed to have obtained 30 pictures of Palmer with ex-boyfriend Scott Speedman, including two pictures of topless sprawl by the pool.
Palmer, for example, starred in Love and Honor, where she was her counterpart, Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, TV series star Chuck Strahovski and actress from the thriller Sucker Punch Browning, did not comment on the stolen pictures yesterday.
A representative of Lawrence TMZ said, "This is a clear breach of privacy."
Actor Seth Rogen criticized the hacker on his Twitter page: "Publishing photos from hacked phones is exactly the same as selling stolen goods."
From a legal standpoint, the publication of the stolen images should not be tolerated.
The Socceroos made up for the Likhs, even without a win
Olomouc - Thunder and lightning, which the co-owner of the Olomouc Sigma, Josef Lébr, sent to his subordinates last week, seems to be a thing of the past.
Although they brought in at the end only a point for a scoreless draw from Opava.
By deploying and belligerence, they made the club's boss a little more at the do.
Paying money could soon come to the club.
"I'll keep one more game as I talked about last week, but I'm much more optimistic," Lébr confirmed that despite the fact that Sigma did not win, the players convinced him with an improved performance.
The combativeness and commitment we played with mainly in the second half was exactly what I wanted to see from the players.
In that case, I am able to forgive that it will not be won.
If only we had played like that since the beginning of the season, I am convinced that we have not lost yet," thinks Lébr.
Sigma stepped up the home side's initial pressure at Opava, then levelled the game and was better in the second half.
After the victory, Kalvodo's charges reached, but they didn't make the goal of their options, so they couldn't win.
The result is not to our liking.
To complete satisfaction, however, we lacked only one converted chance," said Lébr, who does not think that the change in the attitude of the footballers was caused only by his threat.
There were definitely more aspects.
Whether from my side, from the coach or the fans," Lébr said.
The pressure must be taken into account by Sigma
Players didn't want to comment much after the Opava game of last week's events.
I'm trying to put these things away.
I tried not to admit it," said the young goalkeeper, Michal Reichl, shaking his head.
No commented completely, the question was then left to the Lebar statement from last week by striker Václav Vašíček, who did not convert Sigma's biggest opportunity in Saturday's match.
Eventually, however, he did talk a little about the pressure.
We'll be under pressure all the time.
Everybody wants to pull out on us.
Today we showed that if we fight and all of us go through the ass, it will work," he said.
The warnings were taken to heart
Nor did coach Leoš Kalvoda hide the fact that the preparation for the match was not the easiest given the atmosphere in Olomouc last week.
It was pretty hard.
But I think the boys realized that, and today you could see that Mr. Lébro's warning was taken to heart.
Although even before, it wasn't about not wanting to fight and flogged it," the Olomouc coach said.
It was similar to the first fifteen minutes today.
It took a while to get even with toughness and realize what the second league was about.
That it's not just about football, it's about the fight," Kalvoda said.
One can only hope that in the next few games it will work from the start.
"I'd love to believe that," he added.
