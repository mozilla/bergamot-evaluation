Petr Čech: Transfer at the last minute?
Possible is everything
Today is the last day to jump through the transfer window and make a big transfer.
The next chance comes in the winter.
Petr Cech, currently substitute goalkeeper for Chelsea, is now not sitting over a new professional contract in Madrid, Monaco or Paris.
He sits in the Smichov NH Hotel, talks with Czech journalists and is going with the Czech national team for a game rehearsal with the Americans and then also for a sharp start of Euro 2016 qualification against the Netherlands.
In the goal for Chelsea, Thibaut Courtois is preferred in the new Premier League season, with the Czech Republic making the position of substitute for the first time in a decade at the London club.
It was speculated some time ago that Real Madrid might be interested in the Czech.
He lost the Spanish Super Cup in the early part of the season in the draw with Atlético and failed to make the start of the league season, losing 2-4 to San Sebastián.
There was also speculation about the interest of Paris SG.
He was relegated to the French league season with two wins and two draws, scoring off St. Louis on Sunday. Etienne 5-0.
Relatively the shoe is pushed the club AS Monaco.
He has a 1-1-2 record in the league so far and broke up with Lille at the weekend with a 2-1 amicable role.
Reports jumped out on the English tabloids today that the Czech could be wanted in Queens Park Rangers.
According to English bookmakers, however, the Czech's departure from Chelsea at the last minute is not very likely.
Skybet set him a 4-1 odds.
Peter, is it possible that you will change the jersey within the next few hours?
I'm not counting on it, but there's never a 100% record of anything in football.
Perhaps during the day there will be an offer that will not be refused.
What would such an offer look like?
(laughs) "Well, I don't know yet how such an offer that can't be rejected actually looks like.
There would have to be a consensus from all sides First of all, it would depend on Chelsea's stance, whether or not the club would deal with any offer.
Is it even technically feasible to make such a transfer now that you are in Prague?
Wouldn't it be necessary for you to sign a possible new contract somewhere in the new site?
I didn't think about it.
But in that situation there are a lot of players today, they're all at the representative reunions and I'm sure a lot of transfers will be closed today.
So somehow it would be feasible.
How many clubs are there on the planet that could afford you?
Well, I really don't know.
So you're not pressuring you to leave?
The situation where I didn't catch in the first three games of the new season is new for me after 15 years of my career.
However, there is no reason to panic, pack up and go somewhere.
I want to continue to participate in the Chelsea goalkeeper's duel and it is up to the coach who he chooses, what decisions he makes over the next few weeks.
What is the role of the family in your decision?
I take all the factors into account.
The important thing for me is, of course, a sporting aspect, but I also look at it from the personal side to which the family's needs of course belong.
Is it possible that you would catch another club in England?
That's a question I thought would never be about.
But in football, anything is possible.
I don't want to rule out anything.
I don't know the answer.
Prime Ministers of India and Japan at a meeting in Tokyo

According to the rapporteurs of India, he also hopes that the two nations will agree on cooperation on defence issues.
Police in Karrata arrested a 20-year-old young man after a motorcycle chase
The bike was halted after a zone with a maximum speed limit of 70 km/h rushing 125 km/h and drove into the bush to escape the officers.
In Karrata, the traffic police tried to stop a blue motorcycle at the side of the road in Karrata when they noticed that the exit from the service station on Bathgate Road was going 125 km/h.
According to police, the driver did not stop and proceeded after Burgess Road and then turned into the bush, so the officers lost sight of him.
The bike and the driver's description were then spotted at a house in Walcott Way, Bulgara.
Karrathsk police charged the 20-year-old with disobeying a call to stop and careless driving.
He will stand trial in Karrat on September 23.
The motorcycle was confiscated for three months.
George Webster accused of rape at hotels in Nairn and Pitlochry
The man will be brought to justice on charges of raping women in two hotels.
George Webster, 28, was briefed on the charge during a hearing at the Glasgow Supreme Court.
He reportedly had 7. June 2013 at Scotland's Hotel in Pitlochry, Perthshire, rape a woman.
According to the claim, Webster attacked her while she "were not conscious, sleeping and not in a state of consent."
Webster is being prosecuted for the rape of another woman at the Golf View Hotel in the Nairn of the Scottish Highlands on 4 May 2014.
Judge Lady Rae set the trial date for 17 November before the Supreme Court in Edinburgh.
Restoring the very American ideal that labour rights are also human rights
Congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis proposed a bill to protect trade unionist organizing as a civil right.
"The way the unions work, the jobs for the middle class are working," says Ellison, the Democratic senator for Minnesota, who is the co-chair of the Congressional Committee.
That is why I am so proud that, together with the model of occasional rights, I can present the law empowering the staff.
This groundbreaking legislation will give workers the same legal options to prevent discrimination in organizing trade unions, as in other forms of discrimination - and stop the anti-Union forces
Amend the law on labour relations to allow all employees who face discrimination if they want to join the trade unions to sue in the civil court - and sue for compensation or damages - is the right and necessary initiative.
But it is certainly not a radical initiative - at least not by American standards.
The best way to understand what Ellison, Lewis, and other proponents are putting forward in the law is to re-establish the American ideal.
Despite the trade union struggles that have taken place in recent years - in Wisconsin, Michigan, and other nations - Americans once supported countries around the world to adopt, expand, and respect labour rights.
There were times, and millions of Americans still remembering them, with the country advocating democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and the right to assembly.
When the United States seized Japan after World War II, General Douglas MacArthur and his advisers supported the country to adopt a constitution designed to ensure that the military autocracy of Hideki Toja was replaced by democracy.
They were convinced that the staff and their unions played a role in shaping the new Japan, encompassing the language, and openly acknowledging that "the right of employees to gather, collectively negotiate and act is guaranteed."
When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his advisers urged the Germans to create a constitution to ensure that Adolf Hitler's fascism would be replaced by a strong democracy.
The Germans were aware that staff would need to be organised and promoted in the new nation, and therefore included a clause that openly said: "The right to create associations that will safeguard and improve working and economic conditions will be guaranteed to every individual and every profession or profession or profession.
Arranges that restrict this right or seek to be harmed by it will be revoked. Measures leading to such a purpose are illegal.
When former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt chaired the International Human Rights Commission, which proposed the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which was adopted by the United Nations as a global treaty in 1948, the proponents and Roosevelt included a guarantee that "everyone has the right to form and enter into trade unions to protect their interests."
Americans have accepted the basic premise of labour rights being human rights.
When the country advised other countries on how to create a civic and democratic society, the Americans explained that the right to create labour unions - and their participation in collective bargaining with companies and government agencies in the position of an equal partner - must be protected.
Now that these rights are being challenged in America, it is definitely necessary to return to the American ideal that working people must have the right to organize and promote themselves in a free and open society.
As the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr said fifty years ago:
History is a great teacher.
Today, everyone knows that the unions have not diminished the nation's strength, but have expanded it.
They increased the standard of living for millions of people, created the market for industry, and raised production to an unsuspected level.
Those who attack the unions forget these simple truths, but history remembers them.
History does not forget, and we would not.
The formal recognition of labour rights as human - and the extension of the protection of civil rights to prevent discrimination in organising trade unions - is overdue.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis are rebuilding the ideals that have raised America and made it a true promise of democracy.
The judge temporarily blocked a law that could have closed all abortion clinics in Louisiana
A federal judge on Sunday temporarily blocked the Louisiana law, which the attorneys say would likely close all five clinics performing abortions in the state.
A regulation enacted by the signature of Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal in June, to come into force on 1 September, would require abortion doctors to have the right to receive a patient in a hospital within 30 miles of their practice.
The judge's order means that doctors can temporarily continue to carry out legal abortions and must obtain the authorisation in the meantime.
"The nominating party will be able to lawfully run its activities and obtain a permit in the meantime," reads the order of federal Judge John deGravels.
The hearing will be scheduled in one month for the judge to issue a more permanent resolution on the law.
The activists for the rights to abortion of the resolution, which is the latest in a series of similar measures, welcomed and said it would give the doctors more time to obtain a permit.
"Today's decision makes women in Louisiana safe from the tricky law to deprive them of their health and their rights," said Nancy Northup, the president and executive director of the Center for Reproductive Rights, who sued for the law from the lawsuit to be blocked by lawsuit.
It was not immediately clear whether the decision also involved the doctors from the two clinics that were not among the plaintiffs, and they were also seeking this authorisation.
Louisiana is among eleven states that have passed similar laws, with the Alabama and Mississippi courts declaring such measures to be unconstitutional.
Key parts of the Texas law that would close most of the remaining clinics in the state were blocked by federal judges on Friday.
Fighters for women's rights to have abortions, together with the Association of American Perciates and Gynecologists and Gynecologists and the American Medical Association, argue that the need to have this permission makes it possible for doctors to make demands that are not necessary medically.
Opponents of abortion countered that the measures were aimed at protecting women's health, and some also welcomed the fact that the clinics would be closed for the measures.
The Center for Reproductive Rights said that only one doctor performing abortion was authorised in Louisiana.
If all the doctors in the state were forced to stop performing abortions, this doctor would also, for fear of his safety, stop performing the procedure, the group said.
In response, the Louisiana authorities said they would not punish the doctors who perform the abortions while awaiting the processing of the application for rights.
Due to late diagnosis and poor availability of treatment, ovarian cancer kills in the countryside more often
Angelina Jolie and her brother James released a video of the tribute to his late mother, who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
Women in the Australian countryside are at a higher risk of dying of ovarian cancer than in their counterparts in the city.
Researchers analyzed the medical records of more than 1100 Australians diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2005 and found that only 35% lived for five years after diagnosis.
Research director Susan Jordan of the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute said that women in rural and remote areas of the state were about twenty percent more likely to die during the study than in women in urban areas.
MALÁ STUDY: New drugs may slow down lung and ovarian cancer
Researchers followed the women during seven years of treatment.
Dr. Jordan said the chances of survival were influenced by the age of women at the time of diagnosis, the type of ovarian cancer, other existing diseases, and socio-economic status.
The lowest survival rates occurred in older women who were diagnosed with cancer at a more advanced stage.
Women in rural and remote areas of the state were about twenty percent more likely to die during the study than in women in urban areas.
Although the study was not designed to determine why women living outside the city were more likely to die from ovarian cancer, Dr. Jordan argues that the factors may be late diagnosis and poor availability of treatment.
"Nicketers are best treated by gynaeconcologists who are usually residing in larger cities," she said.
Despite improvements in remote medical services to cross the distance barrier, the doctor has proposed to help boost the transport service to be able to treat women closer to their homes for specialists and programs to support people who are being treated far from their families and friends.
Dr. Jordan said the study revealed that the long-term survival of ovarian cancer women is low regardless of geography, highlighting the need for better treatment and preventive programs.
Research funded by the Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer cancer will be published today by the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2012, at the age of 33, young mother Elisha Neave of the Gold Coast was diagnosed with an aggressive form of ovarian cancer.
Garden centres regret reducing the number of homeowners
According to a HTA study published by the Financial Times, the drop associated with the extraordinary decline of homeowners under the age of 35 could lead to the fact that when today's young generation of consumers reaches the "lead age group of gardeners," garden centres will lose up to £10 million a year.
According to the report, people who rent out housing spend on average 55% of the amount spent on their own people living in their own.
As other factors threatening the sector, which makes an estimated £5 billion a year, the increase in the number of people living in very urbanised areas, where there are no gardens, the popularity of paving instead of the front gardens is not popularity, the likes of paving houses used as a parking space and a shrinking size of gardens.
In the area of Greater London, where the share of homeownership has fallen from 61% to 43% in six years, the lowest household expenditure on gardening products in Britain is the lowest per household.
HTA and the Royal Horticultural Society have stated that lodging or lack of space does not mean that people could not grow plants.
Guy Barter, the chief hilarious horticultural adviser to the RHS, said: "For tenants, growing potted plants is very popular - when they move, they can take the plants with them."
The HTA report revealed that the "golden age" of the horticultural retail sector was between 1997 and 2005 and was the result of a higher share of homeowners and economic prosperity lasting from the 1980s to the mid-1990s.
He also forecasts a higher sales this year thanks to the better weather that came after adverse conditions in March and April.
When the Eastern dictator preaches about democracy.
Having rattled Putin's youth organization at the reunion, which reminds me most of all of the Hitler Youth, he rattled with atomic weapons and basically let everyone know that he didn't give a damn about their views, he gave us a lecture on democracy today.
But I have a feeling that the current regime in Russia exhibits many features of the fascist state.
The great nations have one thing in common, and that is that they can be dominated by both tense nationalism and that they can transform the inferiority complex into imperialist appetites.
Time passes in the east in a different way from the west.
While the Western world thought the time of the wars of domineering Europe was long gone, in the East, on the contrary, they think they had been overlooked for a long time and had to be reclaimed for a long time.
Such mood and frustration reigned in Germany in the 1930s, just before the Nazis seized power, followed by an explosion of nationalism unlike today's situation in Russia.
And then the very identical cult of a strong leader, the thrashing of journalists, the liquidation of inconvenient political opponents, discrimination against minorities and homosexuals, is quite similar, so to be quite similar.
Vladimir Putin, and certainly a large proportion of Russians, may be missing for a time when Russia ruled halfway around the world and the other part was shaking.
I guess Western politicians brought this on themselves, maybe patted little on the shoulders of Vladimir, maybe they didn't invite him where he wanted to go and maybe they started to underestimate him, and he just acted like a typical Russian man.
He made order at home, pretending that he didn't really want to go anywhere, sharpening his knives at home.
Now he decided to take back the lost position.
He starts slowly, he has time.
He's probably the leader for life, so what's he'd be in for a hurry.
He's trodden the Caucasus, now he's trampling the Ukrainians, then the midgets of the Baltics are next.
They've been stinging the Russian bear in their fur long enough.
This will surely be noticed by China, which is jumping up too much and is certainly making a crush on the far east.
And the Germans are also pretty upset by that Vladimir, how well they're doing and we gave them a spank at the age of 45.
How about doing one new Novorosija in Karlovy Vary.
That would be the base and ours there are a lot of them and as they are depressed by the dachuke they already wanted to demolish some of them.
After all, our veterans still remember how they had in that Czechoslovakia.
Nu vot, for their Prime Minister Gospodin Sobotka, he is so soft, can be peeled like onions and I eat all of their EU.
That would play to make a big Russia jump-and-go.
They need to be reminded of where their place is.
And as a detonator, we will use our compatriots who live in their territory.
There are enough Russians everywhere, and when they say they're being oppressed, they just oppress them and we don't let that happen, we'll protect them.
And again, the Russian will rule, what else is born to be.
After all, Europe is only as good as a preposition that a proud Ivan can dance to a Cossack.
Turkey summons US diplomat for espionage report
Turkey's foreign secretary called in the country's highest-ranking US diplomat to explain the report on American and British espionage activity in Turkey.
The Deputy Prime Minister Bulent said the US charge d'affaires and Turkish civil servants discussed the report on Monday.
The German magazine Der Spiegel and the online magazine The Intercept reported that according to documents provided by the former analyst of the US National Security Agency, Turkey was a priority target for US and British intelligence services.
According to Turkish media, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan downplayed the importance of the report, saying that all major states were following each other.
The earlier report, according to which Ankara was also targeted by the German intelligence service, sparked a more indignant reaction from the Turkish government.
Game of Thrones series presents more tricks of the fourth series
Game of Thrones creators are currently filming episodes of the fifth orders of the cult series.
At the same time, they boasted about how the fourth series tricks were created.
The most visible are the computer editing of the series environment and the mass scene, when a bunch of soldiers become the giant army of the famous Daenerys.
Magaluf Police Director charged with corruption
On Friday, the complainants presented the Mallorcuri Attorney's Office with evidence of blackmail by police and city hall civil servants in the Calvia self-government district.
The director of the Calvia Police on the holiday island of Mallorca was arrested after being charged by businessmen and bar owners at the infamous party district of Magaluf.
Chief Inspector José Antonio Navarro was taken into pre-trial detention after being charged with corruption charges against him by several businessmen from Punta Ballena, a street in which most of the bars and nightspots in Magaluf are located.
According to the Mallorca Diario online newspaper, on Friday, the complainants presented evidence to the prosecutor of the Mallorcuan's corruption office against corruption allegations of blackmail by police and state council officials in the Calvia self-government area.
Two other local police officers have been arrested by Spanish state police for links to corruption charges and will be interviewed by a judge and he and Navarre will be interviewed by a judge.
Spain's national daily ABC quoted disgruntled owners of night-time businesses as saying that favouritism by public officials has serious repercussions for their business.
"It's not about making money anymore, it's about making money," one of the businessmen said in court.
Don't play with our livelihood.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf made it to the top pages of magazines worldwide after a video of an 18-year-old British tourist who provided oral sex to 24 men during a tour of bars.
Island authorities have since been trying to oversee drunks and rioters in the ranks of holiday party attendees in Magaful by reducing the number of not-so-known alcohol-famous booths touring.
In addition, the Playhouse Club, where the event was given to the preschough, was forced to close for a year and, together with the organisers of the Carnage-goal, a fine of €55,000 ($73,000).
The tourist resort Magaluf, which is particularly popular with the British, has also witnessed many alcohol-fuelled accidents, including the fashion wave known as "balconing," in which people jump from one balcony to the other or from the balcony to the hotel's swimming pool.
The first day of spring marked by rain and thunderstorms that had an impact on the flight at Adelaide Airport
JARO gave South Australia's south an icy surprise, coming in with heavy rain and a fierce wind that seriously hit the Adelaide airport.
Another 5 mm of precipitation is expected to fall in the city until 9 p.m. and another 6.6 mm will fall during the night on Sunday.
The last rain was introduced together with a few short showers combined with thunderstorms and gusts of wind, which began before 8 p.m. in the evening and brought in almost 4 mm of precipitation in about ten minutes.
After several early doses of spring arrived after the winter last week, temperatures in the city dropped again to just 15.8°C on Monday.
The storm weather is believed to have contributed to the delayed arrival of Virgin Airlines from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The plane was scheduled to land a little after 19:30, but was hit by a change in wind speed or direction over short distances and was forced to postpone the landing.
Wind gusts at the Adelaide airport at that time reached a speed of about 50 km/h on the ground.
Flight data showed that the plane had to abandon the second landing and eventually touched down at about 20:40 a.m.
The delay in the plane was subsequently delayed by other flights, including a flight from Emirates from Dubai and a Qantas flight from Sydney.
The Adelaide temperature is expected to reach a maximum of 16°C in Adelaide on Tuesday and one or two showers may appear.
Israeli children return to school after the Gaza war
Thousands of Israeli children from areas near the Gaza Strip returned to school on Monday after spending the summer in anti-combard shelters, while rockets and mortars attacked their homes during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas. However, schools in Gaza remain closed while the territory is recovering from the fighting.
The start of the school brought a sense of joy and excitement to the communities in the south of Israel marked by attacks, but the signs of the fighting are still evident.
In Asidod, a city in the country's south, the kindergarten staff hit by a rocket has removed the remnants of shrapnel from the wall, and are slowly awaiting the children's return.
"We're a little scared, but other than that, we're looking forward to it," said Ronit Bart, a kibbutz resident of Saad and an English teacher at the local school.
A lot of kids in this area really need to get back to their daily routine.
Her 11-year-old daughter, Shani Bart, revealed that "it's a little strange" to go to school all of a sudden.
"We had some rough moments and never left the house," she said.
Kibuc, located close to the Gaza border, was visited by President Reuven Rivlin to offer his support to the residents.
Until the cease-fire ended last week, the thousands of residents of border settlements like Saad remained inside their homes or left their homes and set off in safer areas farther from Gaza to escape rockets and mortars.
Many residents of Nachal Oz, a village close to the Gaza border in which a Palestinian mortar missile killed a four-year-old boy, is hesitant to return.
The Education Minister said that about a dozen families have still not returned.
Their children were temporarily placed in replacement schools.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited the school in Sderot, a city on the Gaza border, which was heavily hit by Palestinian fire.
He encouraged the children to study diligently, adding, "We will provide you with education and security."
Israel and Hamas agreed on an unlimited amount last Tuesday.
While the cease-fire led to an immediate end to the fighting, it did not solve key challenges as Hamas's demand to end the Israeli-Egyptian blockade of Gaza and the reopening of Gaza's airports and ports.
Israel is demanding the disarmament of Hamas and the return of the bodies of the two soldiers killed in the war.
A new round of indirect negotiations is expected to begin later this month in Egypt.
According to estimates by Palestinians and the UN, more than 2,100 Palestinians died in the war, three-quarters of whom were civilians and at least 494 children.
Israel disputes these figures, estimating that at least half of those killed were radicals, even though it has no clear evidence for these claims.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians, including a Thai worker, died.
Hamas and other Gaza militants fired 4,591 rockets and mortar missiles and mortar missiles at Israeli cities, mainly in the country's south, during the fighting.
The Israeli military, for its part, has carried out more than 5,000 air raids and other attacks.
The Israeli attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in Gaza, and an estimated 250,000 people hid in a hundred UN schools that turned into makeshift shelters.
Because of the tens of thousands of people still in hiding, and due to ongoing fighting, school officials postponed the start of the school year last week.
"I hope they will open the school soon so that we can complete our education as well as the Jewish children and other children in the world," said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old boy from the school's largest city in Gaza.
Willow at the reunion: I stand behind Vácha.
And Lafatu is troubled by the temperature
The Czech national football team met before noon in Prague today before Wednesday's preliminary match with the USA and the subsequent opening match of the European Championship qualifier against the Netherlands.
Of the 23-man cadre, Spartans striker David Lafata, who is suffering from the temperature, is in trouble.
David's not here yet, but Sparta had some problems last week, there were more players involved and David probably still has a little bit of those problems.
But we want him to be here and be all right as soon as possible," coach Pavel Vrba told reporters.
"Whether it's two or three days, or it's already fit tomorrow, that's to be seen by his health, which will be decided by our doctor," he added.
The other players are fine.
"Of course, someone has some kind of a sore, but it's not like they can't train or take part in the match on Wednesday with the USA," the Czech coach said.
On Sunday night, Vrba called up Spartan midfielder Lukáš Vácha as the last player.
He admitted that this had not been an easy decision, with other midfielders.
I decided on the basis that Lukas is a prospective player who is 25 years old.
The decision-making was very difficult, but I stand by it,' said Willow to Vách.
What about Shural?
Let's see what happens to Latatla
It is not excluded that, in the event of health problems, the nomination could still change.
At the weekend, a great performance was flashed by Liberec's Josef Šural, who scored a hat-trick.
Of course, there are players who have been showing form lately.
Let's see how David Lafata is.
In the event that he can't be available on Wednesday, I'm not saying I can't donate to one of the players who impressed in the Czech league," Vrba said.
This afternoon the national team will be training in Strahov, then on Tuesday a classic pre-season training before the duel with the USA on Letná, which will be open to fans and will be followed by an autograph session.
The match with the Americans is played on Wednesday from 20:15 and the national team will aim for a first-ever victory under Willow.
He had played in two draws in the previous three preseason games and lost once.
The qualifying match with the Netherlands is then on 9 September from 8:45 p.m.
Peshice goes to the Dutch in Italy
Willow is happy to have more time to train, unlike in previous meetings.
It's an advantage when you have players for eight days and you can rehearse with them certain things that we might not have had so much time for before.
Now we will only be able to concentrate on getting the best prepared for the Netherlands," Vrba said.
The Dutch will present themselves in Italy on Thursday before the match in Prague and the duel will be watched in person by former interim representative coach Josef Pešice.
He'll give us the information that's coming from the game.
But it won't just be about him, we're going to have the game and we're going to have a shot and we're going to discuss it.
A new coach is coming to the Netherlands, we will see what the changes will be there," Vrba said of the bronze medalists from the recent world championships.
According to high-profile statistics, housing prices rose the most in the last seven years in the winter.
According to the apartment value index in the Australian capital RPD CoreLogic Hedonic, housing prices rose by 1.1% in August, the agency said on Monday.
The increase led to an overall increase for June, July and August to 4.2%, the highest increase in the winter months since 2007.
The annual price increase climbed to 10.9%, more than double in one year to August 2013, but the profit was not evenly spread in the country.
RPD research director Tim Lawless said Sydney and Melbourne are leading the market.
Figures from the RP The data shows that Sydney's housing prices rose by 16.1% last year, while prices in Melbourne rose by 11.7%.
Among the other strongest markets were Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin, with price increases averaging between five and six.
On the other side of the scale were Canberra, which was hurt by a state-mandated reduction in expenditure, where prices rose by only 1.4% during the year.
Lawless said that now that spring has started, the number of properties for sale will increase in the coming months, which will be a "real test" for the market.
"Given the persistent high level of auction sales, generally high sales speeds and low interest rates, the value of housing is likely to increase in the next three months," he said.
Lenny Henry: My father never huged me.
He never said to me "I love you"
Henry was born in 1958 as one of Jamaican's seven children in Dudley, the Midlands.
He and his father, who died when he was 19 and who worked in the factory, had a colder relationship.
Henry is rehearsing a comedy, Rudy's Rare Records, which is partly based on an imaginary interview with his father, and which is part of the Radio 4 series.
The soundtrack is a mixture of reggae and rap and the tune is optimistic.
Henry, however, had to deal with a few unpleasant childhood memories.
After his mother's death, Henry went through a "curdish" therapy, and now he's thinking about his relationship with his father.
He knew precious little about him.
You've never seen his face before, you just heard his voice: "Stop the din.
Leave your sister alone.
Move!
I wanna watch cricket.
My older brothers, Seymour and Hilton - when I was a child, they were adults - would go to the bar with him, discussing things like the shape of a beer glass or the beauty of a cricket strike.
I've never spoken to him like that.
Most of my life, he's been a serious guy in a corner reading a newspaper.
Recently, Henry had visited the Dudley foundry, and although conditions were better than his father's time, he looked into the way life must have been for him.
There's a little more light in there today, but it's still a dark, smoky, gloomy labyrinth where the flames explode and there's a lot of smoke and soot.
Dad would always get in the tub and just lie there, then you could hear him singing slowly to himself because he was washing off the foundry.
When I walked by, I realized he'd been doing this for years to support his family, and I'd come to appreciate him more.
Even so, Henry had a childhood without parental love.
Dad didn't embrace anyone, said "I love you."
It wasn't until my mom was sick and dying that we started to think "I love you, I love you, I love you."
His daughter Billie, whom he has with Dawn French, allowed him to experience the love he lacked as a child.
Can you stop with the "I love you" now?
Don't hire me all the time!
Dad, I'm 22!
With Dawn French.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mom
French, who was married to for 25 years, are still good friends.
Dawn's good.
Why shouldn't Dawn and I be friends?
She's a great mom.
Henry's own mother had diabetes.
It was one of the things that killed her.
So when I was very, very overweight and symptoms of diabetes, the doctor said to me, "You have to make a radical change."
So I started going to a big fitness center, and I also had to go on a drastic diet to get rid of the symptoms.
It's very hard.
And tiring.
Nobody wants to eat all the carrots.
The change in the direction of hying Henry's career may be reflected in his elegant, short-cropped beard.
After receiving acclaim from a critique for his Othello, he immersed himself in the theater.
Comedy of the blueprint and the Fences of August Wilson followed.
It's a different experience than the sitcoms and comedies that filled out his hectic working life.
He started when he was 16 and worked in a factory.
DJ spotted him on stage parodying someone and wrote about him in the New Faces talent show.
His television career began in the mid-70s: "For a long time, I was the only black impersonator/commerce on television."
He was studying as he went.
In addition to being noticed by the public, I also had to learn how to make up working jokes between 1975, and be a star and appear on TV, and that was really hard.
Lenny in New Faces in 1975
Since his manager owned the rights to the stage production of The Black and White Minstrel Show, an entertainment program in which the actors dressed up as blacks, Henry eventually performed in it with his comedy for five years.
My family was already unease about it.
I kind of wish it never happened, but I don't regret it.
Although it was a strange and embarrassing position, I worked on the big stages and learned how to work with the crowd.
What was "the years' award-winning major product of British television" but was also a "grotesque parochial parody of blacks."
In the 1980s, Henry worked in alternative comedy circles and introduced the characters who were both ridiculed and glorified by British black culture.
The Lenny Henry Show's first series began airing in 1984, and in the 1990s, he was known as the chef Gareth Blacklock in the comedy series Chef!.
The next decades were taken up by ads, documentaries, TV series and roles in the movies, but after the BBC's broadcast of his series LennyHenry.tv on the BBC in 2008, he said, "So what are you going to do now, Len, because it looks a little like you're stuck in one place, or you're a little off the road."
Next up was a documentary show on Radio 4 called What's So Great About...?/What's so great about...?
The first was Shakespeare.
I was really allergic to Shakespeare.
We didn't really learn him at school, and I thought it was something for the white middle class.
So I was so worried about it.
Everyone we interviewed on the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench, said, "You should try it."
Don't get involved when you don't know what you're talking about.
Try a few words and see why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry had delivered twenty lines of Othello's closing statement for the documentary, and he was in for it.
It made me feel like I could do it.
It's like it's given me courage.
"That's what it's about. It's a serious matter, take it seriously, learn the lyrics, find out about it.
So the rehearsal was hard, and I'd read the play months and months before.
And it was a success.
It looked like they were in trouble, which they didn't.
He soon began playing in a Comedy of Errors.
Suddenly I was at the National Theatre. I couldn't believe it.
At one point I thought, "You changed."
There was a technical glitch, and Henry instinctively felt he had to take responsibility for the confiscation of the audience.
"The forelick in his head said to me, 'Before he fixes the computer, you must entertain them for ten minutes now.'"
Instead, the theater director announced that the show would continue as soon as the problem was resolved.
I left the stage, and something in me said, "Hm, thank God."
It's not my responsibility.
It could be handled by someone else for me.
"You play, so stay in the role."
Henry in Plotts at Duchess Theatre
Learning the fullback text was a challenge.
Panic is quite good, he adds determination.
The game was also well received, so it's like a sign of God that says, "This is what you should do."
Of course, he says it in a UWN TOWN voice.
So I'm staying with it.
I really like it.
I like to be in the rehearsal room.
Nevertheless, the comedian's brain remains with Henry - he interrupts our interview all the time with humorous performances as he enters and steps out of the role of the imitator.
I decided not to make stand-ups, because having the satisfaction of a room full of strangers is a little dangerous, I'd say.
If you're still looking for something, you can get to a dead end.
Sometimes when I want to, I do Live at the Apollo, but I don't enjoy it as much as I used to.
I asked if he'd ever organize a stand-up tour again.
The joy of sitting in the same room with the director who helps to put out the outlines of the beginning, the middle and the end of the road - I don't think I ever want to give it up.
So, your new incarnation?
I think so.
I enjoy acting.
It's fun.
You keep telling stories, which is great.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Kenya registers civil servants to shine a light on nonexistent employees
Kenya began with the biometric registration of all of her civil servants to try to remove non-existent employees from the government's payroll.
According to the government statement, the employees who are not registering in the next two weeks will stop receiving a payday.
The government believes that thousands of people receive a salary even after they left the civil service.
After taking office in 2013, President Uhuru Kenyatta promised to prevent corruption in the state administration.
An audit carried out this year showed that the state is losing at least $1 million (£700,000) a month to pay for non-existent employees and further misuse of official authority.
The government suspects that salaries continue to be placed on bank accounts even after the employee's death or after the employee leaves the civil service, the BBC's capital, Nairobi, Wanyama Chebusiri, said the BBC's reporter.
All civil servants must report to the identification centres within the next two weeks, where their data will be biometrically recorded, the government statement said.
He goes on to say that anyone who fails to appear without a sufficient apology will be removed from the payroll.
"By storing the real public service staff, this measure will make a significant contribution to its development and will also be used to purify the payroll at both levels of the government, thus resolving the problem of non-existent employees," said Anne Waiguru, secretary of the Ministry of Development and Planning.
Dozens of Turkish police arrested over "conspierging" against government
Local media reports that a total of 33 police officers have been detained in Turkey on suspicion of a "conspiracy against the government."
The police department has yet to comment on the case.
According to the Hurriyet Dail News, there were fourteen high-ranking officials among the detainees.
Some of them were implicated in a corruption investigation in December, which targeted government officials, including four ministers.
In July, several Turkish police officers were arrested for allegedly organizing a criminal gang and telephone eavesdropping.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (at the time the Prime Minister) called their actions part of the actions of the Islamic cleric Fethullah Gülen against him and other people in power.
Not all children returned to school in Ukraine
Most of the schools in Ukraine reopened on Monday (September 1) after the summer holidays.
This day is traditionally important for families, and like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk took his daughter to school.
On this occasion, he told journalists present that not all schools had reopened, but that they were determined to defend the country for the next generation:
Not at all schools was the traditional ceremony for September 1st.
Not all of Ukraine is the peace.
We must fight for peace.
The whole of Ukraine, the combined Ukrainian front, must fight for peace.
Alexan Pastukhov, a teacher at a school in Slavyansk attended by Yatsenyuk's daughter, spoke in Russian.
We hope that peace will finally be achieved here and that children will gain the knowledge that will be useful to them in the future.
The first day of school is traditionally celebrated by the children wearing embroidered shirts, bring balloons and give the teachers flowers.
In Ron Fairhead, the BBC may have found the boss of hard times
It carries with it a cloud of fame from the world of banking, media management, and an internal conclave of the conservative party.
She has experience in the front lines herself.
She began her career with consultants at consultants Bain and Co, then continued through Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and the media world of Pearsons.
For seven years, she was the Financial Times' executive director. She resigned when her senior position at the parent company Pearson's was filled by her younger colleague.
They say her severance package was close to £1 million.
Its political portfolio is also extensive.
She was recommended to David Cameron by Lord Browne, the former director of BP, when Cameron needed a private expert in Whitehall: she became an adviser to the Cabinet Office.
Her husband is a former city council member.
In May, I described the work of the director as a chalice with poison.
Not only is the BBC a large and complex entity at the centre of public life, but there is also an internal paradox in its structure.
The corporation turns two directions: in the top of the BBC's own-led hierarchy, but also out in the public's voice in times of restlessness when things don't work.
This is an almost unsustainable monopoly that calls for a thorough reform.
But what director would risk coming into a company as complex as the Chinese dynasty, dismantling it, and thereby depriving himself of his own work.
It's a tough challenge.
If it hadn't been so hard, a lot of people would have liked to see the BBC getting smaller - its power, its finances - and its revisit its status.
As the competition array expands and the new technology calls into question the old certainties, the immediate negotiation of concession fees for the BBC carries a great danger.
For a modest amount of £145.50 a year, the British public buys a stake in what is surely the world's largest media business.
The BBC tells a good story: it claims that its production reaches 96% of households, each costing only 40pc.
Moreover, the BBC's popularity is clearly rising: to 53% of supporters, up from 31% a decade ago.
BBC services use models have changed: Today, newspaper subtitles are shown on my mobile phone, and I can watch iPlayer on the shows I missed.
But the BBC remains a very beloved and wonderful institution.
She needs an amazing director - I hope she found one.
Texas Governor Perry says he didn't approve the offensive tweet
A tweet from the official Twitter account of Texas Governor Rick Perry, released on Sunday, included an offensive picture of the Democratic Attorney General who initiated Perry's criminal charges for abuse of power.
The tweet was later deleted and another was posted on Perry's account, which distanced itself from the previous one.
A tweet that was not authorized by the postoron left my account.
"I disagree with the tweet and I downloaded it," he said in another post.
Perry's assistants did not respond to the reports asking questions immediately.
Although the tweets were sent from Perry's official account, it is unclear who is actually responsible for administering it.
The previous tweet was posted by an unflattering, humorous picture of Travis County State Representative Rosemary Lehmberg, who was convicted of drunk driving in April 2013.
When she refused to resign, Perry refused to disburse funds for her office, which brought forward to be a possible presidential candidate in the 2016 election this month before a major jury in Austin.
The caption in the tweet read: "I don't always drive with three times higher blood alcohol levels than the permitted limit . . . but if I do, I'll sue Governor Perry for holding me accountable."
I'm the drunkest Democrat in Texas.
The investigation against Perry was not conducted by Lehmberg's office.
He was in charge of Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor from San Antonio who was designated by the Republican judge.
Perry was found not guilty and called the accusation a tactical, political maneuver.
His qualified law team has asked the judge overseeing the case to dismiss the charges because the use of the laws to prosecute the longest-serving governor in Texas' history is unconstitutional.
Perry cut the disbursement of $7.5 million from the state's Public Interest Defending Fund, which is headquartered in Travis County and is prosecuting corruption in Texas, after Lehmberg refused to resign.
The rejection was prompted by a formal complaint from a left-leaning group of civil rights activists.
Perry's official account is active - and sometimes he becomes famous.
After finishing fifth on his party's committee in Iowa during his 2012 presidential campaign, Perry responded to speculation that he might be done by now, tweeting a photo of himself running near the lake, saying, "Here I am, South Carolina!"
According to Berkeley, the housing market is returning to normal
One of London's most prominent developers has warned that the housing market has "reopted" to the normal level of activity in the south-east of England.
Housing in the capital was subject to high demand and rising prices and widespread credit bubble concerns prompted the Bank of England to impose limits on mortgages in June.
Tony Pidgley, founder and chairman of the developer's investment company for discerning clients, Berkeley said on Monday: "From the start of the current financial year, the market has returned from the top point in 2013 to the normal level of transactions."
The London housing market did well during the downturn, as buyers from abroad flooded the capital.
According to data from the Land Registry, prices in the city jumped by 18.5% in the past year alone, far ahead of average of 6.7% in England and throughout Wales.
Average sales prices for private, affordable and student housing from Berkeley rose by about a fifth last year and climbed to £423,000 at the end of April.
However, because of the strengthening pound, they have not been so attractive to foreign buyers of London properties in recent months - some of them have also been intimidated by the introduction of new property taxes and talk of a possible "sublitting tax" that politicians came up with before next May's parliamentary elections.
London real estate agency Foxtons warned last week that the April revision of the mortgage market, which introduced stricter loan rules, would also slow the pace of market growth for property sales and prices during the second half of the year.
New data from the Bank of England on Monday showed a drop in the amount of approved mortgages for the month of July, suggesting that the housing market is calming down.
Hamptons International, another real estate agency, has fallen by the fact that home prices have already started to fall, their forecast for a rise in the price of London properties for 2015 to 3%.
Meanwhile, according to real estate agent WA Ellis, the volume of transactions fell by a quarter each year in London's most expensive neighbourhoods such as Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington.
Still, demand for housing in the capital was a booze for Berkeley as it increased cash for forward sales to more than £2.2 billion.
Pidgley added, "Demand for the right, good-looking housing in a good location has remained the same, and as a result, the forward sale has been maintained."
In June, the company reported that it had sold 3,742 properties from the beginning of the year to the end of April, almost a third more than before the 2007 crisis.
The annual pre-tax profit increased by 40% to £380 million, yields by 18% to £1.6 billion.
Speaking on Monday before the annual meeting of Pidgley, he said it was predicted that Berkeley's annual revenue would be in line with current market expectations.
Analysts agree that the annual pre-tax profit will be £450 million.
Berkeley's shares stopped at £23.96 in the afternoon at the London Stock Exchange.
Hacker posted pictures online of nude Jennifer Lawrence
Jennifer Lawrence arrives for the 85th Academy Awards.
Photos of Oscar winner Jennifer Lawrence were leaked online for a hacker who claimed to have a "list" of photos of hundreds of aspiring actresses.
A spokesman for the "Hunger Games" film star confirmed that the photos of Lawrence were genuine and criticized the hacker for "an obvious privacy breaches."
Authorities have already been contacted and will prosecute anyone who publishes the stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence.
The hacker reportedly acquired the photos, which were originally posted on the 4chan image-sharing server, due to a gap in the Apple iCloud internet storage system. The alleged list of photos of the hacked victims, according to BuzzFeed, includes the names of dozens of stars, including Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Mary-Kate Olsen.
It is unclear how many pictures are authentic, however, the star of "Scott Pilgrim against the rest of the world" was also critical of the act on Twitter.
"I hope those of you who look at the photos my husband and I took in the privacy of your home years ago are happy with each other," Winstead wrote on Twitter.
However, Victoria Justice, known for the Nickolodeon cable series "iCarly" and "Victorious," denied that the photos were genuine. She posted on Twitter, "These alleged nude photos of me are SUJH, people."
Better to cut it out in the prime. *deliberate pun.
Buzzfeed announced on Sunday evening that a spokesman for pop star Ariana Grande had denied that the alleged photographs were genuine.
An extraordinary sample from Howard Jacobson's affowed new novel about love and the letter "J"
They dissolved, that's the best way to describe it, they gradually unfolded like a cardboard box left in the rain.
Only from time to time did a woman tell him that he was too serious, complex, violent, isolated, and perhaps a little irascible.
And then she shook his hand.
Inexcus, he admitted it.
He could sting like a hedgehog, yes.
The last victim of this abilities of his was an incipient love affair that more than ever promised to relieve him of the lonely boredom of his life and perhaps give him some satisfaction.
Ailinn Solomons was a fragile beauty with a wild-haired mane and a fledgling heart from a village on the northern island that was even more remote and inhospitable than Port Reuben.
To the south, she came with an older companion whom Kevern thought was her aunt, who had inherited the property in a damp but beautiful valley called, aptly, the Valley of Paradise.
The house was not lived in the house for several years.
The pipes seeped, there were dead spiders in the tubes, the slugs with a slimy sign on the windows, as if to think the place belonged to them, the garden was overgrown, and the weeds resembled huge roints of cabbage.
The house looked like a cottage from children's stories, terrifying and charming at the same time, with a garden full of secrets.
Author's profile: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" is on the preliminary list of nominations for the 2014 Man Booker Prize.
A narrower selection will be announced next week.
Kevern and Ailinn sat on the folding chairs in the long grass and holding hands, enjoying the unexpectedly warm spring afternoon, absently tuned in to the public station, which supplied the country with comforting music and soothing messages, when the sight of its tanned crossed legs reminded him of an old song by a long-forgotten black comedian, which his father liked to listen to with the turf-turning rounds.
Your legs are too big.
Because of their natural aggressiveness, they didn't play such songs on the radio anymore.
They were not forbidden - there was nothing really forbidden - they just weren't played.
They helped them get into the desuetod, as well as the word desuetudo itself.
Folk taste has accomplished what regulations and outside the law could never do, and just as people in books choose a memoir in which the poor man becomes a rich man, cookbooks, and love novels, so music is chosen.
Kavern let himself down to the bottom and began to play the imaginary piano and, in a rude, comic voice, sang to Aill's big feet.
Ailinn didn't understand.
"That was a favorite song by jazz pianist Fats Waller," he said, automatically putting two fingers to his lips.
That's what his father always did when he wanted to suppress the letter j before he came out of his mouth.
It started out as a game when he was a kid.
His father told him he played the game with his father.
When you didn't put two fingers in the word that started at the j, it cost you a penny.
It wasn't very funny even then, and it wasn't funny now.
He just knew it was expected of him, that was all.
He had to explain what jazz was.
Ailinn never heard one.
Even jazz, even when not outlawed directly, did not play.
Improvisation has gone out of fashion.
There was only room in life for one "if."
When the melody started to play, people wanted to know exactly where it would end up.
Same with humor.
His unseeingcability was on people's nerves.
And jazz was the humor expressed in song.
Although he had not heard of Samma Davis Junior until he was ten years old, Kevern knew the jazz from his father's semi-secret collection of old CDs.
At least Aillin didn't have to say that Fats Waller was black.
Because of her age, she could not remember a time when the popular singers were not black.
Also without laws or coercion.
The permissan society is one in which each part of it is with gratitude - the gratitude of those who were a lucky accidental to be spared - agrees with the principle of group gratitude.
People of Afro-Karibbean were well suited to the temperament and the constitution for entertainments and athletics, so they sang and ran.
People from the Indian subcontinent, as if by nature gifted for electronics, took responsibility for the fact that no family would be without a functional phone.
The Poles left were plumbers, the Greeks left were the dishes.
Those from the Gulf states and the Levant, whose grandparents quickly left the country while it was happening TO, WHAT SE STALO, WHEN SE TO STALO - they were afraid of being accused of putting them on the fire, in fact, afraid that the fire would be spent the next time - they opened the restaurants where the labno was sold and smoked with water pipes, they didn't answer for themselves, and inactivity was slowly consuming them.
To each to his talents.
Having listened only to ballads, Ailinn found it hard to see how the foul words Kavern had just sang to her could have produced music.
Music was an expression of love.
"They're not really mean," Kevern said.
Maybe just for people with too big legs.
My father never offended anyone, but he loved this song.
He spoke too much, but the neglected garden gave the illusion of safety.
From behind the soundproofed leaves, no word could escape.
Ailinn still didn't understand.
Why would your father like that?
He wanted to say it was a joke, but he was reluctant to put two fingers to his mouth again in her presence.
She thought he was weird.
"She seemed funny to him," he said at last.
She shook her head in disbelief and shaded Kevern's view.
In the whole wide world, you could see nothing more than a jumble of her raven hair.
He didn't want to see anything else.
"If you say so," she said doubtfully.
That still doesn't explain why you sing it to me.
She looked genuinely upset.
My legs are too big?
He looked again.
Noys exactly.
Maybe a little ankle...
You're saying you hate me because my ankles are too fat?
Hate me?
That's not true.
It's just a silly song.
He could have called her "I love you," but it was too soon.
"Your fat ankles are attracting me right now," he tried.
I'm a bit creepy.
That didn't work.
He wanted to be funny.
When he wanted to be funny, he was often in trouble, because, like his father, he lacked the spell necessary to tame the cruelty that lurked in the jokes.
Perhaps his father was cruel on purpose.
Perhaps Kavern was deliberately cruel.
In spite of kind eyes.
Ailinn Solomons reddened and rose from the cot, knocked the radio and spilled the unfinished wine.
Sink wine, so it wasn't the drink's fault.
She seemed to be shaking in her excitement like palm leaves in a storm.
"I'm so sickly attracted to being a jerk," she said. . . .
Except I'm not drawn to it.
He felt sorry for her, both for her unkind words and for the fear she had in her eyes when she faced him.
Did she think she'd be hit?
She had not spoken to him of life on the cold northern peninsula where she had grown up, but he had no doubt that in the foundations it was the same as here.
The same wide and icy ocean was shattered over.
The same deranged men, then, WITH WITH STALO, even even more petty and grumpy than their ancestors, the smugglers and the spoiler, angrily wandered from pub to pub, ready to lay hands on any woman who dares to refuse or laugh at them.
A moron?
If she's not careful, they'll show her their fists!
First to cuddle her - cuddling became the most common term for erotic irritation between a man and a woman: the anti-abortion of the faint ballads of love that the radio was spewed - first she was anointed, then one of hers.
In Kevern's view, over-cultivation, because the cuddling was an act of violence in itself.
Ailinn Solomons neverbicously indicated to him to leave.
He rose from the lounger like an old man.
She felt cranky herself, but the weight of his sadness surprised her.
It wasn't the end of the world.
They barely knew each other.
She watched as she walked away - as if watching him from a upstairs window - the man who had been caught up in what he had done.
Adam leaving the garden, she thought.
Her heart tightened because of him, and for all the men in general, regardless of the fact that a few of them beat her.
The man turned away from her, his shoulders down, ashamed, defeated, all the belligerence had left him - why did it feel he knew that he well of this sight, though she could not recall a single moment, until today, that she had ever seen it before?
Ailinn Solomons, alone again, looked at her legs.
About twenty years after these events, Esme Nussbaum, an intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year-old researcher working in Ofnow, the Neatutte Public Mood Monitoring System, prepared a short article about the persistence of minor and moderate violent acts in the country's areas where it was mitigated or downright halted if enough money and energy were spent on its disposal.
"A lot has been done, and a lot has yet to be done," she wrote, "to be reassured by the innate aggression of the people who have fought in many battles and won most of them, especially in the hollow, hard-to-reach places of the country, where, despite the tips of the church towers, the hostile of human kindness has rarely appeared historically."
But some things are irreplaceable.
It might seem that the higher the church tower, the lower the instincts.
Residents sigh at the sentimental ballads, devour unhappy stories and declare that they firmly believe in the value of marriage and family life, but not only do old brutality hold as stubbornly in the Russian domain as stubborn as in urban agglomerations, but the evidence also shows that new and offensive intolerance is emerging at home, in the workplace, the road and even on the sports pitches.
"Unfortunately, you tend to be too florid," her supervisor said.
I would suggest you read fewer novels.
Esme Nussbaum bowed her head.
I also have to ask: are you an atheist?
"I don't think I have to answer that," Esme Nussbaum said.
Are you a lesbian?
Esme objected again to her privacy and silence.
Feminist?
More silence.
"I'm not asking for that reason," Rabinowitz said at last, "that I would have something against atheists, lesbians or feminists.
We don't have prejudice in this workplace.
We serve unpreplicit societies.
But a kind of hypersensitivity that is itself perfectly acceptable and commendable can sometimes distort the judgement as you have demonstrated.
Apparently, you yourself are biased against the church - the things you call "cruel" and "brutal" others could also interpret as an expression of natural power and energy.
Always solving CO STALO, WHATS TO STALO, as if that had happened, if it had happened, yesterday, was preparing a country with its basic life force.
While Rabinowitz spoke, Esme Nussbaum looked around.
Behind his head on the light board, a recommendation flickered in pink, which had been broadcasting To the world of the last quarter-century or more.
Smile of your neighbor, take care of your partner, listen to the ballads, go to the musicals, use your phone, chat, agree, apologize.
Talking is better than keeping quiet, the sung word is better than the written one, but there is nothing better than love.
"I completely understand your reservations," Esme Nussbaum replied quietly, as she was sure her superior had quit, "and I'm not saying that the blow was no longer healed as we tell it it was.
Above all, my concern is that if we are not notified in advance of this, we will repeat the same mistake that led to CO SE STALO, KDY TO STALO.
This time, however, we will not vent our anger and distrust on others.
Luther Rabinowitz joined the tips of his finger.
This was to indicate endless patience.
"You're going too far," he said, "when you describe the steps they may have taken and may not have made to your grandparents as mistakes.
You also go too far in talking about venting their "reach" and "didity" to "others."
I should not be reminded of anyone in your position that, in understanding the past and in the protection of the present, we are not talking about "us" and "naj."
There was no "we" and there were no "they."
All we know is that these were chaotic times.
'Whether, if we are honest with each other,' Esme said, 'no one is blameless.
I don't blame anyone.
Just or not, what happened, it was.
That was before.
There's nothing to add - we agree on this.
And just as there is no guilt to blame anyone, there are no things that should be corrected even if the remedy is appropriate and perhaps.
But what else is the past for but to learn from it -
The past is to forget her.
If there's one thing I can add -
Luther Rabinowitz unplugged his fingertips.
"I'll take your report into account," he said, releasing it.
The day after she went to work as usual, she was hit by a motorcyclist who hit the pavement in a way that was described by passers-by as "brutal and furious."
Coincidence is happening.
The Forest Kingdom's Army says no coup is planned - the Prime Minister remains in South Africa
Military officers of the ForestHoth Kingdom have denied organizing a coup to overthrow the government, and say they have acted against the police suspected of attempting to arm political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane fled the country and says the army has encircled his official residence and seized government buildings in the capital, Masseru.
After saying he was being threatened with death, the prime minister and his family went to the neighbouring South African Republic.
Army spokesman Major Ntlele Ntoi said it was not really a coup, but the army's response to the threat of "political fanatics" that the police were trying to arm.
"This morning, the command of the defense services of the Lesothos was in negotiations after receiving several reports of the information service that there were several groups in the ranks of the police to design some radical, political fanatics who were about to create havoc in the country," he told The Voice of America.
South African government spokesman Clayson Monyela said the military actions looked like an attempt to overthrow the government.
"Although no one has declared that he has seized government power with the help of force, the actions of the Forest ofoth Defence seem to bear signs of a coup d'état," he said.
Military officials of the Kingdom of Leshoth said the soldiers returned to their barracks on Sunday and the capital was quiet.
During Thabet's absence, Deputy Prime Minister Mothetjoa Metsing will be responsible for the government.
Thabane said he believed he was under attack because of his efforts to fight corruption in the country.
Since Thabane suspended parliament sessions in June over internal disputes, there has been tension in Lesotho.
He said that despite the opposite claims, he did not undermine the government's actions.
Eurozone production at 13-month low
Production growth, according to a closely watched poll in the euro area in August, slowed to a 13-month low.
The final index of euro area purchasing managers (PMI) from June's 51.8 fell to 50.7 in August.
A number higher than 50 indicates expansion.
New orders have been declined and the factories have been hurt by rising tensions between the EU and Russia over Ukraine.
The figures come from Thursday's meeting of the European Central Bank (ECB).
Markets will want a clear plan from the bank to deal with the delayed recovery of the euro area as well as the threat of deflation with inflation stagnant at 0.3%.
There has been speculation that the ECB's director, Mario Draghi, may have indicated this week that he is considering the quantitative easing of the euro area, similar to what the United Kingdom and the US had approached during the financial crisis.
"Although at least some growth is better than no growth, the braking effect that the growing economy and geopolitical uncertainty have on manufacturers is becoming more visible," said Rob Dobson, Markit's chief economist.
Germany's production PMI, Russia's largest trading partner in the EU, fell to an 11-month low of 51.4.
In the zone's second-largest economy, France, the PMI fell to 46.9.
There is concern about France, Italy has gone from the expansion of the stagnation.
The signs that the driving force for growth in the most important industrial areas in Germany, Spain, and also the Netherlands has disappeared is also not very reassuring," Dobson said.
The slowdown in the industry is likely to add fuel to the fires for analysts expecting the implementation of additional monetary or tax incentives.
One positive report came from the Republic of Ireland, where the PMI rose to 57.3, the highest level since the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, chief economist at IHS Global Insight, said, "The best you can say about the purchasing managers' production report for August is showing that the sector is still growing."
He added: Manufacturers in the euro area currently have a very complex life, because the increasing geopolitical tensions - especially between Russia and Ukraine - are adding even more uncertainty to the challenging conditions in many countries.
This increasing uncertainty has shown a proven hit to the trade - and in particular consumer confidence, which is likely to cause some orders to be delayed or even cancelled, especially the costly ones.
He said that it appeared to be "even more likely" that the ECB would eventually have to do some form of quantitative easing, "although we expect it to be limited."
Ten years of baked by the survivors of Beslan: Ten years since the horror of the occupied school, children still suffer
Ten years ago, 1,000 people were taken hostage by Chechnya militants at a school in Beslan, southern Russia
During the ordeal, which lasted three days and which shocked the world, more than 330 people were killed, more than half of whom were children
We returned to Beslan to seek out some of the victims who escaped death during the atrorose at the school
Exactly ten years after the horrific cast of the school in Beslan, which killed 334 people, including 186 children, the surviving heroes warned last night about a new apocalypse in Ukraine.
When, on September 1, 2004, at the start of the new school year, the fanatical terrorists captured and murdered children's children and parents, it looked like the deepest bottom of hell.
The resistance to the tragedy united the east and west, which led to negotiations and the future in this disastrous disaster.
Ten years later, we returned to Beslan in southern Russia to seek out some of the victims who had escaped death during the atrocity at the school.
We have found amazing young people who have resisted the misfortune, even if the memory of the inferno caused by the terrorists will live in them.
What is their greatest wish?
So that the war that is now destroying Ukraine - and in which children like them were dying - should be over.
Girl trying to climb back into the ruined school gym
She was captured by leading Russian photographer Dimitriy Beliakov, only in her underwear, trying to climb back into a bombed-out school gym after a bomb exploded in it.
Confused, Aida searched desperately for her mother, Larissa, who is now forty.
There were fears that they were both dead, but had in fact survived.
"A woman told me to run and save my life, but I couldn't," Aida had said.
My legs were covered in blood.
I got up and got back in to find my mom.
She was rescued by a soldier.
After several surgeries, she thought she had made a full recovery, but she said yesterday, "The pains came back three months ago.
I'm afraid I'll have to have another surgery.
In my knee, bits of shrapnel were left.
Her goal is to become a dentist so she can help people the way the doctors helped her.
"This tragedy changed my life, but it certainly didn't destroy it," she said firmly.
"It just happened to me, and it can't be changed.
I go to the gym once a year to remind myself of those who stayed there.
Otherwise, we try not to talk to your friends about it.
The pain's too great.
My best friend and future classmate from Jeru Gapoev's class were killed there.
We played together as a kid and imagined us going to school together.
"I don't want to get married until I finish school and start my career.
I'll think about the family later.
She says she hasn't forgotten captivity, but the memories fade a little by the year.
I'm glad so many people in the world still remember what happened, and we're very grateful for the help we got from the UK and other countries.
When I look at my picture online, climbing the school window, I think a lot of people will see it for the first time, understand the disaster and prevent it from happening again.
A boy who escaped the rain of bullets and believed his mother was dead
It was his first day of school (in Russia, children start school at the age of seven) and survived a three-day siege of the school in the embrace of his mother, Tamara.
At the time, the seven-year-old said, "My mom told me that if there was an explosion, I should lie down on the ground and hold her hand."
After the explosion, he thought his mother was dying.
She said to him, "Run."
He was afraid she was dead, ran and saw a weeping toddler along the way, grabbing the child's hand and running through a spray of bullets.
His father, Vladimir, who caught him outside, said, "Damir told me that his mother was dead."
She says, "I couldn't have saved her."
In fact, Tamara staggered to freedom and lay in the hospital with her injured leg and, on the contrary, thought her son had died.
After they met again, she said, "I cried with happiness.
I couldn't believe it.
He ran in and hugged me.
Damir then flew to London (according to the defunct News of the World), where then-Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Cherie were declared the winner by Bernardo's Children.
"The horror comes back every day, but I wish I could stop thinking about it," he said yesterday.
But I can say that the memories are fading.
I remember right after that, I threw away all my toy guns.
But today I can play the computer games that are shot in, and I don't have a problem with that.
"I'm not afraid to go back to the gym, but I don't think about myself.
I remember the kids I played with in the yard who didn't get out.
We never say they were killed or died.
We say they stayed in the gym.
I remember the trip to London well, especially how I could have picked up anything I wanted in the toy store and how I drove through a convertible.
But now he is worried about a place like Ukraine where he suffers because of the war as he and his friends suffered.
The horror comes back every day, but I wish I could stop thinking about it.
"I am terribly sorry for anyone who has to go through such horror," says Damir, who attended the monastery's volunteering business last week.
I want to help so much.
I want to work in the police force one day and I hope to be accepted at the academy next year.
His mother, Tamara, 48, says, "They killed 37 children from our neighborhood, can you imagine?
I remember the silence right after the attack. There were no children to scream and run around, and that silence took several months.
He remembers vividly the trip with Damir to London.
When I told our story in London, people were crying.
Then I realized how people on the other side of the world could understand our feelings and how they could express their support.
She was grateful to Cherie Blair and her foundation for the award and the chance to go to London in the autumn of 2004.
I wish I could call Cherie and say in person that even though it's been ten years, I still remember meeting her and her husband in London and how they helped me and Damiro.
I remember Damir's appetite for borsch, so they called all the Russian restaurants.
I also remember him playing with the waiters in the restaurant, Damir shooting at them with a water pistol, and they ran and played with him.
And that was only a month away from the horror.
I was surprised how the British wanted to share our pain with us and how they supported us.
She said, "I still think the world hasn't changed for the better in ten years.
Now the war is in Ukraine, people are dying every day, and I think a lot of children have been and will be killed.
They're the same kids as ours.
I think for a lot of people, war is just something on the news that they listen to when they're bored or doing something else.
I know what these people are going through, what the horror is.
I can still feel it.
Nothing's changed, people still want to murder each other, it's so sad.
Damir grew up and he's a nice and quiet kid, not at all aggressive or angry.
For example, he has no desire for revenge, he doesn't care about this at all.
I know he doesn't like to remember that, but he's very close to six classmates, and from time to time he goes to the gym and light candles.
When he was smaller, he had trouble with it - I remember sometimes lying down on the couch with his face facing away from us and sometimes lying there for hours.
He didn't sleep, his eyes were open.
I also remember he fired all his guns or other toys. Damiro is 17 today, taller than me, handsome, smart and healthy.
I can hardly believe that I was sure for several hours that he was dead and that I would never see him again.
When I recovered from the explosion and got to my feet, I looked around and saw the inferno, there were pieces of human body everywhere.
I was absolutely sure my little boy didn't have a chance to survive this hell.
"I remember shouting 'Damir, run, run!' but I was convinced he hadn't heard me.
But he heard her and ran away.
So our life goes on, unlike others.
Grigory Ilyin, 17
The boy, taken photo of the attack, became a symbol of the horrors in Beslan
Avenge: The survivor of Beslan's Beslan, Grigory Ilyin, with his mother Fatima after the 2004 attack, on the right, Grigori
When he ran for his life after a Chechen terrorist shot his classmates, there was a fear in his bloodied face.
His photo was one of the most shocking symbols of the atrocity of the atrocity in Beslan.
His mother, Fatima, 54, a doctor, dropped him off at the school on his first day and rushed to take his older son, Vladimir, to the university.
"I left two minutes before the terrorists stormed into the yard, leaving my little boy alone for three days," she recalled.
Not all by myself, because we had relatives there, but they all died there.
Only my Grigori did.
As the date gets close, it's getting harder to think about and talk about it.
Not a single day will pass so that we don't remember the tragedy.
It doesn't seem to us that it happened a long time ago, I feel like it was yesterday, some of the moments keep coming back to me.
I promise no one will ever forget.
Still returning memories: A photo of Grigori (left) was one of the most shocking pictures of the attack and was immortalized as a sculpture (right)
I remember Grigori really looking forward to school that day, saying he wanted to give his teacher a hug.
I learned that he was alive when I saw him on TV.
There's even a statue of the weeping Grigori in San Marino.
Grigori doesn't like looking at the photo, and we have it hidden in the bookcase at home.
I get it, but I also think that because of this picture, people around the world know the pain we feel.
Today, Grigori says, "The important thing is that this doesn't happen again.
"I doubt we'll ever know the truth.
Such tragedies are still under investigation, but no one ever finds out the truth.
Now they're investigating the Boeing crash in Ukraine.
Do we ever know what the cause was?
This world is in for something very bad.
"I don't understand why this is happening, because if you ask people, no one wants a war, then how is that possible?
Ten years is nothing to do with such pain.
To forget a little, he needs decades.
It's had an effect on my health, I can still feel it.
I had nightmares for three or four years because of the attack, but then it got better.
Then when I returned to school in 2004, I was terrified every day.
I was thinking about my friends and my classmates who were killed.
That's why, as September 1 starts to get to the gym.
I want to honor the memory of my childhood friends.
It's hard for me to enter the gym, but I have to.
I don't feel like a victim, this story is a thing of the past.
I won't forget it, but I don't feel sorry for myself.
My life goes on.
This year I finished school and started studying medicine at the University of Vladikavkaz.
I want to be a cardiothoracic surgeon.
First I wanted to join the army.
I wanted to be a soldier, but I couldn't help it for my health.
I wanted to fight for my country, but I can't.
Grogori Farniyyev, 20
The boy who survived despite being held to the feet of the murdering terrorist
A miracle: Gregori Farniyev was held at the feet of the murdering terrorist during the attack, but still managed to survive
When the attack was in full swing, he was caught trapped in the gym sitting next to the bomb at the feet of the murdering terrorist.
It's a real miracle he survived.
"It feels like it was yesterday," said Gregorsky, who wanted to become a Federal Security Service agent but was unable to suffer from the injuries he sustained during the attack.
It's still with me, it's not something I put behind me.
I'm older now, and they say kids can deal with bad experiences better - I have to say it's not true.
"I went to a psychologist in 2006 and it made me feel a little better, but I can't forget.
And I'd like to.
In 2005 - the year after - that was the first and last time I joined the gym again.
I fainted.
I will never go there again, and please do not ask me to show you where I am sitting on the well-known picture.
Survivor: Gregory Farniev today, on a laptop with his photo taken in hospital after the attack
The pain is huge and I bring it with me every day.
My friends know I don't like to think about it or talk about it and never ask me about school.
As for physical health, I'm fine.
I have to be careful about my knee, which I hurt, but I'm walking normally.
Even so, for the sake of my health, I was unable to enter and study at the FBS Academy in St. Petersburg, as I wanted.
I sent them my documents, including medical reports, and they replied that this was impossible.
My next hobby is the animals, so I joined the vet.
I finished the second year there.
He learns how to treat all animals from "cats to cows."
He said, "I know I will never tell my children about it.
It's not something that children should know about, and certainly not something to experience.
His mother, Marina, 42, said, "The pain will always be here.
He's inside and getting worse as the anniversary approaches.
I will attend the commemorations.
I know Grigori won't go.
It must be even stronger for him because, unlike me, he was there.
I was waiting for him at home and I couldn't help him.
I'm so grateful to God he gave it back to me. Here in Beslan, there are clues everywhere.
It's staying with us.
Gregori is an adult today, but he carries on that horror.
It's hard to accept when something so terribly unfair happens to you.
He's a kid, he likes sports, but he can't do it for his knee.
He's had several surgeries, he can walk, but he can't exercise.
I'd say, about a 50% of the horror, but you can't forget it completely and you can't forget it.
This terrible experience with us will always be.
A lot of our friends and neighbors were killed during the attack, and that only makes the pain worse.
I lost a lot of people I loved who were close to me.
My son is with me, and that's the greatest gift God could have given me, but I'm hurt by the loss of those killed.
I know families in whom other children were born, but also widows who did not marry again.
It's hard to accept that life goes on, even if you don't want to.
I'll never forget my heart almost jumping out of my chest when I saw him in the hospital.
Now I observe what is happening in the world - wars in other places.
What are these people fighting for?
Why are they killing each other?
The war is now approaching our country, which I can hardly believe.
We've been a friendly country in the past, so how did we get to the point of fighting with each other now?
People and children are suffering, I am sure that many children in Ukraine have been and will still be killed.
If only we could have picked up all these rebels and thrown away them - as far as I can.
Alyona Tskaeva, 10
The child who was taken to safety by a special commando
Saved: Alyon Tskaev is carried into a secure Russian special commando (left).
She is now ten (right) and does not remember the tragedy at all
The world gasped in 2004 when little Alyon was carried out in her arms from the Beslan captivity by a Russian policeman.
The terrorists released her, but captive in the school's gym, they kept her 30-year-old mother, 10-year-old sister Kristina and brother Makhar.
Makhar, who was three years old at the time, escaped, but Alyon's mother and sister died in the massacre.
Her brother Ruslan remarried and she and his new wife, Svetlana, have a little girl named Kristina after the dead daughter.
Neighbors say that Alyona, who is now ten, has no recollection of the attack and has grown into a bright and happy little girl.
A close friend said that "it's a big happy family, and Alyona and Makhar are great kids."
Ruslan is an excellent father and wants to keep the children away from the memories that the tenth anniversary commemorates.
You can understand why.

4 tips on how to get better photos and videos underwater
If you are interested in taking pictures or shooting underwater, you have a large selection of equipment.
The cheapest option is a compact such as the Nikon Coolpix AW120 or the GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition outdoor camera, which costs around $300.
I took these photos at the family party with a few cameras, all of which cost less than $350.
It doesn't matter what equipment you use, but there are several rules to achieve the best results.
Check your gear.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure the batteries and other parts are tightly closed.
Next, set the camera according to which type of photos or videos you will take.
Some cameras and video cameras have a scenic or shooting mode that optimizes the exposure to the dark underwater environment.
And before you get started, find out how far you can dive with your equipment.
Some of the cameras are only designed for 5 feet, with another one up to 50 to 60.
Read our guide to the purchase and rating of digital cameras in both normal and waterproof design.
Always do a few shots - a lot of them don't come out.
Compact cameras have LCD to help you with a composite of photos, but the outdoor cameras don't.
Even if you have an LCD, it will be hard to see under the water and the composition of the shot will be unveiled.
So always take more pictures.
If the camera has a bracketing mode that makes a series of frames with a slightly different exposure dispersion, take advantage of this.
Stay close to the surface.
With a deeper draught of light, it is dwindling significantly.
As far as possible, stay close to the surface when taking a photo shoot in the pool, the lake or the sea.
This will also allow you to capture more light in the photos - the deeper you sink, the less colors you will see.
Get close to the photographed object.
That's excellent advice if you're taking pictures on land, but underwater it's even more important because of the more muffled light.
This is particularly important if you are filming with an outdoor camera: Such devices usually have a firm and wide lens angle, which means that if you want to fill the photo frame, you need to get closer to the objects.
Andrew Lawson was a man whose personality strength could change things even in such a huge organization as the NHS.
As an anaesthetist, he dedicated his career to relieving the pain caused by the disease and the treatment of the disease.
His wife recalls that one of the people who sought his help was an MI6 officer who had to live with the consequences of the torture that crippled him.
Lawson understood that while doctors focused on diagnoses and diseases, the patients treated overwhelmingly interested in something else entirely: pain.
But one day in 2007, he was the one who began to suffer.
"I don't feel like myself," he wrote in May of that year.
I felt without power.
He struggled with the symptoms of the flu, he found himself impatient and his wife, Juliet, was regretted.
He noted, "I want everything to happen sooner rather than later."
When Juliet left for a week on a business trip, Lawson was unusually and inexplicably agitated.
Something was wrong.
A colleague gave him a chest X-ray.
He had skied in the French Alps for two weeks before.
X-rays came in.
It had a mesotheliome, an incurable tumor that affects the pleura, or the lining of the lungs.
Most cancers are hard to determine what was the cause of them.
Although some smokers get lung cancer, not all lung cancer patients have smoked.
But the Mezotheliom is different.
In almost all cases, it is the cause of asbestos being displayed - a building fibrous material that was previously described as "miraculous," but is now known to be deadly.
For most of us, it was not difficult to ignore the mesothelioma.
Asbestos, after all, belongs to the past.
The most dangerous type of asbestos has not been used in Britain since the 1960s, when the ban on the use of asbestos in industry came into force.
Even when asbestos was used, only certain groups of people came into close contact with it, such as insulation treasurers, builders, carpenters and shipyards workers.
Toxin used in industry in another era now appears to be a cause for concern.
But such complacency is misplaced.
As it turns out, a cancer epidemic is now at the height in Britain.
The number of deaths per mesothelioma is higher here than in any other country in the world.
2,500 deaths from the disease a year are twice as many as the number of victims of car accidents.
Deaths from mesothelioma per year since 1980 and estimated deaths in the UK
The reason we are only now feeling its effects, even though the use of asbestos has been illegal for years (all asbestos species were eventually banned by law in 1999) is that it usually takes several decades to develop a mesothelioma.
The disaster of mesotheliome is not just about veterans of the construction industry.
Asbestos was, and in many cases, it is still present in the homes in which we live, in the offices where we work, in the schools where we learn, and in the shops we shop in.
So the Mesothelioma does not respect the social stratum, wealth, profession, or age.
The privileged bastions from London department stores to public schools are not a hiding place.
Parliament, too, is full of asbestos.
Even the hospitals in which we should be treated are the repositories of this mortal carcinogen.
Andrew Lawson was not old.
Nor did he inspect isolation.
He tried to find out where he might come into contact with asbestos.
Then he found out.
"It is possible that a lot of asbestos was in the basement corridors of Guy's Hospital, where I spent six years on the practice," he wrote.
All of them - students, nurses, doctors and doormen - used the corridors.
The question is, how many of my contemporaries will get the same disease?
Unfortunately, it was a question he could partially answer.
"Of the four doctors who were at the practice of Guy's Hospital and who were then shown to mesothelioma in the past five years," he noted in a letter in 2010, "I'm the only one still alive."
How many of us get sick?
Andrew Lawson was diagnosed with a mesothelioma when he was 48.
When 17. he died in February of that year, 55.
Surviving with this diagnosis is not usual for so long.
55 percent of people diagnosed with mesothelioma die within eight months of diagnosis.
The disease is always fatal.
So now we can only repeat Lawson's question: "How many of us get the same disease?"
According to the leading British mesothelioma expert Professor Julian Pete, the best estimate is that between 1970 and 2050, when an asbestos epidemic is taking place in Britain, around 90,000 people will die.
Most of them currently have no idea that they will die in this way.
Asbestos Mine in Quebec, Canada
A cursory insight into the files from the archives of the courts, to which the disability often turns and require compensation, it shows how much the mesothelioma disaster has spread.
For example, this June was admitted by Marks & Spencer to subject asbestos to Janice Allen out of negligence.
She worked for the chain for nine years, from 1978 to 1987, when she supervised two stores in the clothing section - one of the sites being the company's flagship, a shop on Oxford Street.
Allen was only 18 when she started working for M&S.
Today he has two children, who are in his 20s.
"Before it happened," she says, "I've never heard of mesothelioma before, I've barely known anything about asbestos.
I never dreamed that I was in any way involved.
There aren't many people who know something about asbestos.
In fact, asbestos is not one substance, but a group of six minerals.
He was named because of his fibrillic structure, which gives him strength and flexibility.
Of the six minerals, three were used in the construction industry.
Most often today, it is possible to find chryzotil in the buildings, commonly known as white asbestos.
It was used in roof panels, floor tiles, boiler tights and even brake lining.
It is not as lethal as other forms of asbestos, yet the EU and the WHO see it as a "great health risk" that death can cause.
But the more dangerous is brown asbestos (famsite) and blue asbestos (steydolit).
Britain was once the world's largest importer of brown asbestos, and experts say that "there is a conclusive but circumstantial evidence that it was the main cause of the unusually high incidence of mesothelioma [in the UK]."
Marsk & Spencer employee was exhibited at the flagship store in Oxford Street, London
Janice Allen may not consider herself a typical victim of mesothelioma, but Julian Pete's work points out that her story is not uncommon at all.
His patient studies claim that "a substantial proportion of cases of mesothelioma without known exposure to asbestos at work or at home were likely caused by exposure to asbestos in the environment."
Much of this exposure is due to the "current use and weathering" of buildings.
It seems that no one can be sure he's safe.
The Goddard Consulting report, which examined the Palace of Westminster, shows that even people in the government's center need not know that they may be subjected to asbestos.
In 2009, Goddard published a report saying that the service lifts and pipelines behind the rooms of the parliamentary committee are contaminated with asbestos, whose deadly fibres could be broken by something as harmless as the "strong air stream."
Ministers are often accused of only caring for their own interests, but in this case the opposite may be true.
Although the Directorate of Services of Parliament insisted that the Palace of Westminster be given a "positive medical certificate" now, it is now expected that it will take one million pounds and several years of work to be thoroughly inspected by Parliament, electricity to be modernised and asbestos removed, and that, rather than on the Green Benchmarks in Westminster, MPs will sit on the premises of the Queen of Elizabeth II Conference Centre.
The Goddard report states that "the presence of asbestos is not in line with several regulations."
It is impossible to say whether this mismatch will cost lives.
All can now be waiting.
One of the people who was never able to determine when they had an asbestos exhibit was taken place by Graham Abbott, the doctor.
Like Andrew Lawson, Abbott (50) is suspected of being exposed to asbestos while working in hospitals.
"I worked at the hospital where the presence of asbestos was established," he says, "but in my case I can't prove it.
It's difficult to remember all the places he worked and when he worked there.
But he clearly remembers the day in early December 2009, when he was climbed by something of a chilly.
He was 45, it was evening and he was in the middle of surgery.
Suddenly I shivered.
It came at once.
I felt terrible.
I thought I wouldn't get by car home.
Because he was a doctor, he knew the pain came from the pleura, the lining around the lungs.
But like Janice Allen, there was no reason to believe it was a mesothelioma.
He ended up spending a month at home.
Confused doctors gave him a chest X-ray and introduced a chest catheter to remove the fluid from his lungs, which they sent for analysis.
Still, they didn't diagnose.
His condition slowly improved and he returned to work.
From time to time, however, his symptoms came back, often after he had worked his way and breathed.
In 2011, one of Abbott's patients with similar symptoms came to the OR and was subsequently diagnosed with mesothelioma.
Even then, however, Abbott did not associate anything with his own case.
After all, his patient was several decades older and came into direct contact with asbestos at work.
In this case, the connection was clear.
In September 2011, Abbott's condition deteriorated again and his doctor consulted his CT scan and X-ray with the panel of experts.
In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbott began to feel ill, a probe was introduced into the space between the lining of the chest cavity and the lining of his lungs.
I'm optimistic.
I have a tendency not to take too much of anything," he says.
To be honest, I wasn't really worried about it.
But Rachel, my wife, was a concern.
The biopsy results arrived between Christmas and New Year's: "They told me it was a mesotheliome."
Graham Abbott: diagnosed with mesothelioma
Abbott began seeing nurses from the Macmillan charity, and one advised him to contact a lawyer.
That was when he realized the extent of the epidemic.
"It turned out that asbestos was used extensively, especially in large public buildings that often have asbestos thermal insulation in the pipes," he says.
The people exposed to these asbestos buildings are now beginning to show the disease.
So the medium-sized media is now beginning to apply to younger people who do not have risky occupations.
The most dangerous asbestos-insulated pipes were in the basement in hospitals, so it was unlikely to endanger patients.
However, the staff members who crossed the basement corridors between the buildings (like Andrew Lawson) or ate in the basement canteens (as often Graham Abbott) came into contact with the toxic substance.
As it now turns out, hospitals were a place to save the patients' lives, but also a place that could have endangered the lives of the doctors who treated them.
Asbestos is still being removed today.
Pupils built Bunsen's outcrock on asbestos pads
And it's not just the hospitals.
Asbestos was often used in offices, shops, libraries and town halls for its excellent insulating and non-flammable properties.
Schools, too.
In fact, many people were exhibited asbestos at school.
Somewhere, in the myriad hours of chemistry, the students were building Bunsen's kahan on the asbestos pad.
There were websites dealing with the issue of asbestos in schools.
Harmless things like floor tiles or roofs of tool cushioners in our homes were commonly included asbestos.
"This is an industrial poison built into a large number of houses," notes Andrew Morgan, the lawyer who represented Andrew Lawson in his lawsuit against Guy's Hospital.
In one case, there was only one contact with asbestos that a woman suffering from a mesothelioma could recall in the 1970s while ruining the garden house.
So be careful how you tear down the garden house.
Knowing that the disease is untreatable, the impact of the diagnosis is huge.
"It takes a while to get it," says Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and tried to get on with it, but I found I couldn't concentrate on what I was doing.
I was in the operating room for two weeks.
Then I realized I'd have to leave and deal with myself.
Well, I'm not gonna live to see another Christmas.
One of the most difficult things was the transition from a doctor to the position of the patient.
As a myriad of patients before him, he remembers how confused he felt about the amount of information he had to deal with.
"It was hard to understand all of this," he says.
"I asked my doctor, "How long do I have?"
I've been told 12 months.
I remember thinking, "Well, I'm not going to live to see more Christmas.
That's the way it is."
The mesotheliome is particularly destructive, because the very mechanism of what keeps us alive - the very breathing - is what causes the cancer that kills.
Most of the cases of mesothelioma are caused by exposure to asbestos.
The asbestos are made up of small fibres.
When the asbestos is broken and the fibers are inhaled, they can settle in the pleura, the lining of the lungs.
The asbestos fibres irritate the plee to the plee and can induce a cell mutation.
"The problem is inhaled asbestos fibres in the shape of the needles," explains Professor Tom Treasure, a cardiothoratom surgeon who joined Guy's Hospital in 2001.
To the same hospital where Andrew Lawson was apparently exposed to asbestos and which, ironically, is the head center in the treatment of mesothelioma.
Treasure also knows Lawson and has treated other patients who were exposed to asbestos probably during his experience at the hospital.
Asbestos needles get into the lung's tissue, says Treasure, and "the breathing itself pushes them to the edge where the lining is located.
By its nature, it has been invasive from the very beginning.
For the mesothelioma, the common therapeutic options used for other types of cancer do not work as much.
It is hotly discussed, for example, the effectiveness of the operation.
Some say it would be worth a try.
Treasure disagrees.
"You can't remove the pleura," he says.
You can't get a scalpel around it.
Cancer "not exactly responds to chemotherapy" which "has some effect" but does not heal.
"Sometimes there's someone who can survive lung cancer," says Treasure.
But in the end, they all die.
Fortunately, some patients live much longer than expected.
Author Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after the diagnosis.
Two and a half years since his own diagnosis, Graham Abbott has been fighting.
After the Mesoplica Recognition, Abbott made contact with Andrew Lawson, who, four years after his diagnosis, became individual support and counselor for people equally affected.
As they called, he cheerfully introduced himself, "Hello, you've reached the cancer headquarters."
"He was very positive," says Abbott.
He was diagnosed with the disease four years ago and he was still very active.
In the beginning, Abbott was offered six cycles of chemotherapy that would take four months, and would probably only extend his life by a month.
"I was desperate," he says.
I wanted to give up.
But Lawson "cerved to show things in a more optimistic light."
After visiting several doctors, Abbott decided to continue his treatment with Professor Loic Lang-Lazduski of the thoracic surgery department at Guy's Hospital.
"I had the advantage of not having to wait for them to be sent to him, but I just called and they examined me," Graham admits.
A normal patient would have to receive a requisition and have to approve the reimbursement.
In order to access the best available treatments, the issue of mesothelioma is crucial for patients with mesothelioma.
But when various treatments inevitably fail in the end, many patients face more financial concerns - the future of the family they leave behind.
And that's why they're going to the courts and they want compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan of Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
"Since 1988, asbestos has been known to be harmful to health," says Morgan.
In the 1960s, however, it was found that even a very small amount of it could pose a health risk.
And here we encounter the negligence of companies.
Andrew Lawson and Guy's Hospital eventually matched the match, but according to Morgan, it was not a "fulfill settlement" because Lawson could not definitively prove that the mesothelioma was the result of asbestos exhibit at Guy's Hospital.
However, after the investigation into the case, Guy's Hospital spokesman confirmed that "asbestos in the basement section in question was removed in the 1990s."
That was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How to remove asbestos
To see an exhibit of fatal asbestos per company or job-seeker job - usually decades after it happened - has proved to be a huge problem for patients with a mesothelioma seeking compensation.
A lot of former workplaces changed hands or went bankrupt.
The insurance records are lost.
And those who are now resisting the charges have time on their side, which their prosecutors certainly do not.
In response to this fact, important new legislation was passed this year, making it easier for patients with a mesothelioma to claim a settlement even if it is impossible to trace their former employer.
The law created a $350-a-hunk of financial reserve, which is paid for by insurance companies, which is intended for people diagnosed after July 2012, who can prove that they have been exposed to asbestos, but have no one to sue.
In such a case, the disabled will receive 80% of the amount that the court would normally award them as a settlement - around £120,000.
There are 300 successful applications expected each year.
Andrew Morgan, like mesothelioma patients, thinks £350 million is a "good job."
"It's an insurance company's insurance deal for insurance companies," he says, pointing out that the sum is a quarter of what insurance companies would have to pay if the time hadn't been hijacked and people with a mesothelioma would be able to reap the former employers and sue them in the normal way.
Even Mike Penning, a former Secretary of Labor and Social Affairs, admitted that the law "had in gaps."
But both Penning and Morgan admit that, given the seven deaths each year, swift action was needed.
"People are suffering too much and need help right away," Penning said in December last year during the second reading of the Mesothelioma Act.
Graham Abbott was in the care of Professor Loic Lang-Lazdunski for 19 months.
After initial consultations, Lang-Lazdunski recommended an operation that, unlike Tom Treasur, he thought had a positive effect.
The surgery was followed by radiotherapy and chemotherapy - a triple treatment for which Lang-Lazdunski can boast a survival rate of up to 40% of patients.
It made Abbott stronger.
"Of course, that's not the most important thing," Abbott says.
You see it all the time in patients.
There's something that drives you.
When you give up, your condition can get worse very quickly.
Graham Abbott underwent surgery in March 2012.
In late August, he completed the last of six cycles of chemotherapy.
Checking the checkpoints showed no symptoms of the disease.
I went to the next check-up in March [2014].
In my chest I had a few spots scattered [cancer].
It was just approaching my 50th birthday.
It's not threatening life.
It's taking him.
Abbott again underwent six cycles of chemotherapy.
There are currently no traces of a tumor in his body.
But it is both a physically and emotionally exhausting process.
You have to think about practical things - financial security when I die, or to show a woman how the boiler's alarm clock works.
When you learn bad news, you start to be negative.
You have to look forward.
As for the father of Ellie (16) and Tamsin (14), it's not always easy.
"It's hard for parents," he says.
It's hard to decide what to say and how much to say.
After the diagnosis, I told the girls that my condition meant I would never be old.
Their reaction was different.
Tamsin is very social and wild.
She told her friends, and all of a sudden, a lot of people started calling us.
Ellie was more restrained.
She didn't say much.
Such talks must be faced by all cancer patients.
In patients with mesothelioma, however, such conversations are not relieved by hope or just a hint of a chance at survival.
The disease brings with it (and eventually brought along to Stephen Jay Gould) a bleak certainty.
As Andrew Morgan says, "inter-the-breaks not life."

China refuses to give Hong Kong the power to choose leadership - protesters promise revenge
China's parliament, despite the proliferating discussions on democratic reform on Sunday, decided not to allow voters in Hong Kong to nominate candidates for the 2017 election.
The move is likely to spark long-promised protests in Hong Kong's business district, as activists began to organize and prepare just hours after the announcement.
China's People's Congress essentially allows communist leaders to eliminate any candidate who is not loyal to Beijing.
"We weren't surprised, but we were fooled," said lawmaker Emily Lau, the Democratic leader.
That's not what Beijing promised.
People were lied to in Hong Kong.
And it is clear that we are dealing with an authoritarian regime.
In defense of the Chinese decision, the Deputy Secretary-General of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, Li Fei, said that allowing public nominations in the Hong Kong leadership elections would cause a "chaos."
Since 1997, when Britain returned to China's administration to Hong Kong, Beijing has promised that from 2017, residents will be able to vote for executive power.
Chinese leaders presented Sunday's decision as a democratic breakthrough because it allows Hong Kong to vote in direct, but the decision also makes it clear that Chinese leaders hold firm in their hands the process of nominating a committee strictly controlled by Beijing.
And under the new clause, only the candidates who "love the country and Hong Kong" will be admissible.
The decision came after the summer months, which recorded some of Hong Kong's biggest and most-watched protests in several years.
Most of the pro-democratic protests in Hong Kong are the Occupy of Centah movement with love and peace, whose organizers have threatened to close the financial quarter if Beijing does not grant them a universal right of voting.
On Sunday evening, just hours after the announcement, hundreds of supporters of the Occupy movement gathered in the rain in front of the Hong Kong administration headquarters.
At the demonstration, organizers said that their movement was entering a new phase of civil disobedience and that it would launch waves of protests in the coming weeks.
However, they provided no further details, clearly wanting to avoid problems with the authorities.
In their online statement, the organizers said the movement "to consider the occupation of the Central as a final step in the event that all the possibilities of dialogue are exhausted and there is no other choice.
We regret to announce that today all the possibilities for dialogue have been exhausted and the casting of the Central Office is inevitable.
Authorities in Hong Kong have been preparing for Beijing's announcement for days, and on Sunday they strengthened the protection of the government's headquarters and deployed police and barricades.
The impelling of the unrest, according to many Hong Kong residents, is a sign that it is slowly losing control of the city.
The surge of landmine people is increasing competition in products and services.
There is also growing concern that values such as democracy and freedom of speech are bent by increasing pressure from Beijing.
Some have criticised the Occupy of Central movement, saying that their demonstrations threaten the trade - the lifeboat of Hong Kong.
"The protest he's talking about could cause much more economic damage, depending on how many people attend and for how long," says politician Regina Ip, who has long criticized the movement.
We do not want to see a widespread concern that Hong Kong is getting out of control.
Such perceptions could hurt investment.
In recent days, Chinese state media have also come up with reports that have been portrayed by democratic activists in Hong Kong as subversive agents run by the West.
In the summer, activists organised an unofficial referendum on voting rights, attended by 780,000 participants - more than a fifth of voters in Hong Kong.
And in July, tens of thousands of people took part in one of the largest pro-democratic demonstrations in the area's history.
Pre-election agitator?
The league in Jihlava is named after the political movement
The small soccer is played in the regional city of Vysočina by approximately 1,600 amateur athletes.
And their top-flight is newly named Together for Jihlava League.
It was named after one movement that goes to the October local elections.
The ten on his ticket is also the head of the small soccer in Jihlava, Jan Mráka.
"There was a general meeting where there was no problem with it," Mráka said.
The situation surrounding the first league of small soccer was already addressed by lawyers from the Jihlava City Council and recommended to change the subsidy distribution system.
Little football received around one million crowns last year, according to the city's website.
This year, too, the figure is in the hundreds of thousands.
In the legal view, the procedure of small soccer is not contrary to the law or to the Municipality's directives.
However, the situation is an incentive for the authority to modify the rules for awarding grants and subsidies," said Municipality spokesman Radek Tulis.
Drawing subsidies from the city and at the same time expressing support as a little soccer support in the elections of one political party is unlikely to be possible.
The highland "big" football has not yet come to a similar request from politicians.
That the ČSSD regional champion, ODS division or KDU-ČSL 1 would be formed.
And the class and the competition like that?
I wouldn't be in favor.
On the contrary, I would like to see us approached by company sponsors," said Miroslav Vrzáček, chairman of the regional football association.
The head of small football will not let other parties and the movement into the league name
According to the players of the small soccer, the sport in Jihlava deserved its own area with six playgrounds, dressing rooms and sanitary facilities.
"For example, the Na Stoupách pitch is not ours, we are rented there," said Ondřej Lapeš from the Starlet Jihlava club.
The most suitable location would be the Czech Mill.
But there will be, for example, a pointless area for skaters, of which there are about fifty in Jihlava, will be built there," Mráka pointed out.
The mayor of Jihlava, Jaroslav Vymazal (ODS), responded that the small soccer playgrounds with artificial grass in the streets of Rošický and Na Stoupách, which are in the property of the city.
We want to build such playgrounds that have the maximum use.
We are preparing to upgrade or build sports venues at schools that will be accessible in the afternoon.
I think there has been huge progress for the little soccer in the last years," Vymazal added.
Other political parties in the league names will not appear, according to Jan Mráka.
We have limitations.
If someone from one field enters our partnership, we don't put the other in," he explained.
"The political movement in the name of the league, I consider this to be at least an unfortunate step," said Karel Voldán, a member of the town hall commission for sport.
"But let the voters assess whether Mr Mráka is using the association Malá kopaná Jihlava and the city's subsidies for political purposes or not," he added.
American tradition infiltrates university life - freshmen can fly a jet
We are pleased to be able to respond to the demand by launching the first luxury travel service for students in Britain.
To give the best impression of arriving at the university, the company also offers transport options, including a private jet or Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Martin or McLaren P1 cars.
Stewart also stated that the service had a security site.
Service is an ideal option for students who would otherwise have to drag their stuff across the state in a dangerously loaded car.
We look forward to ensuring that with our VIF (very important fresher) variants of this year, we will ensure that students arrive at the university with a minimum of nervousness and the maximum of luxury.
A spokesman for the company said that since the services were just off, they had no reservations yet, but added: "Students will start making reservations within the next few weeks."
The company also said that although students pay annual tuition fees of £91,000, it expects the service to find its place on the market.
Compared to students ten, twenty, thirty, or forty years ago, today's students are different in terms of expectations and wishes - it's more important than ever to make the right first impression, and the VIF program is exactly the appropriate way to do it.
But the National Union of Students criticized the service as unattainable.
Megan Dunn, the vice president of the Union for Higher Education, commented: "For most students, such a project is unattainable.
Many students who are entering the university this month have to come to terms with the financial crisis before throwing out £000 for something as simple as arriving at the college, because the financial support available in the form of loans and grants cannot keep up with the rising cost of basic needs.
Feminists oppose racism and police behavior after events in Ferguson
At the beginning of the month, a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, killed an unarmed teenager.
Those present waiting for the funeral with their hands up chant: "Hands up, don't shoot!"
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Missouri over the shooting of unarmed teenager Michael Brown, blogger Miriam Zoila Perez noted a shift in online discussions by white female feminists.
She found that when it comes to promoting reproductive rights and income equality, white-fashioned feminists favor the sexes over the race.
With increasing tension in the Midwest, which drew the attention of the national press, Peréz noted that the white woman's reaction was 100% focused on race.
Compared to the reactions of black women soon after the shooting on August 9th, personal articles with titles such as "white-been's reflection on Ferguson" or "Feminism is not just about women's oppression" have appeared relatively late.
According to Peréz, however, this represents an important change.
"I don't think there are many people in the feminist movement who talk about race and privilege at that level," she said.
People felt they had to comment on what had happened.
The crisis we face is characterised because [the situation in Ferguson] is so racially outspoken that they had to draw attention to it.
According to the professor of English at the Ohio State University in Ohio, Ferguson brought to light the problems that African women have to face every day and which are not seen as "women's questions" in the cultural sphere.
"I can post funny stories about life with my partner on Facebook, and it gets 150 kicks from people from all over the world," Mitchell said.
When I write something about the colourants being trapped in their own country, it's a deafening silence.
"How is it that a woman can speak publicly about relationships, but not about security in public space?" she asked.
For black women like Mitchell, who have addressed the issue of race, gender and sexuality in American history, there is no question of race and the gender of dichotomy.
The black women, she said, could not have the luxury of sharing the problems clearly: they live in this mixed reality every day.
Although the white women are now coined with the issue of race and gender in mainstream feminist circles, Angela Hattery, a female-speaking professor and gender studies at George Mason University, says their predecessors did the opposite.
Between 1865 and 1890 at least 10,000 blacks were lynched and the reason was in almost all cases of white rape," Hattery said.
To justify the lynching, you needed the collaboration of a white woman.
According to Hattery, the split between white women and black women came when a campaign fighter like Susan B. Anthony explored the terrain at the end of the 19th century and realized that only one group of people - women or black people - could have the right to vote.
"They decided to bet cards on women's voting rights and the right for blacks to focus later," Hattery explained.
When we realize this, we get an important outlook on why colored women don't trust white women.
We didn't do a good job.
We never helped black women protect their husbands and children.
Even after women were given the right to vote in 1920, it took ten years to organize against lynching at the Southern Women's Association for the Prevention of Lynching.
The group was formed 40 years after the blacks first asked for help.
According to Mitchell, the surge in the white feminists' reactions to the questions that events in Ferguson have brought about - the question of police behavior, racial discrimination - reflects a time when white feminists had to "cover up" the questions that black women faced generations.
"Wouldn't it be great if the activists in these areas of [the traditional feminism] took the right to raise a child as seriously as they took the right to contraception?" Mitchell asked.
The second wave of feminists to make a career fight for reproductive law and access to contraception are now investigating what it means.
Major feminist activists like Gloria Steinem took Facebook's attack two weeks after the shooting of Michael Brown, where they posted a Guardian column of Rebecca Carroll, which demanded that white Americans protest more aggressively against racism.
"I hope that women who have different but nevertheless similar reasons for understanding the dangers of society - and the views on the race that differ significantly in the opinion polls - will seek change," Steinem wrote.
Although Steinem espouses intersectoral feminism, which encompasses both race and gender issues, her comments on the question of race in America confuse some people.
American Enterprise Institute expert Christina Sommers, author of "Who Steals Feminism?" told The People that young men in the United States, especially young colored men, are "much more vulnerable to their sisters," but Stein's remarks by Ferguson have faced criticism before.
We now have hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but almost none for the boys.
But when the White House launched the small My Brother's Keeper program to help vulnerable young blacks and Hispanics, many feminists, including Gloria Stein, drew furious reactions.
The police's relationship with the black community is not the only problem that comes to the forefront of mainstream feminism.
After U.S. Border Police detained nearly 63,000 unaccompanied teenagers in the south-west of the country this year, the issue of reform of immigration laws - this time as a women's question - has reiterated the issue of reform.
Andrea Mercad, co-chaeying We Belong Together, an organization mobilizing women to reform immigration laws, said that in order to present the issue as a necessity for women, the only thing she had to do was share the stories of the immigrant women.
"They speak for themselves," says Mercado.
As most work permits are granted to men, the women who come with them find themselves in a position of vulnerable in terms of domestic violence and abuse.
"These stories are echoed in women's organizations," she said.
The residence of the pig in Ipswich for sale
The real estate agency had removed the picture of the house for sale in Suffolk - when it was published, a pig was resting on it in the living room.
The one-room homeowner, which is for sale for £120,000, is on a private trip in Ipswich.
The information photos included a picture of the living room in which he rests with his head on the pig's sofa.
The real estate agency Connells said the pig in the photograph was a pet of the owners.
"The photo was there by mistake, and that's why it's already been removed," the office spokesman said.
In the property's property information, the real estate agency, Connells, described the former prayer room as a "single single one-bedroom house."
Although the office has already removed the photo from its website, it still appears in the promotional material.
The sale of the house sparked interest on social networks, where some asked whether the pig was included in the price.
After winning the lottery, the city of Harvey has a recent millionaire in the southwest
A lottery player in Harvey gets a million.
A search for a new millionaire in southeast Perth is underway, with one lucky man taking $1.1 million from Saturday's lottery campaign home.
The Harvey Traffic was lucky for the second time in five years, the last time it was a $1 million win in November 2009.
But the happy winner has yet to register.
The store's owner, Steve Forward, said the entire city in the southwest of Perth was talking about the winnings.
It's the main theme, and everyone is upset.
We thought a win like this was to the touch.
Eight winners split a single win in Western Australia last month, capping off a few happy weeks.
Last weekend, a player in Canning Vale became one of the five millionaires in August, and just a few weeks earlier in Belmont, the couple had won a whopping $7.5 million.
The winning pair had been betting for twenty years and said the prize would allow them to travel the world and buy a new house.
The millionaire of Harvey is the 59th lottery winner in Western Australia this year, winning a total of $85 million.
The Deutsche Bahn trains will not start in the evening.
Train drivers want higher wages
In a press release, GDL called the protest a warning strike for which he deliberately chose time outside the rush hour.
With the chosen time of the strike, GDL takes into account the number of people who return from the weekend to the rail only on the first day of the working day.
At the same time, we are also thinking about commuters during the day," the trade union said in a press release on Monday morning to announce the strike.
"Our first strike should be hit primarily by freight, less so by passengers," GDL said.
DB has yet to release an official response to the strike announcement.
Nor is it clear how the protest action will affect international railway connections, including with the Czech Republic.
The union is demanding a five per cent increase in train drivers' wages and a reduction in working hours by two hours per week.
Currently, the average salary for female train drivers varies between 36,000 and 46,000 euros (998,000 and 1.27 million crowns) per year, depending on the years worked.
Train drivers at DB work 39 hours a week.
DB refuses to accept pay increases in the event of a reduction in working hours.
They stress that the pay for train drivers must be developed in the same way as for other railway staff, for whom DB does not provide for shortening the working week.
Krest's car was in danger of catching fire.
That's why he quit the Barum Rally
What exactly happened?
It was a material defect.
The car was brand new, so it didn't even occur to me that something like this would happen.
Could the exhaust not be rearmed and continued at a slower pace to the service station, where would the mechanics replace it?
If we'd just headed there, yes.
But there were two more stages ahead of us, and we couldn't.
It's got a high temperature, and the risk of the car starting to burn was a big one.
I can't afford that.
At full pace, you've done five stages of the stage.
What was your impression of them?
Very good.
I felt like I was young.
We were fast, yet I didn't drive through the vint.
Everything was caused by the fact that we had been piping the car for more than six months to make it on some level.
The race showed that we did it.
You drove it so hard you could realistically be thinking of winning.
I prepared myself and the car in such a way that we really had to win.
Work has not come to nothing.
On the other hand, the result we could have been thinking about didn't work out.
But it's Barumka.
Unfortunately, the technique said no.
You weren't the only one of the top guys who stepped down prematurely from the fight for the first.
Foreign favorites Breen, Abbring or Lappi also dropped out.
Were you surprised that so many favorites resigned?
Yes.
It was a pity for the spectators, especially, because the race was over for prematurely.
Jaromír Tarabus, to whom you are preparing a car, moved to the top for a long time.
But he paid for the fact that he flew off the track and took a nearly two-minute shortfall.
How were you satisfied with his performance?
It's a shame because he could have repeated the podium.
He was running the first second time.
But Mira also confirmed that we had set up the car well.
He was going very fast.
Exactly one year ago, you announced the end of your career, yet you appeared at the start of the Barum rally.
Can you feel good about the ride again making a regular rally racer?
Certainly not at the moment.
I said last year that Barumka was my last race and I still didn't keep up.
I decided to go it again.
It was my 19th start here, and if there's another chance in a year, I think I'll do it.
But I don't think about anything else.
A lot of people arrived at the track just for you.
Were you pleased?
To a certain extent, we started just because of them.
A lot of people, acquaintances or unknowns, kept asking if I was going to go.
I wanted to make them happy.
What's next for you after Barumka?
The team continues on.
Next week we will go to Vyškov, where Robert Adolf will race.
I hope he didn't do much damage here.
In addition, he wants to borrow the Fabia of Honza Sýkora from us for this race.
With Mira we have a European double race in Switzerland and Corsica.
To do that, we'll have to do things for next year.
Can you imply anything?
No, nothing's decided.
When the Corsican Rally was in the World Championships, you reached your best in the series with fifth place.
Aren't you tempted to try out the tracks there again?
Not tempted.
Oral deal with employer may be a problem
Unfortunately, you did not have a sick leave certificate issued by the doctor, which serves as evidence for the organisation that you cannot perform workkeeping for health reasons.
Moreover, you did not immediately notify the absence of the employer.
There was then an agreement to register the days as a holiday, but the agreement was only conducted orally.
Although the Labour Code does not require it to have the employer's consent to take leave receipt in writing, in practice this procedure has worked well.
If there is only an oral agreement, you do not have confirmation of the agreement.
Later, the alleged consent to the take-off of leave, as in your case, can be denied and absenteered at work as a long-term unexcused absence, therefore a reason for the immediate termination of the employment relationship under Section 53 of the Labour Code.
In the event of a lawsuit over an appointment with your employer, you lack demonstrable evidence.
However, the employment relationship with you has not been cancelled under Section 53, only you have given given days in the creditshe as an unexcused absence.
The unexplained absence from the credit note does not have the same consequences as Section 53 (e.g. the impossibility of receiving material unemployment security), yet the possibility of seeking a new job is made more difficult.
We recommend you to see your doctor again and have it confirmed in writing that there has actually been an accident, as a result of which you were incapable of work (this is not a so-called "disability" document, it is only a doctor's certificate).
When looking for a new job, you can present the document and explain the situation.
In practice, it is advisable not to underestimate both the issuance of a written medical certificate of incapacity for work and an early notification to the employer or to request written consent to take leave.
You avoid any complications.
Accident by Tony Stewart on his return to the track
The return to the track ended for Tony Stewart just beyond the halfway line of Atlanta Motor Speedway.
Stewart hit the fence for the second time after his right front tire blew up in the 172nd lap, and the race was over for him.
Stewart drove the wrecked car into the garage, did not comment on the reporters, and left.
The head of his team, Chad Johnston, said the No. 14 is disappointed, but will now concentrate on the race in Richmond, Virginia, which will take place next weekend.
"I'd like us to have a better performance and a better finish," Johnston said.
We'll go to Richmond and hope we do better there.
Stewart crashed into the fence for the first time in Sunday night's race after a collision with Kyle Bushch, which required the right side of his car to be repaired.
"We had hopes of a good finish in today's race," Johnston said, adding, "It just didn't work out."
Not long after the second crash, Stewart's car was loaded and the team packed up and ready to leave.
After hitting and killing another driver at a race in New York, Stewart skipped three NASCAR Sprint Cup races.
He decided to return this weekend and needed to win either the race in Atlanta or the next race in Richmond to catch up with the spot in the table.
He returned to racing during an investigation into the tragic accident in which the death of 20-year-old Kevin Ward Jr., who drove Stewart into his path during the race.
Authorities said the investigation into the cause of the accident would take at least another two weeks.
It has not yet been decided whether Stewart will face any charges.
The three-time champion received warm encouragement before the race.
Stewart started in 12th place, worked his way to the 10th at the start of the race and then even to the 4th.
Then, at the start of the 122nd round, with Busch's No.
18 got out of control, came out of the second corner and crashed into Stewart, sending both cars to the booth.
Stewart continued, but withdrew to 21st.
Prague Seps New Pickpoint Post Manager, earns $12.3 million
Prague has completed tenders for new taxi service station managers.
It receives around CZK 12.3 million annually for 103 parking spaces.
Until recently, it collected CZK 150,000 annually for the same seats for the drivers of the cars of the taxi.
This was reported by Councillor Lukáš Manhart (TOP 09).
Previously, the city used a draw to select administrators.
The winner then received a lease for a flat-rate amount of CZK 1,000 per year.
But the rules have changed.
The level of the offer currently decides.
"A year from the termination of the original lease agreements and the start of tenders, the new rental system has been shown to be far more advantageous for Prague and, overall, fairer," the councillor says.
The most expensive spot is Na Perštýně
The highest price was offered by those interested in the post in Na Perštýně Street.
They pay CZK 2.1 million annually.
Approximately CZK 1.5 million were paid by the new administrators for seats in front of the Municipal House or on Wenceslas Square.
The new rules for leases of taxi service stations were adopted by councillors in the autumn of 2012 and in the summer of last year they terminated the original lease agreements.
The selection procedures were held in four waves and the new administrator was found to be 29 by the site.
For the second time this year, we had to clean the well.
We released it all each time, creating a practically second pond around the cottage.
Then we poured the Savo in.
Incredible stench!
Our well in the cellar always provided plenty of beautiful fragrant water.
And she wasn't very expert at that, Grandpa scooped it out with his own help.
Long time ago.
She was just three scrubs and generally quirky, as was everything in the cottage, but as I say.
The water was great.
Until this year.
When we started the season, of course we exhausted the water.
When she stood there for months, she deserved it.
But even then, it seemed to us that the water didn't smell.
We wondered if something had fallen in.
At the point where the pump passed, it was possible with a bit of bad luck, there wasn't quite a load, so the opening was sewn by a piece of brick.
Our inspection confirmed that the brick was moving.
Otherwise, you couldn't see anything in the water, and we shone through it to the bottom.
So we released it again and cleaned it.
Of course, we upgraded the improvised seal around the pump pipe.
In the basement, however, we noticed strange things.
There was a sticky packet of bones on the ground.
At least that's what it looked like.
And one step away, another one.
Now it looked like a dung-filled mouse.
At the ceiling, in places where there are vents, Grandpa's invention, there were the remains of the fish!
And heavy-angled!
Our cellar is self-deprecating, too.
Some would say Grandpa just burgled the cabin.
And he would not be that far off the mark.
The walls and the floor are only packed with sand, only the ceiling is underwrapped.
It's mainly the boats.
And the wheels.
And deck chairs for the beach.
The gates with wide gaps were mostly open, as someone went there all the time.
At the ceiling of several of the aforementioned vents.
No net, so birds are routinely flown there and nests are being floored on the rafters.
It is useless to mention mice.
Grandpa wanted it to be flogged, and it did.
Now, of course, the luft didn't help.
The whole cellar stank.
So we cleaned the whole cellar.
Especially the fish on the beam was nutritious!
We threw out the things that were around: boards, heckle board, and so on.
Our cottage at a distance greeted passers-by with a disinfectant odor.
We were wondering who could have brought us the disgusting remains in there?
The nearest cat lives two kilometres from here in the village.
It would be hard to come to us to snack.
Grandpa was attacked by a neighbor who's not quite right.
Did he, the Franta, didn't he screw us up the venues?
He's here practically all year round, stupid ideas, he's the one.
We decided to watch the cellar and the well and check regularly.
After a few days, everything was fine.
We started using the water again, so far just for washing and washing, before the tests are ready, but it was good.
Pulling water from the forest well is nothing I've wanted to do for a long time.
We once heard the terrible anxious barking of our bitch.
Mom looked out of the balcony and saw a long, thick black hose in the grass next to the porch.
The rheretch bounced over her and squeezed like a fool.
Her mother scolded her because she thought Réza had dug up the waste hose from the sink.
Suddenly, however, the hose was partially coiled into the ball and partially straightened up.
The balcony was hissed.
Réza had a hysterical fit.
We ran down.
The snake, well over a metre long and as fat as a bull, was about to swallow a huge toad, and Réza prevented her from doing so.
It wasn't clear if she wanted to save the toad, or if she wanted to eat it herself, but that was irrelevant.
When the snake saw the outnumber in the form of our entire family, she probably told herself to eat it when we're so hungry and stretched gracefully through the vent into the basement.
We flew after her.
Like a lightning bolt, she jumped behind the well.
By the way, we've recorded another stinking package on her record.
The smell is probably a fish.
The day before yesterday, she wasn't there!
Our new security around the pump was a bit of a scourge.
And we locked the basement in the day.
That he would...
We went out and there we went to the hatch.
We didn't wait long.
It rummelled to the well.
First there was a flat head with yellow moons on his neck.
Then the whole snake rose to the well.
She wrapped around the pump and began to break in.
The fired employee took revenge, bought laptops on the company and sold them
The jilted employee, after being laid off, purchased computers from the company and then sold them.
He managed to spend the money raised before being detained by the police.
Within a short time, the man had purchased a total of sixteen computers for more than two hundred thousand crowns in twelve cases.
"He took the notbooks to Olomouc after the takeover, where he sold them around the bazaars," said the head commissioner of the Šumperk police, Rostislav Brückner.
The motive for the fraud was revenge on the employer for dismissal, as well as the profit of the money.
"In the interrogation, he told us that he had used the money to repay the loans," Brückner said.
Police also discovered that the impostor was a pathological player who had been repeatedly being treated in a psychiatric hospital.
The money could also end up in slot machines or video lottery terminals.
"The fact is, we didn't find any money with him," the commissioner said.
The fraudster, who has already been convicted of theft once, now faces a prison term of one to five years.
Officers have yet to say whether the punishment is also at risk of the bazaars that the under-priced laptops have bought and continued to sell them.
"It is true that they were taking over brand new goods, which is at least suspicious," the Commissioner stated.
However, none of the bazaar's owners have yet been charged.
Come on, a little more, you'll do it or how I enjoyed We Run Prague
This year, the organizers have prepared some changes for us.
The biggest one was the change of route, which brought the destination to the float, rather than leading back to the Yellow Spa.
I was looking forward to the race with the rest of the Rungo.cz team, but I was going to live it a bit from the other side.
We and the team decided to personally greet our readers at the booth, where we took pictures and made videos together.
To perfect my view from the other side, I took on the role of a personal conductor.
Together with our friend Katya, we obediently placed ourselves at the end of the corridor for 60 to 70 minutes just before the start.
We greeted our friends, who were passing by us to the sector for faster runners.
There wasn't much time left.
A few jumpers to warm up, turn on the sports testers, the countdown and start!
Screams of cheers, but instead of a quick start, the scurrying to the starting line followed.
After five minutes we come to the gate, turn on the measurements and break off at a rate of ten.
Weave with a yellow snake of runners who, like Katya, run their first race.
So far, everyone looks fresh, with the slowly descending sun in the sky giving the view of Vyšehrad an almost kitsch-shaped tinge.
The pulsing mass stretching along the waterfront looks as if the whole of Prague is running here.
Traditionally, on the waterfront between Vyšehrad and the National Theatre, it is traditionally starting to show who has how many strengths.
A light hill in Palacký Square forces many runners to slow down or walk to the walk.
Just before the run-up to the Theatre I see a police entourage and just behind him, Vítek Pavlišta flies to the finish line at an incredible pace.
I hear the admiring fuzzi of other runners' sighs.
I move to the edge of the track, encourage him, he prepares to slap me, but just before that my leg spins and our hands just miss each other.
With the Story Street, it gives a chance for a short rest and a breeze.
It is needed, there are places ahead of us where the views will take my breath away.
A turnaround on the Mánes Bridge shows Prague in the whole beauty of the setting sun.
I'm not in the mood and my feet are almost alone.
Behind the first refreshment, there's a moment of truth.
As the road runs over, Katya stumbles against the curb and performs a leap in a swimmer.
I'm looking to see if she needs help, and I'm running a series of encouraging words to keep her time to think about pain.
It rises and we continue with Goat's Lane, it's one of the narrowest points of the track, there's no such rush at this stage of the race, but it's still necessary to keep a good eye on the surroundings.
I have no idea yet that the term of the narrowest place will gain its true meaning later.
Beyond the Powder Gate, we are frenetically encouraged by the tourists and friends of the other runners.
I try to clap with anyone who offers a hand, and I advise Kata, because ten cuddles with the fans is like half the energy bars.
It really works, we are speeding up again and although we have fallen quite significantly, now the pursuit has started.
We're getting ahead of dozens of runners as I pass someone particularly tired, I try to cheer them up with a few words: "Come on, a little more, you can do it!"
Beyond the last refreshment, no one is overtaking us, we are speeding up.
So far we've run for an hour and a quarter, we're adding, there's nothing to wait for.
Three kilometres to the finish will hurt, but you need to really work.
The sun has set its course and the end of the day is symbolically ending the race.
The last run to the bridge, the turn and just the straight to the finish.
The pace we're running makes me wonder, where does that girl come from?
"Come on, we'll go under the hour of thirteen, we're working!" I call.
We're trying, we're sprinting, and there's a goal.
An hour of 13 and six seconds.
Well, what can I do?
The coach set the limit for an hour of twenty.
So seven minutes to plan.
Which is a great result.
Just behind the goal, Kata's legs are on, helping her to the railing, where she rests for a while.
You can see exhaustion, but also the luck of a well-done performance.
After a while, I slowly lead her out of the target's space.
The euphoria doesn't give us to think of the crush in the passageways to the dressing rooms.
You can see here that Goat Lane wasn't the narrowest of place.
That's where the float is behind the target, which is crammed to bursting with the onslaught of almost ten thousand runners.
If someone doesn't like crowds, it's not a place for them.
I, too, is losing my head after a while, and I wonder if the gorgeous views and the more interesting route compared to previous years, was worth what was happening at the finish line.
I know from my own experience that hosting a race is no fun.
If it is joined by ten thousand people, a rich accompanying programme and the closure of the entire centre of Prague for all transport, it is a huge challenge.
This year's route change showed runners many interesting places, but it also brought some really unpleasant surprises.
The excellent atmosphere pumped up in the Yellow Spa was transferred to the runners and in the race itself.
Organizers around the track and random spectators stepped up it on every metro of the track.
Unfortunately, during the city's historic centre, obstacles must be taken into account, which cannot be removed, but I do not consider the target of the mass race in the place, which is bounded on one side by a wall and on the other by a river.
If I tell myself that the race ended with a finish, I rate it as very good.
Behind the goal I was a little worried about the health of those involved, but in the end everything turned out well.
Write to us in the discussion if you liked the route as well and what do you say about the situation at the finish.
Prison guards in Bulgaria to organise protests
Hundreds of prison staff across Bulgaria attended a national protest rally in the Justice Ministry in the capital Sofia.
At a peaceful demonstration, they reiterated their demand for the reintroduction of the original working conditions, which have recently changed.
The list of requirements to be discussed with the interim Justice Minister Hristo Ivanov also includes higher salaries.
Peacekeepers symbolically protested against the new working hours for the month, demanding a return to the original twenty-four-hour shifts.
Although the union of the prison guards and representatives of the Ministry of Justice met, they did not agree, the Bulgarian State Radio (BNR) reported.
"Negotiations are still ongoing," said the head of the General Directorate of Prison, Rosen Zhelyazkov, of the BNR.
Protests of prison staff are also expected to be joined by members of the Federation of Trade Unions of Employees at the Ministry of the Interior.
Why the universe can be of more size and we can't see them
Physicists don't usually write bestsellers, but Brian Green of Columbia University made a hit on the spot in 1999.
His book The Elegant Universe became the most accessible way for laymen to penetrate the thicket of problems that a number of theoretical physicists today discusses - to unify two superbly functioning but mutually incompatible discoveries of the 20th century: quantum theory and the theory of general relativity.
One of the causes of the success of the Elegant Universe is undoubtedly that the search for a unified physical theory is not a boring story.
Physicists have solved the basic problem between two key theories (after all, our universe is de facto divided into two worlds with different laws) was solved and solved so imaginatively that it stands by it for retelling even to the layoffs.
Moreover, Greene had dealt with the complex material so fresh and engagingly that it was impossible to blame him for not including how many interesting things he had included in his book.
Moreover, he made up for the most part his "mistake" in the next two books: the Structure of the Universe and Hidden Reality.
Apparently, even the author would not object to his book becoming obsolete more quickly, but the fact is that, even after 15 years, the Elegant Universe still provides almost everything essential that an informed layman with the ambition to understand the world to know about this important part of theoretical physics.
It is quite likely that in the coming years it will be a bit more vivid in this area after all (for example, because the LHC accelerator will finally go on a "full-gas"), and so it is a good time to enter Green's non-violently open door of the world of modern physics.
How many dimensions can our universe have?
The idea that perhaps our universe has more than three spatial dimensions may sound foolish, fantastic, strangely or mystical.
Yet it is concrete and completely acceptable.
To be sure of that, let's take our eyes from the universe as a whole to something of a more mundane, specifically to a long and thin, watering hockey.
Imagine how to stretch the 100-meter garden hose from one side of the canyon to the other and watch the entire scenery from a half-kilometre distance (as in the picture and on the following page).
From such a distance you can easily detect a long long in a horizontal direction stretched hose, but if you are not suffering from the sharpness, you can hardly tell the thickness of the hose.
Given your long distance from the hose, you'd think that an ant forced to live on a hose has only one dimension in which to walk: a left-right dimension along the hose.
When someone asks you where the ant was at the moment, you answer with just one particular indication: the distance of the ante from the left (or right) end of the hose.
All we want to say is that from a half-kilometre distance, a long piece of hose looks like a one-dimensional object.
In the real world, the hose has a thickness.
If we enlarge everything, we suddenly see a second dimension - in the shape of a circle, a frolicking hose.
In such an enlarged view, it is clear that the ant can actually move in two independent dimensions: in an already well-known left-right dimension along the length of the hose, but also in "distortion/agition of the clockwise direction of movement", i.e. around the circular cut of the hose.
You begin to understand that you must enter two numbers to determine the position of the small anteat: how far from the end of the hose and where there is a frying hose on the circle.
This reflects the fact that the surface of the hose is two-dimensional (note. Experts will note that this chapter focuses purely on the disorder theory of the strings.
Non-protection aspects are discussed in Chapters and 12th and 13th.
The surface of the hose is two-dimensional: one longitudinal dimension is shown by a straight arrow, a dimension in the direction of the circumference, marked with a circular arrow, is short and coiled.
There is, however, a clear difference between the two dimensions.
The size along the hose is long and easy to see.
The dimension-encrying circuit of the hose is short, "worthened" and less noticeable.
To realise the existence of a circular dimension, we had to examine the hose with a significantly better resolution.
The example in question illustrates an important property of spatial dimensions.
That they divide into two groups.
They can be either large, vast and therefore directly visible, or small, coiled and much less observable.
Of course, in this case, we didn't exactly get overturned to reveal the "wine" dimension of the hose's faded thickness.
All you had to do was take the binoculars to help.
But if the hose were thinner - like a hair or a capillary - we would have detected the coiled dimensional dimension with great effort.
Kaluza sent his article to Einstein in 1919 in which he came up with the astonishing thought that the spatial geometry of the universe might have more than three known dimensions to all of us.
Kaluza justified his radical assertions by saying that the additional dimension provided an elegant and convincing framework in which Einstein's general relativity and Maxwell's electromagnetic theory could be woven into a single, unified conceptual structure.
Immediately, the question arises as to how this observation of Kaluzek goes together with the obvious fact that we see just three dimensions of the space.
The response Kaluza quietly assumed between the lines and which was clearly stated and clarified by the Swedish mathematician Oskar Klein in 1926 stands and falls, claiming that the spatial geometry of our universe may have both large and coiled dimensions.
This means that, as well as the dimensions in the direction of the hose length, our universe has a large, vast and slightly visible three dimensions, the existence of which we are aware of at any moment.
But by analogy with the circular circumference of the garden hose, the universe may have additional dimensions, tightly coiled into a space so tiny that so far they have remained hidden from our most sophisticated experimental apparatus.
To get a clearer picture of the nature of Kaluza's remarkable proposal, let's stick with the hose for a while.
Imagine drawing a fairly dense of circles on the circumference of the hose in a fairly dense color.
From the stand, the hose still looks like a thin one-dimensional line.
With the telescope, thanks to the drawing, we will now reveal the coiled dimension even more easily, as we will see the theme from Figure 2.
We can clearly see that the surface of the hose is two-dimensional, with one dimension large and almost unlimited and with the other short and circular.
Kaluza and Klein came up with the idea that our universe has a similar structure, but apart from one small circular dimension, it has three large spatial dimensions, a combined four-seater dimension.
It is difficult to draw an object with too many dimensions.
To help our imagination a little, let's note the illustration on Figure 3; it shows two large dimensions and one small circular dimension.
In the picture, we magnify the view of the geometry of space in much the same way that we enlarged the surface of the hose.
Each subsequent level represents a huge increase in the geometry of the space from the previous level.
Our universe may have additional dimensions (we see them at the fourth level of magnification) if they are cooed into a small enough space; we explain that we have not yet directly observed them.
The square network depicts the commonly known "large" dimensions, while the circle is a new, tiny and coiled dimension.
Just like the loops of the thread in the densely woven carpet, even these circles exist in each place of the usual size - we just drew them into the intersect in the square network for the sake of clarity.
The background of Figure 4 shows the commonly known space structure - the ordinary world around us - in such normal scales as the meters, the viewed side of a small square in a square network.
On each of the following images, we focus on the small range of the picture preceding; we will enlarge it to become visible.
At first, nothing special is happening, as we see at the first levels of enlargement.
However, when we advance on our journey to the microscopic properties of the space's geometry further - to the fourth level of magnification in Figure 3 - we suddenly see a new, shaped circle of coiled dimension, similar to the loops of a thread in a densely woven piece of carpet.
Kaluza and Klein came up with the idea that the additional circular dimension exists in each place in the direction of the large dimensions, as the hose has a circular circuit at each point in its length.
For the sake of clarity, we have drawn the circular dimension only in some of the regularly spaced points.
Figure 4 of Kaluza's and Klein's ideas of the microscopic structure of the space's geometry are summarized.
The similarity with the hose is obvious, although we also see important differences.
First, the universe has three large, echoing spatial dimensions (of which we drew only two), whereas the hose has only one large dimension.
The more important difference is that we are now talking about the spatial geometry of the universe itself, not just any object within the universe, like our hose.
But the basic idea is the same.
If the additional circular coiled dimension is extremely miniature, recognizing it is much harder to recognize it - like the circular circuit of the hose - than to observe the obvious, large and vast dimensions.
If the size of the additional dimension is small enough, it will actually be revealed beyond the strength of our state-of-the-art enlargement tools.
But the most important thing is that the additional dimension is not merely a rounded bump inside of normal proportions, as the two-dimensional illustration mistakenly suggests.
The circular dimension is a new dimension that exists at each point of three common large dimensions.
It is the size of the other three dimensions independent as the dimensions of the top-down, from the left-right and from the front-backed independent (and perpendicular) each other.
A rather small ante could move in all four dimensions, and we would need four data to determine its position, in addition to the usual three, a position in the circular dimension; if you count the time, the data five, in any case one more than we would normally expect.

The price for the e-book is 149,- CZK.
To our surprise, then, we find that, while we are aware of the existence of only three dimensions of space, Kaluza and Klein's thinking shows that this does not preclude the existence of additional coiled proportions if they are small enough.
The universe may well have more dimensions than we can see with the naked eye.
How small should they be?
The state-of-the-art technical equipment can recognize the structures of the big billionth of a billionth of the meter.
The smaller, coiled dimensions can hardly be seen.
In 1926, Klein combined Kaluza's original idea with several ideas from the emerging quantum mechanics.
His calculations indicated that the additional circular dimension could be in size of about one Planck length, far from the resolution of today's devices.
Since then, physicists have called the possibility of additional small spatial dimensions Kaluza-Klein's theory.
Wohnout Honza Homola advises on how to practice on electric guitar: episode 5
The whole essence of "twelve" lies in a 12-act harmonic form, which you can repeat at will.
Whoever fumbles in music theory will find its principle detailed here.
Jan Homola, or Honza Homolka Tobolka (1976)
By educating the puppeteer and the puppeteer, whose Facebook profile can be tracked here, has made a living as a graphic artist since graduation twenty years ago.
He is the guitarist of the band Wohnout, which is said to be reportedly impossible to leave.
The guitarist is the father, as is Brother Matej, the leader of the Wohnouts.
Start with the coaching on one string.
"The rhythmic model is up to you, you can invent anything, just apply it to a harmonic model of the 12," says Honza.
If you add another string, you can change the figure again.
Just listen to it and watch Honza to figure out what you can with the 12-cylinder harmony on two strings and how pretty it's starting to sound.
If you take the third chord, you can already flirt with the melody of a song.
When you finally add a fourth, beware of the change in tuning, Honza points out in the video.
Next time, Honza will return to the pentatonice and try to put it together with the 12th.
So practice it honestly.
As best as you can, you will read this in an interview with Jan Homola at the first lesson of his school play on electric guitar here.
Another goal without waiting?
It's not for a big celebration, Hradec Dvořák acknowledges
We take the point and we are happy for it.
The first half we had more chances, the second the home side," said the striker, who scored from the penalty spot this time.
Weren't you nervous about playing it, was he accompanied by a huge whistle after all?
I didn't particularly notice it, although it would have been worse for the second goal, where the home fans are.
You equalised with the penalty after half an hour, but you also scored from the penalty spot after less than four minutes.
What's the matter?
We overslept the start, we were passive, it came out of that corner and then a penalty.
After that, you got up and the first half you were the better team that had more chances.
Why did that change after the break?
It's hard to say.
I agree that we played well after the goal scored a goal well.
In the booth we said we wanted to keep the game pace after it, but we couldn't do it.
To tell you the truth, I can't even explain why.
But it is probably also true that the home side said something about their game at the break, they probably weren't very happy with it.
You only scored for the first time on the pitch of the opponent, while at home you might not have scored a goal.
Why is it so different?
I wouldn't say it makes that much of a difference, it's up to us to deal with it.
We started well in Brno, but then it was bad for us, Plzeň, that's a different category.
You waited for a goal for four games, weren't you worried that it could be similar after the last game?
Not really, but of course we are glad that since the last game we do not have to listen to talk about waiting for a goal.
Now we've added more without waiting, but there's still only three in six games, which is not yet the big celebration.
Iceland - the lava flows from a kilometer away from the crater.
Lava flying out to the surface in the Holuhraun area near the Vatnajökull glacier, flows through an underground tunnel from a crater a kilometre away.
It is located under the glacier, as is part of the aforementioned underground lava tunnel.
This fact now worries scientists the most...
For now, the situation remains unchanged.
Since yesterday morning (318.
2014) still fours from the fissure of approximately the same amount of lava.
However, compared to the original estimates, its amount is lower, not 1000 m3, but "only" 300-400 m3.
Compared to the previous eruption of 29.8.
2014 is up to 50 times larger.
However, scientists fear that the lava tunnel could also be opened in places where it is under the ice.
If this were to happen, with a similar intensity to the current eruption, it would mean huge flooding, both on the Jökulsá river á Fjöllum and other rivers.
There is a strong smell of sulphur in the vicinity of the eruption, clouds of steam and gases rise from the crack.
It is certainly not an eruption suitable for tourism, as was the case with the Fimmvörðuháls eruption in 2010.
This is much bigger and there are also many more gases," says volcanologist Ármann Höskuldsson.
However, the weather has improved considerably since yesterday, with almost no wind in the area in the morning.
The traces of the sandstorm were washed with rain.
Scientists can continue their work.
For air traffic, the orange stage (second highest) for Bárðarbung and the yellow (third) for Askja apply.
The sky over Cheb was a brave Lady Peggy.
She walked the flanks
Aerial Day in Cheb.
The Boeing Stearman PT-17 was introduced to the aircraft acrobat Peggy Walentin, who climbed out of the cockpit from the cockpit to the trapeze on the upper wing of the biplane and also between the wings.
There it is confined to the strength of the muscles.
The air day in Cheb was held for the fifth time this year and the organizers again managed to prepare some interesting aerial bits.
The premiere at the oldest Czech airport was not only "walked on the flanks" by the German acrobat Peggy Walentin, but also the legendary P-51 D Mustang fighter or the Beechcraft 18.
He drew attention to himself with his shining cover.
The acrobatics called Wingwalking originated in the US.
After World War I, many former war pilots were thus trying to get ahead.
But because of the large number of fatalities, it was banned.
But today, he is slowly returning to the air-long day schedule.
Peggy will climb from the cockpit to the upper wing after the start.
There he performs various exercises.
Towards the end of the performance, it will move into the space between the wings of the aircraft, where her show continues," described Luděk Matějíček from the Cheb Ultralight Club and the organizer of the air day.
The pilot of the Boeing Stearman 75 E aircraft is her husband Friedrich.
If Peggy's performance was the main highlight of the program, then the next performance of the Mustang fighter was the legendary icing on the cake.
The legendary fighter rushed to the desktop with the Grippen of the Army of the Czech Republic in tow (so-called numbers).
Such a line-up could be seen by aviation fans in the Czech Republic for the first time.
The pilot Miroslav Sázavský then showed everyone a breathtaking acrobatics with an aircraft from 1945.
It was made during the war, but he probably never participated in it.
He was included in the Army Reserve.
He has been active in the civil sphere since 1963.
Even as a racing aircraft.
Today, he has his home hangar at the airport in Munich Hradiste.
There is also another pearl of Cheb air day, the twin-engine Beechcraft C45H Expeditor.
At the airport, the massive machine could not be overlooked.
His polished aluminum coating glowed in the distance.
The Max Holste MH 1521M Broussard in the colours of the French Air Force also gained an aristocracy.
The small airliner was taken aback by the rendecepted Turbolet and brought part of the German delegation from the German Hof on the air day.
German neighbors performed in Cheb with the renovated aircraft of the Yak, the likes of the Bücker Jungmann, a three-man binder.
Lucie Borhy: A dramatic return to the camera!
The petition worries were traded by Lucie Borhy at least for the evening for the business.
Stress or nervousness - the blonde presenter clearly doesn't know any of this.
The TV news showers were going well for her, as if she hadn't stopped with him for two months!
It's only been two weeks since the blonde's six-year-old ended up, in which women experience the most stress after giving birth.
Lucie, however, will not be shown regularly in the main news bulletin of TV Nova.
A regular return is not expected for a month, according to Blesk.cz.
After all, her daughter Linda now needs her more than the TV audience.
Lucie Borhy returned to the TV screen and it was a hit.
Exhibitions a year in Prague?
The hall would sell out, plans Jagr's bachelor party
It would be dignified if something like this was done during the World Cup.
But it depends on how the union goes about it," he said in Jihlava after an exhibition called the Golden Match, in which the breathtaking Nagano team reunited.
Even the players who participated in the golden hat-trick.
Players would like to, wouldn't they?
For sure.
It would simply be a good idea to make a farewell to the golden generation during the Championships.
I think you can find one or two days during the tournament, when it's a complete day off and where you can blend in a match like this.
We'll tell Gum (Jirue Šlégrovi) or Ya's Shcherban (an organizer of the Jihlava match) who would take charge of it...
The arena would sell out.
But what if you play the New Jersey playoffs?
Well, if I come in...
You don't want to play in the national team.
Or did the Jihlava meeting somehow altered your decision?
Representation and exhibition matches are two different things and the performances are crucial in the national team.
It's one thing to like to see me there, but the performances are crucial, especially at the World Cup.
There should be players who have the money to do it, not because they have a good name.
My decision has not changed.
How did you really enjoy the Nagano reunion?
The meeting with the players alone was great.
You've brought up stories and have had a lot of fun.
It was a great experience not only for the fans, but also for us hockey players.
But the most important thing was to honor Ivan Hlinka.
And it's good to be reminded of the history of our hockey and that one generation is leaving, which was really worth it.
Slavomír Lener, Vladimír Růžička and Petr Čechmánek on the bench.
Will you still remember your first representative match?
You don't forget that stuff.
It was against the Calgary Flames and the three youngsters: me, Robert Holík and Robert Reichel, we started in one three.
It was the first representative start for everyone.
But that we would have dominated in some way, that's not to be said.
In Jihlava, Dominik Hašek was catching for a long time.
What did you say about his performance?
Hashan will never surprise me on the ice.
I wanted to give it back to him with the criticism, but I can't (Hasek criticized Jagr for the reasons why he decided to quit the national team).He just captured it excellently.
Even Hnilička performed brilliantly.
He was trained with me one night, and there was a jolt.
And now he was catching famously.
First the USA and then the Netherlands, the Socceroos start qualifying
The Smichov NH Hotel was visited by prominent guests on Monday morning.
People could see, for example, goalkeeper Petr Cech from Chelsea, the national coach Pavel Vrba...
And there, the figure in the black baseball cap, that's Tomas Rosicky!
The Arsenal midfielder and the captain of the national team arrived at the meeting around 11:30 p.m.
We have a beautiful game against the Netherlands.
Who wouldn't be happy?" he said when he had already appeared before the press in the representative set.
Programme of the Czech national team
Monday, September 1: start of the reunion, first training session
Tuesday, September 2: Training open to fans (18:30, Letná) Autographing (20:00)
Wednesday, September 3 Czech Republic - USA (20:15, Letná)
Tuesday 9th September Czech Republic - Netherlands (20:45, Letná) end of reunion
Rosicky and Co. can be supported by fans before Wednesday's match against the USA (20:15).
The team opened Tuesday's training session for them, which starts at 18:30 at Letná.
It will be followed by an autograph session, at which neither Rosický nor the Czech will be missed.
Otherwise, of course, this national team reunion will be calmer.
This is praised by coach Vrba, who just complained about the number of social events in the spring.
Finally, we will focus on what we want to do.
Now we're going to focus on the Netherlands.
It's an advantage when you have a player together for eight days.
We'll have time to rehearse things that there hasn't been that much time for so far," said Willow, who has officially led the national team since January.
The Czech national football team will be accompanied by a Musketeer image when entering the new qualifying cycle.
The team has three games under Vrba, all the preseason.
She drew 2-2 with Norway and Finland, losing 1-2 to Austria.
However, these results were not yet important.
That's now.
The match with the Netherlands will kick off qualification for the 2016 European Championship.
It would of course help the Czech team to manage a dress rehearsal against the US.
The first six months were to meet.
The results are important now.
We have to think about being successful," Willow agreed.
The only player in the 23-man nomination to have health problems is forward David Lafata.
He's suffering from the temperature.
If he failed to recover until Wednesday's match against the USA, coach Vrba would call in one more striker.
Genetic disorders are often misdiagnosed
A woman from Britain describes how, after a bad diagnosis, she thought she was going to die for many years.
After being diagnosed with another disease, Karin Rodgers spent most of her adolescence thinking she only had a few years to live.
In fact, it was Charcot-Marie-Tooth syndrome (CMT) - a group of hereditary disorders that damage the nerves outside the brain and the spine.
The charity CMT UK reported that bad diagnosis is a common problem among people with the CMT, because very little is known about the disease.
Approximately 23,000 people in the UK are believed to be suffering from CMT, which can manifest symptoms in motoring such as muscle weakness, clumsy gait and twisted toes.
Fresenshee or pain may also occur in the afflicted, the condition being incurable and progressive, which means that over time the symptoms are getting worse.
When Rodgers was thirteen, she thought she was suffering from Freidreich's ataxia (FA) - a condition that had a very poor prognosis.
She believed that before she celebrated her eighteenth birthday, she would be confined to a wheelchair, and dead before she was thirty.
The mother-of-two, who is now 51, says, "As a child, I knew I couldn't do the same things as the others.
I fell off every day and it took me longer.
I could never ride roller skates or skateboards with other children, and I was bullied at school for the way I used to walk and run."
When Rodgers was thirteen and was after several surgeries to release her Achilles' tendons and straighten her feet, she took advantage of her doctor's departure from the room and looked into her documentation, where she learned that she was suffering from the FA.
"I felt guilty because I was stalking, so I didn't tell anyone, but when I got home, I looked up information about the disease in the library and wrote to the FA Association," she says.
When they answered me, I was in shock, I completely panicked.
I thought that by the time I was eighteen, I would end up in a wheelchair, and by the time I was twenty-five, would be dead, and in the meantime, gradually, I would lose all my abilities.
I was on my own and planning a funeral."
When she was seventeen, she realized that her ability to walk had not worsened as much as she had assumed, and asked her surgeon.
He just stood up, hugged her, and said, "Golden, I don't think you've got the disease, or you'd be in a wheelchair.
I think it's going to be something far less life-threatening."
After passing several genetic tests, it was found to have a CMT.
"When he explained to me what the CMT was, I thought I was a lucky child," she said.
CMT UK, the charity organisation, launched a month of informing the CMT to highlight the disease.
Entrepreneurs in Washington: tax rises with economic turnover
The growing economy means more customers, higher sales and new jobs.
And higher taxes, too.
According to a new survey published last week, state and local corporate taxation in the country increased slightly to the recovery of the economy, and companies in Washington were no exception.
Entrepreneurs in Maryland and Virginia, together for the 2013 fiscal year, paid $27.6 billion to the Treasury and local coffers, up 3.8% higher than the $26.6 billion raised in 2012.
The tax burden - both state and local - rose by 4.3% to $671 billion last year, compared to 3.9% last year, and was the third consecutive year in a row in 2009 and 2010, when taxes were falling.
According to a study conducted by the professional firm Ernst & Young and the political grouping Center on State Taxation, government taxes were rising faster, by 4.3% than local levies, by 3.9%.
More than half of the district's tax revenue, 56%, is on a business tax, and 36% of Maryland's income is from the company.
Virginia, at 28%, shows the lowest tax revenue from the business in proportion.
Researchers argue that the majority share of tax revenue growth comes from an increase in the value of properties belonging to firms, which increased property taxes by 3.7% this year after three consecutive years with a rise of -1%).
Although most of the profits come from major nations like California, New York, and Texas, the situation seems to be the same in Washington.
Last year, D.C. Maryland and Vriginia paid over $10 billion in real estate taxes, a yearly increase of 4.2% compared to $9.6 billion in 2012.
However, the apparent increase in the value of real estate does not drive up the state and local tax revenues in Maryland so much, where the property tax represents less than a fifth of the company's taxation.
For companies in Virginia and D.C., the property tax accounts for nearly half of the state and local taxation.
"In Maryland, a lot of the real estate of the companies, especially the tax base around D.C., the government, or non-profit organizations that don't pay taxes," explained Douglas Lindholm, the Center's executive director on State Taxation.
So Maryland is forced to rely much more on income taxes, for example, to pay for the same services that are in other states.
The recent increase in business tax revenue cannot be attributed solely to the healing real estate market.
According to the data, business revenues also appear to be increasing.
Companies in the region published a tax on company income of $2.3 billion, which increased from $2.1 billion in 2012.
Maryland collected $1 billion in corporation income taxes, the most in the region.
Although they are moving in the same direction, the local tax burden on entrepreneurs is not growing just as quickly in these three places.
The growth rate in D.C. was at the national average, at 4.3%, while Maryland's growth was significantly higher, 4.9%.
In Virginia alone, the increase in taxation was below average, to 4.1%.
Virginia has the lowest corporate income tax of all three districts (all of which they have the same taxation) of the lowest corporate income tax.
The taxation rate of companies in Maryland is 8.25%, while the D.C. average remains relatively high, at 9.975%.
A similar study conducted this year by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce showed that Virginia has lower state and local taxation and a more favourable tax climate overall than Maryland.
D.C. did not evaluate the study.
Despite this advantage, Virginia faces pressure from the competition from the south.
North Carolina recently signed a law lowering company tax from 6.9% to 6%, as did Virginia, and next year the tax will be reduced to 5%.
If the state continues to meet the revenue targets in the coming year, the statutory income tax rate could be reduced to 3% in 2017.
According to a recent study, retail entrepreneurs in Washington are doing better, so they pay higher state and local taxes.
A trade-making tax paid by small business owners as a tax on personal income - the price-incrementation structure by raising the prices that most firms are organized - in D.C., Maryland and Virginia, rose by 20% to $2.4 billion last year, much faster than other taxes.
Researchers argue that the trend and nationwide growth in trade tax are likely to continue next year, with total tax revenue from sales for both state and local governments to increase to 6.2% compared to the same period in the previous three quarters of 2014.
But Washington may lag behind others, as it is taking its toll on the labor market to reduce state spending.
What you missed: Europe's head will be Tusk, Putin's Novorse and Lafat scissors
Will there be a new state in Ukraine?
Putin Calls for Novorum to Negotiate
Russian President Vladimir Putin mentioned the possibility of creating a new state in southeastern Ukraine, where government troops have been clashing with pro-Russian rebels since April.
He also warned European firms that, following the current regime of anti-Russian sanctions, they would have a difficult return to the Russian market.
The support afforded to the West by the warfare of the Ukrainian army in eastern Ukraine, he argues, contradicts democratic values.
The end of the conflict, he said, depends on Kiev, so he cannot say when the Ukrainian crisis will end.
More sanctions for Russia?
Czech Republic wins right to disagree with part
The European Commission, along with diplomats, is to propose a further tougher in the anti-Russian sanctions within a week, the EU summit decided last night.
The permanent chairman of the meetings of the member countries, Herman Van Rompuy, told reporters.
According to Czech Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka, concrete proposals for the post to move the sanctions form are expected to be prepared as early as Monday.
Tusk will be the new EU's "President."
Van Rompuy to be replaced in December
At the European Union summit, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk was elected to head the European Council, the so-called EU president who directs the summit meetings of the member countries.
From December, he will replace Herman Van Rompuy for two and a half years.
European diplomacy will be succeeded by Italian Foreign Minister Federica Mogherini, to lead European diplomacy.
The Italian woman, who will thus become Vice-President of the future European Commission, has yet to be confirmed by the European Parliament.
Assisted death is a reality in the Czech Republic, it is not mentioned
Help the terminatura and long-term suffering patient with the departure from life?
In Czech conditions, where laws do not allow euthanasia, this is not legally possible.
Yet the comments made by the doctors who approached the LN show that they hear of such requests.
ALS: The Hardest Chapter for Neurology, says doctor about sclerosis
Approximately three hundred people suffer from the Czech Republic in the Czech Republic with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), 21 patients undergo experimental stem cell therapy in Motol, Prague.
We don't know for a hundred percent whether it will be successful.
But if we don't try it, we won't find out," says Radim Mazanec, a Motol neurologist.

ČSSD MP Stanislav Huml is clear about who shot down the Malaysian plane over Ukraine.
According to him, it is clear that "the hilarious sanctions that were announced in view of the downing of a civilian aircraft with nearly 300 dead were deliberately caused by the Ukrainian army."
According to the legislature, it also shows the manuscript of the CIA.
Unfull promises.
Elections are coming up and the parties are once again offering the impossible
The end of the homeless on the streets, parking for each family and a funicular above Prague.
It is repeated before every election: parties promise the impossible.
Also, with local elections looming, politicians are racing to see who the voters will like more.
Lidovky.cz has selected the unfulfilled promises of the present and the past.
70 years ago, the Czechoslovaks landed at Dunkirk.
A fierce siege has begun
It was August 30, 1944, when the Czechoslovak Independent Brigade moved to France.
Its commander, Alois Liška, consistently asked for the addition of technical equipment and dispatch to the front.
The British side eventually complied and listed this ground unit as one of its forces in the siege of the port city of Dunkirk, which remained in the power of the German troops.
SUMMARY: Plzeň leads league in front of Prague's "S", Liberec declassified Baník
Viktoria Plzeň is the new leader of the Football League, which is one point ahead of both Prague's "S".
The changes at the top of the table were caused by the Slavia 1-2 defeat in Mladá Boleslav.
After two defeats, Sparta recovered in the domestic league, beating Jablonec thanks to two Lafat's hits.
Liberec claimed a record win of the year, with Baník Ostrava 6-0.

How to survive the return from vacation?
Take a swipe at a rush and indulge in your sleep
The last days of the holidays are ahead of us.
Get used to getting used to the sunny beach or cottage on a normal work rate can be a nut for a lot.

Joan Rivers' family: 'Fetches Frightened'
Joan Rivers has been unconscious for three days, ever since she was brought to the New York City hospital, but her daughter said today that she was not losing hope of the 83-year-old comedian's recovery.
"Thank you for your greetings and support," Melissa Rivers said in a statement today.
Fingers crossed.
Her mother was brought to Mount Sinai Hospital on Thursday after a call to the emergency services, according to which she was at cardiac arrest on a Yorkilling endoscopy at the Upper East Side, according to the source.
Doctors deliberately keep her under the influence of sedatives and under close scrutiny until they are sure of her condition, which remains "serious."
The responses were not long in coming, including the surreal support on the Internet from personalities like Donald Trump, Montel Williams, and Kelly Ripa.
Reality is a twisted headlines
That the media's headlines distort reality is (unfortunately) no news.
I know that the headlines are "sold" in the paper, but unfortunately I also know that many are so-called "readers" who read nothing else.
And that's a fact that's been bothering me a lot lately, it's more aptly word that's hitting.
This applies in particular to articles on the conflict between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip.
It is common for the headlines "Israel attacked Gaza."
Only in the text will you read that the Israeli "attack" was a response to the fired rockets from the Gaza Strip, often at the time of the truce.
This then appears the headline "Both parties violated the truce."
Does the journalism community realise that in this process it is directly involved in the anti-Semitic attitudes that are growing across Europe (and not only there)?
Less than sixty years have passed since the end of World War II.
So far, there are survivors of the Shoah.
When I saw videos from the Federal Republic of Germany, where the crowd shouted the slogans "Jewish swine" and the like of a misconception, I got chafed.
Does the world want to finish what Hitler failed to do?
Do our journalists realise the fact that the Slavs were appointed to be liquidated by the Jews?
Ladies and gentlemen of the journalists, please pay a little more care to the job.
You are often referred to as the "watchdogs of democracy."
So defend her.
While he's here.
And defend the right of the only truly democratic state in the Middle East to protect your population.
How would you like our government to act if one of our neighbors decides to eliminate the Czech nation and remove the Czech Republic from the map of the world?
Perhaps you should also be aware of one more fact.
Nearly 20% of Arabs with Israeli citizens live in the state of Israel.
And they're comfortable there.
If you ask them, why don't they go between "their," like Gaza, to answer you, why would they do that?
In Israel, they have jobs, social security, and top-notch health care (I've seen with my own eyes how to the top private Hadassa Hospital, which is funded by the sponsorship donations of Jews from all over the world, and are, of course, treated there).
Hamas is also attacking its Arab brothers with their missiles.
The only real aid to Gaza, and thus to this troubled region, is to rid it of Hamas and disarm it.
And not to condemn Israel, albeit indirectly in the headlines.
Inform about the practices of Hamas, about its abuse of people as human shields.
To inform Hamas that Hamas aims to eliminate the state of Israel, at any cost.
Even at the cost of the death of innocent Arab children.
Notify that Hamas is on the list of world terrorist organisations.
Notify that in nine years of self-government in Gaza, the area may have been thriving through humanitarian aid from all over the world.
Even from Israel, which supplies water and electricity there, for which the governors of Gaza do not pay and even fretted that the power supplies are sometimes cut off at this time.
If Hamas had not invested money in the construction of underground tunnels so that suicide attackers could infiltrate the territory of Israel, but perhaps in the construction of apartment buildings, hospitals, and schools, its Arab brothers from Gaza would have lived considerably better.
Amazon buys $1.04 billion for Twitch
AMAZON just confirmed the information's claim on Monday morning: An Internet retailer - a video producer and hundreds of other things - is buying the video streaming service Twitch for $1.04 billion ($970 million).
The announcement came as a surprise, not because no one expected the Twitch to be bought, but because YouTube was expected to be the buyer.
Three months ago, the $1 billion Twitch Twitch sale looked certain, and the connection seemed natural.
Twitch, founded by Justin.tv only three years ago, was on track to become a widely used video streaming service - a live version of YouTube.
Instead, it quickly became a platform for players who broadcast online broadcasts from games to it - in the words of Business Insider "YouTube for live-streamed gaming."
Interferation Twitch.
The "Let's play" videos are already popular on YouTube, a species where the sages (mostly older) give the Mystery Science Theater-workmakers.
The fact is that YouTube comes up a lot when you're describing the Trawitch, so the news that YouTube is buying a Titch didn't excite much, it was a textbook example of how the established company would pay off possible competition.
The mystery is why the deal with YouTube failed, even though the company was willing to pay the same amount as Amazon.
All we currently have at our disposal is the statement by Twitch CEO Emmet Shear: "We chose Amazon because they believe in our company, it has the same values and a long-term vision and wants to help us deliver it faster."
Another mystery is the - honestly - incredible success of Twitch.
For snobs like me, who say they'd rather do sport than watch, it's hard to understand what's so amazing about just watching the game instead of playing.
It's one thing to look over a friend's shoulder at 3:00 in the morning, playing Resident Evil, and it's all the more a whole thing to watch a stranger get 20 hits to the head in Call of Duty.
All the games you could just watch.
Another problem is that a lot of today's, most popular games are from the perspective of the player, so looking at their record without being able to control the perspective yourself is a pretty good recipe for getting a headache.
I admit that the speed run-type games in which the Rogers Bannisters of our electronic time finish the game in record time are entertaining.
But if someone is not a master of playing or humor, their Twitch channel is unlikely to be very interesting.
But what do the skeptics like I know?
Twitch has 55 million visits a month and is fourth at the height of internet traffic.
How exactly will Amazon take advantage of that?
It's hard to imagine Twitch tapping into Amazon Instant Video as elegantly as it could have been swallowed up by YouTube.
But the Twitch has something that every company would like to attract: hordes of young men that advertisers want.
As Twitch's director Shear, both Amazon and Twitch said, "believes in the future of games," the media doesn't seem to be reluctant, or the likes of - the audience.
The second fundamental lie of creationism.
Another Czech translation by American atheist vlogger Aron Ra.
This time on the theme of "Hateful Scriptures are God's Word."
Attaching the original video.
The second basic lie of creationism is the belief that the sacred texts were written by God and not by real human authors.
When believers debate one of the many things that run counter to their religion, they often confront us with the question: Who will you believe?
The alleged word of God or the word of man?
As if human exploration were completely trivial compared to the authority they imagine that their doctrine was.
But when they say "man," they talk about science.
And when they report to the "Sin of God," they report to the myths of a god written by people.
If there really is an intelligent one with a creator with a purpose, then he is the one who created a fossil record that reveals evolutionary history, and it must be he who invented the genetic formulas that match it, and it must be he who supplied other pieces of evidence that show exclusively to the evolutionary conclusion to the last detail.
Why else would all these things exist?
It seems like he's trying to tell us something!
People couldn't create any of those things.
But people can tell stories, fabulously.
And it was the people who wrote all the lyrics that pretend to be the word of God.
Every supposedly holy teachings of any religion in the world describes itself as written by people, not gods.
People who were "habitted" or "inspired" by their favorite gods, or perhaps listened to the dictates of the angels, but those texts were not written by anyone other than mere mortals with a certain degree of imagination, not angels and certainly not gods.
If there really was one real god, he would be an integral part of all the gods of all religions, the über-galactic supergennius, the ultimate entity of the whole cosmos.
If a creature of this size had ever written a book, there would have been only one such book, the only script of the saint.
It would have been known all over the world, without its predecessors, parallels or alternatives in any language, because mere human authors would not be able to compete with such a work.
And people would not have to believe it in sight, because it would be consistent, backed up by verifiable and truthful evidence, and would reveal deep morality and wisdom far beyond all human limits.
It would permanently inspire every reader to be unfriendly of the common faith.
If God wrote it, we wouldn't expect anything less.
But what we see instead is the exact opposite.
Instead of the one religion leading to the final truth, we have many different religions with no conceptual origin, and all of them are constantly disintegrating into more and more separate denominations, seeking questionable truths, and each of them somehow claims dividing the leadership of God, regardless of the continuing dissolution and separation in every direction.
The Jewish Torah, the Christian Gospels, the Islamic Qint-i-Akdás, the Christian Goalag, the Arabasthuhrov's Avests, the Sikh-Adi-Granth, the Mahabharata Bhagavad-Gita, the Book of Mormon, or the book of Urantia are all considered "absolute truth" and the "revected word of the only true god" and the relevant believers of each of them say that the other ones are awning out of the aft, and the other believers say that the other ones are awning outwardly the other ones are awneduberments..
The only logical explanation is probably that everyone is astray to some extent.
None of the aforementioned books have any advantage over the others.
None of them have evidence support, and none can be historically confirmed.
My name is Dr. Paul Maier, and I'm a professor of ancient history at the University of West Michigan.
I'm not saying I've proven that the Bible is reliable and historical.
Of course it's not.
You must still have faith.
All of them require faith, as well as apologies (obhajoby), because they contain inconsistencies, absurdities, and primitive images once considered true that have already been overcome.
So it cannot be said that they are proof of divine wisdom.
Many of them advocate heinous atrocities instead of morality, and many of them are claimed to have been confirmed by the fulfilment of the prophecy - with any of them, too, to contain prophecies that have not been fulfilled.
Leading theologians admit that all sacred texts of any religion have been written by human hands and are therefore the subject of interpretations, impressions and perspectives of their primitive and often prejudices bound by politically motivated authors, thus explaining many of the contradictions and inconsistencies in these books, especially those in the Bible.
I wouldn't call it a contradiction, more like mutual comments.
We must once again point out that we have two different authors here, the work of which has somehow been mixed together during some editor's review.
He is right that Genesis has more than one author and is certainly not the narrative of an eyewitness!
Some experts now distinguish between four different sources for the Pentateuch alone, i.e. the five books of "Meshius" and do not attribute any of them to Moses, because it almost certainly did not exist as described in the Bible.
Experts agree that Genesis was composed (probably by Ezdráš) from several unrelated oral traditions less than 2,500 years ago.
The other documents were filtered at the same time and are all attributed to human authors.
The Bible is by no means as old as her believer thinks.
The Dead Sea Scrolls are the oldest archaeological findings of texts known for their unfinished foundation of all Western monotheistic beliefs, and yet are many centuries younger than the roots of zooroastrianism, Buddhism, Hinduism, Hindunism, Druid cults, or Egyptian cults.
Christianity began as a Gnostic faith, followed by docels and ebionites and their completely different insights into Jesus, which were eventually combined in a kind of compromise called orthodoxy.
Other Christian groups as luciferians have been dispersed and discredited by further revisions of the Bible.
One of these edits refers to the King of Ugarit, who ruled 3,500 years ago.
Because his followers posed a major threat to the young mosque religion, the authors of the New Testament decided to ridicule and Ba'al Zebula, "the Lord on the Mountain" changed to Beelzebub "Lord of Flies."
So the Bible was deliberately and fraudulently altered for both religious and political reasons.
The remainder of what happened to the New Testament was canonized in the 4th century A.D. in a series of commissions decisions at the Nikai Assembly.
The four Gospels were taken, and sixteen others were rejected by the simple handshake, as if the fact of the matter could be accepted or rejected by a vote.
The way the canon evolved depended on what was read on Sundays in the Christian centers of the time.
What was read on the second Sunday after the Easter in the Jerusalem Church?
What about the Roman Church at the same time?
And gradually they discovered that they were approaching the same Gospel stories.
And so the core of the canon evolved from the primary church.
So the council simply accepted as the gospel any relevant stories that circulated among the uneducated masses in that time.
But they also consciously took more than ten books from the Bible, even though they were reported by books that were approved.
Among the rejected items, we find writings of both the apostles and the prophets.
Why should the word of God refer to us to books that are just the words of some people and/or are no longer available?
Who was the real editor here?
The Bible often mentions human authors.
But how could it be approved in this way if God was the true author of this random slob of legends, parables and psalm lyrics?
The Bible was certainly written by the people and certainly not by the enlightening, rather the opposite!
This is the reason why so much of its content is historically and scientifically quite wrong, whatever it is from start to finish.
We are talking about people who believed that snakes and donkeys could speak, believing in spells, bloody sacrifices, ritual spells, enchanted objects, fiery potions, astrology, and five elements of magic.
They thought that if they used a magic rod to spray someone with blood, it would cure them of leprosy.
We're talking about people who thought rabbits were ruminants and bats were birds and whales were fish and they know it was an integer.
These people believed that if they showed pregnant cow striped designs, they would give birth to striped calves.
How could someone who knows anything about genetics say that?
The authors of this book, of course, did not know.
If the Bible had been written by a higher being, then it would not contain the mistakes it contains.
If it came from the pen of a truly superior being and was intended as a literal history, then it would not contain anything at all that it contains.
As a moral guide, it totally fails because, most of the original Hebrew writings were written by uneducated and bigoted savages who overlooked or promoted cruelty to animals, incest, slavery, the abuse of slaves, the abuse of family members, the abuse of children, violence against children, abortion, looting, murder, cannibalism, genocide and prejudice against the race, the nation, religion, gender and sexual orientation.
To defend their inhumanity by claiming that they do God's will.
But the creationists are still ignoring all this.
Some of their website admit that if any fact is contrary to the Bible, then the reality must be ignored!
And why?
Because if the creationists didn't have their beloved books, they wouldn't have God.
In their world, one and the other is the same.
Ironically, they reject God's "work" as "worship of creation instead of the creator."
But they themselves see the word man as the word of God and God himself, and even insist that the rebuttalion of their supposedly "holy" books somehow uprooting God as such.
Not their version of the god but all the versions of God.
Creationist Christians think that if the Bible is wrong, then God is lying.
They cannot accept that God might exist, and the Bible could be wrong at the same time, because they cannot separate the doctrine from the deity.
So it's a kind of idolatry where believers worship man-made compilations, as if these books were a god himself, because they think they're the word in HIS.
But God never wrote or dictated any of the writings of any religion.
Everything people approved or rejected into their supposedly "unwessword" of any god was invented, assembled, grouped, translated, interpreted, edited, edited and often also intentionally altered and twisted by mere erring people.

Participant of the bucket challenge dislocated her jaw
As she poured icy water on her head, Isabelle Roberts from the UK shouted so hard she had damaged the facial bone structure.
This bucket challenge didn't work.
The woman was hospitalized after she screamed at the bucket call by dislocating her jaw.
As she poured iced water on her head, Isabelle Roberts shouted so intensely that she damaged the bone structure in her face.
"The water was so cold I had to scream, but my jaw started to stiffen," she told The Mirror.

Attacker stabbed nine people at Chinese school, three of whom died
A man named Chen, according to the New China news agency, forced his way into the primary school building in the morning and attacked around 10:30 p.m. local time.
Three of the nine people he stabbed later died in hospital.
Chen eventually killed himself by jumping from a height, New China said, referring to the regional government.
In recent years, China has seen a series of similar attacks in schools and against children.
The public is therefore calling for more security measures and better protection for children in a country where many married couples have only one child in accordance with the government's policy.
Zeman showed first-time students in Lány how he had to sit at school
The smallest schoolchildren were taken by ninth graders to their classroom, where he and the teacher waited for the president to come.
He then demonstrated to the children how he had to sit alone in the school.
"We had to sit with our hands behind our backs, fortunately that is no longer for you, you are already free people," Zeman told the children.
His wife then presented the first-graders with a conundrum as a gift.

Education Minister Marcel Chládek started the new school year at a private sports school in Litvínov.
"This year I want to connect Czech education with Czech sport more," he said, explaining one of the reasons why he went to the north of Bohemia for the first day of school.
He was approached by the school's management some time ago at a hockey match in Litvínov.
"They were the first, so I accepted the invitation to attend the start of the school year," the minister added.
Education Minister Marcel Chládek (ČSSD) started the school year at a private sports school in Litvínov.
The first classes were joined by 115,000 first-graders this year.
Over 850,000 children will attend primary schools in total and over 405,000 students will be educated in secondary schools, the Ministry of Education estimates.
Nova's new artte director of news is David Fiala
The new arts director of Nova's news and journalism of Nova's news has become David Fiala since 1 September.

Apple iCloud reportedly succumbs to hackers, with nude images of celebrities released to the public
Screen sheet with leaked file listing
So far, an anonymous user is posting nude and pornographic images of American celebrities on 4chan, the US website Mashable.com pointed out.
They were allegedly obtained by unauthorized access to user accounts on Apple's servers, where disabled users uploaded them by automatically backing them uploading images from iPhones and iPads.
Apple has yet to comment on the issue.
Some of the celebrities dismiss the pictures as falsified, but several of the images' affected have already acknowledged the authenticity of the images.
They include actress Jennifer Lawrence, a friend of herald's role in the Hunger Games film series, and Mary Elizabeth Winstead, who starred in the 'Maintain's 4-0 Die Grade.
The hacker's goal is to use the images and videos obtained to enrich themselves.
The footage reportedly showed interest from the American magazine, but according to reports on 4chan, the hacker wants money from the community instead.
According to The Next Web, this is very likely a weakness in the security of iCloud.
In fact, a tool appeared on the GitHub server two days ago that allowed passwords to be obtained to user accounts through brute force, i.e. by automatically repeating attempts to log in with different passwords.
This tool was demonstrably working, but Apple closed the security hole after two days.
What is certain, however, is that potential attackers had plenty of time to gain access to the various accounts before the launch of the instrument.
As a precaution, iCloud users should thus change their password associated with the Apple ID.
The length of the password, not its complexity, is important.
Suitable is the length of at least 12 characters.
The leak of nude images of celebrities is considered a reminder of the safe use of online services.
Although the servers of companies like Apple, Google or Microsoft are secure many times better than computers in homes or smaller firms, upload of sensitive photos in an unprotected form is an unnecessary risk.
If you want to back upstream explicit photos or any other sensitive content online, first encrypt the files before upload.
It is also sensible to set up automatic backup of photos from the phone so that it takes place only on wi-fi and when connected to the charger.
This way, you'll be able to move the sensitive images "to safety" in time, and most importantly, you'll have the space to delete the missed images, so they won't take up space in the online repository.
Instructions for how to encrypt files and communications on the internet are offered to readers of HN and IHNED.cz in the form of an electronic book by Michal Altaira Valášek in the PDF format.
A smart way to save on a college script
With the price of college scripts for many students exceeding $1,000 a year, the upcoming sophomorest came up with a smart way to cut costs.
He devised a system of renting books from senior classmates with a menu of nominal compensation to delay their divestment back.
"I got a book for the calculations, which normally costs $180 for a semester, for ten and for chicken nuggets," says Schroeder, 19, who is a student at the Covenant College in Georgia.
The books required in his last semester would cost $430, he says.
Spent 120.
According to the university council, the average student spends more than $1,200 a year on textbooks and aids, but students have different ways to manage these expenses.
The preferred choice of students is becoming online shops and creative solutions like Schroeder's.
Textbook lending is on the rise, allowing students to use the book for a semester, often at a significant discount rather than buying it.
Neebo Inc, which operates more than 250 bookstores in campus venues, says that book lending has doubled since 2011.
The review in the sector shows that about a quarter of the books in university bookstores were borrowed in the last spring semester, says Vice President Neebo Trevor Meyer.
Less than half of the teaching texts are bought at university bookstores, according to the National Association of University Businesses.
Here's the top 101 ways to succeed.
Shopping online
Prices for some new books may be up to a third lower online than in the university bookstore.
The recommended award for the ninth edition of Rona Larson's "Calculus," and Bruce Edwards, and Robert Hostetler is nearly $290, but it can be purchased for $239.99 on the Internet at Chegg.com, in retail, specialized in textbooks, for $2399.99.
Buy used
If you don't mind other people's comments or wear and tear and vandalism, the appropriate option is the curriculum art text.
On Chegg.com, "Calculus" sells for $93.49.
Matt Casaday, 25, a senior at Brigham Young University, says he paid 42 cents on Amazon.com for a used copy of "Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business" .
The new one sold for $48.
University teacher Ingrid Bracey, head of the University of Massachusetts Amherst's College Without Walls, suggests students at their teachers to check whether the older editions are acceptable.
Sometimes the changes for working in semen aren't relevant.
If so, older releases can be sold for a fraction of the price of the last version.
In addition to Chegg and Amazon, eBay Inc's Half.com is a popular alternative for buying used books.
Borrowing
It is also worth considering lending textbooks, if you treat them well, remember to return them, and you don't need to have them even after the seminar.
You can save up to 80% of the cost of a new book.
For example, the student could borrow "Calculus" for about $20 for the entire semester.
Meet the terms and conditions of the store in which you borrow the book, including the penalty for notes, highlights or wear and damage.
Keep in mind: If you don't return the book in time, the fine may be higher than the price of a new book.
E-books
Another option is to get an e-book instead of a normal book.
Sometimes these books are essentially lent in the form of an electronic licence valid for a certain period of time from distributors such as Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc.
Chegg lends "Calculus" for six months for approximately $61.
According to Bracey, the most advantageous offers can be found by literary students, as many classics are now available for free downloads, while science and technical texts can be very expensive.
In any case, go to the shops.
Joe Gault, 29, who will soon be joining the Pepperdine Law School, recommends following the ISBN because it guarantees that you are buying the right book.
Before you order the book online, make sure it's really in stock, advises Gault.
He made sure of it firsthand.
The book he bought was sold out for four weeks, and had to pay the full price for a book from the university book.
Mud, all mud.
And then they found a torso of a rifle in the well from the end of the war
The well is a short walk from St. George.
We uncovered the foliage around and began to pull out an aged trek - about a meter and a half of mud and rotten leaves.
As we approached the clay day, we came across the barrel," said Radomil Novák.
We pulled it out, cleaned it, and found it to be the torso of an assault German rifle used by SS troops.
The discovery is reportedly unusual.
According to my information, such rifles were made only towards the end of the war.
And there were about three hundred thousand of them," Novák added.
All the wooden construction items have been laid out over time, so it is unusable.
Her body, however, is preserved - it holds its shape.
How did it come to be in the well?
There is an explanation.
Maybe it was thrown in by people who needed to get rid of the weapon used by the SS, probably for fear of being moved.
Fascists on the run probably wouldn't do that.
They were dropping their weapons in the woods," the finder thinks.
The rifle was the only thing the enthusiasts from the Rainbow of the Jeseníky Movement found in the well.
"There could have been hand grenades, there were a lot of them around here once, so we slowed the excavation work, we felt the mud carefully to avoid any misfortune, but there was nothing else down there," Novák said.
The discovery will end in the museum's depository at the castle in the nearby Silesian Rudoltice.
Ukrainian general: I have not liberated the captive Czech yet
Aktuálně.cz's exclusive interview with General Colonel Volodymyr Ruban, which liberates Ukrainian soldiers from the captivity of pro-Russian separatists.
Kiev/Prague - "Excuse me, I have to take it... I am being called from Donetsk," excused the Ukrainian-descolator General Volodymyr Ruban, otherwise the director of the Centre for the Liberation of War prisoners there, apologized, for an exclusive interview with Aktuálně.cz.
Colonel Volodymyr Ruban in a televised debate.
In each such interruption, it was impossible to hear people's names, their numbers, or where they were - or should be - that Ruban specifies with his counterpart at the other end of the phone.
"That'll be it - go there," he concluded one of the lightning discussions with Donetsk, and turned to ours again.
Volodymyr Ruban is a reserve general, a former fighter pilot and an active participant in the Maoan anti-government protests.
Only yesterday - when we were arranging an interview - he was in Donetsk.
The liberation of Ukrainian soldiers from the captivity of the pro-Russian separatists is devoted to twenty-four hours a day.
Aktuálně.cz: You may know that the Czechs are also fighting on the side of the pro-Russian separatists.
Our counterintelligence estimates their number up to 30.
There could be many more, of course.
Have you met a Czech prisoner in your negotiations?
Volodymyr Ruban: I have liberated the already captured Serbs, the Dagestani, the Chechew, the Swede, the Georgian... but not yet a Czech.
But I know who to turn to in Prague if we come across your captured countryman and can rescue him.
Ukrainian soldier captured by separatists
What do you advise the Czechs who join the pro-Russian separatists and the Ukrainian soldiers will capture them?
They should understand that if, as Czechs, they are fighting in the Ukrainian banners of volunteers and the separatists capture them, they will be shot without mercy after being questioned, as will any other foreigner.
Separatists consider these men to be rented mercenaries, who deserve nothing but death.
But if, for example, Ukrainian soldiers capture a group of Donetsk separatists - and a Czech among them, for one, they put him behind bars and treat him like a prisoner of war.
The guy just survives.
The Ukrainian side also behaves like a state in the war.
A.cz: And how many of the Ukrainian prisoners have you managed to rescue?
As I understand it, it's in exchange.
Some sources say it has long exceeded a hundred men.
We've long since stopped counting how many people we've helped.
But we just freed them... they couldn't save them from the war if they decided to continue the fighting.
The rescuers are doctors in the war, the surgeons, but we certainly aren't.
That's it.
And every day, more and more are added.
We save someone every day.
Sometimes one, sometimes a quartet or a five.
And it doesn't always have to be an exchange.
Sometimes, even a human plea is enough to release the prisoners.
A.cz: It is rumoured that in a few months you have gained great authority and even trust with the pro-Russian separatists... as well as in Ukrainian society.
How did you manage to build the respect of the two warring parties?
Tough question.
One of the officers in Kiev gave me the nickname "a madman general with steel balls."
It's not offended by me.
And perhaps that captures the essence of our work.
As head of the Ukrainian Officers Corps, I had gained some of that authority before.
I never catch, cheat, and always keep my word.
No matter what, I act honestly and tell the truth.
Even when it is the Ukrainian government, or the Donetsk or Luhansk very unpleasant one.
If they torture and kill people?
So I simply tell them that they are tortured and killed.
And that they're crimes.
I often risk my life in the process, I was even captured in the exchange of prisoners... this job can be the end for me at any time... I don't have to come back.
A.cz: How many executions and torture of prisoners do you know about?
... (long pity)... to torture the prisoners, Ukrainians and separatists are resorted to torture of prisoners.
Unfortunately.
And executions?
These only take place on the Donetsk side.
I do not have information that the Ukrainian army is also executing prisoners.
Nor hints about the Ukrainian military committing such a thing.
We have an idea of the number of executions, but I can't and I don't want to give the numbers.
A.cz: Describe to me the characters and motives of pro-Russian separatists.
Among them are officers, but also veterans from Afghanistan.
They are trying to make autonomy, and perhaps democracy in Donetsk or Luhansk - that's what they say.
They don't want to play games with Ukrainian oligarchs any more.
The separatists are fed up with the oligarchs and are their impassimable opponents - to the death.
As we say - they've gone over to their throats.
The same dreams and aspirations were made by the way of the people in Maidan.
And now I'm filling in a bit: Russia is supporting the separatists, and the West, on the other hand, the Ukrainian state.
I consider one speculation to be great, and the other one, on the other hand, to be small.
But this line of mine already holds an impregnitable contradiction.
A.cz: For example, how does one of the toughest leaders of pro-Russian separatists, Igor Bezler, appear to you?
Every time I cross the line of the war front, I am unarmed and show soldiers or militants their bare hands outstretched.
And I've always got both sides of the two or three hundred meters in the sights or in the optical sights.
The faces of the people who point to me, I can see well every time... and they can pull the trigger of their weapons at any time.
A paratrooper, an experienced colonel with both German and Ukrainian ancestry.
He is considered a Russian officer, but his family - his mother - lives in Ukraine.
He believes that Ukraine should not exist.
And if so, just as a small governorate in the big Russian empire.
In any case, he talks about it all the time, and sees Ukraine as a kind of misunderstanding.
Such a state should not even exist.
At the same time, he is an impassable enemy of all Ukrainian oligarchs.
A.cz: Speaking of characters - in a discussion show on Ukrainian television, you called your Prime Minister, Arseniy Yatsenyuk, a weak, clueless and tired "leader" who would do best if he left quickly.
In those three hundred yards of walking, I get scared at least five times.
So why should I be hiding the view that Yatsenyuk is a very weak prime minister and that he is hurting our country?
A.cz: Do you think he has a part in the war in Ukraine?
You may know that the Ukrainians of Yatsenyuk are nicknamed "the breeder."
And the rabbit is not, in the eyes of Ukrainians, an animal that would be afraid of or would have respect and authority for others.
His behavior directly follows the behavior of the rabbit.
He may be a good economist, but as a prime minister, he has no right to cry in parliament in the war, to beg him, to play his intrigue with him, to threaten to lay down the post ... he must run the country, administer it and protect it during the time of the war.
At the threat to the country, the prime minister is not entitled to family, his friends, rest on tearful emotions.
He is the first of the ministers of Ukraine.
And Yatsenyuk?
He acts like a teenage girl.
Yes, he is tired, but also weak, because he was never strong... he does not fight for Ukraine, he just complains about everything all the time.
He should therefore leave.
The sooner, the better for Ukraine.
Why the Guardians of the Galaxy couldn't save the sales
Sylvester Stallone's portrait 3 was refunded from a $90 million budget in the US by less than $30 million, and by Sin City: A woman for whom I would murder return only $12 million from the $70 million budget.
The film Sex Tape with Cameron Diaz grossed only $14.6 million on its first weekend, as well as films for children such as How to Train the Dragon 2 were a disappointment to theaters.
According to an article by film critic Robbie Collin in the Telegraph, the quality of children's films is to blame for the very quality.
Collin called 2014 the "worst" year of children's films, and called How to Train Your Dragon 2 a mere "functional" sequel.
When it comes to films put on a slightly older target audience, it seems that the problem is not necessarily in the quality of the films themselves.
In July, Entertainment Weekly compared CinemaScore and Metacritic servers and their average rating of summer film premieres aired in at least 2,000 cinemas between the Victims of the War and the 20s. July in 2013 and this year.
The results, which take into account the view of both viewers and film critics, suggest that this year's film crop is of similar quality to last year's hits.
According to some commentators, a change in viewers' approach and the higher popularity of internet sites like Netflix may be to blame.
Director Jon Favreau, who is currently working on Disney's treatment of the Jungle Book, told the Hollywood Reporter website, "I think times are changing."
We have to admit it and not try to chase at what was already.
Unlike the current crisis in Hollywood's box office, Netflix's profit has reached $1.2 billion thanks to internet services, almost twice as much as last year's $837 million.
Last summer, director Steven Spielberg criticized the studio for relying on comic book rights too much, and predicted the "giblings" of Hollywood.
In light of the current slump, some commentators claim that there may be something to his catastrophic prophecy.
With the launch of possible major box-cash-couples in the summer of 2015, including Avengers: Age of Ultron, Mimoů and Jurassic Worlds, other numbers are more optimistic in the film industry.
X-Men producer Simon Kinberg recently described the drop in sales as simply "cyclical." Speaking to the Hollywood, the Reporter said, "Next summer will be the summer of the biggest box-office hitters in history, and no one will worry about selling."
DPRK threatens Seoul again, launches another short-range missile
North Korea has launched another short-range missile into the sea, Seoul announced.
The missile's alleged test was carried out shortly after the completion of the joint military maneuvers of the United States and South Korea, which Pyongyang perceives as a preparation for the invasion.
The province of Chagang lies in the northwest KDLR at the border with China.
A spokesman for the South Korean Defense Ministry told DPA that the missiles were launched from a place in the northwest of the DPRK and reached a distance of about 200 kilometers.
As a result, North Korea apparently launched a missile from the province of Zhagang for the first time, South Korean media reported, citing military circles.
The province is said to be home to an underground launch pad for Scud-type rockets.
This is another in a series of similar tests carried out by the isolated North Korean regime in recent weeks.
North Korea has conducted an unusually large number of missile and artillery tests this year.
NATO summit: First Protests in Newport and Cardiff
Over the weekend, protests were made by protests from opponents of the NATO summit in Newport.
On Saturday, hundreds of people gathered in central Newport to take part in a march against NATO.
And on Sunday, about 150 people came to the town hall in Cardiff for a meeting that was described as a counter-summit.
Stephen Fairclough watched the situation over the weekend and spoke to the protesters who had come from Bridgend to Belgium.
Teenagers had to be airlifted from the Blue Mountains
TWO teenage tourists were picked up by plane and taken to safety after spending the night in the Blue Mountains in New South Wales.
A 16-year-old girl and an 18-year-old man went on a hike to the Govetts Leap in Blackheath after noon on Sunday.
When they didn't return home, the anxious relatives called the police around 8 p.m.
A search crew, including the local police and a rescue team, were dispatched, and the couple were found near Bridal Veil Falls at around 11 p.m.
The girl injured her knee and the man fell, hitting his head in the process.
The police stayed with them overnight and were picked up on Monday morning.
In a stable condition, they were taken to the Blue Mountains Hospital by ambulance.
Olomouc brought only a point from Opava, the win was on Vasicek's leg
The 23-year-old forward could have made the decision, but failed in the two best chances.
The goal was called mainly by a shot from close range three minutes before the end, but instead of in the net, it ended up on the goalkeeper of the Opava goalkeeper Josef Květoňovi.
I had it on my leg, I have to give those chances.
I'm mad at myself," Vasicek said, pouring ashes on his head.
"I guess I should have put it higher under the lid, it got a little bit of a slip," he mused.
Sigma's defense didn't allow much of Opava, with the exception of Mikul's 11th-minute drive, which was covered by the goalkeeper Reichl.
Then they started pushing the Hanáci, but they were not allowed to the chances in the block defending the home side and the shots from a distance were caught by Květoň.
We were comparing ourselves for 15 minutes, then took the initiative.
We were better in the second half, we had more from the game and Opava only threatened us from the standard situations.
But the outright chance was not converted by Vasicek, and it ended 0-0," said the coach of the Hanák team, Leoš Kalvoda.
Opava also took the point because of absences from the line-up, where in addition to the pair of injured, Petr Vavřík and the three-goal scorer Petr Ševčík, who are playing for Sigma in Silesia, were missing.
Unlike her earlier policies, this did not allow them to step in.
Substitutes deserve discharge.
Sigma was more football-wise, but except for one standard we didn't let her do anything," said the Silesian coach, Petr Baránek.
There was a lot of emphasis, aggression and vigour.
The draw is probably well deserved, the point is a decent gain for us," he added.
Sigma drew four points, which means 13th place.
Nothing that could satisfy the club's chief executive, Josef Lébro, who, after his defeat to Znojmo, made his million-dollar contribution to the coffers conditional on divametrically divorring performances in other matches.
"We were aware of Mr. Lébro's warning, so there can be no question of the boys not wanting to fight," Kalvoda noted, adding to the sleeping shooter Vasicek: "I believe it will come and when he scores, he will start to drop it.
But after the first hit, I'll replace him right away to save goals for the next games," Kalvoda laughed.
Al Pacino has twice thrilled Venice.
Film Festival is experiencing a crisis in other practice
After tremendous enthusiasm for the opening film, Birdman, whose director Alejandro González Iňárritu suddenly became a serious Golden Lion candidate, the next few days suggested the impression that interest in the 71st Venice Festival had subsided somewhat.
Whether because the number of seats in the largest room has risen to fourteen hundred, or because Birdman was followed by critics recognized, but less appealing to the audience, as a documentary about the genocide in Indonesia of the 1960s, A Scout of Silence and Other Social-Themed films from American 99 homes to Iran's Stories, in cinemas, in cinemas, simply remained empty seats.
Heroes of comic books
Even the red carpet in front of the festival palace has not yet been surrounded by crowds as in the past, and it has reportedly stopped finding the problem to get a last-minute hotel seat.
The crisis is talked about in Italy more than elsewhere, and it is no wonder that it has suffered even esteemed institutions as the Biennale and the world's oldest film festival.
Fortunately, the crisis does not manifest itself in a lack of personalities, but those present exclusively in connection with the films.
While younger fans yearned for autographs by comic book superheroes Michael Shannon and Andrew Garfield, who had been quite successful in dramatic roles in 99 homes, the main event for all generations was a visit by legendary actor Ala Pacino.
He also starred in two films.
In the story of a foreground performed out-of-competition by Oscar-winning Barry Levison, the 74-year-old Pacino has a role to play close to him: an actor at the height of his fame who suffers from depression from the end of his career and his personal life.
But seeing him the very next day as the eccentric owner of a Shire of a Shredder in the film Manglehorn, directed by David Gordon Green, was a truly unforgettable experience.
The Volpi Cup for Best Actor should not miss it - but does the Pacinova-shape-former still need awards?
Perhaps the greatest satisfaction for him is the love of the audience, and the Italian especially, for although he was born in New York, Al Pacino is proud to be the country from which his grandparents come.
Points for Italy
Indeed, it is the Italian film that is doing very well in Venice this year.
The black souls, directed by Francesco Munzi, became the first film with a rewarded long standing ovation after Birdman.
The Calabrian offshoot of the mafia is viewed by the view of the family's relationships between the clans, which struggle for each other's power and money, and the director has been able to reconcile all the prerequisites for a good film: a quality screenplay, a camera, music, and an actor.
He was also intrigued by the chamber psychothriller Hladová's Hearts, who filmed Saverio Costanzo with Alba Rohrwar in the role of a woman who nearly kills her own child with her misguided anxiety.
In contrast, French competition films did not receive a warm reception either the Rate for Fame or 3 Hearts, both of the works clinging to the traditional model of consumerist films that rely on the popularity of the performers.
But, after all, two really excellent films, that is, Birdman and the Black Souls, are not so few at the first half of the festival.
And while the festival films have mostly depressing themes, Peter Bogdanovich's new film, She's Funny That Way, a funny comedy out of competition in Venice and shot in the style of American bookels in the 1940s, was able to raise the mood for more than a day.
Police officers catch four meth manufacturers in Prague, brought drugs from Poland
"Detectives have detained three men in the past few days, aged 42, 42 and 37, and a 25-year-old woman who produced and sold the drug of meth in Prague 9 from last November until this August," police spokesperson Jana Rösslerová said.
First, on Tuesday, August 12, a SWAT team in Cihlářské Street caught the 42-number 42-year-old organizer and a dealer in one person and a young woman who was in the group as a drug buyer in Poland and a delivery saleswoman.
The following day, detectives detained another member of the group on the basis of the prior approval of the prosecutor, the 37-year-old.
The last of the four officers were captured in the early hours of Wednesday morning on August 20 in the area of the picturesque incinerator," the spokesperson described.
For transporting drugs from Poland, the woman received a third of the drug
The main organizer had a wide field of effect.
In the workshop of the air-raid area, in the garden house in Horoměřice, in the apartment in Koněvova street and other places in Prague 9, he produced meth, procured various aids and chemicals needed to make it and provided the transfer of pseudoephedrine drugs from the Republic of Poland.
He weighed the manufactured drug, divided into plastic bags and subsequently sold meth.
With the transfer of medicines from Poland or the sale of addicts, he was helped out by a 25-year-old, hitherto unpunished woman.
For this, she received a reward from the organizer in the form of a third of the drug produced," Rösslerová added.
Criminals also carried out several house searches on the judge's orders, where they secured the drug, industrial chemicals, digital scales, pay bags, syringes, tubes and other aids and items that, according to the experts, can be considered as a complete make-up methamphetamine.
The dealer has been convicted seven times since 1995
"From the available records, officers discovered that the main organizer had been convicted of property crimes in total seven times since 1995, the woman was not being convicted," the police spokesperson said.
The last detainee was in 2006 suspended for the offence of sexual abuse, and the 37-year-old mechanic who is on the loose who has been prosecuted nine times for legal abuse.
For him, too, it was mostly for property crimes.
The investigator charged three men and a woman with committing the crime of illegal production and other handling of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances and poisons, punishable by up to 10 years in prison.
For three persons, the investigator eventually filed a motion to the prosecutor to take custody, where the judge eventually placed them," the spokesperson said.
The fourth accused, a 37-year-old repeat offender, ended up at large.
His position and role in this case were not as essential as those of the other accused.
The police continue to work with this man.

The disturbance of grammar schools and secondary schools makes no sense.
The Czech Republic has few generally educated people, and statistics show that grammar schools have a good application.
The start of the school year is here.
There have been major preparations in the schools in the last fortnight.
Most are routine matters, like transferring pots from the summer repository back to the classes and get chalk.
In the grammar school in the grammar school, they'll be a little bit more busy.
A few days before the start of the season, they are looking for furniture, computers and other technical equipment, as well as library literature.
There was no robbery or embezzlement, the four-year grammar school in Hořice is opening and restoring its activities after three years.
Not on a public one, but on a private platform.
The lack of material equipment is not due to the founding founders being so incompetent.
They had to wait to see if the existence of the school would be confirmed by the enrollment in the school register administered by the Ministry of Education.
"French socialists should shut up and fix France," says Francois Hollande's key ally
Valls calls on the highly fragmented left to "show its support" for the belligerently attuned socialist president, whose new distribution of the posts was not met with the approval of the majority of the French.
The president deserves universal respect, he deserves loyalty, he deserves our support.
"Our duty is to stay by his side," he said, drawing applause.
As a conciliatory gesture, the Prime Minister insisted that his government would not question the controversial French 30-hour working week, despite the heated conjecture of conversation by Emmanuel Macron, the new Chancellor of the Exchequer, who proposed to relax the rules at the beginning of the week.
On Saturday, Hollande asked the Socialists to remain "cooperative" with the government.
But Christiane Taubirová, the Minister of Justice, drew a line under his budget when she appeared at a meeting of rebellious Socialist MPs, where she criticized the Socialist Party for "the Francouzi lose faith in the future."
Marine Le Pen, the leader of the extremely conservative right, laughed at the constant internal disputes among the Socialists when she said she did not expect the new Valls government to last more than a few months.
Emperor Francois Hollande is naked and Prince Manuel Valls is also. They were forced to form a new government when the previous one did not last until the end of the summer.
"And the new one won't last until the end of autumn or winter," Le Pen told her supporters.
It reiterated its party's call for the dissolution of Parliament, saying that it believed that the party could win an early election and that it was ready to run the country.
The French ruling party suffered a defeat in the municipal elections in March, and in May the extremely conservative right succeeded in the European Parliament elections.
According to a poll by the Journal du Dimanche, 76 percent of French people think that the Socialist Party is at risk of being divided into several rival factions before the end of Hollande's term of office in 2017.
Pascal Perrineau, a political scientist at Sciences Po University, warned that the French would soon run out of patience if the new socialist government failed to improve the economy and reduce record unemployment.
"It's a limited space for opportunity, but public opinion must think there are changes in the situation," he warned.
Otherwise, the situation could get worse.
Hazard and street art will no longer restrict Prague to the polls
Amendments to the relevant decrees should be prepared and approved by the new leadership of the capital.
Other gambling establishments will not disappear from the streets of Prague before the local elections and the city will not restrict street art.
Nor will the dog walk be restricted.
Prague will not be able to prepare and approve changes to the relevant decrees in the council by the October elections.
"Moreover, the decision on the changes should not be made by the current city leadership, which is ending its mandate in a few weeks," said Councillor Lukáš Manhart (TOP 09).
The cessation of gambling on its territory has been decided in the past weeks by several town halls, such as Prague 5 and 7.
But the gambling hall will not disappear, the gambling decree will not be changed yet.
It is the task of the new leadership of the city after the elections.
We would not technically do so now, given the deadlines for submitting comments and the like," Manhart explained.
He added that the last meeting of the current council, which must approve the amendment to the decree, would take place on 11 September.
A referendum on a blanket ban on gambling is planned on the local elections of the Prague 1 and Prague 8 districts.
There is currently a ban on gambling in, for example, Prague 2 or Prague 12.
The decree will not be changed for the same reasons in the case of street art, so-called busking.
This is particularly complained about by Prague 1, which has already sent the Municipality a proposal for places to expand the current list of prohibited places.
Musicians are also not wanted by Prague 5 in the vicinity of Anděl.
The decree regulating the dog-walking city is planning for several months, not yet completed.
The placement of gaming rooms and the issue of busking are dealt with by the city ordinances.
They can be issued or modified only by the city council.
Councils have only a consultative vote, they are not allowed to issue ordinances themselves.
Last week he placed victory at his fingertips of Scottish independence at his fingertips' reach
The Scottish Independence campaign was in danger of making this mistake a third time when it almost put the question of whether the Scots wanted to be rich.
But you don't get to the hearts of the Scottish electorate by appealing to their wallet, nor do you get their respect when you start threatening them.
The Morality of the New Testament is still alive in Scotland, although few Scots still go to church today.
Scots have a much more inclination to banner money-grandchildren from the temple than to have them dictated to vote.
The head of the Scottish Nationalists, Alex Salmond, knows this well, which is why he repeatedly asked his opponent, the Unionan-based Darling, in a televised discussion as to whether he was willing to respect the "sovereign will of the Scottish people" if Scottish voters would vote for independence, and to start supporting the single currency for both Scotland and England.
This forced Darling to choose between Scottish civil society and London financiers, and he fell into this trap with a grimace.
Of course, Darling will not support the mandate of the Scottish electorate.
But the discussion about Scotland's currency would have been more or less neutralised.
What really motivates Scottish voters is fairness, job opportunities and defending the state health service that citizens have for free.
Darling supported London bankers in the currency and also gave the impression that he would not protest against the privatisation of the health service.
By the way Salmond put it, "get into bed with the Conservatives."
This is a very dangerous position for every Scottish politician.
Every Scottish voter knows that Scottish businessmen are in bed with the Conservatives.
This was confirmed by David Cameron, who spoke not to voters in Scotland but to the association of "bosses" to the Confederation of British Industry.
It is becoming clear that Cameron's refusal to debate independence with the Scottish Prime Minister, Salmond, was a serious mistake for the Unionist campaign.
Cameron thus looks like a cowardly absentee domestic.
The Scots would respect him if he came to the debate with the Scottish Prime Minister.
At least Cameron could say that Scotland could be a "successful independent country."
Alistair Darling can't say that, it's almost a physical pain.
What he says is clear: Scots are not supposed to jump out and must accept what is.
The longest year is 10 months.
The Pessimistic Early Start of the School by Miloš Urban
Illustration for the story The Longest Year
Miloš Urban The longest year
The end was the best of the holidays, the last week that wasn't going anywhere and just lounging around and wallowing in with the Indian summer, the silence before the storm, the peace of mind before the stress.
New clothes when you could get from Tuzex, boots from East Germany.
Reading the Fast Arrows, for the fiftieth time, whirring on a bicycle up the mountain by the Imperial to the back of the Vars, somewhere near the tennis courts, no longer hot, the sun stroking its back and shoulders, tapping the farewell rays.
In the evening, a mild nervousness, still a holiday regime, to sleep until half-past ten, a week in a week it would be worse, the moment before falling asleep would stretch from a few minutes to two hours, then to get up at six-thirty in the morning.
Coming in, Monday.
It doesn't usually rain, on the contrary, summer sneers viciously sneer in front of the school.
To be glided in the ghostly light on the page and feel like a plastic figure in a glass paperweight, there's the school, the Elementary A.
Zápotocký with monstrous pink plaster, and in front of her old familiar faces as well as a few new ones, boys more oozing, girls more boorish.
There are thugs over there, to avoid them, it's still interesting how infamous they keep together and how early they are here.
And these mature-looking girls who came in forbidding are laughing hysterically at something now, I guess something has changed in their lives over the holidays, while everything is the same for me.
And the new first-graders, some of the nervous and the others excited, why are they coming in at all?
Because they have to, the educational military obligatory.
So inward, the cool dampness of the floor and the light smell of disinfectant, the poisoned janitor with the mop, unfortunately, the same one that is said to lend the pupil to the tin cabinet key, where you can leave the textbooks and which are still so little.
For a bottle.
The smell of the locker room remains in the memory, now it is not held, it is pretty airy, but in a week it will be worse.
The very idea is a stomach clenching and a headache.
A head that even harder to embrace the maths curriculum, that diabolical game for the elect, which I'm not one of whom and never will be.
Again, the threes and fours, the nickname fag, hide from rehearsal, fit in from the bench and best be dug up, be there even if it weren't, to exist only as a name in the classroom, and to dream stories of the nicer girls and nicer buildings, about antennas in space, where no one competes with anyone, is atnooning, and undermining anyone's leg.
The longest year is ten months.
And it's only the first day, now as it was years ago.
She let the daughters born die.
She faces exceptional punishment - Novinky.cz
The first birth took place in March 2012 in the public toilets of the public toilets at the bus station in Jihlava.
Without any help, her baby girl was born, which she wrapped in a prepared blanket after cutting the umbilic, hid under her jacket and carried her to a road feeder, where she placed it in the bushes located a few dozen meters from the road.
She gave birth on the way to school
It came to me a little earlier, I guess.
I was on my way to school.
On the bus, I felt the need to go to the bathroom, that's where I gave birth.
She was born alive, looking at me.
I cut the urn card cord with scissors, which I wore to school," the defendant described, stating that she was said to be ashamed of her pregnancy.
"The following day returned to the site, put the body of the child in a backpack and took it away, removed the body from the backpack, wrapped it in a black plastic bag and hid it and left it under the staircase in her grandmother's house in Havlíčkův Brod," the lawsuit reads, noting that it is not entirely clear when the death of the newborn was taken.
It could have been in tens of minutes, but also a few hours after giving birth, ash by covering the blanket or putting under your jacket, hypothermia or bleeding from the unbound umbilical cord.
A similar scenario was repeated next spring.
The woman at the undetected time from February to April 12, when the child's corpse was found by accidental witnesses under the bush at the pond in Havlíčkobrodsko, was again secretly born.
This time in the bathroom of the attic apartment in the family home.
Without checking to see if it had been born alive without cutting and disengaging the umbilical cord that was wrapped around the neck, she put the child in several plastic wrappers, including a plastic bag, and left it in the bathroom.
Subsequently, in the afternoon, he and his then-partomate took him to the pond.
She was eventually turned in by a friend
The father of both children was the defendant's friend, who was allegedly unaware of his partner's pregnancies.
For that reason, too, he is not now in court, only being punished for a transgression against the Funerals Act.
He, too, was the one who later turned to the police.
I don't like the fact that he's not being punished as an accomplice.
He manipulated the child against my wishes.
I know my solution was wrong, but it felt human at the time," said the defendant, who allegedly succumbed to the man and was afraid of the man in the relationship.
In the course of her testimony, the young woman sounded rather composed.
Tears to her eyes were only brought to her eyes by the moment she spoke of her relationship with her parents, from whom she had gone after reaching the age of majority.
She didn't want to kill
"They come to see me every 14 days for a visit, they do everything for me, even though I know I don't deserve it," she sobbed.
I didn't get my outfit because I didn't want kids, I felt young.
I was still going to put him in a babybox, but I don't know what happened that I didn't do that.
I can't explain that to you," she said to the judge.
However, she denied that she acted with the thoughtful and intention of killing the newborn.
In addition, the second child was reported to have been stillborn.
Even in pregnancy, she did not stop drinking alcohol.
But I limited it.
And she didn't drink hard.
I have also reduced smoking," she said.
Although the pregnancy was visible in both cases, she told everyone, even to repeated questions, that she had a medical condition, that she was iridescented.
And my friend.
The trial will continue at the Hradec Castles Court on Tuesday with the testimony of forensic experts.
By Wednesday, a verdict could be handed down.
The woman is at risk of a penalty of up to 18 years in prison, or even an exceptional sentence.
Norwegian Cruise approaches $3 billion buyout to Prestige Cruise
According to sources familiar with the matter, the company Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings s.r.o. (NCHL.O.), the world's third largest cruise liner, in the negotiation of the purchase of Prestige Cruises International Inc. for approximately $3 billion.
The deal by Norwegian Cruise, a market value company of $6.8 billion that competes with greater competition from the Royal Carrebian Cruises s.r.o. (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N) have given access to the luxury Prestige Cruises cruise ships and wealthy clients.
The deal may be released as early as this week, the source revealed on Sunday, but pointed out that the negotiations may still not be successful.
The owner of Prestige Cruises, a private investment company, Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N), also owns a 20 percent stake in Norwegian Cruise.
Sources did not wish to be named because the negotiations are not public.
Representatives of Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to requests for comment, a spokesman for Apollo declined to comment.
Norwegian Cruise, based in Miami, operates thirteen cruise ships in North America, the Mediterranean and the Baltic Sea, Central America and the Caribbean.
The company's revenue in 2013 was $2.57 billion, 13% more than in 2012.
Prestige Cruises operates under the Oceania and Regent brands, which together own eight cruise ships sailing to Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
The company announced sales of $1.2 billion in 2013, 6% more than in the previous year.
The $ngeary billion segment of cruise voyages is expected to benefit from the rise of the middle class in growing economies like China and India in the coming year.
Companies compete to make them the preferred option for these customers to choose cruise rides.
Prestige Cruises registered its first public offer with the US regulatory authorities in January 2014.
Apollo has held a majority stake in the company since 2007, worth $850 million in the deal.
Norwegian Cruise has been in existence in its current form since the merger with the cruise operator owned by the Genting Bhd (GENT.KL) cruise liners, a consortium of leisure and casinos-related businesses controlled by Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thay.
In 2008, Apollo invested $1 billion in Norwegian Cruise.
Norwegian Cruise listed the shares on the stock exchange in January 2013.
According to the registration with regulatory authorities at the end of June, Genting held a capital shareholding of 28%, Apollo 20 % and the private investment company TPG Capital LP 8%.
According to the registration dossier, the first public offers include a combined total of 82% of the volume of North American passengers.
Pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong the day after the vote decision provoke Chinese authorities
Nearby, a group of people loyal to Beijing were standing around waving the Chinese flag.
The Permanent Commission of the National People's Congress on Sunday approved that only two of the three candidates participate in the 2017 elections in Hong Kong.
All candidates must first receive the support of the appointment committee, which is likely to be made up of members of the loyalists to Beijing.
Because of this decision, it is almost impossible for the opposition Democrats to get on the ballot papers and get pro-democratic activists to renew the promise and cripple Hong Kong's financial center with protests by the "Eccabroup of the Centre."
In Hong Kong, political reform is the main reason for tensions, with Chinese leaders fear that the demand for democratization will be extended to other cities.
After Beijing released a detailed report outlining China's official authority in Hong Kong in June, Democratic activists held an unofficial referendum on the elections in a special official district, and hundreds of thousands of people marched into and occupied the city's business district.
The press conference, at which Prime Minister Li will speak, is organised by the government in Hong Kong and the Chinese Liaison Office in Hong Kong.
During the day, the vice-chairman of the Standing Committee of the Legislative Commission, Zhang Ronghsun, and the Deputy Director of the State Board of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs of the Hong Kong Affairs and Macau Feng Wei were also scheduled to speak at several press conferences.
Studensk activists said they would gather in front of the Hong Kong government's office in the afternoon.
Until the last days of the colonial government 150 years ago, Britain has never mentioned democracy in Hong Kong.
Putin asks Kiev to start negotiations with eastern Ukraine on "state sovereignty"
According to a Russian newspaper's description of events, Russian President Vladimir Putin requested on Sunday that the Ukrainian government should halt the fight with the separatists in the east of the country and immediately begin negotiations on the "state sovereignty" of the seceded areas.
His spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, later explained that Putin's remark had no intention of suggesting that the areas of eastern Ukraine under the control of the separatists would become part of Russia, but that their status within Ukraine should be reconsidered in order to give the Russian-speaking area the authority to protect its rights and interests.
Putin's call to the Kiev government to deal with pro-Russian rebels as equals responds to an apparent strategy that follows it since the unrest broke out five months ago: Help the separatists to occupy the territory and give the Ukrainian government to give the newly declared Novorum to effectively independence so that it can ally with Russia instead of the West.
In an interview with the first channel of state television, Putin condemned Ukrainian military actions to reclaim the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, which were taken over by the separatists in March and April after Moscow annexed the Crimean Peninsula belonging to Ukraine on March 18.
The Kremlin and the separatists described the recently occupied territory as "Novorussia" or "New Russia," a term that refers to the glorious pre-revolutionary days of the Russian Empire.
The Russian Itar-Tass news agency published Putin's words that the "prisoner of the Illusions" is anyone who believes that peace negotiations are on the horizon because Ukrainian politicians started the 26th in the run-up to the parliamentary elections. campaigns in October, while government troops are attacking the civilian population in areas controlled by the separatists.
"In the interest of the people living in these areas, we must immediately launch meaningful negotiations, not only on legal matters, but also about the political organisation of society and the status of state sovereignty of the southeast of Ukraine," he said.
Peskov said Putin's reference to state sovereignty was meant in the context of broader autonomy, which has been discussed with Kiev's leadership for several months, to alleviate the concerns of the Russian-speaking areas of threats to cultural and linguistic rights.
Peskov said that only the Ukrainian government could grant the necessary autonomy to the eastern regions.
This is not a matter for discussion between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov said, "because this is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but an internal Ukrainian conflict."
The Kremlin spokesman's action to correct the "incorrect interpretation" of Putin's remarks emphasized the approach of Russia's leadership to address the separatist uprising in the east, which is different from the open occupation of Crimea, where most of the two million-strong population of origin is ranked as ethnic Russians.
Moscow would have much more difficulty in annexing Donetsk and Luhansk in eastern Ukraine, as most of the 6.5 million people are not Russians, and the opinion polls that took place before the conflict showed broad support for remaining in Ukraine.
The autonomy that Russian diplomats discussed in international fora would give regional governments in Ukraine the power to determine their own trade agreements and international relations, essentially giving the Kremlin effective control of the territory that would link the Russian mainland to Crimea.
The Black Sea Peninsula annexed five months ago is the headquarters of Russia's main naval fleet, maritime trade facilities and historic coastal resorts.
The areas between Rostov-shot and Crimea, Russia, are also the centre of mines, factories and foundries that produce important components for the Russian military.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko during his inauguration speech of 7. In June, he proposed that Ukrainian lawmakers - after the new elections - consider changes to the constitution that would give diverse regions more control over their finances and language statutes.
But this vision of autonomy differs greatly from that of the Kremlin and the separatists. Moscow is accused of arming and inciting violence.
Putin's final call for Kiev to treat the separatists as equals followed the rebels' next move last week after Russian troops and tanks from an earlier quiet area along the Sea of the Sea of Azov penetrated eastern Ukraine.
The separatists, reinforced by the Russians, have taken control of Novoazovsk with such force that the Ukrainian security authorities fear that this is a campaign to occupy the strategic coastal territory as far as Crimea.
This hastened the huge civilian and military effort to fortify Mariupol, a port with metallurgical combinations of 500,000 inhabitants, which lies between Novoazovsk and the narrow entrance gate to the Crimean Peninsula.
Poroshenko spoke at the European Union's headliner's meeting in Brussels on Saturday, urging action to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, the former Soviet republic, which has been independent for the last 23 years.
"We're approaching a point from which there is no return," warned Poroshenko.
Ukraine now houses thousands of foreign military units and hundreds of foreign tanks.
The EU summit has not taken any definitive steps - leaders are calling for more sanctions to be taken against Russia in the event of an unspecified escalation of the Ukrainian crisis.
Colonel Andriy Lysenko, a spokesman for Ukraine's National Security and Defence Council on Saturday told reporters in Kiev that Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Ilovaysk after two columns of Russian armored vehicles and 1,000 military units infiltrated the Donetsk region to support the besieged separatists.
The first of the 63 reported Ukrainian soldiers who were captured in Ilovaysk in the Russian invasion were exchanged on Sunday for 10 Russian paratroopers captured in the hinterland of Ukraine a week ago, Lysenko said on Sunday.
In the scandal of the exposed photos, Australian celebrities and Gabi Grecko are also involved
Geoffrey Edelsten expressed his disgust at the hackers who probably stole intimate photos of his fiancée Gabi Grecko and other influential Hollywood stars.
Tinseltown is in shock after a series of explicit photos of Jennifer Lawrence's online in the biggest scandal of hacked celebrity photos.
Hacker claims to have sixty photos with the nude star Hunger Games Lawrenc and other stars, including Kate Upton and Cary Delevingne, singers Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Ley Michell, and actress Kirsten Dunst.
The escape from iCloud reportedly made public personal pictures of Australian actresses Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovski and Melbourne actress Grecko.
There are 101 celebrities on the list.
Edelsten, who proposed to Grecko last month, told Confidential magazine, "It's disgusting."
All private correspondence and all private images should remain private.
It is a disgrace that personal information can be stolen and disseminated to the public.
Greco, who is now in New York, told online news reporters that the hacking was "shameless" and those who have become his target "seem humiliation."
The hacker is believed to have obtained 30 pictures of Palmer with former boyfriend Scott Speedman, including two images of the topless sprawl by the pool.
Palmer, for example, starred in Love and Honor, where her counterpart, Liam Hemsworth, was her counterpart.
Palmer, TV series star Chuck Strahovski and actress from the thriller Sucker Punch Browning, did not comment on the stolen images yesterday.
A representative of Lawrence TMZ said, "This is a clear privacy violation."
Actor Seth Rogen criticized the hacker on his Twitter page: "Publishing photos from hacked phones is exactly the same as selling stolen goods."
Legally, the publication of the stolen images should not be tolerated.
The Socceroos made up for the Legging, even without a win
Olomouc - The gromies and lightning that the co-owner of the Olomouc Sigma, Josef Lébr, sent to his subordinates last week, seems to be a thing of the past.
Even though they brought in from Opava in the end only a point for a scoreless draw.
By deploying and belligerence, they made the club's boss a little more.
Payday money could soon come to the club.
"I'll keep one more game as I talked about last week, but I'm much more optimistic," Lébr confirmed that despite the fact that Sigma did not win, the players convinced him with an improved performance.
The combativeness and commitment we played with mainly in the second half was exactly what I wanted to see from the players.
In that case, I am able to forgive the fact that it will not be won.
If only we had played like that from the beginning of the season, I am convinced that we have not lost yet," Lébr thinks.
Sigma stepped up the home side's initial pressure in Opava, then levelled the game and was better in the second half.
After the victory, Kalvodo's charges reached, but they didn't make the goal of their options, and so they couldn't win.
The result is not to our liking.
To complete satisfaction, however, we lacked only one converted chance," said Lébr, who does not think that the change in the attitude of the footballers was caused by his threat.
There were certainly more aspects.
Whether from my side, from the coach or the fans," Lébr said.
Pressure must be reckoned with Sigma
The players did not want to comment much after the match in Opava about the events of last week.
I'm trying to put these things away.
I tried not to admit it," said the young goalkeeper, Michal Reichl, shaking his head.
He then left the question to Lébr's statement last week's challenge, not converting Sigma's biggest opportunity in Saturday's game.
Eventually, however, he did talk a little about the pressure.
We'll be under pressure all the time.
Everybody wants to pull out on us.
Today we showed that if we fight and all of us ride on their asses, we'll do it," he said.
The warnings were taken to heart
Neither coach Leoš Kalvoda has shared that the preparation for the match was not the easiest given the atmosphere in Olomouc last week.
It was pretty hard.
But I think the boys realized that, and you could see today that Mr. Lébro's warning was taken to heart.
Although even before, it wasn't about not wanting to fight and flogging it," the Olomouc coach said.
It was like the first fifteen minutes today.
It took a while to get even hard and realize what the second league was about.
That it's not just about football, it's about the fight," Kalvoda said.
One can only hope that in the next matches it will be working from the start.
"I'd love to believe that," he added.
