What's he gonna do? ČSSD in Prague does not know Voldemort or the pastry shop
The new ČSSD capital councillors will probably have to overcome a certain language barrier to understand their old ODS colleagues in the Prague Council and the council.
The daily Aktuálně.cz "tested" the members of the new ČSSD council, as they know the notoriously established slang that arose at the town hall during the last years, when Prague was governed by the current coalition partners.
The coded dictionary, introduced by Prague's political elite during the previous era of Mayor Pavel Bém, describes some of the most famous figures, situations and caucuses in the metropolis.
Surprisingly, it turned out that the new councillors did not understand the familiar terms very well.
At least that's what he says.
"Who is Voldemort?"
"I really don't know."
"I am more of a newcomer to Prague politics," Lukáš Kaucký, a councillor for culture, responded to the "Godfather" test.
And while he is a political veteran, so did Councillor Karel Březina.
Like the term "golf hole."
"It's the only expression you present to me, which I sometimes use."
"Otherwise, I don't generally accept slang."
Of the vocabulary, whose terms were published by Aktuálně.cz in June this year before the ODS election congress, the editorial board selected six examples, mainly of those notoriously associated with the Prague Municipality.
The Socialists were to explain the terms "Voldemort," "the biggest golf hole in Prague," "go to the pastry shop," "the steep neck," "the capital's betrayal" and "noch."
The trio of the councillors agreed to the quiz, the fourth - Antonín Weinert, who is to head Prague's education in the future - first promised the interview, but later did not answer the phone.
Fifth Councillor Petr Dolínek rejected the test outright.
"I don't care about these things at all, and I'm not going to evaluate the Civic Democrats."
"I'm now working out how we're going to get along in our programs," he responded.
As has already been said, Councillor Lukáš Kaucký would not have disclosed in the headline above that we are talking about an influential businessman and friend of the ex-mayor Bém, Roman Janoušek.
"Voldemort" Kaucky means nothing to him, and the only date he correctly estimated in the test is "the biggest golf hole in Prague."
"That's the Blanka tunnel," Kaucký says, adding at once: "But I know that from the newspapers."
"I'll have to pay for a language course," he jokes.
The golf hole is then decrypted not only by matador Karel Březina as a Blanka tunnel to the administration, but also by the councillor for the environment, Lukáš Plachý.
Both Social Democrats then know who Voldemort really is, and Lukas Plaché is familiar with where to find this character - he suspects the meaning of the term "go to the confectionery shop" .
"I think that means going to a Prague business," Plachý is close to deciphering that it is the headquarters of Janoušek's companies.
Consistently with Březina, he recalls that he drew the knowledge from the newspapers rather than using such a vocabulary.
In the social democracy, according to the test's frequented test, there is no such run-of-the-mill vocabulary of slang terms.
"I've been with my colleagues, too, but it looks like we really don't have anything like that."
"We call ourselves more names, sometimes they use shortcuts and mischief of names," says the chairman of the Prague ČSSD, Petr Hulínský, whom the party members dub Hulda.
"I was called Birch at the school, but I don't know if my colleagues call me that," confesses to his own nickname, Karel Březina.
The daily Aktuálně.cz has tried the name and is working.
Councillor Weinert is nicknamed for partisans of Grandpa or less amicably, deputy Miroslav Poche, who drew attention to himself in the sponsorship of the party before the elections, is nicknamed "Igracek" by some colleagues.
The nicknames are also the only thing the Social Democrats in intra-party affairs concede.
Hulínský is said to be disliked by Huld, but Aktuálně.cz also noted another nickname for this Prague chairman.
"Doctor of the Caucus Law" is said to be reminded that Petr Hulínský received his JUDr. degree at the Bratislava Police Academy.
Government wants to limit the torture of 'witches', issued brochure
The women declared to be witches in Burkina Faso have several common features.
They are more likely to be the older generation, they cannot get involved in work for medical reasons, for example, they are single and have no children.
The one who "sleats" with the witch is sent to isolation so as not to threaten the rest of the village.
"The man will suffer this fate very rarely."
"Nor are not the young healthy women who help at work and give birth to children," describes the nun, who takes care of the West African nation of the West African city of Burkina Faso in a special house of more than a hundred women who have been banished by their community from among their ranks.
The local government has now decided to take action against the unusual "social measure."
She issued an information brochure to help limit the witch-hunt.
But there is a catch.
"More than 70 percent of adults in Burkina Faso can't read," Die Standard pointed out the disadvantage of written education.
Charging for witchcraft is also common in other African countries.
In Ghana, bordered by Burkina Faso, 72-year-old Amma Hemmah, 28, died last week after being tortured, doused with kerosene and set on fire.
The case was reported by the BBC.
The perpetrators claim that this was an unfortunate coincidence.
The woman's version said, the oil that's used for ritual riches came on.
He was said toerge after the group wanted to "kick up the evil spirit" from the woman.
The insulation of the "witches" is supported by people, regardless of the level of educational attainment.
Der Standard quoted the 42-year-old entrepreneur from Burkina Faso: "The urges of human souls have always posed a danger," he said.
While in Burkina Faso the Witch Hunt is being tempered by the government, the president himself participated in Gambia last year.
"Gambi's president, Jamamm, after the death of his aunt, unleashed a massive witch-hunt to allegedly be involved in her death and seek to use the black magic to kill the President himself."
"He has invited shamans from nearby Guinea to help himself, who, accompanied by police officers, soldiers and personal security guards, were forcibly diverting the chosen men and women from the Gambian villages to the President's farm in Kanilai," Amnesty International said in its report.
On the farm, the trapped people had to drink a potion of herbs with hallucinogenic effects, which also caused bowel and kidney problems.
Two imprisoned staying at the farm did not survive.
After international pressure, nearly 1,000 of those imprisoned were eventually set free.
Bakala's tenant: He drowns in the stove, the higher rent signed
The older, stocky man stepped out of the door of the client centre of RPG Byty Byty "uhlobaron" Zdeněk Bakala, the largest private owner of the rental flats in the Czech Republic.
He carried a folder under his arm, and in it new leases to three apartments: his daughter and his son, who is serving his sentence.
To all three, deregulation just raised the rent.
Instead of 3,500 a month, the son will pay CZK 4100 for a 2+1 second-category apartment from next year.
"And that's not hot water there, and petrama (bottom-fuel pits) must be heated," the man says, pointing with his finger in his son's new contract, for which he has a power of attorney.
"But I signed it," he says, half-an angry, half-resigned.
The civic association BytyOKD.cz, which described the new lease conditions as "incorrect and immoral," advises the tenants not to sign the new contracts and wait until December 7, when to publish a guide on how to proceed against them.
But the man is just waving his hand at it.
"One says it, the other says it," he frowns.
Ostrava is becoming a large laboratory of deregulation.
After the New Year, a large majority of flats are expected to be held by non-market rent in the Czech Republic.
Aktuálně.cz therefore decided to visit the "laboratory" in person.
The Havířov Churches RPG is one of four in Ostrava and is already full at 9 a.m. on Tuesday.
Next to the door is a security guard from the security agency and a gear-in.
"Ninter Desire 2011", the special button on its touchscreen.
One tap and a slip of the machine is taken out of the machine with a number.
You can't even read "157" and your figure is already beeping on the big display under the waiting room ceiling.
You're up in half a second.
The rent is asked by an older married couple after a while, but the rush in the waiting room is clearly not involved in the new rents at all.
Most people came to solve common problems like other times - requests for repairs, insurance claims and the like.
Letters with new lease contracts have been received by tenants in the post office boxes in Ostrava for most of the total 44,000 flats of the RPG portfolio since around mid-November.
RPG Apartments are proposing in their letters to increase the rent by 15 to 38 percent.
The special counter to the new rents was opened at the client centre on 18 November.
"It runs for over a week, so it's only in the run," the desk worker replies after a moment's hesitation when the client introduces herself as a journalist.
Deregulation and Bakala's former mining apartments are a local impulsive subject.
He was taken up rather loudly before the election by the deputy speaker of parliament and Ostrava-born Lubomír Zaorálek of the ČSSD, and even now the local newspaper is full of it.
"Twenty-years after them, I want a new floor."
"I didn't even..take a board in the toilet for me," the man in question relieves the introduction.
The most so far, according to the workers, are the pensioners coming in to see if they will receive a discount on the lease if they sign on time, as the RPG promises them in a special offer.
A half-receional discount on the February rent will also be given to other tenants who will sign the new contract by 15 December.
The Havířov "deregulation" counter, however, is definitely not overwhelmed by the inquiries.
"Oil 36 of yesterday's 360 clients were only about forty to fifty people here because of the 2011 rent," the workers at the counter estimate.
At the same time, RPG proposes on the web and its bulletin boards to individual contract negotiations where necessary.
However, if both parties do not agree to the lease, it will have to be determined by an independent court.
"This is not about threatening, but about information about only possible and completely legitimate legal procedure," the RPG points out on its website.
"No one is going to sue here," one of the RPG Byty workers thinks, and the man on the street in front of the client center partly agrees with her.
"I have a pension of 13 grand and I have five grand left to eat, I don't have the gives to sue," he claims.
But the worker is insecure afterwards.
"We'll see."
"Mr. Zaoralek tells them in the media not to sign, so people are probably waiting," he muses.
The regulation of rents ends in most of the Czech Republic with the New Year 2011 and according to the RPG Byta, their increase is an economic necessity.
"The current rent is still not even above necessary for the simple maintenance of the housing stock," recalls Pavel Klimeš, director of the residential portfolio of RPG Byty, recalls that the just-evited tenant's accused neglect of the housing stock is the main reason for the increase in rents, according to the homeowners.
While in the five years between 2005 and 2010, RPGs could invest four billion in the rents in the apartments, this is expected to be 5.2 billion in the four years from 2011 to 2014.
Meanwhile, the large-scale screen hanging by the ceiling opposite the padded seats of the mining waiting room is repeating a few red-refootted information.
"The rent increase in 2011 is 15% and less affects 31,200 flats, that's more than 90% of RPG flats."
"And it will always be the most of £7.50 per square metre per month," he will appear on the screen.
Only 400 flats in the RPG portfolio will be increased by 38 per cent.
"In these cases, this is an increase from an extremely small amount of CZK 19.66 per square metre," RPG points out.
For 2600 flats, the rent will remain the same next year.
RPG Byty promises that deregulation will not cut rents in leaps and bounds, but will be spread out in four to eight years.
In addition, it adds another commitment: all the money from the rent increase (see chart) will be put back into the apartments by the company, mainly in the heat savings - new windows and insulation.
They are to be given to people who sign an agreement to increase rents.
The offices also include a kindergarten, the architects understood
The Avriopoint office building in Brno is the new headquarters of Arch.Design.
No one would have expected him to also hide a mini-box with everything that goes with it - with colorful walls, imaginative furniture, a bunch of toys and even a miniature playground on the outdoor terrace.
Since October of last year, the children of the Arch.Design employees have been visiting.
The architheonic-architonic company Arch.Design, from whose studios the emergence of a number of important Brno buildings, counted on the space for its corporate mini-dollar from the first drawings of the Avriopoint building.
It employs nearly 90 people, mostly at the age of the babymoon, and cared that the women of the designers' designers and architects could quickly return to work.
Along with the option of part-time work, the kindergarten is a benefit offered by Arch.Design to its employees as part of the social programme.
The builders and architects have the opportunity to combine demanding jobs with child care.
The mini-church was invented by the employees of Arch.Design and, with the support of the management, they managed to obtain a subsidy from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
The company mini-chamber is funded by the European Social Fund through the Operational Programme Human Resources and Employment and the State Budget of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to the grant funding (subs of 2, 8 mil. CZK) could purchase the equipment and equipment and provide qualified staff and operations for two years.
After the financial grant has been exhausted (2 years), Arch.Design is obliged to operate a mini-chool at its own expense for 3 years.
The project took one year to prepare and Economy Rating helped significantly with the application for the subsidy.
The care is provided by qualified staff, the children are being cared for by a nurse and a school teacher, so children can attend kindergarten without age restrictions, yet most of them are over the age of 3 years.
Because it is a "minor-wheel-timer," only 5 children can be present at the same time, but more of them take turns during the day.
The operation of the nursery is flexible according to the needs of the parents, and the children of all employees have the same right to use the nursery regardless of the hierarchy of position in the company.
Although it is an individual education and care, the mini-group programmittic is comparable to the pre-school framework programme.
Children not only play here, but also provide quality teaching - from basic cognition to school desks, and English language is taught.
The class is equipped not only with toys, inspiring games, but also with a computer that children can use.
The presence of young children directly in the company creates a friendly and positive environment.
Parents can check their child at any time and fall off the stress situations of delayed picking up children from kindergartens away from their parents' workplace.
Parents thus use working hours more productive.
No wonder the employee's naturally loyal relationship - the employer - is created here.
Arch.Design thus joined Czech companies offering a significant benefit in the recruitment of new employees, are family-friendly and through this program reinforced personnel marketing.
The Bone House is still fascinating after 100 years. Take a look at the interiors from Gaudi
The roof looks like the back of a prehistoric lizard, the staircase resembles the backbone of a dinosaur, and the balconies are open to a fish mouth.
Such is the Casa Batlló in Barcelona by the Catalan architect Antoni Gaudí.
The house earned the house from the locals the nickname the Bone House thanks to its organic shapes.
Organic shapes, wild colors, unusual use of stone, fragments of tiles and mosaics, a scales-like facade and ubiquitous soft curves are all typical of the Art Nouveau by Antoni Gaudi.
The front of the house plays out the dreamy lines, tender colours and textures reminiscent of nature and animals.
In detailed observations, you can see the geometricity, rhythm and precisely thought-out order.
At night, the whole facade of the houses is even more dramatic, illuminated to make the impression of colouring a bit more amplified.
The culling and twisting of shapes appears equally in the interiors.
The wood in the waves replicates the window frames, the railing, the decorative elements of the door, the peepholes and the molders.
Batlló house, which is located in the Eixample district on the bustling shopping street Passeig de Grácia No. 43, was created by the reconstruction of the 1877 house by architect Emilio Sala Cortese.
Reconstruction took place for two years and the house was completed in 1906.
The investor, wealthy industrialist Josep Batlló, originally insisted on demolishing the old structure and building a brand new one, but soon embraced Gaudí's idea of an unusual and cheaper rebuilding.
But the Casa Batlló apartment house was not proposed by Antoni Gaudí himself.
It was co-operated by architect Josep Maria Jujol.
It was on his design board that the decorations for the representative apartment of the owner of the property were created and the use of the mosaic on the facade were created.
A number of other creators and artists also worked on the facade.
Working together on the designs of the Casa Batlló house started with Jujol's successful collaboration with Gaudi.
Yujol participated in the construction of Gaudí's house Casa Milá as well as Park Güell, which houses Gaudi's other works.
From the locals, the house soon after its completion, thanks to its organic shapes, earned the nickname "Dench of Bones."
Others, for the specific mechanism of opening the windows, began to call it a "simmer house."
It is also said that the sword of St. George, the patron saint of Catalonia, is represented at the top of the structure.
The hidden religious motifs also contain other sculptural elements of the building.
Gaudí designed for his time for his time a unique system of central heating with ventilation vents and typical chimneys.
Bizarre may seem to be their forty-five-degree gradient.
In the creation of Gaudí absolutely did not respect the building regulations of the time and did not let them be constrained.
At the beginning of the construction he obtained a building permit from the city, but the data provided by him were so vague that two years later, when the city council was horrified by the result and asked for redress.
Councillors were concerned, for example, that the construction interfered with the Pillar and the public sidewalk.
There was never a correction, on the contrary: only fifteen days after the city's call to the city district, Josep Batlló applied (and successfully obtained) permission to lease the two tallest floors of the building.
The owner himself moved into the lower levels.
The second-floet gallery featured a formal salon and a bedroom and a private part of the apartment on the third floor.
The ground floor was leased to jewellery.
The entire six-storey house is intersected by a staircase to climb up to the rooftop terrace itself.
The essential elements of the redevelopment were the abolition of all the right angles and straight lines and their replacement with curved walls.
Gaudí also worked with the modern concept of connecting the space.
The social part can be completely connected by opening the parlour doors, and the larger company can communicate comfortably without at the same time preserving the privacy needed for more intimate interviews.
The house with Gaudí's reconstruction was also given an unconventional roofing and two extra floors.
The Gaudi game with the light, blue and white glazed tiles, which is lined with the inner courtyard, and the skylights, are also impressive.
The game of two colours adds maximum light to all floors of the house.
Simply betting on the principle that white reflects light more than dark, which absorbs the sun's rays.
The house Casa Batlló, which was included in the Unesco World Heritage Fund in 2005, can be visited by anyone.
On the first floor of the house, the spaciousest and most aloatan apartment is made available to the public.
The owners did not opt for the move until 2002, to mark the 100th anniversary of the famous creator's birth.
They remained at the tours, finding that it was a very advantageous undertaking and, in addition, they extended the tours to include joint and attic spaces, including the roof terrace.
Admission to the monument is by no means insignificant, at €16.50 and students, pensioners, groups and tourist card holders have a 20 percent discount.
The sum greatly exceeds the price of admission to other Gaudí's buildings in the city.
If you want to get a taste of the real atmosphere of the house with the dragon turrets, you must quickly make friends with one of the residents of the apartment building and visit it right at home.
How to choose a mattress and a grate: women have different requirements than men
Not the fancy bed frame, but the quality of the light-cocklocking surface, the mattress and the grate, give the base of a really good bed.
However, they must be complemented harmoniously to suit a particular user.
In choosing, a lot of things decide from weight, height, age, health and gender of the owner.
Also important is the type of interior in which the mattresses and grate are taken.
A typical example?
For example, for weekend cottages where they don't regularly heat up, latex mattresses are not suitable because they are slower to "warm up."
In addition, they have a significantly higher weight than standard polyurethane mattresses.
At the same time, they are necessary to turn them over regularly.
For if they don't have a lot of ventilation ducts in their core, and they're still on the solid slab, they hold back the moisture: Mould could appear underneath.
The choice is also decided by habit.
Whoever has spent a long time abroad, where a very high mattresses are often used with a softening layer, will find it hard to feel comfortable on a low and hard surface.
"Perhaps all the hockey players who were coming back from the NHL complained to me that they wouldn't get a sleep-default here."
"For their battered shoulders, heels, and hips, they needed mattresses with a softening layer of lazy foam."
"Suchs are recommended for people with diabetes who have a nervous system disorder, so they misread "information" from joints and skin," explains Sylva Hadamczik, who specializes in upholstered furniture.
For many hockey players, as well as other customers, they were looking for lazy foam mattresses years ago.
"Today it's fine, the suitable mattresses have Tempur, the Italian Magniflex, but also the Czech Tropico."
You don't have to be the NHL guy to appreciate the lazy foam.
This "miracle" works simply.
Optimizes its stiffness and adapts the shape to your warm body according to the absorbed heat, or to your warm body.
Nothing is pressifying you, you will not be overturning at night like you did after a tough match.
You just get a better night's sleep.
Lying foam also acts as a protection against bedsores.
When choosing the size of the mattress, add the foot length to your height, which is usually about 21 to 34 cm.
The man and woman with a height of about 180 cm so need a bed of 210 to 220 cm.
The minimum width for one should be at the double bed of 90 cm, i.e. 180 cm.
For separate beds, such as singles, is recommended at least 120 to 140 cm.
For comfort and a possible visit.
"Otherwise, the bed width rule is simple: when lying on your back, your hands should be comfortably slightly bent at the elbow," advises Ing. Helena Prokopová, a guild of the Arcade and Decorators' Guild, who has been involved in the issue of healthy sleeping and ergonomics of furniture for many years and has been lecturing it at vocational schools.
At the double bed, everyone needs their own grate and mattress, but here you are careful to buy to reconcile the height of the mattresses.
Otherwise, there will be no choice but to mount the grids to different heights, but you may not be able to do that at each bed frame.
The foam mattresses should have a height of at least 14 cm, the types with a spring skeleton of at least 15, of which at least three centimetres count on the moulding and raising layer.
"When you touch your hands or touching down on the mattress, you definitely mustn't feel the springs," warns Helena Prokopová.
Each mattress requires a certain type of grate.
The all-rounded beds, when mattresses and the base are like fused siam twins, have no place in their bedrooms.
Mattresses are poorly ventilated, their cover cannot be washed, which is now common.
And because we normally sweat 0.2 to 0.75 litres of sweat per night, it is clear that after five to seven years of the mattress, it will start to resemble one large (and clogged) sieve.
That is why experts reject advertising slogans on the lifetime of mattresses for up to 25 years, or even life-long warranty.
But everything has its but.
And that's why the advice from the retailers' practice: for a mattress with a width of 120 or 140 cm of hygiene and a purifier, do not give up the purified coating, but add a mattressing pad, which you can easily remove and wash.
Although mattress covers are now commonly made ford all around the perimeter, so that after unbuckling we get two parts (for washing machine and size very important!), the handling of larger types (and in one person) at the sensation of the lightweight in the ring could still be reminded of the lightweight duel with the heavy.
Do you have a solid slab in bed instead of a grate?
Never!
At most, a bed designed for one-night visit.
However, you will still provide the plate (if it no longer has them) with air holes and use a mattress with a spring skeleton and a height of at least 15 cm with springs in sachets (from it.Taschenfederkern) and a buckling layer.
A polyurethane mattress does not belong to such a base.
Flooding vermin grids with 14 to 18 slats will be suitable for latex or sandwich mattresses (such as a combination of latex and coconut), but you are always worth grind with more slats, 28 or more, where the slats are doubled in the liny flat and can be regulated by the stiffness.
The positioning lamellar grid does not include a mattress with a spring skeleton because they do not respond to positioning.
In addition to setting the stiffness of the blades, you can also indulge in the so-called shoulder cradle.
It is a special attachment of slats, which allows you to push, or even tilt the slat, so that the sleeper's shoulder is pretty much "rampled."
For men who have "the strips all over their backs," an important thing.
It is even remembered by mattress manufacturers, who in the "men's" have started using a softening zone just in the shoulder area.
Women also remember - they are given a softer surface in places of hips.
For the most demanding customers, the wings or platelet grates with so-called multitorus suspension are intended.
The pressure is spread down into more points and the voltage decreases.
But beware, once you use the wrong cushion on the right mattress and grate (big and "sucked"), most "plus" will disappear.
The basic rule is simple: the cushion is supposed to be supported by the head and topped with only the shoulders to relax the shoulder muscles.
It is recommended to be the appropriate size of 50 x 60 cm, which they prefer in Scandinavia, for example.
When lying on the side, the cushion should be balancing (along with the shoulder cradle of the grate or the softened zone in the mattress) the shoulder height.
Modern mattresses have something to do with the original mattresses stuffed with grasses.
Their manufacturers are increasingly using natural materials or at least admixtures.
It is simply a trend for the mattress bio.
The raw materials from the oil from which polyurethane foam are made are replaced by natural oils, such as jumping and soya.
It is soy that perhaps all the famous manufacturers use.
"Bio at the mattress means that the core is made of a material of purely natural origin," explains Petr Vašíček from Tropico Plus.
Natural substances are also used in the production of mattress coating, one of the first being aloe vera.
But you can also indulge in micro-capsules to release the fresh scent of the forest or lavender.
There is also a division for men and women.
While the man is "coolled" by the plant extract from the birch to absorb the heat and cool the body to the mattress coating, the women's workshops are "heat."
Red pepper extract increases blood circulation, making it warmer for the weaker sex.
Today's favorites?
Mattresses made of cold foam (it has larger pores with a broken cellular texture, is thus more breathable than a normal polyurethane and offers better elasticity.
By combining various stiffness of cold foam and "lazy" foam, multi-zone mattresses are created, which know exactly where the head, loin, and heel should be.
You will pay for a quality mattress from seven thousand crowns and above.
Those that meet the health parameters tend to have a lower VAT rate, they are taken as medical aids.
Gumotex was the first to reach this advantage in the Czech Republic.
Saving on a mattress and a grid is not easy.
Sometimes you can use, for example, the events of manufacturers or retailers, which offer two mattresses at the price of one.
For example, the Magniflex brand offers a Duofreeze mattress with a sewn Memory memory foam to the coating for CZK 11,990.
The second, however, can already be purchased for free.
The era of lazy, or viscole-elastic foams with an open cellular structure and high density, kick-started Tempur material at the "space" pace.
It was originally created as material for NASA because the astronauts were subjected to enormous overload during the launches.
Tempur softens in the warmth, while it is strengthening in the cold.
The warm human body is so perfectly adapted and degraded optimally by its pressure.
It is therefore ideal against the formation of bedsores, but also to increase the comfort of sleeping.
Viskoelastic foams are used not only for mattresses, but also for medical products, such as special cushions under the feet, which lighten the legs and the venous system.
Domestic manufacturers use, for example, the Eucatherm C or Twinsaver foam and the like.
More and more parents want to watch people, so they want to watch their children
Fear for their own child brings more and more people to the idea of watching via GPS.
The system originally designed to search for cars can also track people's movements, and thus help, for example, in such cases as the disappearance of nine-year-old Anička Janatková.
The device is about the size of a matchbox yet, but it can soon be only as big as a watch.
A number of people were startled by the case of the missing Annie and began to look for the means to better protect their children.
Even at the cost of invading their privacy.
"We are trying to tell everyone that this is not about spying, but another means of reducing the likelihood of a tragedy," says Petr Pilin of Macro Weil, one of the suppliers of surveillance equipment to the Czech market.
"I admit that in some case, such devices may be misused, like when they're put in a bag to someone who doesn't know it, but we haven't encountered a case like this yet."
"Most of the time, customers actually buy it for safety reasons," Pilin added.
According to him, the child should always know for what purpose the "box" is for and how it is used in the event of an emergency.
Child psychologist Dana Bočková points out that if a child doesn't want to wear anything like this, he'll just get rid of it.
"Even very young children show great creativity in how to lose some things on purpose when they don't want to be in control."
"Large expectations were raised earlier for their parents' mobiles, which, however, can be turned off just like these tracking devices," says Bočková.
It is also questionable whether such a device would actually help in the event of an attack.
"As for the upcoming kidnapping, the perpetrator will practically always ensure that the child has no electronics on him that could give away his location."
"Now it's the phone."
"When the tracking devices start to expand, they will look for them as well, because their sale will certainly be boosted by massive advertising."
"In that case, the criminals will always be one step ahead of the police," the psychologist says.
However, he admits that a similar device can help in the event of a paedophile assault.
According to Robert Čech of RC Monitoring, which offers tracking services for both cars and people, even if the tracking device is immediately destroyed after the attack is attacked, its presence can help.
The device can be set to be sent to the positioning periodically after a certain period of time."
'If it is damaged, at least the last position of the person concerned will be available.'
"The more expensive devices have also built-in tilometers, so even if one merely slipped and lay motionless, the device immediately sends a warning with the location," the Čech says.
According to him, a similar service can be done by smart mobile phones with navigation, where you can upload special software.
The problem with the current surveillance units is that they are either devices similar to pendants the size of a matchbox box or smaller mobile phones.
They are always at risk of losing them.
According to Pilin of Macro Weil, this is why a device that looks like a regular digital watch is now being tested.
"That will have the greatest advantage in that a possible aggressor may not recognize the tracking device at all."
"Or he'll recognize them after a while and that can give the police extra time," he adds.
Whether the tracking devices are developed in bracelets or pendants, they will still use the same technology used to guard wagons.
It is a combination of positioning through the GPS system (used by common auto-favigation) and the mobile phone's function that reports the car's current position.
The army has a incendiary line that they would arm the Czech Republic. But it will only last two years
The Czech army bought 445 kilometres of cords to launch explosives.
Already last year, the Ministry of Defence delivered 224 kilometres of cords to the warehouses.
The army has supplies for 225 years.
The problem is that the shelf life of the caucus is two, four years at the most.
The army bought the fuse lines from the joint-stock STV Group, a. s. for CZK 40 million.
The general staff, in the justification for buying such a huge number of incendiary cords, wrote off MF DNES that the soldiers consumed 60 kilometres of fittings a year in training.
However, calculations of the army bomb technicians interviewed by MF DNES show that then all generals, army commanders, secretaries of the army command or cleaners would have to undergo a very intensive pyrotechnicic training each year.
Defence Minister Alexander Vondra and army commander Vlastimil Pick included.
Only then could the military's annual consumption of sixty kilometres of fittings be justified.
This length is equivalent to 25,000 explosions.
And even if it were, the army's supplies would be enough for more than a decade.
If, on the other hand, it would be true that a minimum of two meters of fuse of the incendiary of the fuse of each new professional, as the experts say, the military's fresh purchase was sufficient - with increased consumption of the engineers or special forces - to provide the supply for the aforementioned 225 years.
Soldiers of the Rapid Deployment Brigade complained to Minister Vondra recently that they had almost no rounds of handguns, so even the shooting for lack of money is limited.
Not to mention the lack of underwear.
"It doesn't give me any thought that they're buying such a large number of fuses from us repeatedly."
"But it's their decision, and they know what they'll be up to."
"For us, the army is a good customer, to whom we try to accommodate as traders," says STV Group's business manager Jan Děcký.
Defense Ministry spokesman Jan Pejšek justifies hundreds of kilometres of the purchased cord and that the army will have supplies of this "ammunition" for at least ten years.
However, Jan Děcký of the STV Group speaks only of the four-year life of the fighter and the police or army bomb squad only about two years.
"With the perfect storage, it can be the four," says one of them, who, as a soldier, does not want to disclose his name as a soldier because of criticism from the army.
After life has expired, each ammunition must be carefully tested to see if it is still reliable and does not endanger the soldiers' lives.
However, these tests are not free and cost extra money.
Another Ministry's argument is the quantity discount on the 445-kilometer incendiary cords.
"We were 60 percent less than last year's van two hundred and forty-four kilometers," the Pejšek spokesperson relays the position of the Defence Ministry's buyers.
Just for the sake of comparison: the annual consumption of the launching cords of police bomb squad, which is destroying World War II ammunition or the Soviet army, has not exceeded 1,500 metres for several years.
And the police always order enough to consume this ammunition before the end of their life.
It has worked for the safety of the bomb squad, and can also get more modern and therefore more reliable types of cords in a more flexible way.
The Ministry of Defence already has considerable difficulty in eliminating tens of thousands of tons of ammunition from the Warsaw Pact, when the 200,000-strong Czechoslovak army was preparing to campaign on the Rhine.
The Czech one, according to the bomb squad, which was approached by MF DNES, is the same problem in a few years: it will eliminate hundreds of kilometres of old fuses that the "bacle" is buying today.
To this day, I draw from the contacts I got thanks to the competition
The winning place in the Entrepreneur of the Year competition helped Lukáš Pytloun in the sale of the franchise of his hotel.
The winner of the previous year's Entrepreneur of the Year competition was the 28-year-old entrepreneur Lukáš Pytloun from Liberec.
His success story is like a movie.
Lukáš Pytloun liked to travel.
And abroad he realized that Liberec lacked quality accommodation at a reasonable price.
From savings from foreign jobs and a bank loan, he bought a half-ruined house with five flats.
For a student of his third year in college at the time, it was a great courage.
"He didn't give me the ratio between the quality and price of accommodation at the time, so I wouldn't try to do something about it," says Lukáš Pytloun.
The first renovated apartment began to be leased to foreign workers.
He invested all the profits back into a house, which he gradually converted into a 54-bed guesthouse.
Since then, he has gradually opened four guesthouses in Liberec in seven years of business, two stylish restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of over 300 beds of all categories of accommodation.
The most comfortable of these until recently was the four-star Bagman design hotel.
But this year it added another, of the same quality.
"We are currently signing a contract with the hotel in Ostrov u Tisé, where we sold our franchise concept and other bidders for the hotel's hotel franchise are applying," says last year's number one tradesman.
"And in this sale of the hotel licence to operate the hotel, it was the victory in the Entrepreneur of the Year competition that contributed to the competition," adds Pytloun appreciatively.
The victory brought him more acquaintance and popularity in and around Liberec.
"People recognized me on the streets, often congratulated me afterwards, and I have to say it was nice," he recalls.
Participating in the competition is definitely recommended by all those who are trying to do something.
It is not even necessary to win, any visibility is good.
He says he still draws on contacts and connections he might not have gotten to in any other way.
"I started trading with some of the contest because of the competition."
The fame associated with the success, according to him, fared a bit on each employee.
And that he's in his 70s.
"I observe greater loyalty and pride in being involved in something that has gained general recognition."
"It's not just my personal achievement, it's the result of the good work of all of us put together."
"Only my name is being pushed to the fore," says Lukáš Pytloun modestly today.
I wish my successor a quieter year than we had at Farmet
The euphoria of the victory was quickly replaced by the effects of the crisis.
Thanks to the player's purposefulness, however, Farmet has had a worse time.
For the award for first place in the previous year's Vodafone Firma of the Year competition, the owner of Farmet, Karel Žďárský, came to the owner of the company in the Slavonic House last year.
The jury at the time appreciated the efforts through which he built a company with hundreds of millions of dollars of turnover from a small tool shop in České Skalice.
"I can say that the award has encouraged not only me, but all my team-workers and has increased our confidence for the match with the competition," says last year's winner today.
At the beginning of Farmet's history, there was a desire to do something useful.
So, when the state offered the father of Karel Žďárský to rent a small workshop to compensate for the communists' confiscated property, he did not hesitate for a long time, he refused to pursue a career at the firm where he worked at the time, and he and a few friends around his dad set up a plastic bath company.
Soon later, they began to specialize in the presses of vegetable oil.
After 18 years, they became the largest automotive press manufacturer in Central Europe.
The company got more and more awareness among the non-professional public after the success achieved in the competition through the media.
"Not only did our customers start to perceive the Farmet brand significantly better, but also foreign partners began to appreciate that they were working with a company that achieved greater success in their country," says Karel Žďárský.
But the past year was not just a sign of the euphoria of the winner in the Farmet.
The awards were based on the company's economic results until 2008 and only partially from 2009.
And it was 2009 that was the toughest year for the sale of engineering goods.
A crisis peaked, not so much touching citizens, but companies were already stopping their investment projects and were cutting back on purchases of new machinery and technology.
"Of course, this situation has not escaped us."
"Revenues fell by 40 percent, we had to limit production and there were layoffs," explains Karel Žďárský.
A viable company must be able to take such unpopular measures at times.
But they handled the situation and kept the company in profit, albeit smaller than before the crisis.
What they did not discount at Farmet, however, is the investment in research and development.
"We built a research and training centre from the subsidies, we strengthened the presentation at international fairs, we won the main awards in domestic exhibitions," says Žďárský.
All indications are that the crisis is behind them.
Sales are up again, and with them the number of new employees.
"I wish the new winner a pleasant feeling of victory, but in a calmer atmosphere," says Karel Žďárský.
A poll that removes nonsensical regulations
The poll on the Absurdity of the Year is part of the business race for the fourth time.
Some nonsensical regulations have already been repealed.
The infamous winner of the next year's Absurdity of the Year poll was the obligation to wear documents to the office that are also accessible to officials online.
More than a third of the less than 4,000 voting members have made the decision.
For example, the Social Security Administration required a paper extract from the Commercial Register, even if the official can obtain it with two mouse clicks.
The poll will change that.
"The Czech Social Security Administration will no longer require an extract from the Commercial Register during checks on insurance payers," said ČSSZ spokesperson Jana Buraňová.
Shine to see all the regulations and regulations that companies and entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic have to comply with, and the nonsensical ones to be abolished is the point of the Absurdito of the Year competition.
This is the fourth part of the business race organized by Hospodářské noviny this year and is increasingly popular among the public.
If some three thousand voted the vote last year, there were already nearly four thousand of them this year.
And no wonder, all sorts of legal obligations that serve only to delay business is still enough and enough for us.
"For example, in the number of documents for tax returns, we are at the top of the world," notes Karel Havlíček from the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Trades Employers of the Czech Republic.
Simplifying business has become a well-proclaimed goal of all governments in recent years.
Compared to the world, however, the situation in the Czech Republic is not particularly improving.
According to the World Bank, the Czech Republic ranked 74th in terms of business conditions, eight places worse than last year.
The Absurdity of the Year competition was first announced in 2006 and is annually in the same scenario.
Anyone can sign up for administrative and bureaucratic nonsense every year from April to the end of September, when the competition is the deadline.
The web address www.firmaroku.cz is then selected by the organizer of the competition for the "anti-a" "anticena" and lets the public vote on it over the internet at www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz.
The absurdity that gets the most votes wins.
More than a hundred were entered for this year's poll, or 105 regulations and a making-event-free regulations.
Tips were sent by businessmen, as well as professional unions and journalists.
Among the "finalists" of the competition, among the nominees, there was, for example, a requirement that highway and express road maintenance vehicles be paid toll, or for entrepreneurs with 20 employees, two offices and two toilets to paint every two years.
The list of this year's seven designs is published on the competition website.
The announcement of the competition, which takes place in early November on Wenceslas Square in Prague, is part of the hapenning, which is regularly attended by personalities of political and social life.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodová, the director of the Association of Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises and Trades Employers of the Czech Republic, or Petr Kužel, President of the Chamber of Commerce of the Czech Republic, assisted on this climax of the competition.
"Economic prosperity cannot function where the state throws businessmen sticks in the works, so my aim is to cancel at least three dozen paragraphs every year, which today only unnecessarily complicate business," said Minister of Industry and Trade Martin Kocourek.
Trying to repeal senseless regulations do not come to nothing.
In 2007, people were most bothered by the obligation for an entrepreneur to report three days in advance to the trade licensing office in the place where the permanent establishment is located, the intention to go to the exhibition or the fair with the stall.
This obligation was removed by an amendment to the Trade Licensing Act.
The second most voted obligation in 2007, which was the report to the employment office for its foreign employee, a business trip of up to 30 days, was removed by the So-Green Card Act.
And for the third time, all good.
The absurdity of the year of 2009 was the regulation of physiotherapists to have a large mirror, a refrigerator and two treadmills in the office.
This has been alleviated by a decree of the Ministry of Health this year - the obligation to have a refrigerator has fallen off.
The new category awards socially responsible firms
Environmental, humanitarian, educational or sports projects are evaluated.
A new feature in this year's fifth edition of the competition of Hospodářské noviny is a category called Responsible Company of the Year 2010.
The mission of this competition is to promote a sensible and fair business.
"We want to support companies that take into account the environmental impacts of their business and support socially responsible activities," says Patrik Bartholdy, regional manager of the mobile operator, Vodafone, which is the promoter and guarantor of the competition as well as the rebel of the year competition.
This year's first edition of this special subcategory of the main Vodafone Firma Firm of the Year 2010 entered companies for which success in business is not the only long-term goal.
The story of each of them is very inspirational and would be published on a separate article.
Although the subject of their activities is diametrically opposed to one's activity, support and consideration can be considered as common denominators of their endeavors.
In one case, it concerns, for example, disabled people and elsewhere, for example, personal problems or the health of their own employees.
Among the 14 nationwide finalists were, for example, the Prague software company Et Netera, which supports the creation of informal sports teams among the staff, who then take part in a number of tournaments in various sports.
Another example of the responsible company from the Pardubice Region is the company Isolit-Bravo, which has been the main contributor to the endowment fund sponsoring handicapped children for seventeen years.
Its disabled employees are again cared for by a paper company from Poděbrad, which has more than 70 percent of them, and therefore won the title of Responsible Company of the Central Bohemian Region and placed third in the Vodafone Company of the Year competition.
In Olomouc, the accountant firm MiRyz Soft, which introduced flexible working hours, also reduced to an average 35 hours per week, but without proportionally reduced pay, won.
The title was also awarded to her by the jury for her first purchases from Czech producers, support civic activities in the nearby area and saving the environment.
"We are trying to recycle as much as possible so that our business and our administration have the least impact on the environment," explains Miluše Ryznarová, the director.
The IT company responsible Enlogit from the Ústí Region, for its part, thinks about the health of its employees and has acquired ergonomic chairs and keyboards for each laptop, supports their work from home and uses catering services provided by the local sheltered workshop at its corporate events.
"In addition, we support the People in Need Foundation, which specifically helps the local Romani community," says Ondřej Suchý, a representative of the company.
Last but not least, it is also worth mentioning the activity of the company Praní a cleaning and cleaning from the Karlovy Vary Region, which contributes to their supplementary pension insurance for its employees in the form of premium bonuses.
"At our place, we give allowances for meals, transport, upskilling and recreation," says Josef Strapáč of the Bruntal construction company Czasch, a winner in the Moravian-Silesian Region.
All the regional finalists of the Vodafone Company of the Year competition were automatically entered into the category of Responsible Company of the Year, who answered the questions of the questionnaire attached to the application and sent it to the organizer no later than 15 August.
The unmanaged or incomplete answers in the questionnaire were then removed from the evaluation by the organiser.
"If the competing company representatives did not answer the questions, they could not participate in the Responsible Company of the Year contest, but are not disqualified from the "main" competition Vodafone Company of the Year."
"A separate entry only for this competition is not possible as it is a sub-category of the main Firma of the Year competition," explains Karel Goldman from the Bison & Rose hosting agency.
At the Land Fund in Pilsen, police arrested during a public tender
In the building of the Land Fund in Pilsen in recent days, anti-corruption police have been arrested.
The school was planted by the detectives on a local businessman in the media sphere and real estate salesman Luboš G.
He allegedly attempted to manipulate the current public tender to settle the restitution claims so that the land offered in the competition would be acquired by a specific bidder.
He was to pay Luboš G. for half a million crowns.
"For now, I can only confirm that the police are prosecuting one person for the offenses of misconduct in a public contract and in a public tender," Antonie Zelená, the head of the Plzeň prosecutor's office, told Právo, noting that further details with regard to the ongoing investigation could not be provided.
The 46-year-old businessman was released by police officers after 24 hours.
The way he could have influenced the public tender is only speculated, given the minimum of official information.
Landfill Fund spokeswoman Lubomíra Černá, asked by Právo, said that police officers had actually made arrests at the secére department in Plzeň during the public tender.
"It was a client, not our employee," she said.
The public tender is the correct name, according to the Black, "The call for the submission of claims for the transfer of land under the Land Act" and takes place in the case of the interest of the offered land of the property being offered.
"These persons in the call offer a higher value of their restitution claims to be settled by the transfer than the declared value of the land."
"According to the claims offered, the ranking of the acquirers is determined and the Land Fund then transfers the land to the person who offered the highest claims," the fund's spokesperson explained.
Luboš G. apparently had information on who entered the challenge, and because he is also a beneficiary of the authorized party because he bought up a number of restitution claims, he offered the bidder of the lander not to participate in the contest.
For that, he probably collected a severance package.
That would explain that he had such a large sum of money when he was detained.
Luboš G. had above-standard contacts at PF in Pilsen in the past.
He was in the case of former PF chief Václav Sankot, who was being prosecuted for issuing land in replacement restitution to which a decision on the location of the construction had already been made.
It was then that Luboš G. acquired from the fund, for example, the land for the construction of public roads, specifically the site where the access road to the Borská pole industrial zone was to be built.
Later, he traded them very profitably with the Municipality to a house in the historic centre of the city itself, which was worth much higher.
At the time, the town hall had to accept it, because otherwise it would have endangered the construction by blocking the land.
Households pay hundreds a month for housing
From January, households will have to pay extra not only for all types of energy, but also for aqueous and sewerage, heat supply and rents to rise somewhere.
As a result, families will have to take up hundreds of crowns more a month out of their wallets from January than they do now.
Electricity will go up to 4.6 per cent more expensive, the gas will be about 2 per cent more expensive, up to a tenth in some cities you will have to pay extra for water supplies and in many cases the supply of central heat will also be undercut.
The increase in electricity should be a year for households in flats to cost CZK 100 per year than it is now.
At the same time, power prices have been lowered by all the main suppliers, so a significant increase in support of renewable energy production, especially photovoltaics, is to blame.
Gas will become more expensive slightly, but at a time when people are the most heating up and have the highest consumption.
They must therefore also expect hundreds of extra crowns a year.
While electricity and gas become more expensive across the country, the change in the price of central heating varies from place to place.
The price increase is mainly planned by larger municipalities.
For example, households in Pardubice or Hradec Králové will pay an extra CZK 50 per month for central heating from January, with families in Liberec paying more than CZK 1,000 per year.
For its part, Prague residents are at risk of making them more expensive to aqueous and sewerage by more than 9 percent if the city increases rent from infrastructure.
If the rent is unchanged, the Roasted 6.8 percent will be paid.
However, the price in Prague will still be among the lower in the national comparison.
In the north of Bohemia, where prices are already among the highest, the aqueous and stodgy is expected to increase by 7.4 percent.
For example, the rent price may rise significantly in the 450,000 rental apartments where regulations expire from January.
For example, CPI Byty, which owns about 2,500 flats in Ústí nad Labem, intends to increase the rents by up to one hundred percent from January.
Those who will not agree to the new renting will be taken to court by the company.
Regulated rents, paid by people in around 300,000 apartments, could grow by as much as ten percent next year.
Czech children are drunk with fernet and rum. Beer is out of fashion, works slowly
Fernet, rum, vodka, exceptionally even a better brand of whisky stolen from their parents.
These are the drinks, after which the drink is most often ended up in the care of doctors by drunks who were under the age of fifteen.
The exception is not children who are treated repeatedly from the monkey in hospital.
This follows on from the experience of doctors who encounter similar cases in the income of children's ward of hospitals.
"Some beers or wines are completely non-fashionable, because it takes a long time to get drunk with them."
"The trend is definitely hard alcohol," Luděk Pelikán, head of the children's department at the Hořovice Hospital in Central Bohemia, told Právo.
"If they manage to pull the bottle out of Daddy's closet, it's a whisky, but otherwise the fernet and vodka predominate."
"The Vodka has the advantage of pouring it into their juice and not feeling that much of it," the chief surgeon explained.
He is also supported by the spokesperson of the University Hospital Motol, Eva Jurin.
"It's fernet or rum most of all."
"This is modern alcohol today especially in primary schools."
"In some cases, it was a slivovitz they brought from home," Jurin said.
According to the head of the Pelikán, 13 or 14-year-old drinkers are a relatively common occurrence at hospital intake.
In front of Hořovice, where he has been since this year, he worked for ten years in pediatrics in Motol, where ambulances bring in underwhellifts of upscale schoolchildren from a wide area.
"One girl lay with us about four times."
"She started her career at the age of 12, when she was brought to us with a blood alcohol level of 3.5 extra alcohol in combination with ecstasy," the doctor said, describing a particularly serious case.
"She was at the exhibition grounds in Holešovice for a dance party."
"What's interesting is that her mother didn't find it strange that she didn't know about her daughter for 48 hours," the chief said.
It is the lack of interest of parents or even their considerable tolerance for drinking their own offspring that is considered to be the main cause of the growing children's drinking span.
However, according to experts, addiction in the truest sense of the word cannot be discussed in the children.
"Actober means a multiple chronic addiction to alcohol with all the phenomena that are not to do so, and that is not in children."
"For those who use alcohol repeatedly, the unsuccessful family-social background is rather characterized," explained the head doctor Pelikán.
According to Jurin, a spokeswoman for Jurin, around forty drunk children were hospitalized at the pediatric clinic in Motol this year by mid-November.
But only those with heavy intoxications that had to stay in the hospital will get into the statistics.
Child drunks who are taken away by their parents after outpatient treatment, or are brought home by the police, do not count in any way.
Aside from when children just sit down after school and drink a bottle of liquor, there are three seasonal swings that can be relied upon, according to Pelikán: the witch, New Year's Eve and the end of the school year.
"That's either how they drank the sorrow from the wrong report card or, on the contrary, celebrate the start of the holidays."
"Of course, I've had seven child drunks at the receiving end," the Pelican said.
Ironically, a drunk who spends the night detoxifying the night under the supervision of doctors is at an advantage over the one who suffers an unpleasant hangover at home the next day.
In fact, morning headaches caused by dehydration and lack of glucose are driven by irrigation infusions with glucose and nutrients that the body is missing.
"They're actually better off, because they have a good awakening after that beautiful evening experience, and they're not in pain."
"They are only confused about where they are," the Pelican admitted, noting that he sometimes spoils patients' pleasant mood by at least listing the costs they had required to receive.
Transportation by ambulance and hospitalization on an acute bed will cost tens of thousands of crowns.
"Sometimes I applied it as an educational vehicle, when I then calculated directly to those children on rounds how much their drunkenness cost and that they could also spend the whole summer on a part-time job to earn a year for that one party," Pelikán added.
But health insurance companies, he said, do not approach the regression proceedings in which they would recover the costs of treatment from the parents in cases of child drunks.
Two L-159s are in foreign hands in Spain for the first time
Two L-159s out of a total of five units, for which the Czech Ministry of Defence exchanged the Casa C-295M transport aircraft, flew to Seville, Spain, on Tuesday, where the aircraft manufacturer Casa - EADS is based.
This is the first time that machines of this type have appeared in the possession of someone other than the Czech army.
So far, they have only been on drills or demonstration flights abroad.
These are two-seat L-159T1 versions, which were operated so far by the Czech army and which were air-capable.
The remaining three machines are a single-seat L-159.
These, meanwhile, stand mothballed in Aero Vodochody and the broker of the deal - Omnipol - took over last week.
When the aircraft will physically dispatch from Vodochod is not known so far, according to Jan Pejšek from the Defense Press Department.
"The single L-159 aircraft for the shift have been earmarked from long-term stored aircraft, without further deposits and investment by the Ministry's ministry."
"The two-seat L-159T1 was exchanged in its current state and form," Pejšek told Právo.
He added that the army would not be left without two-seat aircraft, as the Ministry signed a CZK 200 million contract with Aero Vodochody in May 2009 to rebuild four unnecessary L-159 machines into two two-seat machines.
One new aircraft was taken over by the military in July, the other will take over by the end of this year.
According to Pejšek, EADS pledged to push the aircraft into the armament of some of the Alliance's countries.
"The contract clearly states that the buyer of the L-159 is EADS and will be used to train pilots from NATO countries."
"It is therefore a matter for the customer to how to implement this matter," Pejšek said.
Hospodarske noviny reported some time ago that e.g. The Spanish army is not interested in the L-159.
The exchange of five L-159s for one Casa aircraft and the purchase of three more aircraft for CZK 3.5 billion was approved by the government of Mirek Topolánek last year.
The Ministry of Defence did not issue a tender for the purchase and approached EADS directly.
The defense leadership at the time argued that the exchange would support the future exports of the L-159 abroad.
The Czech Army bought 72 machines from Aero and only uses it 24, the rest would like to sell.
The purchase of Casa aircraft is also likely to have a court-of-came.
The European Commission sued the Czech Ministry of Defence in a European court for the fact that it was to select the aircraft on the basis of a pan-European tender and not by addressing one manufacturer.
The army has already taken over three Casa aircraft, the last one should arrive at Prague's Kbely Airport in a fortnight.
Longer index finger than ring finger indicates a lower risk of cancer
Men who have a finger longer than a ring finger are at a lesser risk of getting prostate cancer.
This is the surprising conclusion of a study published on Wednesday by the British Cancer Journal.
It may be related to the level of the male hormone testosterone.
"Our results show that the relative length of the finger can serve as a simple test of the risk of prostate cancer, especially for men under 60, especially for men under 60," said co-author Ros Eeles, a professor at the Institute for Cancer Research at the University of Warwick.
The finger could thus help identify which men should undergo a prostate cancer test, particularly in combination with a genetic risk or other endangering factors such as the family health burden, Eeles added.
In the period 1994-2009, she and her colleagues in the UK tracked more than 1,500 prostate cancer patients and, at the same time, over three thousand healthy men.
More than half of the study participants had a index finger on their right hand shorter than the ring finger.
They were as likely to be prostate cancer as for 19 percent whose fingers were the same length.
However, in the case of those with a finger longer than a ring finger, this risk dropped by 33 percent, for men up to sixty, the decline was even 87 per cent.
The ratio of the length of the two fingers in question - shaped in the prenatal period - appears to reflect the different levels of the sex hormones to which the child is exposed in the womb.
Less testosterone matches a longer index finger.
Earlier research has shown that it is testosterone that supports growing prostate cancer.
The leading Czech geneticist and former chairman of the Academy of Sciences, Professor Václav Pačes, told the Czech Press Agency that he was a cursory knowledge of the study, but did not seem to him that the relationship between the length of the finger and the cancer was "completely proven."
Czech Republic under snow, D1 and D5 closed
The Czech Republic, like most of Europe, is covered with snow on Thursday morning.
On the roads and sidewalks there is mostly driven snow, with road crews driving in many places all night.
The D5 motorway between the 89th and 93rd kilometres in the direction of Rozvadov is closed in the morning due to several accidents of trucks and passenger cars and also stands the D1 at Brno in the direction of Prague.
News was told by the Central Automobile Operator (ÚAMK).
A truck crashed there at the 91st kilometer, two trucks collided at the 93km, the accident resulted in injuries.
Several passenger cars also ended up in the ditch.
There are also problems on the D1 motorway at the 185th kilometre in the direction of Prague.
Two trucks collided there.
Drivers should go down just behind Brno at the 190th kilometre or go through Brno and then drive at the 182nd kilometre on the Ridilet.
It consists of several-kilometre columns.
There is also an accident on the D11 motorway, right at the arrival in Prague.
In Prague lies a several-centimeter layer of snow, the thermometers show minus seven degrees Celsius.
Columns of cars are created on Prosek, for example, and Štěrboholská is also clogged.
The surest means of transport is the metro.
Trams run late, for example, on the line between Charles Square and the Peace Square.
At 8 a.m. the Prague Emergency Staff is to be re-run.
There are also problems with railways and airports.
Czech Railways has already had to cancel seven express trains due to the snow.
For example, the line from Prague to Kralup or from Prague to Beroun has problems.
Passengers should check the current situation.
Ruzyne Airport was closed from 11 a.m. at night until 5 a.m. to 5 a.m.
Most roads in southern Moravia are already passable, but only with increased caution.
Three side roads are impassable in Vyškov, snow is forming in places in Brno and snow chains are needed to climb some roads in higher places.
The most affected places included Vyškovsko.
There are still closed roads: Rousínov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Kučerov and also Šaratice - Milešovice.
They will need to be put on with cutters.
When they will be cleared, it is not yet possible to estimate.
In Hodonín, caution is needed in the area of the White Carpathians.
On the roads, which are only maintained there for conservation by inert sprinklers, there is up to a five-centimetre layer of snow, the Czech News Agency reported.
In the Czech Republic, from two to ten centimetres of snow fell, falling the most in northern Bohemia, often up to 18 centimetres.
The Moravian-Silesian Region received about 15 centimetres of snow.
The snowfall in the Czech Republic is gradually ceasing.
American soldiers have a new "smart weapon"
The U.S. military deployed a new "smart" weapon in Afghanistan, known only as the XM-25 so far.
The generals hope that the new automatic rifle will affect the conflict with the Taliban there and "change the game" in their favor.
A new weapon is like a little super-accidental cannon.
Its projectiles are guided by a laser with an accuracy of several meters.
The 25 mm special cartridges, developed for this rifle and containing a highly explosive explosive, effectively act as small grenades.
The embankments can be programmed by exploding not only when they hit the target, but at any point of their ballistic path.
They can therefore be used against an enemy hiding behind an obstacle, behind a wall or in a trenga.
He is not usually protected from above, and when the deadly rain of steel shrapnel is brought down on him, it can be taken out of the fight.
According to Richard Audett, who was involved in the development of the XM-25, the new rifle is the first weapon for infantry to use "smart" technology.
"The soldier basically treats it by finding the target, sends a laser beam to it to determine the distance, so he gets a specified intentional point, adjusts the icing and pulls the tap."
"Let's say you measured 543 meters."
"When you pull the trigger, the gun is charged and detonates the missile at a range of 543 meters, plus or minus one, two, or three metres," Audette said.
It will relocate 400 jobs
Fujitsu will move its branch from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
400 employees will move their post in July next year from the existing office building to Marienbader-Nace in Bad Homburg to Astro Park.
The Japanese concern Fujitsu will move its branch from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As the industry specialist in computers and maintenance specialists in the field on Wednesday, 400 men and women will move their job from the existing office building to the existing office building at the Marienbader-Setling in Bad Homburg to Astro Park, a large administrative complex in Lyon Street, a part of Frankfurt called Niederrad.
According to a Fujista spokesperson, another 100 more 100 jobs of the concern, which are so far divided in the region, should be moved there in the foreseeable future.
The offer of the lease was said to be very attractive and the large-size offices in Astro Park are said to be more suited to the working method of employees.
Also in Bad Homburg, Fujitsu was only in rent.
Competent agent Bernd Wagner said, "We have found a central headquarters in Frankfurt-Niederrad with excellent infrastructure."
Excellent connection to the airport is very important for a global company like Fujitsu.
The recent move of an important business within the region drew joy for the winners and the disappointment of the losers yesterday.
The head of economic officer in Frankfurt, Markus Frank (CDU), said that this had thus succeeded in acquiring a "global player."
It is said to be a "fantastic show of confidence in this locality."
Fujitsu is said to be suited to the city, settling is an important boost for Niederrad.
The mayor of Bad Homburg, Michael Korwisi (Greens), regretted Fujitsu's decision.
The city was said to have been informed by the company's management in a timely manner of his intention.
"Of course we offered the company our help," Korwis said.
But the friendly contacts could not change the difficulties of the computer manufacturer with the landlord of the property on Marienbader-Navid Square.
As a result, economic reasons were decisive.
It is now about preventing a long non-admission in such a prominent place.
"I hope the owner and landlord of the building will be cooperative."
The Rathaus-Squet House, which has been used by Fujitsu so far, and the neighbouring "Kleine Vertikale" were among the most discussed building projects of the spa town, together with the other buildings on the Marienbader-Nace.
It was created between the station and the town hall as a joint project of the city and a private designer of the so-called city entree, which was criticised both for the massive construction of the areas that had previously served as a car park and also because of the height of the buildings.
In 2001, investment consultancy and ratings company Feri, a manufacturer of travel distribution systems software, Start Amadeus, moved into the homes, as well as computer manufacturer Fujitsu, which was then affiliated with Siemens.
The buildings used by Fujitsu were jointly acquired in 2006 by the Frankfurter Deutsche Immobilien-Chancen-Gruppe and Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund, and after a year the Spanish Falcon Real Estate Investments SA were sold in Madrid.
The Fujitsu-Concern from Tokyo is the third largest IT-provider in the world.
It offers computers and servers available to companies, for example, and also takes care of the necessary service.
The Rhine and Main Hotel is one of the largest in Germany, but Fujitsu's most employees are in Munich.
A subsidiary of Fujitsu Technology Solutions is moving from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt-Niederrad, other subsidiaries in this location will be Fujitsu Services and a company called TDS.
The Astro Park administration building has been leased to this end by 7,000 square metres.
In the complex - his name draws attention to the star plan, which is twenty years old, which is based, among others, the central association of the electronics and electronics industry.
Amazon shuts down server - threats against Assange
Wikileaks is getting into a tight spot.
Amazon's Internet service has turned off the detection platform on its servers.
It is possible that this was done in political pressure after the release of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic dispatches.
The founder of Wikileaks, Assange, is reportedly staying in the UK.
Wikileaks, the unveiling platform, is coming under increasing pressure in the United States.
Online activists have lost access to their previous home site in America and are now looking for an internet home in Europe.
Meanwhile, prominent U.S. Senator Joe Lieberman called on other countries and businesses to boycott Wikileaks.
And Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, who is listed on the wanted list of Interpol, is to be delayed by a newspaper post in the UK.
"Wikileaks is no longer on Amazon."
"Free speech in the country of the Free," the activists told the publication of the Facebook News service on Wednesday (local time).
Shortly before, the online company, Amazon, downloaded Wikileaks' documents from its servers.
Online activists used the Amazon Web Service (AWS) to publish secret diplomatic dispatches to handle the high number of access to documents.
Using Twitter, Wikileaks explained to this move: "Fine - our dollars will now be spent by employing people in Europe."
With Amazon having such problems with freedom of expression, "then they should stop selling books."
Amazon stopped using its servers for Wikileaks after Senator Joe Lieberman's associates were said to have made a search, CNN reported based on information from Lieberman's office.
The chairman of the Senate Home Defence Committee threatened to boycott Amazon, the British "Guardian" reported.
"I would have liked Amazon to take this step earlier, given the earlier disclosure of classified information at Wikileaks," the senator said.
Meanwhile, Lieberman has called for the platform to be prevented from using the servers in other countries.
"Wikileaks acts illegally, outrageously and recklessly, and thus our national security is put at risk and threatens life on the entire planet," a statement from the nonpartisan senator said.
"No responsible firm - either American or foreign - should help Wikileaks in their efforts to expand the stolen material."
The founder of Wikileaks, Assange, who is wanted by the Swedish authorities on suspicion of rape, is on the list wanted by Interpol.
A report from London's "The Independent" resides the 39-year-old Australian in the UK, with Scotland Yard also knowing the exact location.
An online activist has always called the investigation in Sweden the intrigue of his opponents.
Wikileaks spokesman Kristinn Hrafnsson said in London that there were also threats.
"There were even calls to assassinate Julian Assange."
That's why Assange is right to worry about his safety, Hrafnsson said.
That's why the founder of Wikileaks will continue to hide.
Hrafnsson was apparently responding to statements from North America.
In America, the former Republican governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, asked that the person responsible for the publication at Wikileaks for the betrayal be charged and executed.
In Canada, a senior government adviser, Stephen Harper, said on television - probably ironically, Assange should be "murdered" and Obama could use a "target aircraft."
Meanwhile, a verbal altercation was unleashed between the White House and Assange.
US President Barack Obama's spokesman, Robert Gibbs, called it "ridiculous and absurd" for Assange's request to resign from Secretary of State Hillary Clinton if she was responsible for the recently released espionage calls to diplomats.
"I'm not quite sure why we're interested in the opinion of one person with the website," Gibbs said.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are far more significant than its website."
The US government is now extensively examining the security of its databanks.
A special commissioner was appointed deputy director of the Center for Anti-Iterorist Measures, Russell Travers, the White House said.
Travers has become responsible for developing the "needed structure reforms" required following the publication of the reports from the Embassy at Wikileaks.
The White House also wants to review the ways in which the entire government exchanges and protects information.
The US government also announced that it wanted to take care of the safety of dissidents and activists if they were to be put in danger because of the publication on Wikileaks.
"We have made all our business to come into contact with them," said State Department spokesman Philip Crowley.
"We are ready to protect them if necessary."
Ice cream university
At "Gelato University" at Bologna, ice cream winners are preparing for a better season.
There is great interest in the basic course for future ice cream makers, which lasts for three days, and visitors come from all over the world.
Where does the ice-cream come from, anyway?
Gelatiere and Gelataio.
Gelatiere, a slightly outdated ice cream maker, makes cream by all the rules of Italian ice cream.
Gelataio takes the ice cream out of the cooling booth with a spatula, wipes it off in a waferle, and sells it.
To find out, you don't have to go to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But who wants to learn even more about ice cream, one cannot avoid the "Gelato-University" of the Italian company Carpigiani.
In 2003, he set up an ice cream machine manufacturer with an ice cream university to match the ice cream from its machines to all square high Italian ideals.
There is huge interest in the base course for the future Gelatieri, which lasts for three days, and visitors come from all over the world.
But there are also several days of special courses on chocolate ice cream and a practice in your own ice cream parlor.
Some yearn for a new career in their Midlife-Crisis, others venture to the thin ice of their vague desires.
This time it is 40 participants from 19 countries of all continents - from Brazil to Hungary to Saudi Arabia.
Jacky, an art teacher from California, loves the movement of Slow-Food and would like to offer a quality European product in the country of the industrial Ice-Cream in the future.
Anke from Berlin is a business consultant and would like to start something of her own after years of stressful work.
Two young Egyptians dream of opening an ice-cream plant in Kair.
One man from Malta and one from Brazil want to improve the quality of ice cream in their bars - and the Canadian housewife in the home of Julia came because her children love Italian ice cream.
Maestro-Gelatiere Luciano Ferrari first explains the ideal features of the perfect ice cream to the participants.
The crucial thing is not only good taste, but also silky softness and good consistency.
Luciano will not forget the Southern and Patriotic Cherry on the cake during her training: "The Italian Gelato is simply the best - and then a good dose of romance."
The first step of production seems to be quite simple.
Luciano puts the basic ingredients in milk, whipped cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilisers in a large blender that heats everything up to 85 degrees with an electronic program and then immediately cools to four stages.
Then he turns the faucet on the machine and leans out the pasteurized white base cream, the base of all kinds of milk ice cream.
Immediately, the docent is filled with questions: Is it possible to make ice cream only from natural substances without a stabilizer?
How can one experiment alone?
Luciano warns to be carried away by the spirit of the time into the unknown.
Those who speak of ice cream "only from natural ingredients" apparently used stabilisers anyway - mostly a natural product, such as guar flour from guar beans from the grains.
Of course, it is possible to make ice cream without stabilisers, but it has to be sold in one day, otherwise it will collide and the customer is all ice grains.
Some variations of the basic mass are allowed.
It will be more exciting with aromatic essences.
Maestro Luciano distinguishes the taste of ice cream according to ingredients that are bought at the supermarket in either the fruit department or the sweets department.
In addition, there are pills and creams.
"The dividers will try to impose a lot of aromatised ingredients on you."
"But you should simply experiment."
Be with fruit sorbets with sugar and fresh fruit.
Or with white base-grade ice cream, which turns the eggs into yellow cream and cocoa to the base for all sorts of chocolate temptations.
Now the participant is allowed to the course for ice cream machines.
Luciano has them always made by four different types of vanilla, chocolate, coffee and hazelnut ice cream - either with or without eggs in the base mass, with a more or less vanilla flavour or other natural ingredients.
The same experiment will be conducted with the fruit types of ice cream.
More aromatic substances, more fruit puree - due to the taste it is not always better.
Listo-saline ice cream doesn't have to taste more hazelnut when it contains more hazelnuts.
The most popular kiwi ice cream will be made by a group that will use more fruit, less water and a little less stabilizer.
Only when the balanced mixture highlights the taste of Gelato correctly, says Luciano.
Making ice cream is a purely numerical task: If peach puree with a lot of sugar is used, the share of sugar in the basic recipe must be reduced.
Lemon ice cream requires an extra portion of sugar.
Luciano takes out the device to determine the sugar content of the fruit (winemakers thus measure the must of the grapes).
Fortunately, the tables are relieving the numbers.
Making ice cream no longer requires as much physical exertion as before.
It is not only aided by the device for the automatic production of basic matter.
There is also a device that simultaneously spans the finished ice cream into the cream and cools to the minus temperature.
Despite all the automation, we can't avoid small accidents.
Brazilian Gustavo gets himself dirty and his colleagues from top to bottom with a fruit puree when a huge mixer gets out of control.
"In every course," Maestro Luciano believes, "it's only a matter of time before something like this happens."
Reviewers in a double light
The European Food Authority, Efsa, is intertwined with an industry that is experimenting with genetic plants.
This accusation has now been made by a group of experts Testbiotech, which is considered an independent institute for the aftermath of biotechnology.
"It's like a conspiratorial theory, but we've documented it well," Testbiotech chief Christoph Then said in Munich on Wednesday.
The head of the Efsa expert group for the genthyn-changed plants, Harry Kuiper, and another Efsa expert have been under contract with the Ilsi lobbyists' union for several years.
It is funded by concerns such as Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer.
Kuiper was a decisive contributor to the Efsa control regulations for genetic plants, standing in a clear conflict of interest, he criticizes the Then.
The Efsa regulations are said to agree in whole paragraphs with the documents of the Ils, and thus carry the manuscript of the industry, which should be controlled by the office in Parma, Italy.
This is the second time that Testbiotech has highlighted the conflict of interest.
Recently, the senior executive moved from Efsa without additions or transitional times to the Swiss agrirant concern, Syngenta - and in doing so she changed the parties.
Also, the Central Germany (MDR) radio radio recently revealed the EU-regional control office's personnel links with the industry lobby, raising the interest of both the Ministry of the Environment and EU MEPs.
In the meantime, Efsa cannot discern a conflict of interest.
It works with all the serious data, i.e. those from industry, if they are of high-level quality, is mentioned in one statement.
Experts who work for Epso are not required to have contacts with the industry.
But they must be substantiated.
Kuiper admits his work for the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the US.
It is itself referred to as a neutral forum of experts in science, industry and politics - among other things, for estimating the risk of biotechnology without a contract by a lobbyist.
Independent experts such as the Then criticise the fact that currently permitted gentechnically altered plants are in animals without any attempt at feeding, and that the response of genetic plants to environmental influences is not tested.
"We want to know what the gentled-unaltered corn in the field will do, for example," says the Then.
Current practice is merely to test isolated proteins and not the entire genetic plant, which does not provide reliable results.
"If they're not looking for risks, how would it be possible to find them then?", the Then asks the lawsuit.
Angelika Hilbeck agrees with that.
The science expert has been studying gentenika since 1994 and is currently working at the Technical University in Zurich.
In this area, industry, as in the US, is now increasingly influencing or discrediting critical scientists in Europe.
That is why there are almost no scientists who are no longer connected to the concerns.
Most of the time, studies that are critical of companies are not published.
"The industry is reviewing security research," believes Hilbeck.
Footprints of stones
Uli Gsell also bought some, a total of about 400 kilograms.
On Monday night, he was standing in front of the station in Stuttgart, a tube on his back.
There was a demonstration.
It was snowing.
The story is known: In September, the backhots arrived and began to tear down a large piece of the north wing.
The world in Stuttgart was no longer the same: Thousands demonstrated against the S21, a billion-dollar reduction in the railway station.
When the construction was stopped, most of the wings were in ruins.
Broken to 6,000, 7,000.
The limestone of Crailsheim, a soft rough stone that was used in 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a sculptor in Ostfildern, 43.
He secured several of these pieces.
"These stones are relics."
"He mustn't disappear."
Heas outbreaks: "A low and poor stone, simple and primordial."
When one cut it open, he smelled of cigarette smoke.
What he'll do with the pieces, he doesn't know yet.
Stones have time.
Uli Gsell, too.
The Stuttgart Stone Track leads to the forest at Tübingen to the former deponia of the French army ammunition, where Manuel Rongen built his stone empire.
The 44-year-old is a trader dealing with old rocks.
He bought all that was created during the demolition in Stuttgart.
"It would be a shame if they were to grind to the gravel or disappeared to the deponium," he says in his office, a wooden booth that was previously a guardhouse.
He tells us that he was being sworn in and threatened when, in September, it said in the newspaper that he had bought the remains of the northern wing from the company that was demolished.
But he spoke to opponents of the S-21 for days.
And he explained to them that he was not to blame for the demolition at all.
And when it's happening, it's most sensible when the stones continue to be used.
Then took in about 200 S-21-open singers each of the roughly 80 kilograms heavy block, the price for a piece of 6.50 to 14 euros.
As a memory, some also in the hope of returning it in rebuilding.
Rongen bought 500 tons, a cargo of 25 large trucks.
About half of them are still in the woods, the rest sold long ago.
Gardeners, landscape gardeners, home builders.
They came from all corners and pulled back what came in the trunk and the trailer trailer.
The stems of the Stuttgart dispute have long since been turned into "widows" or as the edges of herb beds.
"This stone is actually nothing special," says Rongen.
"If it weren't for the political interlude."
He gets into his SUV and goes for a ride in his 20-hectare kingdom.
He studied law first, interrupted his studies, later biology, then took an interest in computers, and eventually became a stone trader.
And a lover of stones.
It has stored 400,000 tons of stones.
He's tying his treasures from all over Germany.
He says he's the biggest old-treater trader in the Republic.
Brake.
In the snow lies the artistically worked sandstone.
"Once belonged to Marien-bone in Dresden," he tells us.
The sandstone from the Elbe, yellow, warm, is thrilled.
"My favorite stone."
We're going on the way up through the woods.
It points to a pile: a red sandstone, formerly part of the railway station in Karlsruhe.
And then.
"Here travertine."
Once, the blocks belonged to the stands of the Neckarstadion in Stuttgart.
Everywhere in the snow lies rocks and stories, Cannstatt-travertin from the police presidium in Stuttgart, the red granite from the temple of Sankt Blasien, tuf from the hospital in Heilbronn.
What jobs, what an effort, what a sweat.
When Rongen thinks of how the stones were first broken down by hand and transported by means of simple hoist chicks and bull wagons, he becomes completely respectful.
"It would be a scandal if something like this was crushed."
He didn't become rich, not very rich.
But the stone trader now employs 14 people, and in addition, the stonemasons, one sculptor, one blacksmith, one glassmaker and a gardener have settled up in the forest.
"We work hard, but it's satisfying," says the one who evaluates the remorse.
They must go to Cologne for the foreseeable future.
There, too, will be rescued by rocks.
Talent Fight for High-Potencials
There's a lot of people at the snack.
16 students are crowded with sandwiches with salmon, tomato soups and sweets.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and the carmaker Volkswagen invited students to the engineering and design students for a workshop.
Together with the developers of VW, they are here to talk about the car of the future - and, by the way, to spot Volkswagen.
Many companies are trying to win the smartest heads at the plant, as well as VW, to succeed and bet on cooperation with universities.
Their mission is: Recruit the most gifted graduates in the auditoriums as soon as possible, before they reach the job market and are interested in others.
Since universities do not issue any lists of success for their students, companies are trying to discover and earn exceptional talent in and get from practice-oriented projects.
At TU Braunschweig, the automotive concern is trying to win the talent for the next day.
One young lady from the personal department handles out pens, gummy bears and VW logs.
He tells promising young talentes about programs on practice, student jobs and hints at them for trips to the group.
Nico Selle of TU Braunschweig takes care of the project with VW.
They see the benefits for both sides: "Students come into contact with the industry and gain experience."
"The VW can simultaneously get to know the students, get to know the interesting candidates, and think about who would be suitable as an associate."
Such co-ops, according to Selle, are not uncommon.
But the news is that it is so openly fought for students.
"Otherwise, there was more of a substantial professional project," says Selle.
The fight for fresh graduates is about to be even tougher.
In many industries, companies can no longer choose their staff from long crowds of applicants.
Instead, it must strive to try and to attract a particularly highly skilled workforce.
In particular, engineering graduates have an excellent bargaining position.
According to data from the Union of German Engineers of the VDI, 40,000 civil engineering positions remained vacant in October.
And according to VDI forecasts, the so-called shortage of engineers will grow.
For the audit and consulting firm KPMG, Roman Dykta goes to talent theaters.
Organizes the demanding Recruiting-events, such as. KPMG-Race, a kind of modern treasure reserve in which participants must find their way according to the GPS coordinates.
The company plans to send eight promising students around the US next year.
Participants can also view KPMG branches and get acquainted with the company.
He will decide in advance in two selection rounds to see who will participate.
Only Crème de la Crème, of the many candidates, will fly to the US.
In the battle for High Potentials at the universities, the increasingly harshy laws will apply, according to Dyctu.
"We want to distinguish ourselves from the others with our Race."
"A simple trip on a sailboat was too little for us."
It seems that the talent scorer Dykta is lucky.
"We stayed in touch with all participants in a similar event last year."
"Some will soon be finishing their studies and are planning to apply for a job," he says.
In addition to direct appealing on campus, small and medium-sized companies are presented classically in the labour markets.
"We try to contact graduates at scholarly exhibitions."
"As e.g. at Intersolar," says Sitha Stübe, head of personnel at the Solarworld, a solar equipment manufacturer.
The company from Bonn employs around 1,500 employees in Germany.
Stübe knows the issue with young workers.
Currently, there are 35 positions on the company's website.
"At the moment, it's just the trouble of filling vacancies."
"It costs a lot of time and money," he says.
Another option is to contact through professors at universities.
Solarworld works with various universities, such as the University of Freiberg.
"Professors inform us that it is possible to do a practice or write a thesis."
A solar specialist does not hold any expensive advertising events.
Instead, the company tries to attract other benefits: personal atmosphere, low hierarchy and light communication.
"The big concerns often can't offer it," says Stübe, head of the personal department.
In search of work, money has not played a major role for a long time.
Flexible working hours, caring for children or good practice options are other factors.
Solarworld took the 125th place among the top 100 employers in Germany in one study at the Great Place to Work.
The Institute is compiling an annual list of Germany's top employers.
In addition, it asks co-workers how satisfied they are with their work and the working environment and monitors the framework conditions of the employees.
Head of the personal department, Stübe, hopes that the placement will give her points with job seekers.
"I believe that those interested are particularly briefing on the external assessments of the potential employer," he says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler of the German Employer Branding Academy advises companies that want to build a long-term strategy of good repute as an employer.
He advises his customers to be more authentic.
And, according to Mr Kriegler, this means above all internal measures.
"The best way to make yourself visible as an attractive employer is through its own employees," he says.
It is technically called the internal Employer Branding, that is, the promotion of an employer to the market within its own employees.
"Satisfied staff are the best ambassadors."
When a company takes good care of its people and they identify with the company, then they advertise on their own to their employer among friends and acquaintances.
"This is like a string game," says Kriegler.
Obama stops new oil drilling
Over the coming years, new oil drilling will not be created in front of the US-wide Florida State in the Gulf of Mexico.
The government in Washington issued a corresponding ban - and thus definitively lifted earlier plans.
Also in front of the Atlantic coast, new wells are forbidden.
Interior Minister Ken Salazar made the announcement on Wednesday.
The reason for the strict ban, which should apply for at least the next five years, is an explosion at the "Deepwater Horizon" drill tower in April.
Prior to this disaster, which cost eleven employees to live and led to the biggest environmental disaster in the US, President Barack Obama, under pressure from the opposition and industry, signalled his willingness to allow new drilling in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico.
As a result, advocates are trying to reduce the US's dependence on foreign oil supplies.
To date, it is not clearly explained who is responsible for the devastating oil disaster in the bay.
The focus of the criticism is the British energetic concern BP, which is confronted with billion-dollar applications.
The Commission of Inquiry, commissioned by Obama, is expected to produce the results during December.
In October, Interior Minister Ken Salazar lifted the ban on drilling that had been in place since the explosion.
Subsequently, various oil concerns submitted applications for new drilling projects.
Obama and Salazar want to prevent a similar catastrophe from stricter controls and strict security regulations.
Currently, a fundamentally reforming the Audit Office is being reformed, drawing attention to itself with many corrupt accusations.
At the same time, Obama announced that he would lift the lucrative tax evasion options for oil and gas concerns.
Industry is now openly warning that stricter regulation will fundamentally shrink the volume of oil drilled in the Gulf.
"The government's plans are the biggest brake on the growth of the gas and oil industries," reads the result of the current survey by the consultancy firm BDO - before the drilling ban on Wednesday.
The American Energy Alliance, on top of that, complains of uncertainty in the field: "No one knows exactly what regulation will change."
Investments in new mining projects are being pushed until further notice - at the expense of growth.
The Ogoni region burned
The water in the rivers is oil-brown, it smells like a pump: billions of gallons of leaked oil have destroyed nature in the Ogoni region of Nigeria.
People steal, corruption and illegal oil cooking for a living.
Celestine Akpobari means well.
"Don't worry," an environmental activist reassures the journalists: "Today, you'll get a lot of oil mud in front of your lens."
The 37-year-old Nigerian watched an attempt to photograph a boy who waded through the chests through the smudges with smudges: the scene was in the aquatic sheen with the rainbow colors almost nicely.
The fact that brown rafts of oil floats under the surface is not visible.
Previously, she collected enough garnels in the containers, told by Esther Badom on the banks of the Bodo-Jetty River.
Meanwhile, the slow-flowing water became completely dead.
Five years ago, a large amount of oil spilled into a huge warm area from a broken line.
Fishermen from the nearby town of Bodo must paddle for at least six hours to reach the waters where there are fish: the Ogoni area, located in the heart of the Niger delta, is one of the worst-infest-infested areas in the world.
On the way down the mangroves' river with a lot of side tributaries, the entire runway is noticeable.
The boat engine boils brown mash instead of light water, and whoever immers his hand in the water pulls out the oil fingers.
The roots of mangroves towers rises from the ground like the black sticks of the lectures, the seldom occurring palm trees leave their leaves sadly hanging.
We search in vain for flocks of birds that are commonly found in damp areas: As soon as the engine dies down on a boat, it dissect in an earlier paradise where it smells like a pump's point of silence.
"What is happening here is the ecological conduct of warfare," says Celestine Akpobari sadly: "We live in constant fear of health."
Comparison with the war is justified.
The Ogoni Settlement Area is a battlefield where the fighting has been fought for several decades: more than 60 years ago, the first conquerors from Europe flocked here, where the first resistance with the later executed writer Ken Saro-Wiwa was formed in the 1980s, here the Shell Group had to stop its production in 1993, because it was too dangerous for the employees.
To this day, the company is not allowed to return to the Ogoni area: while the entire delta is mined daily from the delta region of sherter size of Switzerland with more than 5,000 mining drilling and 7,000 kilometres of running more than two million barrels of black gold, the oil fields in the Ogoni area lie fallow, the situation is too unstable for the group.
Every few hundred meters, the steel structure is towered from the water of the steel structure like bizarre sculptures: "Christmas trees," that's how little they call the heads of the drill holes.
They're 50 years old, most of them rusted to the marrift.
Every so often, the head of the drilling hole breaks, the Akpobari tells, and then a constant flow of oil flows into the water.
Experts estimate that more than two billion litres in the Delta ejected the Delta ecosystem: Every year, the amount of oil that leaked into the sea off Alaska in the "Exxon Valdez" super-tanker crash 21 years ago - one of the greatest environmental disasters in human history.
There are controversy over who is responsible for the continuing ecological disaster.
While Shell calls sabotage and organized oil theft at more than 90 percent of pollution, environmental protectionists talk about the crackling heads of wells and leaking lines as the main cause.
Shell requires far less safety regulations in Nigeria than is customary in the world, the Concern in 2008 accused US-American scientist Richard Steiner: Only the number of disruptions in the leadership is said to be "a multiple times higher than elsewhere."
In a place that looks from a distance like an abandoned, oil-soiled open-air workshop, a figure emerges from the mangroves: they are completely naked and up to their necks from oil.
Under one of the many barrels, which is partly connected by the line, partly arbitrarily scattered on the ground, fire burns: an illegal small refinery.
Oil heats up in a barrel over the fire for several hours, explains Michael, the group leader.
First, the line goes to the choking pot, then drips at the end of the kerosene management and finally diesel.
In this way, Michael and his four co-workers make up to four barrels a day for 300 litres: "We make about 34,000 Naira" - about $22.
The deltaite is taking advantage of a chronic fuel shortage in the largest oil nation in the largest oil nation in Black Africa.
Nigeria owns only one refinery.
A ridiculously low price of 40 cents of the euro per litre of diesel can still be beaten by illegal producers: because they have the raw material for free.
It comes from "bunker" who are joining the leadership everywhere in the Ogoni area: according to experts, at least 16 million litres of oil are lost to the land a day in the entire Niger delta region.
But only a negligibly small portion of the makeshift raw material is being treated illegally: the largest share will be filled by organized criminal networks, which include politicians and high-ranking military leaders, tankers, and sell it to the world market.
The debate on whether the people were a disaster and their interventions or a lax method of production is considered purely academic by the activist.
"If the oil companies didn't consider themselves aliens, and if they hadn't so thoroughly destroyed the life nature of the fishermen, then there would be no sabotage, nor theft and illegal refinery."
In the meantime, however, the Ogoni's relationship, above all, to Shell, is so damaged that only the departure of the congress is possible: "Perhaps other nations will turn out to be better for the Chinese."
Michael will be disturbed.
"Time to get lost," says the muscular manufacturer.
"The soldiers can come in any minute."
If a special military unit found them, they wouldn't be in danger of jail, but a painful bribe.
The soldiers, who mostly come from the north of the country - like all Nigerians - also want to profit from the raw material.
"The cursed thing has brought our country to the bottom in all respects," says Akpobari.
Investigators have discovered a dangerous construction flaw in the A380 engines
The A380 clearly has a major safety glitch.
Investigators found a possible building error during a search of the machine that made an emergency landing that could lead to a "catastrophic engine failure."
The airline Qantas wants to sue the engine manufacturer.
The passengers of the Qantas Airbus seemed to have had more luck at the emergency landing in early November than was previously known: the Australian Air Safety Board found a major safety fault with the engines of some of the A380s in its investigations - and is now warning of a possible building error.
Perhaps the defect would have severe consequences: there could be cracks on one oil connection due to wear and tear, a statement released by the ATSB was said this Thursday.
This could lead to a "disaster engine failure."
These are engines made by Rolls-Royce in 20 A380 aircraft.
Among them is the Qantas Airbus, which had to make an emergency landing in Singapore on 4 November.
The Australian airline has now taken legal action against the British turbine manufacturer.
It filed a statement of reasons for the action before the Australian Federal Court of Appeal in Sydney, which is permitted by further legal measures against the company.
The head of Qantas, Alan Joyce, said his company would seek compensation for the incident at the beginning of November.
During the engine fire, parts were released and they damaged the load-bearing surfaces.
Rolls-Royce has identified the burning oil as the cause of the damage.
After this event, up to 40 engines have to be replaced worldwide.
Australian investigators have announced that they will conduct further safety tests with the giant aircraft, which are equipped with the engines in question.
The safety recommendation is the result of cooperation with Rolls-Royce, said ATSB spokesman Martin Dolan.
The safety deficiency was considered important enough to inform all those concerned.
After the emergency landing of the Qantas, the airline left its A380 fleet on the ground for several weeks.
Singapore Airlines has temporarily left three of its eleven A380s on the ground.
Lufthansa replaced the engine with one A380 as a safety measure.
The two-story aircraft is the largest passenger aircraft in the world.
National snowfall will create chaos in traffic
Germany in all over white: it snowed almost all over the country overnight.
Chaos reign on many roads, trains and airplanes are jammed.
At least three people have died in traffic accidents.
Winter frosts Germany: almost the whole republic fell into place at the night of Thursday at the snow temperatures - leading to the chaos of the traffic in many places.
To the north and east, up to 15 centimetres of snow lies in some places.
There are heavily limited traffic on several motorways and many roads.
At the A7 at Flensburg, the road service was still in deployment, but it could not handle the newly blown snow.
On top of that, there was a strong gusty wind over the Baltic Sea.
The Federal Office for Navigation and Hydrography (BSH) expects a storm surge on the Baltic Sea coast in Schleswig-Holstein this morning with a water level of 1.2 metres above normal.
Snowdrive drifts have caused significant problems in Saxony on motorways and state-owned roads.
According to the Meteomedia bad weather headquarters, the level of alarm was therefore in Saxon Switzerland - the highest level ever.
In part, 30 centimetres of new snow fell, with drifts causing heavy and fresh winds.
There were several trucks and passenger cars left at night.
Also in Saxony-Anhalt, police authorities reported major difficulties on the roads.
The A2 was caused by wind and snow from slow operation and congestion.
There was trouble in Thuringia because of the snow on the A4 and A9.
According to the German Railways, major problems are occurring in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia and northern Bavaria.
The main problems are snow on the tracks, overturned trees on the tracks or broken upper lines and switches.
In Saxony, long-distance traffic from Leipzig to Nuremberg had to be halted.
In Jerusalem's Saalfeld, he had to stop an ICE to Munich.
165 passengers were on board on board from fire and rescue workers with wool dungeons, food and drink.
Snowy winds blew over the roads.
At major German airports, many flights were cancelled due to snow winds.
According to a spokeswoman for the flight information center, an overlapped flights have already been reported from Munich.
In Frankfurt, the Sea of Main has already been cancelled for 40 flights, according to a Fraport spokesperson.
Road maintenance is in constant use.
Although few passengers were left unlicenional at the airport, 400 field beds are prepared for them.
On many roads, accidents occurred as early as Wednesday evening.
In the evening, a lorry driver died in a collision with a train at a railway crossing in eastern Holstein.
The driver was slightly injured.
The snow-covered road caused a similar accident close to Nuremberg: a lorry was also caught on at a railway crossing as the vehicle was stuck.
The driver died.
Four passengers were injured on the train - the route from Bayreuth to Nuremberg remained closed until the early hours.
And a 30-year-old woman died after she rolled her car at Aschaffenburg's car on a slippery road.
But meteorologists have good news: the snow will remain in the form of light powder, which is why it will be lifted even with light glots of wind.
But the wind will weaken.
Only on the Baltic Sea will there be fast winds with a gale force.
But it will be very cold - locally to minus 15 degrees.
Deutsche Bank seeks buyers for twins-twins
Deutsche Bank wants to say goodbye to its mark: according to one newspaper post, the bank is looking for a buyer for two towers with offices at Frankfurt headquarters.
The property could raise up to 500 million euros.
Deutsche Bank had just renovated its headquarters: Twins' towers in Frankfurt's banking district were being upgraded; in the meantime, the bankers were allowed to see their old jobs again.
But now the financial concern seems to want the cost of renovation back again - and is looking for a buyer for both skyscrapers, as the "Financial Times Deutschland" reports, citing the spokesman.
The spokesman did not name the reasons for the planned sale.
"We are still investigating whether it is more meaningful to own or sell the property and then lease it again," he said.
This is again giving up its corporate headquarters to the largest credit institute in Germany after a short time.
The bank only took over the twins' towers in mid-2007 for €272 million from the investors of their own fund and subsequently renovated them expensively.
The energy redevelopment has swallowed around 200 million euros, according to the data.
Selling would probably bring a lot of money to the bank.
According to the newspaper text, industry experts estimate the value of the so-called topped towers to "Greentowers" at a price of around 500 million euros.
The spokesman said it was not decided whether the building would be sold back to the fund's assets or an independent investor.
Thousands mourning for the dead miners
More than 10,000 people honored the soured miners in New Zealand who were declared dead after several explosions in the mine.
It has still not been possible to rescue the dead, as the security situation remains complicated in the shaft.
Almost two weeks ago, there was a powerful explosion in Pike River Mine, near the city of Greymouth.
The 29 miners, aged between 17 and 62, were overwhelmed in the mine.
A probe was launched into the shaft where the disaster occurred, but found no trace of life.
Due to high concentrations of poisonous gases and subsequent explosions, the rescue forces were unable to descend for safety.
After the second strong detonation, the authorities and experts drew on the fact that the miners no longer had any chance of survival.
It still failed to be freed for the dead.
Now the memory of the dead has been honoured by relatives and friends.
In Greymouth, on the southern island of New Zealand, ten thousand people gathered in sunny weather.
They were two minutes quiet.
To commemorate the buried miners, 29 tables were built, with helmets, lanterns and the names of the miners.
Pictures and personal items, such as clothing and surfboards, have found their place here.
On state government buildings, flags flew at half-mast.
New Zealand had hoped that the miners would once again come to the surface from the "deep of the country," New Zealand Prime Minister John Key told attitagers.
"But they never came home."
He cannot say goodbye to his son until he saw his corpse, said Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was swamped in the mine.
In addition to the Prime Minister and relatives of the victims, the commemorative event was attended by several foreign diplomats.
During the explosion on 19 November, British and South African miners were also overwhelmed.
Rescuers began by extinguishing a fire inside a coal mine on the southern island of New Zealand.
Once the toxic gases are dissolved, the high temperatures are cooled inside the mine, police president Gary Knowles told journalists.
To hell, warriors!
Is a horror movie going to an art cinema?
Director Nicolas Winding Refn is attempting to re-run the old boundaries with his "Walhalla Rising" combat epic.
What audience did the Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn think when he shot "Walhalla Rising"?
A captured one-red-screen Viking fighter (Mads Mikkelsen) is free of himself from his tormentors and kills in a big way with almost the supernatural power of his opponents - it sounds ideal for young men's viewers looking for bloody action, because our hero helps himself with cruel killing methods, tearing even his enemies from his stomach alive when he is in a bad mood.
On the other hand, One-Eyed, as he is actually called, does not say a word during the whole film, and the other characters utter at most one or two sentences or be swayed to the harrowing dying screams.
Otherwise, they are silent and revel in the gruesome, hilly landscape of Scotland, which offers the backdrop to the Viking world about a thousand years ago.
The film is more ideal for adult cinema enthusiasts with an interest in existencialism and very quiet camera footage.
It's good when a movie has multiple target groups, it's just a shame when they're sorting out each other.
Director Winding Refn, after making his wild and stylized trilogy about drug dealers, "Pusher" is considered a Danish version by director Quentin Tarantino, but stoically resists to bring his works either to the mainstream's humor or less brutality to an artistic audience.
Most fans of the art cinema appear to be discouraged everywhere by spraying brain and guts.
Supporters of action films will be bored at the latest when the One-Eye goes for loosely explainable reasons with a group of violent Christian missionaries by boat to Jerusalem, and is left hanging in a clear air and fog for an eternity before the team appears to reach America and remain silent there.
It is no wonder, then, that the "Walhalla Rising" did not make it to theaters in Germany and has now only been released on DVD.
It's a pity mainly because of the wonderful shots, but also because behind the distinctive facade, in places to the cranky blood, it hides an exciting cinema that deserved a bit of attention.
This film is not about dialogue or the exact plot, everything is an atmosphere, a feverish dream that has become a film.
And that's not for the viewer to escape.
Refn will not give him a moment of release and slowly chokes him with his chilling footage and a grim hypnotic soundtrack, but above all, indescribable hatred that is said to sting from the hearts of the characters.
Only a little blond boy who helps the One-Eye keeps something like innocence, everyone else is driven by malice.
Of all the most one-eyed hero, whose motifs are never explained, who will become, in time, a warrior from hell for enemies and temporary allies, perhaps the emissary.
It portrays destruction, but perhaps also only for the corrupt.
"Walhalla Rising" is a mysterious film that can be hated and admired, for angry, excitement and admiration.
Experience.
Mysterious groundwork
The IAEA has new alerts to the secret nuclear program in Syria.
But the country resists expression - and will not allow controls.
Around midnight on September 5, 2007, at least four Israeli F-15 warplanes will attack the mysterious square building in Syria.
It is on the banks of the Euphrat; the nearest major city is 30 kilometres away and is called Dair as-Saur.
In the documents of the International Office for Nuclear Energy (IAEA), her name appears when it is a reactor allegedly built by Syria with the help of North Korea in this square hidden in a valley that turns away from the current.
Following a U.S. CIA foreign intelligence note from the US-American Secret Service in late April 2008, the reactor, also known as the nearby village of el-Kibar, would be well suited to make plutonium - from which nuclear weapons could be built.
The 1950s technique is not suitable for anything else.
The CIA presented a video of unfocused satellite images.
Using computer animation, it explained where which reactor components might have been before the destruction were, it was to be a scaled-down copy of the Yongbyon nuclear nuclear center model.
In addition, there were also photographs presented that showed the building up close or even from the inside.
The reactor was said to be shortly before the launch, but still without fuel cells.
Today, after more than three years after the bombing, little is known for more than it was then, even the riddles have grown even bigger over time.
Earlier US-President George W. Bush recently disclosed in his memoir that the CIA was very sure before the attack that Syria was building a reactor in an el-Kibar, but it did not have the evidence that there was an "active nuclear weapons program" in the country.
Some intelligence retreats in Europe are even more cautious and talk only of a "allegal reactor," even if they view the CIA presentation "currently."
They lack clear evidence, as does the IAEA.
When asked how he was sure he had a reactor in front of him, a senior UN diplomat replied in the summer, the IAEA said "a sufficient material to ask questions."
The harvest of the supposedly "unused military building" was quickly cleared away by the Syrians and also properly aligned the terrain.
Nevertheless, the IAEA team was found in June 2008 under the leadership of former chief inspector Olli Heinonen in the el-Kibar of the Uranium Track, which was made by humans.
In addition, the IAEA received satellite photographs of commercial vendors via a member state from just after the attack, which should be more apt than those presented by the CIA.
Unfortunately, these shots are not on the market because they were exclusively bought by an unknown customer - perhaps Israel.
The IAEA cannot therefore confirm their authenticity.
Syria has always claimed that it has never had a secret nuclear program and has not built a reactor.
Uranus is from Israeli weapons, Damascus has commented.
But this was refuted by the IAEA after the particle analysis.
Since then, Damascus has refused to discuss the matter - as well as the satellite footage.
In addition, it banned the auditors from a second inspection in the el-Kibar and access to the debris of the bombed-out building.
But Israel is also stubbornly silent.
"We will never comment," the ruling Prime Minister Ehud Olmert recently confirmed the official position at the time.
The investigation into this case has thus dragged on to no avail since June 2008, and has "grown into a serious problem given the credibility of the office," as a senior Western diplomat at the IAEA's headquarters in Vienna has admitted - a serious breach of the Nuclear Weapons Treaty oversees by the IAEA.
The IAEA sees the next three devices to be the "in-functional connection" with the alleged reactor - and, unlike it, they still exist.
The auditors have not yet stated, nor which equipment is involved, or what their function or why they are suspected.
According to the Süddeutsche Zeitung newspaper, the IAEA internally refers to them as Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayayah, again derived from nearby cities.
The Independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (Isis) identified these objects and found a building complex that is believed to be one of the suspicious objects in satellite imagery.
It appears to be inside or in the immediate vicinity of a military base - for that reason, that is why Syria rejects the IAEA's access to these three places.
In Vienna, it was said that the Syrians were afraid of a so-called fishing expedition - that the IAEA would be sent to the US to track down military bases.
Nuclear detectives were alerted to the facility by the US Secret Service.
The IAEA has the paperwork, as well as satellite images, that material was transported back and forth between these three seats and a square at Euphrate.
In Vienna, a senior Western diplomat said that at least one furnished should be "in connection with fuel production."
But there are no "no evidence of sensitical activities," i.e. enrichment of uranium and new processing; the processes necessary for the production of nuclear weapons.
The reactor type is powered by uranium, which is not enriched.
But where the uranium came from, and where it should later be the plumplatonium for the bomb, with only likely estimates of these central questions.
It is also unknown whether the debris that could hide important clues are kept in these three places.
As if the hundreds of cargo trucks had been lost from the face of the Earth, no one seemed to have information about where the debauge had gone.
Only a few kilometres from the el-Colibe, distant and on the other side of the Euphrat, located by the al-Tibni salt mine, which Syria had inspected in 1998 as a suitable warehouse for radioactive waste, is considered unlikely by the IAEA.
Earlier IAEA inspector Robert Kelley put it in a connection with a reactor in one satellite image analysis for the renowned Jane's Intelligence Review.
But images from space show that after the IAEA demanded access, Syria carried out groundworks at all suspicious sites and removed large containers.
It could have been a coincidence, but it didn't help to clear up the suspicions.
In addition, diplomatic circles speak of the fact that the IAEA has spent many months creating a plan for auditors that would allow Syria to preserve any military secrets - only that effort shows how much the interest of auditors is.
Meanwhile, Damascus rejected this proposal.
If, just a year ago, Western diplomats in Vienna were reassuring that the reactor was being destroyed after all, and therefore the matter was not burning, for months, US Ambassador Glyn Davies has been talking about so-called special inspections, one of the harshest funds the Vienna Nuclear Authority has to enforce controls.
The head of the IAEA, Yukiya Amano, who would have to propose inspections, has already spoken of the "option to which I am leaning in the future," but has so far hesitated.
This choice places a great risk: On the one hand, it takes a majority in the IAEA Governing Board, and many of the 35 countries represented are certainly not interested in escalating.
On the other hand, as one diplomat points out: "What happens if they don't find anything in the end?"
Love in a Time of War
Since Angelina Jolie started working on the still-name directorial initial in the summer, there has been trouble.
She wrote the script herself, a love story of a woman from Bosnia and a man from Serbia.
Much more is not yet known - but this, too, causes restlessness.
There has been a persistent conversation that the woman, who is a Muslim, falls in love with the Serbian man who raped her during the war in Yugoslavia.
The Bosnian women's associations protested at once, so the planned filming from Sarajevo to Hungary in a hurry moved from Sarajevo.
The film, meanwhile, has been taped to the film in Hungary and is in post-production, but there are still protests in Bosnian.
Bakira Hasecic of the Women's War Detection wrote Jolie via UN-Organization to help refugees, UNHCR, requesting a meeting with the actress, the Bosnian newspaper reported now - Jolie is also the UN-organization ambassador for the help of refugees.
It is not exactly diplomatic - she offered women a meeting in Hungary weeks ago, but they refused to do so.
The meetings must take place in Bosnia, Hasecic said.
There were no love stories in the campsites where the rape was made, and Jolie's attitude toward the victims reveals a lot about the script.
Her organization has therefore recommended the UN-organisation to help refugees release Jolie as ambassador, reports the Guardian.
What scenes did Jolie write exactly?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which received its script to be read, allowed filming after minor wrangling in Sarajevo - it is not entirely clear why Jolie did not come after all.
The young author stresses that she does not follow any political intentions in her film, that she has devoted herself to the conflict in Yugoslavia with great effort, that she wants to show the terrible consequences of the war and give space to all the parties involved.
Given the contents, it remains vague.
There is another version of the film circulating on the internet that sounds really quite different: the lovers knew each other before the war and meet again when she, like a Bosnian Muslim woman, is brought to a Serbian campsite, where he serves as a guardian.
Which really sounds a lot different than "a victim of rape falls in love with his tormentor."
The fact that Jolie's film is really starting before the war - is true.
Jolie argues that there is pressure on her, which is "not fair and based on faulty information."
Now she can be freed by the hecklers of Hollywood: By posting her script on the internet illegally, as they have done many times before.
Nothing but gone
This evening is good again for the Irish.
No sign of grief.
The home team dominates power significantly over its guests from Sweden, Finland and the USA.
Fans roar with joy to the sound of loud music, stamp their feet.
Bailey-Pub is boiling in Cork, South Ireland, as players throw tennis balls at a distance of three metres into beer cups - and hit.
"Beer Pong" is called bizarre theater and can be won 500 euros as a winning bonus, plus a ticket to Las Vegas at the World Beer Pong Championships in January.
Cian Tanner is a calm type; this shouted beer game and a restrained computer scientist doesn't really match.
Still, the 26-year-old man is trying to entertain, to unwind from the plight of what the future will bring.
His plan is not a playing passion in Las Vegas, he goes to an interview in New Zealand in January.
"I have a strange feeling about this," he says.
"It's so far away and I don't have a job there yet."
Still: His girlfriend is already waiting for him in Auckland - "she has immediately acquired her dream job as an Eventmanager, perhaps a good sign," says the young man, smiling.
Due to bad prospects at home, two of the Tanner's three siblings have attempted their luck abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sydney, his brother Colin now has a place as an IT-adviser in London.
The boys leave: As with the Tanners, it looks like in many families on the island.
The 100,000 Irish will leave the country in the foreseeable future, predicts experts at the ESRI's scientific institute for the Economics and Social Affairs in Dublin.
They even count on 200,000 emigrants by 2015.
For such a small country with only 4.5 million inhabitants, this is a major loss.
If the forecasts are confirmed, there will be a similar expassing wave to the one that Ireland suffered in the 1980s.
After a decade of the rise that brought great prosperity to the Irish, discomfort is now once again expanding.
The economic crisis is particularly unsettling the young, educated Irish, who have only experienced a rise so far.
Losing a job and a social descent seemed absurd to be a boom in these years.
Everyone needed to be needed, the money was in short supply.
In the meantime, however, three of the ten women and men under 30 are out of work.
There are many letters from readers in the Irish Times who complain: "Everything's going downhill in Ireland."
"There should be an uprising against politicians and bankers - but whoever can, he goes away and our country is losing a generation."
"Please let the last one go out."
Law student Leanne Caulfield, president of the Irish Student Union, sees the future in black because the government is said to be merely deceiving and offering no prospects for the future for young people.
"They are cutting the minimum wage, but they have no strategy to create new jobs," says the 20-year-old.
She watches her classmates dive in from one unpaid practice to the next.
Her biggest concern is that she will have to move out on her own in four years.
"This thought is sad and depressing."
Men like Stephen McLarnon are trying to see the subject positively.
McLarnon organizes "WorkingAbroadExpo," an exhibition that offers a full service on the topic of work abroad.
"For job-boomers, jobseekers abroad are an excellent chance to take the first steps on the rankings of a career," says the manager.
His website shows photographs of surfers in Australia and snowboard skiers in Canada.
The message is clear: Working abroad is not the galleys, but freedom and joy.
Seán O'Donovan has known about what it's like to build something somewhere else for six months.
As the 29-year-old engineer had no work in Ireland, he is now employed with 15 Irish colleagues at a construction site in Germany.
He's building a fashion house in Gelsenkirchen.
In January, it continues to Hanover or Berlin for the next project.
O'Donovan, meanwhile, rarely gets home because he works in extra shifts to pay off a home loan at home.
"The situation is sometimes really a bit crazy," she says, as she crosses the threshold of her own house for the first time in a long time.
"I make money in Germany for a house in Ireland that I'm basically not at all."
He laughs awkwardly and walks through the cooled rooms.
The small house is in a good neighborhood with well-maintained gardens, with large expensive cars parked in the entrance.
O'Donovan bought the house with his sister four years ago for 380,000 euros - 100 percent funded by a loan.
"It was a crazy time, simple money was without many questions," he says.
Is he worried that the loan might not turn out well?
O'Donovan thinks for a while, hot tea is coming down, and he says, "I don't have children to feed and I'm young; even if things go wrong, I can start all over again."
The Construction Engineer doesn't like the moaning hears so often now.
"No one has to starve - our situation is not even as dramatic as it used to on this island," he says.
"It's not the worst thing that can happen for a while - maybe we'll just feel like the Irish after."
He laughs and then tells of his father, who left for England in the last economic crisis.
"After seven years, he was back again, and life went on in Ireland, quite simply."
Cian Tanner likes this idea.
To have an open future and simply wait for life to evolve elsewhere.
He has also had several years of work in London, and why shouldn't it be good for him and his girlfriend in New Zealand as well?
But there is one more thing that is of concern to him these days: his 27th birthday party in Dublin on Friday.
She's afraid she might get hurt to the farewell party.
"Especially no emotion," he says, having a good drink of beer.
"Goodbye, that sounds disturbing."
"Let's put in the celebration of the departure, quite simply, with a few friends, a few drinks, a few games."
The standard practice of democracy
Democracy support for democracy in Latin America is growing, as is the promotion of private enterprise.
Criminal activity is more concerned than unemployment.
And Brazil is considered more influential by the United States to be of more influence.
These are some of the results of the current Latinobarómetro survey, which took place in 18 countries and was published exclusively in The Economist.
As the survey has been held regularly since 1995, it can thus follow changes in attitudes across the whole area.
This year's survey, which took place in September and early October, is dominated by two related items.
The first is that Latin America is in a rather cheerful mood.
The second is to increase the stability of attitudes towards democracy and its key institutions.
Democracy support in several countries on the outskirts of the Pacific in South America has increased significantly (see Table 1).
For example, in Peru, where economic growth averages 6% per year from 2002, democracy support has grown from a low of 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
It also rose in Mexico, where economics was recovering after a deep decline in production last year.
But only around half of those surveyed in Mexico and Brazil, the two most populous areas, are convinced by Democrats, which is pulling the regional average (see Chart 2).
About 44% of respondents across the whole area expressed satisfaction with the way in their country of democracy works in practice, it is the same figure as last year, but compared to 2001, when it was 25%, a large increase (Figure 3).
Roughly 34% said they trusted the Diet in their country and 45% trusted the government, again the same figures as last year, but it is a big difference compared to 2003 (17% and 24%).
Ten years ago, democracy was undermined by the economic crisis in Latin America.
Support was created during the global financial crisis probably because many Latin American countries suffered only a short recession and enjoyed a strong recovery.
In addition, a stronger social security network has helped protect poor people.
(The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America announced this week that the Latin American population living in poverty ratio had risen only marginally in 2009 and fell to 32% again this year.)
But the mood is changing in a wide range from country to country (see chart 4).
Brazil's strong economic performance and the popularity of its outgoing president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, are reflected in the broad-naked sense of progress.
This situation is scarceier in Mexico and Central America, where the recession was more serious and the state of violent crime deteriorated.
It is only for the second time since the surveys began to be conducted that more respondents across Latin America see crime as the most important problem than unemployment (see Chart 5).
Roughly 31% say that either they or their close relatives were the victims of crime last year, but that is a decrease compared to the 38% figure of last year and is also the lowest figure since 1995.
More massive economic performance is reflected in the growing support for private enterprise and the market economy: about 71% of respondents across the sector say that private business is essential for development, a percentage of 56% in 2007 (see Chart 6).
About 58% agree that a market economy is the only system that will allow their country to develop, a percentage that has grown from 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of respondents in Venezuela have the same view (and 80% there support private business), even though their left-wing president, Hugo Chávez, expropriates many private firms.
Brazil is a country that has a leading position in the region, as 19% of respondents mentioned (compared to 18% last year), followed by the United States (9%, unchanged from last year) and Venezuela (9%, compared to 11% last year)
However, the United States is considered the most influential country by respondents in Mexico and in much of Central America, with Venezuela enjoying success in Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
Criticized elections
No one expected the general election in Haiti on 28 November to be perfect.
But they were far worse than the outsiders, who are trying to help the affected country to be afraid.
The election meant filling-up urns and repetitive voting, ballots scattered across the sewers, broken polling stations and intimidation.
Polling stations open after hours of delay.
Many Haitians, including many moved for the January earthquake, were roaming around, trying to find out where to vote.
Some of them gave up in the end.
More than ten presidential candidates, including several presumed preliminary presences, shouted that it was a hoax and called for the election to be cancelled.
The protests, some of them of a violent nature, spread across the country.
Still, Edmond Mulet, a high-ranking UN official in Haiti, said that "it was a pretty good election in many ways."
Observers from the Organization of U.S. States States and the Caribbean Community cautiously said that "they do not believe that these irregularities, however serious, did not necessarily have to cancel the process."
In other words, the show continues.
The electoral body, whose opposition votes are beholdled by René Préval, the unpopular outgoing president and his candidate, Jude Célestin, is scheduled to give preliminary results on 7 December.
The expected deciding contest is scheduled for January.
All electoral hopes are not lost.
Two leading opposition candidates, Michel Martelly, rapper and Mirlande Manigat, the former first lady, have withdrawn from their original call to declare invalid the vote.
But the problem may arise if Mr Cesle, who has little or negligible support among the electorate, is described by the electoral commission as having achieved a decisive contest.
The rampaging outbreak of cholera and the more than 1 million people still living in tents after the quake were concerned that turnout would be low.
In the end, many of the Haitians wanted to vote, but because of their disorganization, they were prevented from doing so.
The roughly 250,000 identity cards necessary for the vote remained undistributed shortly before the election.
There's a lot to bet.
Donors see the choice of a legitimate and popular government as a crucial step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
And it is clear, then, that the Haitians will work for this on their own.
After tiptoe to the center
In the weeks when she was suddenly widowed, Cristina Fernández, the president of Argentina, is benefiting from public sympathy, when her popularity boosted from 20 to more than 50%, the highest level since she was elected in 2007.
Yet the reversal of this success in a successful campaign for a second term in next year's elections may depend on whether the grieving Mrs. Fernández gives up the uncompromisingness of her late husband, predecessor and political partner, Néstor Kirchner.
And on these signs, everything will be based.
Mr. Kirchner, who continued economic policy after his wife successfully became president, was in the habit of compiling budgets that underestimated tax revenues, economic growth, and inflation.
This allowed the first couple to spend additional income at will.
Mrs. Fernández's government lost its majority in Congress last year.
But the opposition split and was further destabilized in Mr. Kirchner's death for a heart attack on 27. October.
Some members of the ruling Peronist political movement joined Ms. Fernández.
But after chaotic sessions (on which were slapped and blamed on the government for corruption), Congress failed to approve the 2011 budget.
"I'm not going to argue," the president said.
The 2010 budget will now also be in place for next year, with the president having more room to spend at will.
The economy is overheating: up to 9% is likely to grow this year.
The official inflation rate is now at 11.1%, but many private estimates and trade unionists are talking about a figure approaching 30%.
Mr Kirchner, who took office in 2003, when Argentina was plagued by economic collapse, made it a priority for growth and poverty reduction rather than to control inflation.
He refused to deal with the IMF, burdened the private sector and purified the INDEC, a statistical agency that agreed to monitor the official inflation statistics.
Can President Fernández now moderate this policy?
It called for negotiations between private businesses and trade union leaders.
And its officials say they want to limit wage growth to 18% next year.
The economy was supported by rising world prices for the export of Argentine agricultural products.
But inflation was disrupted by growth based on a major devaluation in 2002.
This may be why President Fernández is showing that she wants to renew Argentina's financial ties to the rest of the world.
Earlier this year, the government formed an agreement with bondholders who had previously refused to restructure the debt that Argentina failed to pay in 2001.
Now, President Fernández faces an agreement with the creditor governments grouped together at the Paris Club, to which she owes around $6.7 billion.
Kirchners always insisted that this fact be in the IMF's sight, as usual.
But last month, Amado Boudou, the Economy Minister, announced that the fund would provide "technical assistance" to design a new national consumer-card index to commemorate the introduction to the INDEC purification.
It is not yet clear whether President Fernández will want to remain in politics after the end of her term of office when the husband is no longer by her side.
If he wants to stay, he needs to get the support of the middle class, which is tired of kirchnerism.
At the time of the Argentines' return from their summer holiday in March, the wave of sympathy will be in decline.
If she wants to win another election, she will have to decide whether it will be necessary to quietly renounce the many views her husband has held in politics.
Half-avoils for China
The Taiwanese electorate is closer to a closer connection to the mainland.
What does Taiwan think of its big brother across the sea?
More than 7.5 million voters, 70% of those eligible, voted on 27 November for the city's mayors and the city council in five districts, which may be seen as a broader assessment by President Ma Ying-jea.
President Ma himself is a representative of the feelings that prevail for the mainland and have a strong set-up in business relations, including the partly free trade agreement, in the greatest straightening of relations with China since 1949.
President Ma passed the test, but only narrowly.
Although his Kuomintang (KMT) party ended in winning three of the mayor's five offices, it failed to win by a majority of the vote.
In addition, the Democratic Progressive Party, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which is in favor of Taiwan's greater independence, won nearly 50% of the total vote against 45% of the KMT party.
If this were a presidential election, President Ma would be in trouble.
Since he was elected two years ago, his party's vote has fallen by around 8%.
The DPP was the first party, together with KMT, on the city councils.
The election took place like most of the Taiwanese elections, which include noisy electoral trucks and mass rallies with flags with scinable-clad girls.
It was even included a mandatory mysterious assassination attempt.
Sean Lien, the son of Lien Chan, honorary chairman of the KMT, was agitating for the KMT candidates on the eve of the election.
A man from the crowd shot young Mr. Len cleanly over the face, wounding him and killing the viewer.
It was not bizarrely determined whether the militant intended to injure Mr. Lien or settle a dispute with the candidate.
In any case, Tsai Ing-wen, the DPP's leading, claims that the shooting affected the election, suspicions are on the DPP and leading voters towards KMT.
Perhaps the only big winner of the campaign was China.
It was remarkable how the question of the land itself remained in the background.
Instead, the candidates were wrestling over plans for state housing and job creation.
Taiwan is usually enjoying its de facto independence and hates the military threats of China.
So KMT tends to avoid ties to the government in Beijing.
But this time, the DPP also abandoned the uproar of anti-Chinese attitudes.
It is a response to the fact and realisation that Chinese trade is crucial to Taiwan's economic survival.
President Ma for his party has confirmed that China's policy is acceptable to most of Taiwan.
The government in Beijing can be expected to continue with commercial bribes, along with his strategy, to lure Taiwan back to the herd.
China wasted no time in sending a negotiator to Taipei to arrange an investment protection and medical cooperation summit.
They would also like to see political integration, too, but in the rank.
This will be better to wait for after the 2012 presidential election.
In any case, the DPP party discovered itself.
Two years ago, she was at the wrong level: her former leader, Chen Shui-bian, was sent to prison on corruption charges.
The president in 2000-08 was a rebeller and a champion of clear independence.
But under the leadership of Ms Tsai, a new generation has evolved, and the DPP is working hard to attract experts and young people.
Ms Tsai was proclaimed as a DPP candidate for president, such as Su Tseng-ang, who held the office under Mr. Chen.
Their party is now doing their best to show that they can also work with Beijing.
Ms Tsai has published plans for research institutes serving as a contact point between the DPP and China, provided that their negotiations can be conducted without prior conditions.
Ms Tsai is telling the Taiwanese public that her party represents a "credible alternative" to Mr Ma's hasty approach to China.
Mr. Chen seems to be angry with this shift.
In a statement issued from his cell, he expressed the opinion that the DPP's candidates would have done better to insist that Taiwan was a separate country.
He even ordered Mr. Su, the pragmatist, not to run for president.
But even without Mr. Chen's intervention, the DPP will fight for a choice between potential candidates.
KMT is justified in finding its own people.
Mr Ma's assessments were poor, despite the rapid pace of economic growth; the KMT candidates did not want to go to the campaign with him.
His unpopularity seems to be based mainly on unemployment and a widening gap between the rich and the poor.
A KMT spokesperson says he will reorganise his cabinet, as well as the local branches.
The heavily championed proposals to support Taiwan for the establishment of friendly contacts are limited.
At the same time, most Taiwanese citizens consider economic integration with China to be inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent columnist, "the point from which there is no return has passed."
Grammy nomination: Jazz singer Esperanza Spalding is a surprise in the category of best new artist
Speaking at the request of the president and people are bound to be noticed.
Esperanza Spalding, a 26-year-old jazz bass player and singer chosen by President Obama to perform at the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize ceremony, is described as one of the surprises of the Grammy Awards this year with a nomination for the best new artist.
Since Spalding was a glorified figure on the jazz scene since her album "Esperanza" was released in 2008, the nomination came a little late, but it's in line with the Grammy rules, when the artist must not release more than three albums before "the public identity of the artist is established."
Her ambitious 2010 album "Chamber Music Society" has certainly taken a step forward, and thanks to her carefree vocal style and a nimble hand with elements of pop, funk and Latin influences, we can talk about Spalding as the success of Norah Jones, the earliest equivalent for the Grammy voting in this category in recent years.
Elsewhere Grammy judges rightly award the album Vijay Iyer Trio "Historicity" in the instrumental album category, an exciting, refreshing ride of the album, which was the hot favourite last year.
Iyer will compete against the album by veteran saxophonist James Moody's "Moody 4B" and keyboardist John Beasley's "Positoottle."
Trombone Shorty, the hoarse favorite from New Orleans and a frequent guest on HBO's "Treme" was awarded in the current jazz category, which is otherwise in favor of Stanley Clark, John McLaughlin and Jeff Lorber's albums.
Darcy's James Argue's Secret Society, with a knowledge of steampunk, has received some well-deserved acclaim in the category of major ensembles, with the chamber jazz Childs Ensemble in competition and the still-bred Dave Holland, whose live album with the "Pathways" octet created a beautiful example of how a bassist can have a free hand as a bandleader.
Grammy Awards nominations: Michael Daugherty, Steve Mackey lead the classic music category
The nominations for classical music have a wide range of musicians and composers from around the world at the 53rd Annual Grammy Awards.
The leading position in the nomination is held by Michael Daugherty and his "Deus Ex Machina" for the piano and orchestra, with a score of five points and Steve Mackey with his album "Dreamhouse," an eclectic orchestral work, with a score of three points.
Among the nominees with a link to Southern California, Estonian composer Arvo Pärt and his Symphony No. 4 "Los Angeles," a work commissioned through the Los Angeles Philharmonic and debuted at the Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
The composer, based in L.A. Avner Dorman and his Mandolin Concerto also have a shot at the award.
Nominations in classical music are divided into 13 categories, which include orchestral, opera, choral and solo recordings.
The category for classical music producer of the year has five nominees, which are Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin, and James Mallinson.
The nomination for the classic album was won by Bruckner and his Symfonie No. 3 a 4 from the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra; Daugherty and his "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" by the Nashville Symphony Orchestra; Steven Mackey and his "Dreamhouse" project from the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; "Sacrificium - the Art of the Castrati" listing various artists; and Verdi's "Requiem" by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Chorus.
As far as the opera category is concerned, the nominees are Berg and "Lulu" by the Orchestra of the Royal Opera House; Adolf Hasse and "Marc Antonio e Cleopatra" by Ars Lyrica Houston; Kaija Saaria and "L'Amour de Loin" by the Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin; Rodion Shchedrin and "The Enchanted Wanderer" by the Orchestra and Chorus of the Mariinsky Theatre; and Arthur Sullivan and "Ivanhoe" by the BBC National Orchestra of Wales.
Among the composers nominated for the Grammy for contemporary compositions are Pärt for Symphony No. 4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina," Hans Werner Henze for the "Appassionatamente Plus," Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Enchanted Wanderer."
Pärt's Symphony No. It premiered at Disney Hall in January of 2009 for a performance that was recorded by L.A. Philharmonic under the baton of Esa-Pekka Salonen.
The approximately 30-minute episode is called "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to former oil tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who is imprisoned in Russia.
Dorman and "Mandolin Concerto" were nominated for the instrumental performance of a soloist with an orchestra.
The composer of L.A. said he had written a 15-minute work specifically for the mandolin performer Avi Avital, who performed at a concert with Metropolis Ensemble based in New York.
"I wrote it using tones from the Middle East and many North African rhythms," Dorman said in a telephone interview.
Conductor Pierre Boulez, 85, received a nomination in the orchestral performance category, for leading the Chicago Symphony in the recording of the work of Stravinsky.
The instrumental soloists who received the nomination include pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin; the organist Paul Jacobs; the violinist Julia Fischer; and the harpist Sarah Schuster Ericsson.
Only women were represented among the nominees by vocal soloists this year, with Anne Sofie Von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucia Duchon, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the category of transition of the classic, soprano Jessy Norman received a nomination for her recording "Roots - My Life, My Song."
Scheduled mosque in Temecule receives approval of the Planning Commission
The planned mosque in Temecule received unanimous support from the local planning committee after more than five hours of an of often passionate public testimony.
Critics have attacked the project for promoting terrorism and leading to the suspension of trade.
However, the judges decided on Wednesday night that the new religious center was in accordance with the local laws and would be aesthetically impressive.
"Many good people came to support this project - the Christians, the Jews, who do you remember," said Hadi Nael, chairman of the Islamic Center in Temecula Valley, on Thursday morning.
"I'm very proud of that as an American citizen."
"It implies that justice always wins."
"The opposition is minimal" he added.
"Those who oppose merely shout out loudly."
"We have really good people in our valley."
The meeting began at six o'clock in the evening and lasted until almost midnight, when most of the time was taken up by discussions with people who were in favour or against the center. These voices were evenly divided, the Press-Enterprise says.
The discussion continued on the newspaper's website.
"There is no more America," appeared one comment.
"We are the Planet of the Apes with the Statue of Liberty sunk in the sand."
"America has fallen."
The planned Islamic Centres also sparked protests in other parts of the country, including proximity to Ground Zero, the site of the tragedy that took place on September 11, 2001, when New York was attacked by terrorists.
In Temecula Valley Imam Mahmoud Harmoush condemned the violence.
His religious community of around 135 families was plagued in Riverside County for years without incident, but he wanted a larger and more suitable space than the storage space he rented with the filter system manufacturer.
The new 3,5 24,943-square-foot mosque in the Mediterranean style of architecture will also have two minarets and will grow to a height of 43 feet.
It should take up a 4.32-acre space on Nicolas Road, approximately three kilometres east of the Chaparral High School.
Opponents can still appeal to the city council on the project.
Microbes with resistance to arsenic increase the possibility of new types of life on Earth or elsewhere
The discovery of a strange bacterium that can use arsenic as one of its nutrients extends the space to find new forms of life on Earth, and perhaps beyond.
Researchers have discovered an unusual bacterium here on Earth, claiming that this is a sign that life has options that stand outside the main elements that have been considered and basic.
"This organism has a dual ability."
"It can grow either because of phosphorus or arsenic."
"This fact is very strange, but it is not proof that this is a form of truly 'Automilic' life,' Paul C commented on the fact. W. Davies of Arizona State University, co-author of the report, which appeared Thursday in the online edition of Science.
For a long time, six main elements were considered necessary to live - carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulfur.
However, scientists have found that the bacteria, discovered in Mono Lake, California, are able to continue to grow after phosphorus is replaced by the arsenic.
"It will start to astonish you of all that is possible," said Ariel D. Anbar of Arizona State University, co-author of the report.
This find is significant for the search for life outside the Earth, because researchers must be able to recognize life and know what life might look like, Anbar said.
The study focuses on the microbes found on Earth.
However, the news release to discuss it, which did not reveal details of the find, sparked widespread speculation online that the report reveals the discovery of extraterrestrial life.
This is not the case.
The discovery "shows that other planetary organisms may be able to use other elements that propel biochemistry and that a set of elements that we consider 'standard' may not be so absolutely necessary for life," explained Charles Cockell, a professor at the Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute, Open University, at Milton Keynes, United Kingdom.
Cockell was not a part of the research team.
"This work is unusual because it shows the replacement of one element with another in the basic biochemical and biochemical structure," added Cockell.
It wasn't a random find.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of NASA's Astrobiology Institute, which conducted the study, focused on Mono Lake for showing high arsenic levels.
Arsenic and phosphorus are chemically very similar elements, so she considered that the microbe, which is exposed to both elements, may be able to be substituted for one after another.
"Arzen is poisonous mainly because his chemical behavior is very similar to phosphorus."
"The result is that organisms can very hardly separate these elements from each other."
"However, the arsenic is so different that it doesn't work, like phosphorus. When he gets into the organism, he starts working in biochemical processes," Anbar explained.
Scientists are gathering bacteria known as GFAJ-1 and exposing them to the increasing concentration of arsenic that the bacteria are able to adapt and to grow.
Microbes grow better when phosphorous is applied, but as they can also survive with an arsenic replacement, the possibility of the life-form used by arsenic is increasing, rising naturally, either elsewhere on Earth or on another planet or a month where arsenic is more common.
Jamie S. Foster, an assistant professor at microbiology at the University of Florida, said the idea of an arsenic that could be replaced by phosphorus was not new, but there was never an example on which to prove the fact.
Arsenic was more common in earlier times on Earth, she said, and so scientists speculated that it could have been used by earlier life forms.
"This suggests that there may have been other ways to create life, not just the way it was created in the early Earth," said Foster, who was not part of the Wolfe-Simon research team.
The research was supported by NASA, the Ministry of Energy and the National Institute of Health
The remaining stolen dogs were found in Compton
The other two of the four showy dogs that had been stolen from the Bellflower Motel were found. The sheriff of the Los Angeles area reported Thursday.
Four showwalk dogs - two Akits and the Welsh Pembroke corgis - disappeared on Tuesday when the Chevrolet Express van was stolen in 2006, in which they spent the night at the Bellflower 6 Motel, the authorities said.
Two dogs were discovered on Wednesday afternoon and the other two dogs then late on Wednesday night, said Steve Whitmore, a spokesman for the Los Angeles County Police Department.
"The good news is that the dogs are fine," Whitmore said.
"They're in good shape."
"They were handed over to their rightful owners."
Whitmore declined to say exactly where the dogs were found, in what location, nor did he share detailed information about finding them.
"The investigation is still ongoing."
"We don't want to talk about it," Whitmore said.
"We follow the rules."
Dog owners, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, were not caught up in the case.
They were very pleased when their two Akits were found at the Downey shelter on Wednesday afternoon.
The sheriff's representatives found the van and two dogs separately in Compton.
Akity Trace, a three-year-old dog Trace and a 10-month-old dog Didi, were unhurt, the authorities said.
But Bunny and Peter, the Welsh Corgi Pembroke Rickard and Peek, who had planned to participate in this week's regional competitions on behalf of their Japanese owners, remained unhumbled until their discovery late Wednesday.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, are in town this weekend to participate in the AKC/Eukanuba National Championship at Long Beach, where they planned to show off Trace.
The other dogs were to compete in other competitions, scheduled for the AKC/Eukanuba show in the days before the AKC/Eukanuba show, Peek told The Times on Wednesday.
Southern California is only one stop for the couple's nearly monthly travel in dog shows.
On Monday night, Peek and Rickard registered for the motel.
They often sleep in motels and park their car in front of the room window.
They also took three dogs - a pork-in boxer, a Parson Russell Terrier and a Breton Hound - who stayed with them in the motel room.
The Akits and the Pembroke Welsh corgis were left in the car, where it should have been cooler.
They opened the windows a little to get the dogs in the car plenty of fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported the car theft at 6 a.m. on Tuesday.
Peek said he would offer a reward to anyone who would lead them to the missing dogs. Dogs are implanted with microchips to identify them.
On Thursday, it was not clear whether the prizes would be awarded.
The lion is ready to yell again now that the MGM restructuring gains final approval from the court
After 18 months of tremors and insecurity, MGM finally got the green light to start over.
On Thursday, the federal insolvency judge in New York officially blessed the creditors' "pre-currenuated" plan to settle about $5 billion in debt to clear the trip for the 86-year-old entertainment company that focuses on the production and production of movies and TV shows.
Thursday's decree that the plan meets the requirements of the U.S. bankruptcy order does not leave MGM with any legal obstacles to relaunch by Spyglass Entertainment founder Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, who will become the lead leaders of the downsied studio.
The number of employees will fall to about 320 from the original more than 400.
MGM will not emerge suddenly from Chapter1 until JPMorgan Chase agrees on the planned financial resources to allow a loan of $500 million to be funded by new operations and MGM productions.
It is now a merger with an investment bank that needs $75 million on its own and funding is expected around mid-December.
The restructuring process of study began in May 2009, when investment bank Moelis & Co. was hired to advise management on how to resolve its finances, as management struggled to afford interest payments of $300 million a year.
That August, Chairman Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, the former CEO of Enron and the Rate Expert, known for his work for Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Attempts by Moelis and Cooper to resolve the financial difficulties of MGM and 140 of the studio's creditors took much longer than expected.
After several months of discussion, the parties agreed to put the company up for sale at the end of 2009.
Although the auction attracted several bidders, none of them were willing to pay US$2 billion plus the funding demanded by the creditors.
In the spring of this year, everything was back on the drawing board and the MGM team started working on the restructuring plan. After months of discussions and internal disagreements, the plan was eventually approved by the creditors in late October.
When MGM officially rises out of bankruptcy in the coming weeks, Moelise and Cooper will receive multimillion dollar bonuses in dollars for their work.
Moelis & Co., which has already received $1.2 million, will receive a payment of $9.5 million.
Cooper's companies, which collect $375,000 a month for their services that govern the company's run, $375,000 a month, will receive a $4 million reward for the so-called "success fee."
Barber and Birnbaum plan to resume production at MGM, which released only one film this year and put together a design for seven or eight films that will be released in early 2012.
They also plan to participate in the financing of two films, the model of which will be the book "Hobit," together with Warner Bros.
The studio needs to arrange a special loan between $265 million and $275 million to fund its share of these two films, which will be directed by Peter Jackson.
Investor Carl Icahn, who owns approximately 18% of MGM's debts, was looking for the possibility of a merger of the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, in which he is the largest shareholder.
However, the recent negotiations between the two companies did not result in an agreement.
The technology toys that will keep your gift budget in balance
The leading candidate this year is the most amazing toy iPad, followed by a video game system. In both cases, however, this is a significant hit to the gift budget.
Consider that for the price of one iPad you can buy five BMX bikes for $99 and one game Kinect costs as well as 10 bead jakes or approximately 48 Play-Doh cups.
But there is a way to keep your budget in balance for gifts.
I recently visited three national toy retailers - Wal-Mart, Toys "R" Us and BJ's Wholesale Club - and watched what electronic toys I could buy for less than $80.
It was immediately clear that Moore's Law was in place; this year's technology toys had far more energy, at the same prices, if not slightly lower, compared to previous years.
While there have been relatively fewer new new toe-to-kind toys with associated sites, the two most famous toys of this type, Webkinz and Club Penguin, offer more.
The number of toys with button batteries is increasing, as are the charging toy toys.
Here are some references.
(All the aforementioned prices are from Toys "R" Us, except in cases which are indicated differently.)
Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, 13$, 3 years old) are stuffed animals that sing when you squeeze their tummy.
At one press, the pet makes a note and the other squeeze begins to form a song.
If you buy more than one, they will sing together and harmoniously.
Warning: Once you start squeezing, you can't stop.
The best choice in the combination of singing and dancing is Dance Star Mickey (Fisher-Price, $60, 2 years)
Last year, I rented a 14-inch animatrox doll on Elmo Live technology, which can play the game Simon Says and can also walk a month-long walk thanks to its innovative folding leg with wheel blocking.
Children are testing the Mickey Dance Instructor's toy, though their parents complain about the lack of volume control.
If you're an '80s child, you might think of Alphie, one of the first computer educational toys.
He's back, (Hasbro/Playskool, $40, for children from the age of 3), with a backpack full of quiety cards that are designed to be turned into fun with a self-corriitable, funny workbook.
If you're eyeing a smartphone for your child, here are three independent alternatives.
VTech's MobiGo ($60, for children from 3 to 8 years) is the cheapest option with simple use, with qwerty keyboard, although games do not have as effective tutorials as the Leapster Explorer ($70 for children from 3 to 12 years old), the first major change of Leapster series by Leapfrog, with a newer and brighter display.
No version is compatible with the older units.
iXL by Fisher-Price ($90, for children aged 3 to 7 years) uses the iTunes-like system to introduce games and e-books and has an SD card slot that allows you to view family photos.
And finally, Scrabble Flash ($$$, Hasbro, for kids 8) is a set of five cubes that's no bigger than a matchbox, each with an LED display.
The goal is to create words by placing the dice in a series before the time runs out; it's great for competing in improvised language creation.
More toys have at least some kind of online connection.
To the highest extent, two toys Webkinz and the Club Penguin were represented in toy stores.
If you want to buy your child an online toy from the Club Penguin, you can choose for example the Disney Club Penguin 2" Mix 'N Match Figure Pack, 5$, for children from 6 to 12), which contains a coin with a hidden code.
When you activate the online code, your child receives enough credits at the Club Penguin store on any two items.
This could include, for example, roller skates or a Puffle pet.
A little bigger than your toothbrush bristle bristle bristle bristles is a Hexbug Nano (10$, for children from 5 years old), the latest in a range of microrobots on a button battery.
The beetle moves quickly on 12 vibrating silicone legs in a random direction.
It's fun when you make a maze out of cubes and watch to see if he can find a way out.
It is also very resilient.
Ours was able to fall down with the kitchen table and spend even some time in the mouth of our dog.
Introducing a more subtle police check in China
As a city military instructor, Tang Shenbin walked around the square, strictly controlled his orders, and gave orders in a low voice with military authority.
He wanted female members - Chinese sturdy enforcer of the city order, feared and despised for their hard-working interventions and a penchant for violence - to convey some impression on a cluster of standing bystanders.
"Stand up straight!"
"Hurry!"
Show them, she whispers softly, "how pretty girls look!"
Four very young girls wearing white gloves and the same olive coats and trousers came to attention.
Four pairs of black shoes are sorted by a ruler.
Four headgear perfectly fits on the hair, which are perfectly bound by blue and white ribbons.
"Personally, I think they look average," Mr. Tang said dismissively.
"The men are nice."
More than one government has tried to revive the image of the city's guards in China.
One city ordered the new conscripts to have a college degree.
Guangdong province turned gray-green uniforms into a supposedly more appealing blue.
Wuhan replaced the stares of heavy weaponry in central China: in 2009, one report said that 50 officers had been adamantly surrounded by a snack cart and stared at the owner until the door-to-door salesman packed up and left after half an hour.
Xindu, the city district of 680,000 in Chengdu, chose the operation as the main picture.
Since 2003, the district has added 13 women to its municipal police, who have been selected specifically to their appearance, symmetry and young age.
The aim is to show, in addition to the rough side of the police, a more subtle, female side.
Unfortunately, even Scarlett Johansson herself would be in trouble to get into secret Chinese urban groups.
The critics would argue for a good reason.
Unlike the police, these officers are only allowed to enforce the city ordinance, impose fines and other administrative penalties.
But the Chinese media routinely capture a different reality.
In January 2008, police inspectors from Hubei province bludgeoned the detached viewer to death after using his cell phone to film, as they act in the crackdown in the crackdown.
Last year, the training of police officers in Beijing took place, the manual for this training was stolen and placed on the internet. The manual included a description of how to effectively beat up the perpetrator with no blood sign.
This year, a peddling meloner in Shanghai got into a brawl with five police officers and suffered injuries to the left side of his brain.
One video game full of violence, which can be downloaded online, depicts Chinese police officers attacking street retailers.
"Chengguan frightened the government," China's Daily, the national edition, wailing last year after another discussion about the tactics.
The paper said "really thoroughly purification."
Skeptics say such an approach is not enough.
After the district advertised interest in eight new female female police officers in October, The Beijing Evening News was an editorial about whether women had real duties or were merely a distraction.
The answer seems to be a little bit of both.
The district requested female applicants between the ages of 18 and 22 with a good physique and "five facial features in the right proportions."
Adepts should have a height higher than the diameter - higher than 1.6 metres.
Retirement at the age of 26 is compulsory.
Officials say the job is mentally too demanding for women over 25.
"Their image is an important thing," an unnamed police officer said on Rednet.com, as a government website.
"Candidates must first demonstrate the external qualities that then determine others, which are among them height, weight, facial features, etc."
Then comes the character and "internal quality."
Women are like flower vases, he said, adding, "In addition to being vases, they will also have other responsibilities."
Zheng Lihua, the deputy director of the district town's management, disagrees with this description.
But he pointed out that height requirements are also common in China for other jobs, for both sexes.
As is the requirement for the coagent facial features.
Which means that the issue of good looks is the subject of discussion among the Chinese.
Disabled or mutilation will certainly not apply.
"He can't allow a lame or hump man to serve with us," Mr. Zheng said.
"His image wouldn't be good."
Liu Yi, who keeps the patrol in Baoguang Square near the monastery, has 22 years old, faces like apples and a finely shaped mouth.
She did not think the emphasis on her appearance could be sexist, she said.
"Do you think I look sexy in this uniform?" she asked with an ironic look.
Her co-worker with pads, 21-year-old Xu Yang says "Our task is to represent the city image."
They have no objection to their limited performance, they said, because their career ambitions are greater than merely waving traders into the aisles where they can do their business.
Each morning, the group stands against the more than ten market-makers who are running around on foot or on bikes, trying to sell as many dumplings and tofu bowls as possible before being banished.
"Mr. Wang, you must leave."
"We've told you this many times!" said Miss Xu as the merchant started running, and left his wheel with a noodle cart for a time.
Police officers describe their duties as more monotonous than strenuous.
"Every day it's basically the same thing," said Huang Jing, 20, who is studying marketing on her off-time.
"Big routine."
One reason is that female policewomen do not have the powers of their male counterparts to confiscate the merchandise.
They can only threaten to report the fact to their male leaders.
The tendency is to then protect them from the sudden public displays of hostility against the official apparatus, which are common throughout China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in Kunming, Yunnan, rebelled after false rumors of police officers killing a vendor were spreading about police officers killing a vendor.
More than ten police officers or police officers were injured in the night hours; 14 government vehicles were overturned or set on fire.
Xindu has so far escaped such violence.
But peace can hardly be guaranteed.
Only two blocks from the quiet Baoguang Square, where the policewomen were on patrol that morning, had gathered at the corner of the street.
Officers seized a motorcycle that was being repaired on the sidewalk instead of inside the shop, as required by the regulations.
The bike owner could cry like he wanted.
15 minutes' left in front of the cops, looking angry, with his elbows on the vehicles, and quickly away with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, the coordinator affiliated with the male group, stayed behind, his white badge turning to hide his name.
Like female police officers, the coordinators are men over 40 who already have only an auxiliary role.
Unlike them, they are not educated in the maintenance and smoothness of the image.
"Sometimes we fight verbally."
"Sometimes we fight physically," Mr. Li said matter-of-factly.
"Most of it's the public that starts with it."
Prosecutors won't accuse Senator Ensign sign
Prosecutors at the Justice Department cleared Senator John Ensign for the criminal charges on his affair with a former campaign adviser and his efforts to secure the lobby, the senator's lawyers announced on Wednesday.
The decision ends the most serious legal threat that Mr. Ensign, a Nevada Republican, has faced, and which, until the time of the scandal, has been regarded as a possible Republican presidential candidate for the year 2012. His affair went into national headlines and damaged his career.
Mr. Ensignton's office said he was "certainly pleased with the decision that followed almost a yearlong investigation."
The senator could still face disciplinary action at the Senate Ethics Committee.
Mr. Ensign's lawyers said that the Justice Department "informed us that Senator Ensign would no longer be the target of the investigation and that there was no plan to press charges against him in this matter."
The Ministry of Justice declined to comment on the case.
The decision came as a surprise to many ethics lawyers outside the Justice Department who argued that there was serious evidence that Mr. Ensign was preparing to violate the ban on federal lobbying.
Interviews, e-mails and other documents, which were published in October 2009 in the New York Times, said that Mr. Ensign had assisted Douglas Hampton, one of his assistants, to secure a lucrative lobby to lead to the silence of Mr. Hampton and his wife, Cynthia, the senator's affair with it.
Mrs. Hampton once worked as a treasurer in the Ensignna campaign.
Mr Ensign contacted a number of political backers to find work for Mr Hampton and to support their views after Mr Hampton were employed to lobby for them, so much to cite documents and interviews.
Since Hampton was, until recently, Mr. Ensign's assistant, he was expelled by law from lobbying his former employer or the Senate for a year.
Ethics experts argue that the unusual settlement of Mr. Ensign and Mr. Hampton, who were friends before the affair, has arisen in violation of the lobbying ban.
From the evidence that was released "it has revealed that this is a clear case of violining the law," said Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who specializes in defending clients who are under investigation by the government.
While Department of Justice officials declined to explain the reasons for the decision in Senate Ensign, Mr. Brand and other ethics lawyers said the department was cautious about political lawsuits, after a large number of failures, including a decision last year to suspend a lawsuit against former senator Ted Stevens in the midst of charges of misconduct by the prosecution.
Federal prosecutors "clearly hid their weapons," said Melanie Sloan, executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington), a law firm that filed several complaints against Mr. Ensign in the case.
"It basically points to the fact that high-ranking government officials are not covered by the law," she added.
Paul Coggins, Mr. Ensign's chief attorney, said in an interview that he had been called by the Attorney General of the Ministry of Justice on Monday and then the next day, and told him that the department had found no charges against his client.
Mr. Ensign's defense team is working with the prosecutors to convince them that the senator, as his office reiterated in a statement on Wednesday, "acted in accordance with the law."
Mr Coggins refused to elaborate on the legal arguments he had given to the prosecutors.
"I'm not comfortable recounting the details of my discussions with the Justice Department, except that we think they made the right decision," he said.
Last month, the Federal Election Commission decided to halt the investigation into a separate complaint in which the ethics group is filing allegations that Ensignton Hamptons' parents' payment to the $96,000 federal electoral law violated the Federal Election Act.
The Electoral Commission said it did not have enough evidence to prove that the money meant nothing more than a gift.
One company that Mr. Ensign helped Mr. Hampton find a lobbying job was NV Energy, the main non-Nazi company that had long supported the senator.
One December 2008 email proved that after Mr. Hampton began serving as a lobbyist at the company, Mr. Ensigne's senior staff - John Lopez - communicated with Mr. Hampton and told him that he was "beating" to the Home Office regarding the subject under discussion.
Mr Ensign also attended a lunch with Mr Hampton and another Vy-Nazadi client, Allegiant Air, and called on the Transport Minister to arrange a meeting on behalf of the airline after hiring Mr. Hampton for lobbying work.
When the affair was first reported last year, Mr. Ensign apologized to his constituents and resigned his post, as the fourth Republican leader in the Senate.
After a months-long stagnation, Mr. Ensign told reporters two weeks ago that he planned to participate in his third term in the Senate.
In a report that Mr. Ensign was no longer the target of the criminal investigation by his spokeswoman, Jennifer Cooper, said the senator hoped the ethics committee would quickly follow the Justice Department and close the investigation.
"The Ensignator is looking forward to continuing his hard work in the name of the Vysettles people," she said.
Cheshire's appeal turns to Twitter
In the ranks of the courtroom, half a dozen of them wrote.
A minute later, they sent reports of the gruesome testimony via Twitter.
Finally, the defense says that more than 140,000 Twitter messages were on rape and tying the children to the beds in the house that was set on fire.
On Thursday, Steven J. Hayes, who was convicted of killing three citizens of Cheshire, Connecticut, the family, and was to hold an official end to impose the death penalty for which the jury voted.
But Mr. Hayes' lawyers have already appealed to the court with requests and arguments that would probably have employed the court for years.
One of the most provocative is that intensive reporting of the process - including the widespread use of Twitter by the main reporters - created a "circus atmosphere" and this widespread, immediate penetration of information with outcast details was then introduced by the jury in a decision in the sense of influencing public opinion.
This claim could force the judge to address the question of whether to require new rules in the courtroom as well as the emergence of new technologies.
"As I have experienced in this trial, I think there is a real danger that the inclusion of new technologies in the courtroom affects the rights of a fair trial for the individual," said Thomas J. Ullmann, the chief defense attorney for Mr. Hayes.
Judge of the trial, Jon C. The State High Court Blue briefly rejected the claims regarding last week's decree, saying that the media was "tryly controlled" and that there was no evidence to point to the jury acting under the influence of the public.
But it is probably not the last word in this case.
For decades, the courts have acknowledged that reporting on notorious cases may raise questions about the justice of the trial.
In a 1966 court court of the United States court, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the conviction of the Cleveland chiropractor, Dr. Sheppard herself for the murder of his wife, when he said in his decision that Sheppard versus Maxwell was a "carnival atmosphere" at the media trial.
Some believe that this offence was the inspiration for the TV show and the film "Fugerle."
Some lawyers have said that the appeals courts, which reviewed the Hayes' ruling half a century later, might be surprised to argue that new rules could be necessary to determine the way communication is directed from the courtrooms, which was in the case of Dr. Sheppard unimaginable.
"There is a general cause for concerns about the impact of new media" in high-profile cases, said John J. Donohue III, a professor at the law Stanford Law School, who studied the death penalty in Connecticut and wrote a report saying it was performed at will.
Professor Donohue said that some judges may be intrigued by the idea that restricting imminent communication from courtrooms can make the trial fairer.
The Twitter case is only one of the many outlined lawyers, Mr. Hayes, who would be able to argue for years to delay the execution of the judgment.
For example, defense attorneys also argue that it may be a bias in the case of Mr. Hayes, when Judge Blue refused to allow him to test the reactions of potential jurors by showing them criminal photographs of the horror when selecting a jury.
Some of the jurors said they were appalled by the victims' photographs of the victims, which was Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48, and her daughter Hayley, 17, and Michaela, 11.
Defenders claim that they will also reject the constitutionality of the death penalty and claim that the judge wrongly appealed the juror, who was critical of prosecutors and that his decision wrongly put more pressure on the verdict and directed the jury to think over the weekend.
The jurors were not separated.
But their arguments about the influence of the scale of the process can attract the most interest.
They stated in an objection to the verdict last month that the case dominated the reports in Connecticut and was discussed during the election campaign by the candidates for governor and the Senate of the United States.
They argued that the media kept stifling the flames of emotion in the case.
"Darget daily media, cameras and reporters in court," the lawyer wrote, "it was something that has not yet been seen here in New Haven, and may also be a nationwide rarity."
Their focus on Twitter is controversial.
In interviews, some journalists argued that the immediate reporting was more outrageous than the reports reported at a later date and, from their point of view, the judicial police should direct the scope of other trials.
But some lawyers have called for the appellate courts with frequently used arguments that social and technological changes require the adaptation of the courts.
Mr. Hayes' lawyers are seeking this right.
In their archives, they referred to the Supreme Court's decision of the 1966 Supreme Court in the case of Dr. Sheppard, because of the breadth of the process's effect and wanted to clarify the requirement that the new media required new rules.
"This case," they wrote, "it represents the case of the Sheppard v. Maxwell of the 21st Century."
Can politeness overcome the abyss?
After the campaign, which was notable for its insult and negativity, a small number of courtesy appeared in Washington this week.
Is this the first swallow of true cooperation between two political parties, or merely an illusory moment before the swift return to the party fight in the capital?
Tuesday's meeting between President Obama and the parliamentary leaders produced no major discoveries about the major issues that must be discussed during the session.
But in any case, it was a polite discussion about the differences of opinion of two parties, as well as defining their shared responsibilities, rather than another blank episode of the party's struggle.
Wednesday's public session of the president's deficit commission was also civilized, despite the political differences that remain among the members.
It seems clear that close cooperation for several months has built up mutual respect that goes beyond the ideological gulf that still divides members.
And it's quite difficult to say that a new era of cooperation has begun.
Both sides are now in the trial period - probing each other with signs of collegiality and compromise, while seeking to assess the boundaries of public opinion and voter patience against the renewed party war.
That is why Tuesday's meeting and its later evaluation by the participants were also conducted with a minimum of requirements or accusations.
The philosophical differences between the Obama and the Republicans are too extensive and too deep to propose a rapid change in the circumstances that have prevailed here for the last two years.
Whether it's the issue of taxes, spending, health care or rights, both sides are miles away.
However, the November election was prepared by Washington, at least quickly.
"It's not a question of whether regulatory matters have changed," said Pete Wehner, Bush's administrator, now at the Ethics and Public Policy Center.
"These are inevitable after the election.
The election galvanized the emotions of the partisans, and then they fell silent.
It's all right."
On several issues, especially those to be discussed at the meeting, Republicans and Democrats have little chance of finding a solution.
Bush's tax cut expired at the end of the year, and no one sees it as favorable.
Both sides want to find a way to protect some or all of them, both sides permanently or temporarily.
Like the likely compromise on unemployment benefits only because Republicans cannot watch them support a tax cut for the wealthy, while rejecting unemployment benefits for the unemployed.
After Tuesday's White House meeting, there is already more optimism about a possible agreement on these issues, together with the ratification of the new opening treaty.
But William Galston of the Brookings Institution points out that successful collaboration on major issues will not necessarily lead to the relationship of two political parties when the 112th Congress convenes in January.
Rather, a likely period of disagreements, or even inevitable, he said.
"After doing the things that have to be done, psychology will return to one of the confrontations in a short space of perspective," he said.
Wehner also expressed skepticism - which is largely widespread - to the fact that courtesy will lead them to real cooperation.
"I look at all events between the present and 2012 as a shadow box, when the main events will occur in 2012," he said.
The reasons are largely linked to the formation of a new Republican majority in the White House and the tea party voters who helped create it.
Republican leaders now face the danger of exaggeration, knowing that they must act on their promises and cut the government's spending and repeal the new health care law.
These adherence lines are clear in the initial responses to the recommendations on the deficit, which include reforming the tax code and the increase in some taxes, the increase in the retirement age and the reduction in spending.
The joint chairmen, Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles, have taken on one of the toughest challenges in Washington and, in their view, are to put pressure on the deficit issues on the public agenda in ways that cannot be ignored.
But they need 14 votes in the 18-member commission to present their plan as an official recommendation and thus fight to get as close as possible to the figure.
The biggest opposition is among the elected officials on the jury, who suggest that in the case of financial issues, we have, at least today, small basics or the will for compromise.
Galston predicts two phases in the battles between the White House and the parliamentary Republicans.
The first will begin next year in the form of party conflicts, with Republicans calling on Obama to address the budget, tax, and health care, when a period of more party cooperation will follow.
What causes the shift?
Public opinion.
There is much evidence that despite the party's partisanship at the last election, a majority of Americans want to continue to see the two parties that work together.
If it could be directed to the heel, as it did in 1995, then both sides will be very careful to follow the public's reactions.
Anyone at risk of reducing the votes, will probably change the course and look for a compromise.
This may be an optimistic view of the matter.
Stranicking and directing are greater today than they were in the mid-1990s, and it turns out that a larger ideological gap between Obama and the parliamentary Republicans has emerged than it was in the case of Republicans and Bill Clinton.
At the same time, activists on both sides see 2010 as a prelude to more important elections in 2012.
Based on this reality, the courtesy that emerged this week would be welcomed by many Americans.
But it will cost many efforts on both sides to find common groundwork on the issues that still divide them.
The stripped American documentary portrays Moscow as a haven for corruption
The city's management is in the hands of the "clucktoracie" and it continues with some of the bribes and bribe for protection that come to the Kremlin on the way to the Kremlin, the U.S. Embassy in Russia reported in records from February.
Police and the Federal Security Service largely hold protective wings to help explain the high cost of living in Moscow.
They collect money not only from legal trades but also from organised crime groups.
Every layer of bureaucracy - which Prime Minister Vladimir Putin called the "trial" - will take his tos when the money starts to move up the ladder.
The footage, which was sent to Washington under the name of ambassador John Beyrle, was posted on WikiLeaks' website on Wednesday.
The footage is based on the sources whose names were redacted.
The footage was written at a time when Yuri Luzhkov was still mayor, accusing him of a large involvement in the corruption.
He was dismissed in October by President Dmitry Medvedev, but since then we can only follow minimal changes in purification.
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena Baturina, who owns a prominent design firm, have consistently denied corruption charges for many years, and have won several lawsuits for false accusations.
He told a Russian television station in September when he was asked about proven evidence of corruption: "It's crazy, it's dirt, it's crap."
The Russians, with absolute conviction, believe that if their society is corrupt, it will turn out to be a vote.
But it is unusual to meet such details spoken in such a way, in the embassy report, and it is also unheard of for diplomats to do so by diplomats from foreign countries.
"The government of Moscow and its association with the criminal elements led some to call it 'dysfunctional,' and confirm that the government functions more as a kleptocracy than as a government," the report says.
"Criminal elements are enjoyed by the so-called 'crush' (a term from the world of jail and mafia, which literally means 'roof' or protection), provided by the police, the Federal Security Service, the Federal Security Service (FSB), the Ministry of the Interior and the Office of the Public Prosecutor, as well as everywhere in the government's bureaucracy of the city of Moscow.
"The Analytiks have identified and a three-step structure in the criminal world of Moscow."
"Luzhkov is at the very top."
"The Federal Security Service, the Ministry of the Interior and the militias are in the second level."
"And finally, at the lowest level, there are ordinary criminals and corrupt inspectors."
"It's an ineffective system in which criminal groups fill in blanks in some areas, as the city does not provide some services."
The report says the FSB is taking money from the biggest companies and the police are targeting smaller businesses.
One source said, "trademarks in Moscow are aware that it is better to obtain protection from the FSB or the Ministry of the Interior (preferably than from organized criminal groups), as they have not only more weapons, resources and forces than criminal groups, but are also protected by the law."
"For this reason, protection from criminal gangs is no longer so on course."
The footage says that while the withdrawal of the money is comprehensive, the protection itself may already be in trouble; even those who pay can sometimes be arrested.
For those who do not pay quickly enough, their business is closed under various pretexts.
Medvedev spoke several times about the fight against corruption, but admitted that he had made little progress.
The bass report speaks of men taking suitcases, probably packed with cash, to the Kremlin itself.
"In his fight against corruption, Medvedev must rely on bureaucrats," Georgy Satarov, director of the Moscow research team, said in a recent interview.
"But it is part of this bureaucracy."
"It is not part of the political class because there are no longer political classes in Russia."
Without politicians, without opposition, without the separation of powers, corruption is inevitable, he said.
The Indo estimates that corruption costs Russia more than $300 billion a year to nationwide.
The country ranks 154th in a recent survey on the global perception of corruption by NGO Transparency International (the country ranks from at least to the most corrupt).
The unveiling of the report by the U.S. Embassy, which did not appear in Moscow until late in the evening, certainly did not elicit enthusiasm with the Russian government, although only to the extent that Luzhkov may be charged for Moscow's shortcomings, may be a chance for the Kremlin to argue about the solution to the problem.
In an interview with CNN with Larry King, Putin told Putin that the documents released by WikiLeaks may have been counterfeits and reacted angrily to a statement that American diplomats called him Batman and Medvedeva Robin.
"The truth about the matter is that it is our interaction, which is an important factor in domestic policy in this country," he said.
"But to be honest, we didn't think it would be done with such arrogance, with such coercion, you know, so unethically."
Khmer Rouge veterans forced to come to terms with the past
In a scantily lit concrete classroom with its soiled and peeled walls, the headmaster of the Anlong Veng High School reminded the man who had built it, the leader of the Khmer Rouge, Ta Mok.
"Everyone here loves Ta Moka."
"He was a good leader and he cared for his people," said Sreng Kor Ma, 42.
Known as a "butcher" for his brutality during the Khmer Rouge, the commander remains popular in this remote-held Khmer Rouge, where he built hospitals, bridges and other infrastructure, and where thousands of former soldiers of the organization still live.
But this year, 12 years after the Khmer Rouge surrendered to reign, the long-running loyalty is also in Anlongenway.
In April, the victims at the Truth Forum and Reconciliation were allowed to publicly confront people who were part of the regime.
In June, the government provided textbooks that for the first time explain to children the history of the Khmer Rouge and their former soldiers.
And in July, jointly, and the Cambodian court, to call on the first conviction of former Khmer Rouge member, sentencing the former leader, the notorious abusive association of Tuol Sleng, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as the Ghost, to 35 years in prison.
With each such advance, there was a growing discomfort among the veterans of the Khmer Rouge in Anlong Veng, which complicates the efforts of reconciliation and their attempts to re-involvele in the Cambodian society.
"There is a grudge and fear among the former Khmer Rouge, but they are powerless to do anything," said Chhang Youk, head of the Cambodia documentation centre, an independent organization that examines the regime.
"For them, life among the Khmery Rouge was a wonderful life, but the regime became a symbol of evil."
"It separates the families."
During the Khmer Rouge government in Cambodia, from 1975 to 1979, an estimated 1.7 million people were executed or starved to death, from disease or overwork.
When the Vietnamese attacked and overthrew the reign of the Pol Pot in 1979, the remnants of the regime and its soldiers fled to the Cambodian border with Thailand.
There, they launched an uprising that lasted until the last movement in December 1998.
Pol Pot, Nuon Chea, and Ieng Sary ran guerrilla warfarean from their bases in the mountains and jungles in western Cambodia, while Ta Mok cultivated followers in Anlongenway.
But in the mid-1990s, after the peace agreement, sponsored by the UN, the country was led to the first democratic election in 1993. Large groups of Khmer Rouge fighters began to move toward a government that culminated in the surrender of Ieng Sara in 1996 and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died of natural causes in 1998, and Ta Mok, who persevered, was captured by government forces in the underdog mountains of Dangrek in 1997.
He died in Phnom Penh Prison in 2006 while awaiting trial.
Their benefactors were no longer cared for, with most of the former Khmer Rouge fighters dropping into ordinary Cambodian rural life, and many of them nostalgically remember the time of the movement.
Although several elite Khmer Rouge have maintained their local government position in exchange for their weapons, their position remains weak, as unskilled farmers.
"These people have only received minimal benefits from the surrender," said Sok Leang of the Center for Justice and Reconciliation, which is being led by public forums across Cambodia, including Anlong Veng.
"They are surrounded by the regime's utopian agrarian ideology."
"There were manners without any idea of doing business."
Sor Lim, 55, who entered the Khmer Rouge as a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle around Anlong Venga before settling as a poor farmer in 1998.
"Life under the Khmer Rouge was good," he said.
"T. Mok fed them all."
"But now life is hard, because we must secure everything for ourselves."
The ongoing Khmer Rouge Court also raised concerns.
Early next year, the court will begin investigating Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Rouge Minister.
The court has a mandate to prosecute the lead of the developers and the people responsible for the crimes, but it has not been said whether it will also continue in the four cases.
It was little to be reassured by the fears in Anlongen.
Recent media speculation focused on Im Chaem, 64, who was the regional leader in the province of the Banteay Meanchey during the Khmer Rouge's rule in the late 1970s.
In 2007, she told researchers at the Documentation Center in Cambodia that she oversaw the construction of the Trapeang Thma Dam, a project that was likely to have perished thousands of forced workers.
A recent hot evening, Im Chaem returned from her field work to her wooden house on a dirt road outside of Anlong Veng.
As the sun began to descend and shadows appeared across the arid grass, Im Chaem refused to speak of her past among the Khmery Rouge.
If the court called it, she would refuse to go.
"Merury reigns in Cambodia and it is stable," she said.
"If there are further prosecutions, there will be war."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who defected from the Khmer Rouge in 1978, also repeatedly warned that there would be instability if the court sought out more suspects, though experts and historians disagree.
"The Cambodia must dig a deep hole and bury the past in it," he said.
But confronting the past is only what Cambodia has to do to move forward, said Chhang Youk of the documentation center.
"Reconciliation in the Khmer ratios means gluing together of broken pieces," he said.
"It is our duty to put these broken pieces together so that we can understand each other."
The center published the first textbook approved by the Khmer Rouge by the Khmer Rouge, with the name "The History of Democratic Cambodia."
It was distributed in Anlong Veng in June as an addendum to the history book of the Ministry of Education, which contains fewer than four pages on the Khmer Rouge.
Like many people in Cambodia, young people in Anlongenway knew only a few details about the Khmer Rouge, despite the city's connection to the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19, a student at a high school in Anlong Veng said the new textbook helps students understand an important part of their history.
But his parents reacted skeptically when he took home a book to study.
"My family rejects many parts of the textbook and the courts," he said.
"They're suspicious because they're not sure how many people the trial will prosecute."
Such resistance makes the reconciliation process more complex and difficult, said Sok Leang.
But public forums, textbooks and the court are beginning to have influence, he said.
The Khmer Rouge still have a strong charm here.
Up in the Dangrek Mountains, the Dangrek Mountains road is overgrown with weeds and emptied with discarded plastic bags that lead to a rectangle of black soot, covered with a rusted tin roof.
The body of Pol Pot was burned here in a pile of tyres after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, 31, a cell phone clerk on the side of the road said she didn't know much about the man who was cremated at the scene.
"But he has a strong spirit, many of the locals come here and pray to him," she said.
It was Nuom Sothea's birthday, and she had planned to visit Pol Pota's resting place later, where she would bring a bundle of ripe bananas in the hope that it would bring her luck.
Belarus agrees to find its uranium-based stockpiles
In a surprise victory in President Obama's campaign to secure nuclear material around the world, the Belarusian government announced Wednesday that they would renounce their stockpile of highly enriched uranium, a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The agreement was made public in a joint statement, issued following a Security Summit by Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov.
The US government has spent years trying to persuade Belarus to give up highly enriched uranium and the stumbling block seemed to have hit last spring.
But American officials told The Washington Post that in the last two months, a couple of classified operations have been conducted with Belarus to remove £187 of uranium-based weapons from the Belarusian research facility.
This set the stage for Wednesday's agreement to remove the rest of the material - around £500, according to the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because it is a sensitive matter.
The agreement proved to be one of the most important results of Obama's 47th National Nuclear Security Summit in April, at which Belarus was scrapped.
And it was probably a good move to secure the invitation of the former Soviet Republic to the subsequent 2012 summit.
"I was really fascinated by the fact that they wanted a place at the Nuclear Security Summit 2012."
"This proves that the process is working," said Ken Luongo, president of the Global Security Partnership, a nuclear-resistant group.
Clinton called the agreement a "very important, important step" from Belarus.
Obama promised in Prague in April 2009 to secure all sensitive nuclear materials around the world within four years.
Since then, the U.S. government has helped six countries to get rid of all its high-enriched uranium stockpiles.
Belarus will be the seventh.
The country's Tucet did so under the administration of George W. Bush.
At the time of Obama's Nuclear Security Summit, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko announced that his nation would never give up its uranium.
"We have highly enriched uranium - hundreds of kilograms of what is basically the basis for a weapon and less enriched uranium," Lukashenko said afterwards.
"It's our commodity...We're not going to make dirty bombs, and we're not going to sell it to anyone."
"We only use it for research purposes, that's all."
Nevertheless, Belarus joined the United States a few months ago and signaled interest in reaching an agreement.
The first commitment to remove Belarusian uranium in October was particularly complicated, as the material was slightly irradiated, officials reported.
It was loaded onto a special train that traveled more than 1,300 miles to a Russian storage and disposal facility, officials said.
The second operation was closed on Monday and was performed by air, officials said.
The US government spent $13 million on the program, most of it on the delivery to the Belarusian research institute less enriched uranium, which is not suitable for nuclear weapons production.
"Everything was coordinated very carefully and controlled by trust," leading to the agreement signed by Clinton, said Andrew Bieniawski, an official at the Department of Energy working for Global Threat Reduction.
This year, the James Martin Martin Center for the Non-Proliferation Study, estimated that Belarus had at least 88 pounds of uranium usable for weapons production.
Belarus will, according to the joint statement, seek to withdraw its stocks by 2012.
Relations between Belarus and the United States have been strained for years, mainly due to Lukashenko's cruel repression of human rights.
But Wednesday's statement suggests the possibility of a gradual thaw.
"We welcome the progress made on these global security issues, the United States and Belarus have recognised that more rigorous respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains the basis for improving relations and it is necessary for the progress of the country and its people," he said.
The Spanish government did not make a long shot at CIA flights
The Spanish government was not making a long deal of CIA flights carrying imprisoned talibans and members of Al-Qaida to Guantánama through Spanish territory, as the United States envoy in Madrid commented in its telegram.
This is the implication from the documents provided by the Wikileaks server to the daily El País, where it is also reported that then-First Deputy Prime Minister María Teresa Fernández de la Veg asked for the Spanish executive to be briefed and "so show that it has the proper surveillance of foreign aircraft passing through the Spanish airspace."
In June 2006, following a communication by the Council of Europe, in which a dozen states, including Spain, were charged with complicity in human rights violations, a meeting took place between the ambassador of the US, Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega.
The deputy prime minister said the Council of Europe's communication "did the Zapater's government out of the game" and insisted that Spain had nothing to hide in the matter.
De la Vega stressed that Spain has no problem with secret service flights through its territory.
"They simply want to be informed only" so that they are not "arranged," Aguirre says in one of the documents.
The then Minister of Foreign Affairs, Miguel Ángel Moratinos, also suggested to the US ambassador that the Spanish government "did the matter of the lowest possible outlines, but the cabinet had limited possibilities of influence by the fact that the matter was in the hands of the judges."
In February 2007, prosecutor Viceente González told the Embassy that, as far as it was concerned, he had no intention of blocking the judge's initiative to request the declassification of documents from the National Intelligence Center (CNI) and the Ministry of Defence concerning CIA flights.
"This information contains no of the incriminating component or any sensitive information," the Embassy explained after talking to the prosecutor.
However, the US has expressed concerns for" manifest coordination between the Spanish judge and the German prosecutors" than to declassify CNI or the Ministry of Defence.
"This coordination between independent experts will complicate our efforts to address this case discreetly between governments," regrets Aguirre.
In March 2007, on the occasion of the lunch of the ambassador of the US and Interior Minister Alfred Pérez Rubalcaba, he told this ambassador that "although Spanish judges are very jealous of their independence and will do what they think is appropriate," he has already instructed his co-workers, "let them avoid the uproared comments with the intention of reducing the tension."
The ambassador also expresses his concerns about the conduct of the political party Partido Popular (PP; Czech People's Party) on this matter.
"Despite its general pro-American orientation, our experience tells us that the Partido Popular Party will not hesitate to take advantage of any hints that the Zapatera government tolerated or intentionally ignored the actions of the US, which could be interpreted as possible a violation of human rights, even if these revelations could have negative consequences for the United States government," he notes.
Confirmed mother-in-woman complained on the network on maternal "happiness"
The young woman spoke of the child when he was dead and had her blog: "Teror after galicius"
Mónica Juanatey Fernández calls herself "Muki" online.
she communicated with this nickname, which she had been using since she was a young age, and at least one friend; the two of them were from the village of Noia in the area of La Coruña, from which the young woman is a long shot.
The news is from 2008.
In order to be understood, it is necessary to know the woman's emotional life, which is reconstructed by the ABC with the help of the testimony of her family members.
A 30-year-old woman from Galicia entered into a relationship with the industrialist Iván Túnez in 1998.
They dated for a year.
Shortly after they broke up, she found out she was pregnant.
The man wanted to know if the newborn child was his, but his ex-girlfriend never had his DNA tests done.
She found a new acquaintance soon.
Its chosen one was Alberto, a young man from the nearby town of Lousame.
Their coexistence took a long time.
Little Caesar lived with them.
When the girl left for the Balearic Islands to look for a job, the little one stayed with her partner, who even came to see her at the Palma for a week.
However, the content of her communication shows that the relationship has broken down.
In March 2008, she's alone on Menorca, writing, "Alberto is some angry that I left for work."
"When I told him, it seemed good, but now he realizes that he has to be with the little one all day and can't do what he wants."
Then he talks about the text message she just got: 'I want you to come back later this month or give me the address where to send you the child'.
He complains: 'If he doesn't like me leaving the little one with my mother, I'll marry him when I get back," he claims.
in May he talks about his return to his residence: 'I'm going there this week, but I'll only stay until the 19th, '20s, 'cause I have to go for work so I don't miss the job'.
He explains that if all goes well, he will take his son to him.
"He'll be with who he's supposed to be with, with me, and it's never going to happen again in my life that I'd leave him with someone else besides my mother," a dubious intention given her bad relationships.
there's another post in July.
When he punches on this message, it is assumed that the child who arrived on the island on the first day of this month and was probably murdered 10 is already dead.
"César is happy on the one hand, but on the other hand he is not."
"On the one hand he's with me, and he kind of likes it here, but on the other hand, he goes to school almost every day."
He's talking about moving to Mallorca.
"He's going to go to summer school (son) there, so I'll save a little money for a nanny."
Seventeenth regards and complaints.
"A big kiss from Caesar that asks me when you're coming."
"Alberto says he sent you I don't know what videos to email, look at the way he wants, he's meeting with me, sex is needed."
The 30th next message: 'The kid is well, he goes to summer school to learn Catalan's.'
There is also one report on Víctor, the current partner: "He gives me money."
On the internet, Mónicca's posts are on blogs dedicated to anime and manze.
She even had her own on MySpace, now revised, where she called herself "Muki ex-prisoness."
"Teror after galicius (motto) ".
The last man with whom she lived, the guard, expresses his pity and feels guilty.
He doesn't want to believe that everything would happen because she didn't tell him she was a single mother.
Mónica entered the provincial penitentiary in Palma yesterday, where she arrived from the Mensornic detention centre.
The defense attorney, Carlos Maceda, said the defendant did not remember how everything happened and "that she had no intention of harming the little one."
Earlier, however, she admitted that she had drowned Caesar in the bathtub and put his body in the trunk.
Both the defense and the prosecutor are requesting psychiatric evaluation.
The People's Party would win 4 seats in the House and the PSC (Socialist Party of Catalonia) would lose 9 seats
with the results of 28 November, the PP party could have the lead at the town halls in Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona.
After a significant increase in votes won and the number of experienced MPs during the recent autonomous elections, the Catalan's PP (Katalania People's Party) has already given an idea of the general election, whether or not to increase, its prospects are more than positive, as the number of votes in national elections is usually one such compared to the Catalan elections.
in 2008 the Catalan People's Party won the general election by 610,473 votes, while in the autonomous elections of 2006 this figure was only 316.222.
Last Sunday, the PPC (Katalan People's Party) received a vote of 384,091 votes.
If this tendency of upwarding, supported by the PSC's transfer of votes and PP voters' loyalty, the party's analysts have calculated that if the election is held, the PPC could win 12 deputies in the House compared to the current 8, CiU (Convergencia i Unió, Czech, Conformity and Union - note) would also receive 4 mandates (now it has 10) and the PSC would lose at least 9 seats (now it has 25).
These calculations would confirm that Catalonia is of crucial importance for the PP and PSOE (Spanish Socialist Workers' Party).
According to this Peoples' Peoples' Analysis, the ERC (Left Republican Republican Party) would lose one MP - it now has 3 - while the Gright's Initiative (Green Initiative for Catalonia) would continue to have one mandate, or won another one.
However, according to the election calendar, the next appearance will be held in May 2011 on the occasion of the municipal elections, where the People's Party could also have a decisive influence on the end of the Socialist domination in the four main provincial cities, as well as the changes in the Barcelona Council (Diputación de Barcelona), one of the administrations with the largest projected budget - 661 million euro for 2011.
Both nationalists and the Peoples agree with the possibility that the PSC could lose the town hall in Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, where the Socialists would not receive a majority and would not be able to turn to their traditional allies, the ERC and the ICV parties.
Given the Republican debacle, it would be impossible for this party to lose its representation in the Barcelona council - as it needs to be won at least 5% of the vote.
The PP increased the number of votes received in four capitals and could have a decisive influence in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragorona.
Nationalists believe they could play a major role in the turnaround in Tarragona, where they ruled together with the PP party in front of the current mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros.
in Lérida, the PP won only 500 more votes than the PSC, whose mayor, Angel Ros, has a very good relationship with Mariano Rajoy - they met on several occasions during the last campaign.
The Peoples also won at other important town halls such as Badalona, Castelldeels and Reus.
currently, the PP has a presence at 34 town halls in Catalonia and would like to create candidates in as many municipalities as possible.
Catalan cell provided Al-Qaeda to thousands of passports
In addition to the seven detained in Barcelona, three more were detained in Thailand
The seven Pakistanis and a Nigerian who had been detained by agents of the General Information Commissioner in Barcelona formed a jihadist cell run from Thailand that arranged passports for various Al-Qaeda groups, including the "Tigers of the Liberation of Tamil's Ilam" or "Lashkar-e-Taiba," with the latter being the author of the bombings in Bombaji, in which 106 people were killed in 2008.
The Interior Ministry attaches great importance to the investigation of the matter, aiming to ensure the weakening of the Al-Qaeda counterfeiting apparatus at international level with the "Operation Kampai" and "restricting its operational capabilities."
Investigators estimate that this cell could have sent thousands of passports to Thailand during the two years when it was active in Catalonia, where they were then forged and then supplied to groups that form the Al-Qaeda criminal galaxy so that their "fighters" could travel across borders in Europe and other Western countries with impunity.
This broken cell was not the only active one with the jihad network in Europe, which is why other European police units participated in these investigations in addition to the Thai services, and it cannot therefore be ruled out that there will be no similar interventions in other European countries in the following days as the one in Barcelona last Tuesday night.
In connection with this operation (when the Pakhizers Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade were detained), another developed in Thailand in which Pakistanis Mohammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt and Thajec Sirianlaya Kijbumrua were capturedng.
It was these men who ran the Bangkok-based cell in Spain and others in other European countries.
The Catalan network, part of which was disposed of in 2009, stole, in particular, travel passports from tourists that met the demands of the Islamists.
This means that the documents had to belong to the men aged 25 to 45, had to be valid for several years and be free of marked visas.
The investigative documents point out that no facts are yet known to link the detainees from Catalonia to the bombing in Mumbai, even though the author of these attacks, "Lashkar-e-Taiba," was to be one of the groups that accepted passports stolen in Spain and then falsified in Thailand.
However, it is worth noting that a few days before this assassination, a transfer agency of about $1,000 was sent by a transfer agency, which was "inserted" to buy mobile phone cards that were later used by members of the "command" that killed 106 people.
Police have already seized a lot of evidence.
People's Party (PP) demands from Mace to halt the fiscal agreement
The president of the PPC (Katalan People's Party), Alicia Sánchez-Camach, had the opportunity yesterday to present to Arthur Mas personally the terms under which she is willing to support his induction as President of the Generalitat; these terms are the same as those proposed during the campaign, and their priority is to revitalise the economy and renounce risky businesses such as the economic agreement that the nationalist leader wants to propose during his mandate.
The Speaker of the Catalan Peoples came to the meeting with Arturo Mas with the certainty of the 18 seats received in last Sunday's election, a figure of more than satisfactory to gain popularity, so the CiU candidate needs at least one of the formations making up for the opposition to abstain from voting to reinstate him.
The possible consensus with the PP depends on the possible consensus with the future alliances that the nationalists would like to keep in the House when the general election is held, but so far the talks on the talks on Mas and the rest of the political leaders are in the Catalan spirit of the day.
As for the president of the PP, to get her support for her inauguration, "she will have to end all the sovereign and liberation speeches," as well as an economic agreement like the one from the Basque Country - which the CiU leader even wanted to vote on in the referendum.
The two leaders would like to downsize the rampant political apparatus of the autonomous administration and reduce inheritance and gift taxes.
Details of the negotiations for Mas's inauguration will be addressed within the PPJi Cornet and the Dolors Montserrat.
Mas has already met Joaquin Nadal (PSC), who promised harsh opposition, Joan Herrera (ICV) and will meet today with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Alberto Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The director of the geriatric establishment assures that the deaths were not due to the "lack of action"
Introductions by the Olot Center do not rule out that their carer killed more than 11 clients
The management of the La Caritat de Olot (Geron) geriatric center gave a press conference yesterday to describe the damage to the criminal behaviour of Joan Vila Dilmé, a caretaker who - while he was employed here - killed at least eleven of the elderly in the care he had in the care of.
The director of this senior home, Joan Sala, arrived accompanied by a lawyer at the facility, attorney Joan Canada, and announced that "the wish of La Caritat's home would be to be able to bring charges against the culprit" responsible for the killing, but "the law and responsibility oblige us to leave this trial to the relevant authorities."
In addition to the reputational damage that this institution may suffer because it has failed to detect the carer's criminal activities in a timely manner, the major threat to La Caritat's home is now the demands for material compensation, which are already calculated by the legal representatives of the bereaved families.
Joan Vila Dilmé admitted that his first crime had already taken place in August 2009 and that he had not stopped killing since
The judge ordered the exhumation of the eight bodies of the clients of the home for the elderly, suspected that in many cases no doctor had inspected the deceased personally, but that - due to the patients' age and ill health - everything was handled over the phone.
La Caritat resolutely rejected this extremity yesterday through its director, stressing that "lack of action could not in any way be the cause of what had happened."
The legal representative of La Caritat added that "There are no indications in the case that any third party has committed an error other than the accused."
The man dubbed the now "Angel of Death" admitted to killing 11 yesterday, clarifying that he committed the first crime on August 29, 2009 and killing a second old woman a month and a half later.
in this case, the death was caused by administering an overly high dose of insulin, as opposed to the first case in which he used a mixture of soothing pills.
The director of La Caritat said it was complicated to control the access of personnel to medication.
The insulin and the seduce was probably, in six cases, out of the nine-year-old, the carer used to kill the patients in his efforts to relieve their suffering.
However, it is only the analyses that are now taking place in the laboratory that should show whether Vila is lying and actually sought a less cruel death for his first victims or, on the contrary, killed them by handing out lye, as he has already admitted in the case of three women killed between 12 and 17. October.
in La Caritat, they do not believe in the medical claims and do not rule out that the number of those killed may be higher than he has admitted to, and they justify their behaviour in various versions that Vila has given to the court, knowing that he must change his actions when it emerged that he had killed eight people.
That's why they say they want to be available to the judiciary to illuminate the full scope of this matter.
European Central Bank threatens
Investors yesterday reacted sharply to the threat of the President of the European Central Bank, Trichet, yesterday, who warned that "the markets should not underestimate our ability to respond."
Fringe differentials closed with force, and European banks' shares fell by more than 5%.
However, we should also not underestimate the European Central Bank's ability to be wrong - the euro has just risen above critical value.
What happened yesterday is typical of the illiquid market, which, although there is a downturn, is recovering - but thanks to short and very speculative positions.
It will take the investor some time to lose his fears.
A month ago, the European Central Bank quoted us as quoting to take back the liquidity rate today, and tomorrow it will have to be called off for the fourth time in two years.
The Bundesbank called for the termination of the plan to buy the national debt to be used for the ineffectiveness and to eliminate all exceptional liquidity measures within the deadline and to leave unrestricted access for only one week.
After the Irish crisis, we expect the liquidity rate to predict 'at least until March' and to honour the three-month non-access auction with unlimited access until the end of this trimester to guarantee liquidity until at least in June.
We also hope that they will continue their bond-buying programme and even announce its intensification.
If the expectations created are not, it will re-establish the response of the markets from yesterday, and if they continue to blindly continue to withdraw the liquidity rate, God be with us!
It was the same at the congress in May, where they claimed that they had not even considered buying the bonds, and there was a collapse of the markets - tomorrow, history could repeat itself.
The European Central Bank must be credible and persistent.
in May, the armor's fist announced it on Monday and said on Wednesday that it had already purchased many of them, triggering a further collapse of the market.
Yesterday's bidding of one-year bills in Portugal was very poor.
El Tesoro issued only 500 million with 5.28%, compared to the $750 million at 4.81% of the previous one.
Which is why the rates in Portugal fell 30 points lower, reflecting a change in the market's mood after the words of Trichet.
in Ireland the figures were published representing the losses of Allied and the Bank of Ireland.
The estimated amounts represent about 10,000 million in short-term securities and another potential 15,000, with a chance of becoming private capital by February, otherwise they will be nationalized.
Although Ireland has no credibility, after the problem was not detected by stress tests in July, the sums are acceptable under the auxiliary plan and will help reduce uncertainty.
However, next Tuesday the government will need to get approval from the new budget by parliament and still does not have enough support, so there continues to be uncertainty in Ireland.
Angela Merkel softened the tone of her speech to ease the tension in the face for the next EU top-flight meeting on 14 December, at which a political compromise is needed to show that we are a union and we are all in the same boat.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner, while the others would prefer Beethoven's Ode to Joy.
In Spain, the Prime Minister yesterday had the opportunity to present a plan for a measure to be approved at the Council of Ministers on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in autonomous areas and financial institutions, reduction of deficit, liberalisation, privatisation, measures to boost employment - sound like the Four seasons from Vivaldi in the ears of investors.
The dual effect of Trichet and Zapatera explains why the Spanish stock exchange rose by 4.5%, or twice the other European stock exchanges.
Unlike in February, the reaction of the government and the National Bank of Spain was swift and convincing - we are probably benefiting from the surprise effect.
Today we have a key three-year bond bidding, which will be favoured by the Trichet effect, which we hope, for which there will be a great demand to help dispel the doubts about our refinancing capabilities.
Asking for a rescue plan would be self-sacrament for Spain.
They would give us the cash we don't need - there are 40,000 million in cash available in El Tesoro, three times more than in March - further high rates and market access would close with sine die.
Nevertheless, it is necessary to continue to use the strategy of Cesar's wife - "not only to be that, but also to be this."
We can do it.
Eulen Group president attacks Vega Sicilia's meeting requested by his children
The storm in open conflict in the Álvarez family, the owners of Eulen and El Enebro, is not dingmouth.
David Álvarez, the founder of the group, contests him after being conceived as a "completely insignificant" legal act by El Enebro, scheduled for the 16th of this month and the requested five of his seven descendants, on which they should try to force their majority and seize, with the help of the administrative authorities, the pro-prosecutor Bodegas Vega Sicilia.
David Álvarez and his sons, Jesús David and María José, are fine-tuning the legal group for a new chapter in their dispute over the control of part of society.
The founder of the largest corporate services holding does not seem willing to relent in his dispute over membership in the ruling bodies of the El Enebro group.
Her administration committee was deposed by five of his seven descendants, who were named leaders during a gathering of shareholders on January 18 of this year and whose objection is lodged in the Commercial Register.
The court hearing of the El Enebro group, scheduled for the 16th of this month, which was called by the Court of Commons 2 official in Madrid, renewed the thunder in the bosom of the Álvarez family.
Applying to the judges is the only legal means to guarantee the commission's convening until the dispute is resolved.
The final move by Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marty and Elvira Álvarezova's Mezquiriz is seen by David Álvarez as "a desperate remedy for his five children serving through judicial guise and a clear legal deception to strengthen and improve the January 18, which was completely invalid."
This line of argument will serve as a basis for the justification for the legal challenge to the conduct of this conduct as "completely insignificant."
The protagonists themselves, who are discreetly silent, have already tried unsuccessfully for the court to convene a hearing in June.
in El Enebro, a group owned alongside other activities by Bodegas Vega Sicilia, controls seven descendants of David Álvarez with 100% capital.
However, the group's founder, according to family protocols, demands a right to use the right to use at 51% of the capital.
This matter is a key issue that the judge will have to decide when he extinguitions the issue of court-appealing. The date of this trial has not yet been determined.
Red Bull triumphs in Formula One with a secret weapon from Siemens
The software suggests upgrading in real-time vehicles.
Ever since Red Bull inversed the Formula One series in 2004, its history in this exceptional world of speed has been characterised by surprise and success.
At first, no one took the options of this newcomer team seriously, and despite the upward trend of recent times, they were all betting on Ferrari Fernando Alonso's triumph.
Without wishing to diminish the riding abilities of the champion, German Sebastian Vettel, or the Renault engine's capabilities that powers his car, in the world of Formula One, a legend was born - a "secret weapon" that the multi-ethnic Siemens put in the hands of Red Bull to make him the winning team.
In fact, these are powerful software simulating marches that the German company launched in 2007 for the purposes of very remote automotive sport.
The so-called PLM, this powerful software device, was used to design mounting lines in manufacturing plants around the world, in energy plants and for high-treatment devices.
Its aim is to faithfully reproduce the product or simulate the process before it is realistically created, thus avoiding unnecessary errors and expenses.
The PLM facilitated the development of the Canon, Sukhoi aircraft or Nissan's most notorious commercial vehicles.
Siegfried Russwurm, head of Siemens' industrial division, explains that the use of this software device allowed the Red Bull team to make the Red Bull team "during a few hours, in near-real time" modifications and improvements that otherwise detect themselves during races and trials.
Russwurm says that in 1992 the stables employed an average of 10 technicians who were able to perform a maximum of three or four improvements in a single period.
on the Red Bull team today works for 180 young highly qualified professionals equipped with powerful information technology to analyze and design each type of modification of racing vehicles.
The manager at Siemens explained that the PLM software is able to analyse and improve all elements of Red Bull racing vehicles with the exception of the engine for which Renault is fully responsible.
They are modeled with materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety features.
Changes can be translated from virtual reality to reality in less than 24 hours thanks to advanced production systems using laser and highly technologically advanced autoclave.
The only limit of this technical conveniency is the $40 million to the maximum each Formula One team can spend for each period to improve its competitiveness.
Red Bull has set up a top-tech plant about 50 km from London to design and manufacture its racing cars.
These are two buildings in which visitors are restricted - especially to journalists.
Everything that takes place here is considered a "big secret."
The list of participants in this project consists of 580 people, including two pilots - champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
The hero of the Red Bull is without a doubt fresh champion Sebastian Vettel in Formula One.
But under the immeasurable technological means of technology put into their participation in the racing circuits, there are other protagonists whose help is invaluable, and no one knows them.
The head of the manufacturing technology, Steve Nevey, says that five years ago it was possible to say that advances in vehicle research and development contributed to a 50% victory, and the rest was due to the riders.
currently this ratio has changed and the technology is worth the success of 85%, while the pilots are contributing 15%.
Nechesy acknowledges that Vettel or Webber will never be replaced by computing, as they are "unpredictable gladiators."
HP will set up 20 of its own stores in cooperation with local distributors over two years
Hewlett-Packard (HP) in collaboration with its business partner Pont Reyes inaugurated its first exclusive shop in Barcelona yesterday.
The company will be the first of a network of 20 stores of 80 to 100 m2 that the multinational company plans to open in Spain in the next two years.
These stores will also be placed in 16 existing department stores such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
The vice-president of Spain's HP, Helena Herrer, cited the newly converted shop to Barcelona's Gran Vía, owned by Pont Reyes, with which HP has been working for 30 years, as an example.
The North American company has prepared a plan to set up 200 sales outlets in Europe by 2013, which includes 20 Spanish stores.
The first stores were opened last week in Bucharest (Romania) and in Belgrade (Serbia), so the deal in Barcelona is the third.
Herrero would not reveal where other stores would be opened, but admitted that Madrid could be one of the following locations.
Herrero, who also runs HP's personnel systems, assured that the philosophy of opening stores would always be the same - using local distributors who have the experience and knowledge of the sector.
The North American company advises here with the exclusive design of the equipment of the outlets (with products that can be tested interactively), which will be identical in Europe.
In addition, HP is also involved in providing staff for shops.
Helena Herrer denied that it was a franchising process, stressing that the exclusive network of outlets was aimed at "improving customer service, services to SMEs when buying, service, after-sales and even packaging."
The shop in Barcelona is part of a world-class pilot pioneer programme to address any problems with computer devices under warranty.
The online service is connected to the technical centre located in Maastricht (Netherlands).
"Then we'll be able to solve problems in 10 minutes that might take up to two days otherwise."
"This system is designed specifically for small and medium-sized enterprises and for ordinary customers, as the big firms already have contractual technical assistance service," Helena Herrerová stressed yesterday.
Sabadell is betting on aldertage to his competitors a million clients over three years
More optimistic than other bosses, the delegated board member of Banco Sabadell, Jaime Guardiola, believes that 2011 will be challenging for the bank, but rejects a new liquidity crisis and predicts the end of the passive war.
Nevertheless, it envisages a reduction in interest rates, which they will try to compensate by discounting bank fees and credit prices.
Sabadell expects to raise a million private clients over three years.
Sabadell found a way to use the next three years to survive in difficult economic conditions.
The Bank will launch a new strategic plan in 2011 with effect for three years.
The aim, in addition to surviving without having to turn to public assistance at FROB, to gain market share by capturing a million new private clients - and 700,000, respectively, if those who eventually leave the bank are deducted - as until now the ai institute was rather cherished small and medium-sized entrepreneurs and large businesses than retail clients.
This year, the bank has already acquired 250,000 private clients and 50,000 businesses.
Its market share is 3.5% for private clients, compared to more than 10% for corporate customers.
Another of the basic ideas of the 2011-2013 plan is a commitment to productivity, or one can also say sober, in order to reduce the costs that the Bank will show the challenges of when it presents the results for the period.
At this time, a few banking institutions are at this time daring to set targets and disclose them, as the financial crisis has changed all plans for world banking.
Sabadell will close its Optima program this year, set four years ago, although it was originally for three years, but the market situation required an extension for the next period.
Clients who leave the savings banks will be their main target group.
At the APIE meeting, Guardiola insisted that 2011 would be "heavy and very important."
Indeed, he believes that the road from the crisis in Spain will be "true for a lengthy one."
In addition, it will be "very difficult to create employment" in two or three years, which is fundamental to the survival of the banking sector, he added.
And while he believes that a passive war - which reduces margins - is giving way, the cost of the risk surcharges that banks and savings banks pay for their issues to receive liquidity are already shifting to credit prices, thus offsetting margin cuts.
"The liquidity and funding theme is structural and will represent a coercive factor on credit."
"We haven't closed the tap yet, but the differentials are very high," Guardiola acknowledged.
Banesto has already issued orders to its network on Thursday to reduce long-term loans and increase the prices of differentials - see CincoDías of 22 and 27 November.
He also acknowledged that the trend in banking "is now being a reduction of commissions" is, but there is a "competing framework."
The Bank's strategic plan of Sabadell is based on organic growth, but as usual the group does not rule out corporation operations.
It does not forbade him assurrect that in Spain they will "require size."
"Next year there will be no stone left on the stone," he assured.
It confirms that the needs of capital are "reduced" and does not rule out that some Spanish institution will enter the red numbers.
And he points out that FROB may be supplying the market to collect funds before the new capital measure.
After assurances that Sabadell may survive a temporary market shutdown, a serious problem remains a serious problem with what some bankers predict as a new liquidity crisis.
It notes that it is not possible to issue, but unlike what was in June, short-term funding can be received using repo rates, which alleviates the crisis.
CECA rules out the next wave of savings-left mergers
The CECA CEO rejected yesterday that there should be another wave of savings bank mergers and again insisted on the speed with which the sector reorganisation is being carried out.
When he started the process of associating Spanish savings banks, there were several institutions that assured that they would not take part in this first phase and wait for the second round.
However, the Director General of the Spanish Confederation of Savings Banks (CECA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, yesterday ruled out that a new wave of these operations should be created.
"I believe that most of the merges have already been made, the incorporation of Cajasol into the Banca Cívica group cannot be considered as the second round, what is happening is the Cods."
"Most of it is completely implemented; it is possible that instead of 17 institutes we will go to 13 or 14, but all major processes are already finished and under the protection of the National Bank of Spain, which has worked very well together on this matter," the director noted.
In his statements at the ADEA meeting (Association of Leadgets and Executive Officials) Olavarrieta described the concentration process taking place "at the highest possible speed and we must be very satisfied, as is shown in the repayments that have appeared in the business plans with the Spanish National Bank in its time, not now," he stressed.
"Going from 45 savings banks with an average asset volume of 28,000 million to 17 with 75,500 million is a process that has no history of comparison, reducing the number of institutions by 62% to make them larger and thus underline in accordance with the Basel Treaty," he underlined.
Olavarrieta acknowledged that "there are a number of not-so-happy views on the slowness of the process" which show "lack of seriousness and understanding" because "it's what the National Bank of Spain is doing is a reminder that we have to be before the end of the year."
CECA CEO José Antonio Olavarrieta assured yesterday that Spain has the strictest financial system in Europe and "probably" in the world, and attributed to those who question it has given "a lack of knowledge."
The director noted that in the current favourable economic situation "we can be calm" about financial institutions and savings banks as well as a system that has mastered a "very important" concentration process and which continues at "the highest possible speed."
He also recalled that Spanish banking came out very well from the stress tests carried out by the European Central Bank in July.
Zapatero and red German line
Berlin decided to keep the euro, but set the conditions for the whole of the Union.
Tensions in the markets have provoked a double government response.
On the one hand, José Luis Zapatero proposed new adaptation measures, from tax cuts for SMEs, to regulating private brokerage agencies or the abolition of 426 euros for the unemployed without benefits, to the privatisation of 49% AENA (Spanish airports and air traffic management), airport administrators Barajas and El Prat and 30% state lottery.
Vice-President Elena Salgado, with the support of former Prime Minister Felipe González, on the other hand, has joined the criticisms of Chancellor Angela Merkel over her responsibility to start the current crisis.
How to interpret these moves?
Let it be said in advance that Merkel's position is not a mistake in her communication policy.
On the contrary, it is another point in the complex euro redefinition process.
And here, Germany has a radically new vision of what its future is supposed to be, which alludes to the idea of adhering to the old traditions adhered to by a large proportion of other members.
In the face of European backlash, three possible paths from the crisis are beginning to be speculated in Germany.
The first is a strong eurozone, which would include Germany, but also Austria or the Netherlands, for example, while the southern states would leave the monetary zone.
The second is a return to the mark - although it may now appear to be sci-fi, this version has a wide public support, approaching 50% of the population.
The third option, according to the German proposals, is the re-election of the euro with greater macroeconomic surveillance, budgetary aritness, fines for offending states, possible deferrals of payments for some of them, and with the extension of possible regulatory costs to the private sector.
The German position is clear and has been defined for some time, so there is no room for evasion now.
First, when both the International Monetary Fund and the European Commission raised deficits in 2009, the German government pulled a constitutional reform from its sleeve to prevent them from happening in 2016.
This was the first sign of contradiction between what Germany thought was right (both plans and the stability of public finances) and what its European partners, including France, practiced.
The second was shown by this Central European country when Merkel painfully dragged out the decision to save Greece.
It was already the subject of harsh criticism, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and the public opinion, which was also published, were strongly opposed to the rescue of Greece.
Finally, in the last days of October, Merkel reappeared with a clear view, calling for the European Union's conventions to be allowed to be allowed to be rescued by a Member State, while at the same time allowing private creditors to bear part of the costs.
This opinion was interpreted as anti-European as it accelerated the Irish crisis and everything else.
However, its proposal, although in a somewhat ablemised form, has been approved, and over the coming months we should follow the reform process of the Union, which should allow these measures from 2013.
Germany has set out a red line that it does not intend to cross.
And he tells us all that, although measures must now be taken that he seems to be very opposed to, from that date the old functioning of the euro will be over.
2013 will be the birth of a new currency zone in which the rules-breakdown states will be severely sanctioned and may be forced to announce the postponement of payments, and the private sector will also have to bear part of the cost.
Germany is suggesting that we need to be given a rigorous path of growth with an increase in the savings and investment rate, moderate consumption, improved productivity and competitiveness, and capital buffers.
Another option based on claims and building, with the enormous gaps in the balance of payments that prevailed in the years of the Spanish growth boom, is simply not intended to be tolerated.
The offer is clear.
And we'd make a mistake if we didn't understand.
This is not just about restoring the public deficit to 3% in 2013.
What they want us to do is much tougher.
And the worst part is that under these conditions, we might be mistaken for ourselves.
I hope this current turbulence will be replaced by more composure.
And that we would take the opportunity they give us by spring 2013.
Prime Minister Zapatero also seems to have understood this, and his double statement (the reform promised after meeting with the big business last Saturday and the announcement of the new measures yesterday) suggests that, through critics to Merkel, the path has been opened up to the idea of putting things right.
But the red line that Germany has set out is here, and it doesn't seem to want to move it.
And from the options to be considered, the exit of the eurozone full of not-so-good countries cannot be ruled out.
Well, Germany will always be able to tell us that it has warned us.
Sport and circumventing the rules
The phints shown by Alonso and Ramos in the match with Ajax show a wit, not an intention to escape the penalty.
The presumed drafted expels of two players from Real Madrid (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) in the Champions League match against Ajax on 23 November caused a sea of ink to be labelled whether or not this is unsportsmanlike conduct, and whether, or in the UEFA, should have both footballers punished.
As is known, a few minutes before the end of the game (which their team had clearly won) the named players, one by one, deliberately wasted time when the foul was about to be played to provoke the referee, who showed them a second yellow card.
In this way, both players will meet the prescribed penalty in the following match against Auxerre - with Real Madrid finishing in the lead in their group - and being able, stripped of their cards, to continue to the next stage.
In the end, the UEFA Disciplinary Board gave coach Jose Mourinho a two-game suspension and the offending players were fined.
Provoking a yellow card under similar conditions is no new practice, but is more or less common in football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos of football, rules that are unwritten but watched.
Part of the discussion in this case was due to the fact that its participant was the Real Madrid team (which boasts of generosity and honour in its anthem, and who has already fined his players for similar acts), and, it seems, thanks to a dramatisation led by Mourinho, who is thus adding another episode to his long history as a comedian and provocateur.
in any case, the debate revolves around whether this type of conduct, which is not expressly prohibited by the rules, is contrary to the principles of sport, that is to say, whether these acts circumvent the law are circumvented; these are indeed actions respecting the sporting rules, the meaning of which it seems.
It is being addressed the type of damage of such actions to the sporting spirit.
One of the precautions of sporting behavior is the physical inviolability of the opposing players, which has not been violated in these cases, or the violent game has not occurred.
Another of these formalities characterizing the clean game is to avoid players having an advantage over the opposing team because of their misdemeanor - which has not happened here either.
Thus, the paradox at the action of the Real Madrid players is the fact that there was no realisation of what we normally characterise as a ruse or circumvention of the law, there was no covert breach of the rules in order to avoid a penalty, but this behaviour should have been as noticeable as possible in order to receive the penalty.
They waited and were happy to receive the punishment.
But the other question is what advantage the culprits will have of their deliberate misdemeanor.
Here it is necessary to state that the opponent is not in a disadvantaged position and that he will achieve no benefit in the current match, as the evident consequence is that the team itself will have fewer players.
Nor is it a useful strategy for the next game, as the club will not be able to count on these players.
The advantage, apparently, is that the players will start the next stage of the Champions League without cards, which could threaten their participation in the future match.
However, this is an advantage from a long-term perspective and with a certain degree of uncertainty, that is, at first glance, the team may be eliminated, and beyond that with this negotiation, the players will take away, and they go to the second round of the cards, in which one less card is enough to be eliminated than in the first round.
So as the bikes continue, it will not be entirely clear whether this is an advantage.
In short, these negotiations do not go against the sporting spirit, which includes strategic decisions that make it possible to obtain the maximum benefit within the rules.
in the case we are dealing with here, the players were not to aim to avoid the granting of the punishment (which would be a clear case of circumventing the rules), but rather chose to submit to it.
They made a strategic decision without avoiding or fleeing punishment.
Although the line between wit and circumvention of the rules is not entirely clear, I believe that in this case it was clearly a wit.
It seems to me that the controversy arises for two reasons: because it was two self-assignment and the way in which the instructions to provoke them from the management took place.
The damage to sporting principles by these actions is not as ethical as aesthetic.
Fighting the offer for hosting Christmas parties in Barcelona
The calendar's dictate is concentrating an avalanche of bookings this year on December 16 and 17.
There is a fast increase in celebrations paid for by the employees themselves, who want to spend between 20 and 30 euros.
Like Turkish honey or lottery, with the arrival of December, the pre-Christmas parties are once again arriving, which still acts as an oxygen bomb for restaurants and leisure facilities in Barcelona, but have resulted in a fight to win clients by lowering prices: almost everyone wants to spend 20 to 30 euros on food, the industry's surveyed business and associations from the sector agree.
To complete the complication of the numbers, the calendar centered this year (when Christmas Eve fell on Friday) applications for the week from December 13, creating an avalanche of bookings for peak days (16th and 17th), whereas there was hardly any traffic in the previous week.
As has been the case since the lean years began in 2008, many of the companies that have cancelled the collective parties for budget reasons.
To keep traditions from leaving, many employees pay their spending at parties out of their own pocket.
Regardless of the situation, many are demanding prices on the verge of bearability, says the president of the restaurant association Gremi de Restauració de Barcelona, Gaieta Farras.
The patron saint of the restaurant is at the moment daring not to predict what the celebrations will be like this month.
"People will think twice before making the reservation."
"They want to come out, but they are cautious when it comes to the awards topic," he adds.
Shots will go well for those "who offer quality and good service at a favourable price," he says, recalling that thanks to the crisis, customers tend to go down a notch and most customers now want to spend around 25 euros.
A survey at various facilities shows that the biggest surge in booking requests is for the evening of December 17.
The Soteras Group is reporting a real boom in reservations this Friday, with the most requirements for spending up to 30 euros, to which they have adapted the offered menus, with total prices ranging from 25 to 30 euros.
in another major company that is Andilana, numbering 16 facilities in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), the peculiar feature of this year's calendar has brought more early bookings since early November.
"We have done the possible and impossible to keep the prices from last year, and our menus, from which everyone should choose, ranges from 19.95 to 30 euros," they report.
In the AN Grup group, which includes El Mussol, Attic, QuQu and a total of 23 businesses, they remain optimistic after seeing an increase in profits from the second half of the year and have a relatively solid outlook for Christmas sales.
Sources at the company stress that December 18 will also be a busy day as there will be pre-Christmas celebrations between friends.
to their six group menu added a Christmas menu, with a budget of 30 euros or more, as they saw a tendency for guests to spend 10% more in exchange for other items such as cava (Spanish sparkling wine).
They also noted that companies are already appearing to invite their employees, and the size of the groups seems to be slightly larger.
Vice President Fecasarm (which includes institutions such as the Association of Bar, Restaurants and Leisure Centres in Barcelona) Enric Goma believes it is beginning to see the end of the tunnel and claiming that the number of bookings has "succurately revived" even though clients "contract to the max."
This impression did not back down even during the Christmas celebrations, let it be true who pays, points out.
Pakistan's nuclear program spawned a great deal of unrest in the US
Islamabad produces atomic weapons at a "speed pace than any other country."
The Wikileaks documents confirm the taliban's tacit ties with the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the United States Embassy in Pakistan and the US State Department released by Wikileaks confirms the extraordinary unrest that averages Pakistan's nuclear program in Washington.
In addition to the elucidated and significant details they offer about the content of the communications and ideas of the representatives of North American diplomacy in Islamabad, these documents reveal that the cooperation between the two states in terms of nuclear safety, instead of increasing, "is in decline," and that this unstable Asian country produces "more nuclear weapons than any other state."
The peculiarity of Pakistan's nuclear program - that its weapons are not assembled, but are stored after the works to make it difficult to degrade them in the event of an attack - is one of the main reasons for Washington's vigilance.
This is calculated by the ambassador to Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson in one report before a visit to then-national security adviser James Jones: "The impurities of some nuclear facilities to the territory under the control of the Taliban, the alleged dispersal of nuclear materials and the vulnerability of the transport of atomic materials."
The increased number of people associated with the nuclear arsenals and the missile program is no longer only observed by the US, but also by Russia, as a spreading and presenting reason to be on the lookout.
"Pakistan had to hire staff with strict religious beliefs to protect nuclear facilities; given the decline in education and culture levels, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people who will work in nuclear or missile programs," said expert Yuri Korolev of the Russian Foreign Ministry at a meeting with his US counterparts.
The biggest news of the documentation published by Julian Assange's increasingly lower cooperation between the US and Pakistan on the topics of nuclear proliferation and the increased pace of Pakistani production of these weapons.
Deposits issued by the embassy in May, which will qualify for communication with Pakistan as "frustrating," claiming: "Transparency often does not exist; offers of aid remain unanswered or are rejected."
in another report, Peter Lavoy, a national intelligence official for South Asia, notes that "even through the economic disaster, Pakistan produces nuclear weapons as quickly as any other nation in the world."
Ambassador Petterson is also asking Washington to make it very clear during a visit by the army's head of the army, Ashfaq Kayani, that "the Pakistan army must put an end to the tacit support of the terrorist groups."
The hunt for the Wikileaks boss
Obama appoints a high-ranking member responsible for the fight against terrorism to avoid new leaks.
Interpol issues a "red challenge" to trace and determine where Assange might be.
Everything about Wikileaks and its founder, Julian Assange, is a complicated labyrinth where it is hard to be sure of the facts.
Interpol yesterday announced an "extraordinary appeal," the so-called red notice, to "localize and track movement" for Assange.
However, this is not a classic detention order.
Moreover, this call is not new, but dates back to 20 November.
And he has nothing to do with the latest leak of more than a quarter of a million diplomatic documents, but with allegations of sexual abuse that the Australian is facing in Sweden.
In addition, Wikileaks' attorney assures the creator of Wikileaks, Mark Stephens, that "the police know where and how to contact with Mr. Assange."
It was on November 20 when the College of International Police, based in Lyon, France, issued the order at the request of Sweden, but did not disclose it until yesterday, when it received permission from the Swedish authorities.
In this situation, 188 Interpol countries have instructions to identify or locate Assange "with the aim of imposing a temporary link and extradite him."
Although Interpol cannot order the detention of a person affected by the red call, many Member States, as the organisation explained, consider the so-called red notice to be able to execute the arrest - this must be ensured by the national police force - especially when the states have a bilateral extradition agreement, as in the case of Sweden and England, where Assange should appear to be.
The move scorched Assenge's attorneys who published a letter yesterday claiming that the 39-year-old founder of Wikileaks had shown a willingness to answer questions from the Swedish authorities by videoconferencing.
They also recall that Assenge requested and subsequently received permission to leave Sweden from the prosecutor of his case, which they compare with the legendary Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, the head of Stalin's security.
"This is a hunt and not a legal pursuit," the letter says.
While the whole world is looking for him - and from Australia his mother defends her son's innocence - Assange is still in an unknown place, but he is silent.
On Monday, via Skype, he gave an interview from the unknown venue to the editor-in-chief of Time magazine, calling for the resignation of U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
"If it turns out that it was responsible for ordering US diplomats to conduct espionage at the United Nations to violate the international conventions that the United States has signed, it should resign," he said.
His opinion was rejected yesterday by the White House press secretary, Robert Gibbs, who qualified the resignation demand as "ridiculous and absurd."
"I'm not quite sure why we should care about the opinion of the individual who runs the website," he told CNN.
Obama himself commissioned a senior official responsible for the fight against terrorism, Rusella Traverse, to prevent further leaks of the documents.
President Barack Obama's spokesman's intention to stop adding to Assange's importance contrasts with the views praised by conservative politicians and commentators these days.
Peter King, a congress member who will chair the National Security Committee in the Lower House from January onwards, asked the State Department to explore the possibility of including Wikileaks among terrorist organisations "so that anyone can be prosecuted and prosecuted who would contribute or otherwise provide assistance to them."
Tom Flanagan, an adviser to Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper, went further, saying that Assange should be "slaughtered," which he subsequently had to recall.
"Obama should put a reward on him or use an unmanned aircraft or something like that."
Who did not apologize was Mike Huckabee, a Baptist priest, former governor of Arkansas, and a possible presidential candidate.
"Whoever is in the government, whoever is responsible for the leak of the information, has committed treason and any punishment other than execution would be too lenient," he said at Fox
Puigcercós seeks peace in the ERC by "sailing" at the follower of Caroda
The Republican leader will allow the party a secret ballot to remain.
Huguet proposes a more plural executive and the end of the meeting system.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found a recipe to fight the umpteenth internal revolt in the ranks of the ERC (Left Republican Republican Party of Catalonia), fruitless due to the loss of 11 MPs and half of the votes.
The party chairman is aware that his gesture for resignation seems insufficient to the supporters of former leader, Josep Lluins Carod-Rovira, and also knows that the sector's influence is now as weakened as its leader himself, and that he absolutely cannot be as worried as he was with other extinct currents.
That is why the Levice leader will seek to win new reviews by fumbling to help him steean himself into the municipal elections.
First, Puigcercós announced yesterday that more than 200 members of the national committee could secretly speak out on his tenure.
With the ballots, not by raising the hand.
If supporters of Carodo want to give the chairman a penalty vote, they will be able to do so without fear of retaliatory measures.
In fact, the boss wants to avoid a split and subjugate his person.
He argued in several interviews that he would not consider himself confirmed with half of the vote and one extra, but added, without specifying the percentages, that it would not also be a good result "on the Bulgarian."
Supporters of Carod are asking the chairman to do more than make his post available - which they see as a gesture that carries no weight, as Puigcercós controls the largest organ at the downhills.
But since they don't have enough of a majority to force resign, they'll try to remind the executive of the plan from now until May.
This is why they expect to participate in the drafting of a strategy reorientation document that the leadership will give the National Council to vote on the national council on the 18th of the month.
Their aim is to support Puigcercós in exchange for this promise to move the congress into the autumn of 2011.
The ERC leader said that "multi-vote" was damaging to stability, and that his goal was for the organization to be able to wash its dirty laundry behind closed doors once and for all.
in this context, the article that current advisor Josep Huguet signed on his blog seems to be symptomatic.
After taking into consideration Puigcercós's ideologue, this innovation adviser took the fait accompli that the leader would be confirmed "in exchange for several goals."
And he named five of them, two of which excel.
The first is to "reconcimate" the executive to represent at least 90% of the members, which also means including new faces who are from the sector-friendly to Carod.
The second target may be a big novelty.
Huguet proposes that the ERC should put an end to the meeting as a working mechanism.
So he is fighting to reform the statutes to hold congresses through the delegates selected by the vote.
The end of the model of the meeting system, the exemption in the Spanish system of political parties, is the intended goal of the Puigcercós team, which has fought in this direction at the last two congresses.
However, the convulsive assembly of 2008 decided that the meeting must be assessed at a special congress on the reform of the statutes.
This matter is still pending, as the situation within the party has discouraged a solution to this matter.
Now, without the lurking critical sectors, it might be a good time to revisit the matter and try to close it once and for all.
23 murdered for the month of November; 390 for 2010
According to MILENIO, Mexico recorded a decrease of 4 cases compared to 2010.
During November, 23 people were killed in Mexico, four fewer than in the previous month, as reported by MILENIO.
The murders are the case with the cases of three women and the discovery of a pair of separate bodies in the Valley of Mexico.
in the penultimate month of the year, Mexico has a total of 390 kills, presumably linked to organised crime.
Among the cases, the discovery of a corpse in San Diego de los Padres Cuexcontitlan, in the district of Toluca, is prominent.
The victim suffered at least three gunshot wounds, a coup dunk to the head, and her arms and legs were bound by a rope.
The next day, the body was found in a suitcase that was stored in the luggage compartment of the vehicle over Mixtecas Street, in the colony of Santa Cruz Acatlán, in the district of Naucalpan.
Early in the morning of Thursday, November 4, the co-cooperatives discovered a body carrying signs of torture and at least three fatal missiles in the chest off the Tenango-Ixtapan de la Sal in the section of Villa Guerrero.
Next to the body was a report signed by the probably criminal organisation La Familia Michoacana.
A day later, a man in Nezahualcóotl was murdered with eight shots, after he left his home and wanted to start collecting garbage.
On November 7th, two victims, aged 30 in the colony of San Pedro Xalaxtoc, in the Ecatepec district, were killed by a gunshot shot to the head.
in Chalco, on a secluded road in El Naranjo colony, the corpse of a man shot to the forehead was found, and a cartridge from a 12-caliber weapon was found under the body.
in Ecatepec, human body parts were found in the sewage sewer in the Playa Golondrina colony.
The rescue services carried out a thorough search for other parts of it, but they were not found.
Residents of the Temototlana reported the discovery of the body with their hands tied back and his head wrapped in the place of Pena Colorado.
The man had a shot from a firearm at the back of his head.
in the middle of the month, the murder of two men who were packed in the bed linen and left in the luggage compartment of the vehicle in the Villas de la Hacienda district of Atizapán de Zaragoza was reported, with reports of death threats also found in the victims.
A day later, she was found in the column of Valle de los Reyes in the district of Los Reyes La Paz cardboard box, which contained a human head.
in the nearby colony, the rest of the body was found, wrapped in a black plastic bag, with a message from El Incorreregible.
Two dead women were found on the 17th, wrapped in bed linen in the settlement of Zoquiapan in the district of Ixtapaluca, and the next morning a man was found in the Huixquilucan, wrapped in a yellow-blue sheet, which was provisionally identified as Mario Ríos, according to a report by the killers left by his body.
Ixtapaluca was found in the San Francisco settlement of Acuautla with no signs of life with two blows to the back of the neck.
The woman's skin tattoo was discovered on the skin of the sacred figure of Santa Muerte (literally "The Sacred Death"), as well as necklaces with her likeness.
At the end of the month, a man's corpse was found in the village of Zinacantepec in a car with at least a third gunshot wounds and a report signed by a criminal group.
Two days later, the bodies of two men were found wearing a head wrapped in tape and were also found in the village of Puente de Piedra, in Santiago Tepatlaxco.
For the victims, the report was probably written by one of the criminal organizations, which read: "This will happen to those who do not adapt."
in Ecatepec, two bodies were found, bearing signs of torture and bound with limbs, inside an abandoned taxi behind the Justice Centre in the San Agustín Colony.
On the last day of the month, the remains of two men were found in the districts of Los Reyes La Paz and Nezahualcóotl.
The first was beheaded and found in the colony of Cuchilla Ancón and was wrapped in black plastic bags, tied with tape, and kept with the message; while the second was tortured and was found in a plastic wrapper in the streets of Colonia Juárez.
Together with him, the agents found a note with the message.
China adheres to its goal of reducing greenhouse gases
At the UN climate change conference, a representative of the country assured COP16 that his country had made an extraordinary effort to reduce the carbon footprint, specifying that he insisted on his promise to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45% by 2020.
China will keep its promise to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45% in 2020, Su Wei, a representative of the country at the UN climate change conference, assured.
In his first public appearance at the 16th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, Su Wei assured that his country had made immense efforts to reduce the carbon footprint and transform it into its industry.
He said his country had already invested $245 million over the past four years in efforts to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions.
But he said that China would not change its goals and would continue to work on the matter with the international community.
He reported that China's climate change strategy was divided into the following four items: dialogue, capacity building, institution-building and support for pilot programmes.
They have already made progress on all of these points, including last year's approval of the new Energy Act, which includes the proposed targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, he explained.
He also stressed that in China, federal authorities had cooperated in a coordinated manner with provincial and local authorities to achieve their goals in terms of energy saving, efficient use of energy and emissions reduction.
Furthermore, as he has said, various multi-year plans are being carried out or have already been completed, funded by both the Chinese government and the governments of other nations.
For example, it is, as it has said, the Energy Efficiency Applied Programme, which has been in place over the last five years, and which has received investment from the UN, the government and the private initiative.
There is also a provincial climate change project, a project to replace fluorescent lamps with energy-saving light bulbs and a mitigation and adaptation project, he clarified.
At the same table, Martin Krol, the country's expert adviser on climate change, assured that China's efforts were greater than is widely meant.
For example, he has described, greenhouse gas emissions per capita represent 6 tonnes in China, while in the United States it is 100 tonnes; China is responsible for 9% of the historical share of emissions.
It has also made unprecedented efforts to use energy - for example, it has increased energy efficiency by 20% over the last five years and expects to make further progress by 2020, he added.
The enamel of the exclusion of Espina: César Nava
The national chairman of the PAN party (Partido Acción Nacional, Czech National Action Party - re-re) said that the former chairman of the party was entitled to claim his law from the National Order Commission of the Law.
The national chairman of the PAN party, César Nava Vazquez, assured that the exclusion of Manuel Espina Barriens had been enacted and that the former chairman of that party was entitled to turn to the National Order Commission to seek his right.
said in an interview made before the State's nomination was raised by the state's governor, Gabon, Cué Monteagud, that the exclusion of Espin was in any event a decision taken at local level.
"This is an autonomous decision of the Sonora Committee's Order Commission."
"Pan Espino has the right to turn to the National Council's REP's REP's Financial Committee by way of a complaint in his case to make a decision made by the competent authority," he added.
He further explained that this was not the time to think about 2012, and that she had never been to the negotiating table for the alliance's presidential candidacy.
Nava Vázquez expressed his belief that PAN would emerge from the internal elections held on the following 4 and 5 December, in which his successor will be elected, strengthened.
"This (Alianance in 2012) is a topic that has never been at the negotiating table, at least not for the time being, it was the intention for the local elections, which was successful and fulfilled its purpose," he said.
The PAN president said that 71 years of dialogue were behind his party and therefore "we are not alarmed by internal competition, on the contrary, we are benefiting from it and strengthening us," he added.
He said the committee could, without question, elect the best chairman or chairwoman, whom PAN deserved for the next three years, so he would hand over the relay to "whom the committee appoints."
"So I am absolutely calm and relaxed, to whom of the five of the five I will be proud to hand over the office of party chairman."
He predicted that the rise the party had seen in the last election in the last elections of July would be reflected in future races, although "there is still no time to think about 2012."
"Now we need to accompany the governor, Gabon Cué, on this task."
In this context, he stressed that the three governments, rooted in the alliances in the Oaxace, Pueble and Sinaloe, would be a flag and would be the subject of observation across the country, as "multimate many expectations and desires are embedded in them, and I am sure that Gabon will live up to these expectations."
When we asked him about the critics of President Felipe Calderón by the PRI (Partido Revolucionario Institucional, Czech Revolutionary Institutional Party)) because of his speeches in the four years he rules, César Nava called on PRI members to think about the six-year periods of former presidents Ernest Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
"If the PRI believes that the governments of Zedillo and Salinas were better than the governing of Fox and Claderón, then let them start defending them, let them come out of their shell," he agreed.
He argued that the head of the federal executive branch was entitled to express himself as he did during his speech at the National Auditorium, as gagging or censorship is not used in this country.
Obama promotes a Twitter bill to support undocumented students
"If you think that passing the Dream Act is correct, let your senators know and pledge to pass this bill," the US president tweeted on the popular social network.
President Barack Obama today, with a post on his personal Twitter account, joined the national mobilization to support the Dream Act Act, which should legalize students with no documents.
"If you think that passing the Dream Act is right, let your senators know and pave them pass this bill," Obama tweeted.
His short report draws attention to an online link to a more comprehensive document that asks the public to contact the senators immediately as the vote on this bill is imminent.
"Since the vote is expected to take place soon, now is the moment, to let your opinion be heard," he points out.
The report was released after 42 Republican senators threatened to block the passage of any law unless the extension of the Bush-era tax cut and government funding was not approved.
Such a blocking, which was announced by a letter signed by 42 Republican senators, could be influenced by the vote on the Dream Act and other projects, such as the ratification of the new treaty with Russia against nuclear proliferation, called START.
When asked about the Republican blocking of the Dream Act and other proposals, the presidential spokesman said he believed that once the fiscal issue was resolved, a calendar could be drawn up for the rest of the projects.
"I believe there's still plenty of time to do..."
"We all agree that we must resolve the tax issue before the end of the year ..."
I believe that we will be able to reach an agreement on this at some point and then we will be able to plan the order of other matters," he said.
Democratic Majority Leader Harry Reid announced on Tuesday that he would ask for a "vote to conclude a debate" on the Dream Act, so the motion to legalise undocumented students could be voted on in the Senate from next Thursday, although next week is more likely.
Senate approval of the Dream Act, or the "American Dream" Act, would be legalized by the roughly 800,000 young people who came to the United States before the age of 16, have resided in the country for the past five years, and have been admitted to the institution of higher education or the military.
But supporters need 60 votes to approve the draft, which is why they need the help of several Republicans, so his adherents' organizations are conducting an intensive agitation to ensure the passage of the bill.
Democrats, whose majority of the Dream Act support, have 58 seats.
However, at least one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, said he would vote against, and only one Republican, Richard Lugar of Indiana, expressed his support for the law.
That's why Senators in the Dream Act need to win several Republicans in case other Democrats decide to reject the proposal.
Among the Republican senators with whom the supporters negotiate the most, Senators from Maine Olympia Snowe and Susan Colins are the outgoing Florida senator, George Lemieux, who added Senator Mela Martínez's mandate.
Other Republicans who supported the Dream Act in the past are Orrin Hatch of Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchison from Texas, but they said they would not support it next time.
Another Republican who supported the proposal, John Mccain, has yet to comment at this point.
Although the House of Representatives is leaning toward a different version, according to a majority of analysts, the Dream Act will face the biggest obstacles in the Senate.
with literature they put their finger in the wound ("poner el dedo en la llaga", translated "put your finger to the wound" is the equivalent of the Czech "to strike the clove on the head).
The second round of the cycle Pleasing to the Language was a promenade where the participants performed a literary gala
"I understand that Sex in the language, but... A finger to the wound? What is expected of me?", asked the writer Luisa Valenzuel, who was invited to start the second round of Pleasure from the Language, a cycle that celebrates literature written in Spanish, and whose question was used as a subtitle on this occasion (at another trade fair, they addressed the Sex in the Language theme at the roundtable, she explained).
The finger "inslege into the wound, the Argentine-born novelist said to the audience, composed mostly of young people, who gathered at the Guadalajara International Book Fair to hear this roundtable debate, moderated by Marisol Schultz, and with the participation of Valenzuel, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Monter and Luis García Montera.
Luisa Valenzuel read the text she gave to Gonzal to Celor, which Schultz then described as a great story in which Luisa first appeared as the protagonist who, in search of the "kill" of what "home" goes from doctor to doctor from doctor, from which she does not get answers, though the footprint of the same story is.
From the infectolog, the convinced person is: 'patience is not my strong suit, maybe it will be my shot'.
Finally, after a frustration with a trauma surgeon who took her breath away in the middle of the road, but explained that the wound was not a scientific term, a psychoanalyst who reveals the secret: 'the gate is really open and the symbolic is the scar'.
The protagonist sighed in a light and concluded that "she had only learned so much about the blow that she was really outspoor and that she did not exist," but she became convinced that the pleasures and pitfalls in the language must go hand in hand.
The writer Valenzuel played with both.
Nicaraguek Sergio Ramírez also came out with a delightful narrative, which he called Praise of Invention, in which the toe is not named in the wound, but appears at one point.
with elements of magical realism, it tells of a glorious witch who played the clouds, brought back people who had gone far, or made up for the honesty that one virgin had lost, this narrative, which was then turned to be spoken by America, a great novel that had not missing his own chroniclers who told him from the outset, and is quoted here as the Bernal Díaz del Castillo, who criticizes the exaggeration of the conquest of the conquerors' narration.
"Cervantes, who invented us all (the writer), mocked the fake testimonies that were presented in the stories as real, but in other ways it has never been possible to tell the story of America with such an imagery that lacked even shame."
However, he pointed out, "they are fools and liars who have a greater imagination" and it is where reality and a lie blend in, where it is no longer known which of the story belongs to one group and what to the other, fictional literature reaches its climax.
He calls it a truly "Cervant tradition."
"Thanks to his legacy, we have what we have."
Subsequently, Mayra Monter emphasized and praised the diversity of interpretations that the invitation of the International Book Fair with her sanging The Finger to the Screw allowed.
The Cuban-Pomestic opera writer has pointed her finger at the big blow of social violence that passes through her country - and is shared by Latin America - and is the result of trade disputes and drug sales.
"I think that good literature, good poetry and good songs conclude a tacit compromise that is not intended, of course," she said, after stating that the reality of literature is the communication and dimension of the compromise that is created between the author and the readers - and in their "chemical reaction."
The evening was concluded by the Spanish poet Luis García Montero, whose performance also emphasized "on this finger in the wound of a writer-ridden writer."
He said that in a world that lives in haste, also in intellectual habits and the control of consciousness, which is brimming with dogmatisms, it is forgotten "that behind each affiliation there is a small no, and behind every denial there is also a small yes."
"To be masters of our ideas and realities, we must color: and to colour it means putting your finger in the wound many times and harassing those individuals who are much more comfortable, since they think in cartoons, in black and white, in fixed ideas and without the timbre, and to harass the authorities that prefer this black-and-white world," he said to support the meaning of writing.
Romano goes for his first title
Rubén Omar Romano has three defeats in the final, having experienced both good and bad during his career, but has already achieved a three-pocketing streak on the deciding series.
in the Santos Laguna and Monterrey duel in the final, two different styles will be met, characterized by their techniques, teams that have a noticeable difference in results between them.
Rubén Omar Romano has three defeats in the finals, having experienced both good and bad during his career, but has been able to reach the three-time series on the decisive series, but until now he has left with nothing butered, which is why this chance is extraordinary for him.
The Argentine had to settle for the silver medal, remaining a step behind the winner and curiously playing the following final with the same team.
As a coach, the Santasist strategist reached his first final in the 2002 Apertura 2002 tournament, wearing the reins of the Morelia club, with whom he fell to a 4-2 overall against Tolucca; then, in the 2004 tournament, Clausura again advanced to the decider and also lost it to a total score of 3-1, which was against Rayados.
Already with Santos Laguna in the Torneo Bicentenario 2010, again against the "Devils" of Toluka, Rubén suffered a defeat again, although his team played against the "Dedes" (the club's other nickname Deportivo Toluca - note) after 210 minutes of play a draw 2-2, after a series of penalty shootings he got the advantage of three to one and had two opportunities to seal the title, but in the end his three-players missed from 11 paces and the team thus suffered a turnaround at 4-3.
Rubén has already lost two finals against the "Red Devils" of Toluka and one against Monterrey, his future rival, so he would like to avoid the same fate and get rid of the curse, and be able to celebrate the title for the first time, though he says the most important thing for him is the institution.
"I want to come out as a winner, I don't want to break statistics, this is for the club, for the passion I'm in debt, and the title would be for me, of course, but the first one is the most important," the coach commented when he was asked about the numbers that speak against him in the final.
in living memory has the previous final, in which he confirms he has learned a lot, "we have learned a lesson that until the referee doesn't turn on the end, we can't celebrate, we have to be ready for action, as well as the players, because last time with two penalties, we were already ready to run out to celebrate, and I think we have learned this in this, we cannot celebrate."
He is not concerned that this series could be decided in penalty shootings, he trusts his players: "You never try to make a series of penalty kicks, you try to finish in a normal time, but sometimes there is no other option and it is necessary to be prepared for it, we were prepared in the last tournament, but unfortunately fate has been prepared for us, perhaps because of the nerves or anguish we felt when the title was in our hands, but we lost it, that left us with something and hope that this time something like this will not happen."
In his hands, Romano has a chance to stop being the other and taste for the first time the glory that titles bring.
U.S. changes visa granting rules
People will have to turn to the Service centres for visa applicants before the interview in the Consign Department; the costs will be lower and the waiting time will be shortened.
From 10 January 2011, the visa preset process will be changed at the United States Embassy and consulates.
with the new procedure, most of the applicants will have to contact the Service for Visit Applications Centre (AASC) before the interview at the Consulary Department.
The staff from the ASC shall withdraw the biometric information of the applicant and will be assessed by the Consulatory department before the interview.
The new procedure will have certain advantages, among which the following are calculated:
The total cost of processing the visa will be lower, no longer a fee will be payable for the meeting, the second for the processing of the application and others for the delivery of the document by the transport service.
The applicant will only pay a single fee to cover all three services.
The current tariff will remain unchanged: the figure equivalent to $140 for a tourist visa, $150 for cases of applications (including visas for temporary workers) and $390 for a visa for traders and investors.
People who want to renew their visa will not have to interview the consulator with the consulator, but will only contact the nearest ASC, where they will submit their documents and take their fingerprints.
As the biometric information will be taken to ASC, applicants who will require a second meeting with an interview at the Consulatory Unit will spend a shorter time here than in the past.
Likewise, those applying for a visa at the consulates in Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo will no longer pay an extra fee for the $26.

NASA announces discovery of extraterrestrial life
The U.S. Space Agency has called a press conference for tomorrow to present a discovery that could cause a break in the search for extraterrestrial life.
The United States' National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) will announce an astrobiological discovery tomorrow, Thursday, that could corroborate the theory of the existence of extraterrestrial life.
The discovery will be presented tomorrow at 1 p.m. by experts in astrobiology, a science that studies the origins, evolution, dissemination, and future of life in space, at a press conference at NASA's headquarters in Washington.
When she invited journalists, NASA assured that it would present "the discovery that will cause a break in the search for extraterrestrial life," which aroused speculation by experts from other countries.
The discovery could confirm the theory that there are, in addition to us, other creatures living in inhospitable conditions that were considered uninhabitable, and who might represent the possibility that they would one day become intelligent creatures like humans, if the conditions in which they live improve.
In the appearance, it is a microbe found at the bottom of Lake Mono in the Yosemista National Park in California, where it lives in an environment that was considered too poisonous for any form of life, as the lake is rich in arsenic.
The creature somehow uses the arsenic to live, and it is this ability that increases its ability to make a similar life occur in other planets that have no atmosphere like the atmosphere on Earth.
According to astrobiologists, if these organisms use arsenic in their metabolism, it will be proven that "there is a different, second form of life, different from the one we know."
The space agency will announce the real reach of the discoveries at tomorrow's press conference.
The conference will be attended by geobiologist Pamela Conrad, who studies the possibility of life to exist on Mars; the biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists who examine Titan (the largest moon of Saturn), with the prospect of its chemical composition being similar to that of Earth.
PRD, PT, Covergencia and Patrón produce opposition "block"
Reforms of the Constitutional Congress Act lead to the arrival of "Biphartism," they claim.
The 60th parliamentary term was not even launched when the opposition bloc, led by members of the PRD parties (Partido de la Revolución Democrática, Czech for "Prana of the Democratic Revolution" - note for), PT (Partido del Trabajo, Czech for "Prana práce" - topped.), Convergencia (Czech "Conformity" to pour and Jesús Manuelol Patrón Montal, who declared himself independent, and these four discussed one thing: the arrival "Accession "Income "Conformity" and Jesús by Manuel Patrón Montal, who declared himself independent, and the four discussed one thing: the arrival "The Bibboartism" to the House.
Before the start of the session at the start of the 1960s parliamentary term, Felipe Manzanarez Rodriguez of the Convergencia, Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza of the PT, Javier Corvera Quevedo from the PRD and Patrón Montalvo "playing" against the reform of the Constitutional Act as it eliminated them.
With this reform, they reiterated, "Bapartism" begins, because now it will be two people from the same number of parties who will control Congress.
These four MPs, together with Gloria Margarita Santos Aquilare, the PRD coordinator, were the only ones who voted against the Council, led by Salvador Lopez, by PAN (Partido Acción, Czech for "National Action Party" - re-pays) and Luis Cárdenasemem Fonseca as vice president.
Corvera Quevedo said that these reforms institutionalized the political marginality at the instigation of the PRI (Partido Revolucionario Institucional, Czech "Revolutionary Institutional Party") and PAN.
He specified that during the coming days they would talk to the representatives of the PAN and PRI parties to modify the scheme on the basis of political will, and if they do not, they would again be subjected to these two parties, ending the opposition coalition.
"When I came here (the opposition coalition), I look at it, because we are excluded from any decision, they don't even have a willingness to consider the opinion of others."
Felipe Manzanarez Rodriguez, on the part of Convergencia, said that they were aligned with the PRD, PT and Patrón and therefore forming a pluralist group.
It is impossible to allow, to continue, that Congress, after being monopoly, now be "duopoolem."
The airbrium of the law's reform is not to make congressional endless bipartism.
This group begins with five lawmakers, and its members are now talking with other colleagues to win more votes, as Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez added.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, from the PT, explained that at the moment Congress has become "the scorch" of two - in reference to the PAN and PRI parties.
"It was previously controlled by only one side, and today it is divided by two."
Patrón asked Montalvo to respect the personality of the MP, to be given a seat at the negotiating table.
"For the five Members of Us, of which there are likely to be already nine, but they see us at five right now, because of the vaulted agreements, each in a different faction, we have united to find a seat at the negotiating table, as the problem is that we stand outside the reform they have formed and agreed to, and we do not agree with this reform."
More 200,000 pesos are issued for the "supplier"
The town hall in Mazatlán will pay another cheque discussed to the owner of the company supplying the electromaterial.
Another check for a little more than 200,000 pesos was sent by City Hall to Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos.
This will be the sum paid in this second half of the owner of the company supplying the electric series to rise to 1,200,000 pesos.
According to the transparency page of the town hall, this last check, No. 9258447, was sent on 16 November of this year, was issued for a sum of 200.144,56 pesos and the subject of "reparing outstanding payments" was listed as its subject.
Treasury Luis Miguel López Moreno noted that the municipality will pay this contractor, who was monitored by the High State Review Office for selling at high prices, with another amount of money.
What was not said is the total amount that the board still owes her, and how many cheques will be sent to Camacho Palazuelos.
"Nothing has been purchased now, it is merely paid for what we owe it, as well as to other suppliers," he said in an interview.
The last cheques "released" in the last quarter of the year: 24 September, two days 15. October, 19. October, 29. October and this last November.
Although the entrepreneur has not yet been published in the Governmental Gazette, as the law states in the case of the firms examined by the High State Review Board, in order to prevent their services from being used by other administrative bodies, the treasurer assured that the services were not used by the City Hall's contractors again.
the previous time, after 25. July, Noroest published a review of the cheques issued by City Hall to its contractors, which revealed that between March 2008 and 9 a.m. July 2010, during the three-year period of Mayor Jorge Abel López Sánchez, the city of Camacho Palazuelos paid more than 10 million pesos through 42 cheques.
It also carried out transactions with Jumapam, where it collected cheques for more than 3 million pesos.
Tourist jobs in urgent need of maintenance
Tourist managers complain in connection with the accident of a foreign tourist about the poor condition of the Sánchez Taboada party in Mazatlán.
After the fall of a foreign tourist to a hollow at the Sánchez Taboada's Suzhea's gaze, the Lubatlan tourism sector is asking the authorities to pay attention to areas and places that are in poor condition, so as not showing the harbor in a good light.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, president of the Zona Dorado Territory Traders' Association, recalled that they had repeatedly asked for the impression of the destination to be taken care of, and the bad things tourists find here in order to be replaced by new activities or routes.
He said that the poor state of the streets and sidewalks was affecting tourists walking around and seeing a mess, which adversely affects nearby businesses.
"Politicians don't know what it's like to close a business for a day, and they have no idea about the sales that are leaking, otherwise they wouldn't have dealt with these matters for so long and without proper planning."
Hotelier José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said the fall of the tourist was caused by a lack of preventive measures and maintenance from the City Hall.
"The town hall will have to take responsibility and prevent something like this from happening again, it will have to devote to preventive maintenance, not just to correct existing defects," he said.
We would like to enjoy a clean city, as it is not only because of the fact that we are a tourist area, maintenance should be done, after all, even as residents we deserve a clean residence, the town hall should change its maintenance strategy".
There are other places that look neglected and pathetic, he noted, such as the mazatal Emblehy and El Venadito (monument, the deer's statue).
"Nowadays, for tourists to come, it is not just the promotion that matters, it is necessary to offer a good product, a city abounding the cleanliness of its beaches and streets where the permanent maintenance of tourist attractions is carried out," he said.
"The attention required of this was not reflected in this, and these facts emphasize something that is well known to all, the maintenance is lacking.
He talked about a number of places to be put in order in cooperation with the town hall, he said the priority must be to keep the city clean and fit to make it attractive because it has tourist potential.
Raúl Llera Martínez, the subsecutor of the Tourist Promoo, said that the rescue of tourist sites in Mazatlano was urgent as they were not properly used and did not make a good impression.
Fortunately, Mazatlan offers many historical and cultural goals and space, but it will be necessary to put in order first to make these places more attractive and to be able to put them on the list we have to promote this destination'.
IP requests results from Congress
Eduardo Dávalos, the president of the CCE, would like MPs to take on a great responsibility by setting an example in the search for a better Sinaloa, in the various challenges facing the state.
A parliamentary term full of decent work and without agreements between the parties and the State Executive Board is demanding the business sector in Mazatlán, as Sinaloa is in convulsing and facing major problems.
Since yesterday, the 60th parliamentary term, consisting of seven political forces, 19 PRI MPs, 13 from PAN, three by the Partido Nueva Alianza party, two from the PRD, one from the PT, one from the Convergencia party and the last of the PVEM party, has been launched, comprising a total of 40 national representatives.
The list of expectations of the new members of Congress is to be able to implement decent leadership, with commitments to society and various areas that require responsible legislative work, and that the same party and paternalistic patrons will not be repeated.
Eduardo Dalawos Zamora, chairman of the Coordinating Business Council (CCE), proposed that the recently elected 40 members of Congress take on a great deal of responsibility and set an example on the way to the better Sinaloa in the various challenges it faces.
"We expect that Members will actually exercise their right, without agreements between the parties, because they usually make measures to promote their own interests and become carnival parades of the rulers and the leaders of the parliamentary factions."
That is why he talked about the need to reaffirm the commitment to establish the necessary bridges to move the ruling forward in order.
"We want them to do a decent job and, above all, be committed to society and the sectors, because it was the people of Sinaloa who gave them the confidence vote in the last election."
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, president of the Tres Islas Hotel Association, has commented that one of the biggest challenges for 40 national representatives will be to gather all the forces in an effort to achieve the country's economic growth, because the current economic situation is very difficult.
The most important thing is that they encourage economic growth, to create incentives for investment and infrastructure, which will encourage job creation in a certain way'.
As for tourism, he asked that the new legislators give him more weight within the state budget and support the Ministry of Tourism.
"I have learned that it is a ministry with the second lowest budget, which is disproportionate, given that this is an important economic activity, bringing currency and investment that, moreover, directly competes with agriculture."
In addition, to issue funds for starter tourism projects, Congress should help the state deliver to security and help with the Alcohol Act, which has failed to be resolved in previous parliamentary periods.
Searching for the Three Kings
Dolls, cars and bicycles are, along with other toys on the children's wish list in the Coronado Valenzuel family.
It will be difficult for their parents to meet their expectations on the upcoming Three Kings Festival, as their household is exactly 12 people and one ram.
But Adelaida, Isabel, Jesús, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaaas, José Juan and Miguel do not lose hope that Kaspar, Melichar and Balthazar would give them the toys and clothes they so desire.
The family lives in a modest dwelling in the village of Colonia Salvador Allende in poor circumstances, as the father has no permanent job.
"Sometimes we have a hard time, because my husband is unlucky, but we sell tangerines and potatoes... In the afternoon I go out with the "plebejci" on the street to sell on the street," said Cayetana Valenzuel Andrade, the children's mother.
Four-year-old Adelaida wishes for a doll or a bicycle, while her three-year-old sister Isabel would like a Barbie doll.
As for 10-year-old José Alfred, he would like a car for a while, and for his eight-month-old brother Jesús, Cayetana would like a one-year-old dress.
"He (José Alfredo) 'I would wish this monster car', but I told him 'we'll see his son' because it was very expensive," he recalls with the sadness of Cayetana.
For older children who were at school, the ideal outfit and shoes would be ideal.
María Guadalupe, who is 11 years old, is a size of 12, a 10-year-old Isaías size 10, while eight-year-old Miguel wears a size 8.
Jose Juan, 14,a-year-old misses, so he could use a couple of five and a half or six sizes.
To help make the sons of the Coronado's Valenzuel family come true, you can participate in the "Searching for the Three Kings" campaign, and bring a gift or cash at the Noroeste reception.
14 suspected drug traffickers who were arrested
Dozens of searches were carried out in the Estrian, Wednesday, as part of the destruction of the network for the production and sale of Indian cannabis.
Fourteen people have been arrested and are facing various charges.
Tours took place in Sherbrook, Orford and Stoke, mostly in places used to make drugs.
"Approximately 750 Indian cannabis beds, four kilograms of hashish, money and equipment that was used for production was seized," said Louis-Philippe Ruel, a spokesman for the Quebec police.
In all, eleven men and three women were arrested, both of whom the supposed bosses of this entire network, two men from Sherbrook.
The people arrested had to attend the judicial palace in Sherbrook after their arrest.
They could face charges of Indian cannabis manufacturing, possession of it with the aim of trading it, conspiracy and theft, among other things.
These searches were held subsequently following a long-term investigation that lasted almost a year.
"It was the information we received from the public that allowed us to proceed with these arrests," said M. Ruel.
This police operation involved 70 officers of the regional department of the investigation of the city of Estrie State Police of Quebec, the Sherbrook State Police and the Sherbrook Police Administration Memphrémagog.
Illegal migration will be able to continue without difficulty.
The Conservative bill, which the government says should regulate the problem of ships loaded with illegal immigrants, will evidently be overwhelmed, while all three opposition parties said on Wednesday that they could not support it.
"I am leaning significantly on the Charter."
"I stand upright on the side of the party that built the granite under your feet," said the Liberal chief Michael Ignatieff, surrounded by MPs after the week-long session of the weekly du caucus.
The Liberals insist that the bill, as proposed, a law that would allow the detention of up to one year to detain any person from a ship, identified as a ship transporting illegal immigrants, would violate the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
The head of the Quebec Bloc, Gilles Duceppe, also said that he could not support the bill because it was headed for the wrong goal.
"We are against it and all the opposition parties seem to be against it, so we will see what the government does," said M. Duceppe.
The NPD critic on the issue of immigration, Olivia Chow, has rejected critics who want her party not to be strong enough for illegal immigrants.
"The non-democrats agree to take measures against smugglers of illegal immigrants and that is what we consider to be the main part of another draft law, C-35," said Ms Chow.
"We do not support the Conservative bill because it blames the offenders and puts children in prison for at least one year," Ms Chow explained.
Immigration Minister Jason Kenney has accused the opposition parties.
"The Canadians are telling the parliamentarians en masse that they do not tolerate this kind of illegal migration, these criminal operations, which take aim at Canada and treat it like a patsoal."
They expect Canada to take consistent measures, Secretary Kenney responded.
The government has not announced a vote of confidence on its bill, which could lead the country to the country's elections to be rejected.
A conservative told QMI that the government would ask for a vote to be held by any MP who oppose to answer for their position in front of their constituents.
New unity does not mean unanimity
Despite the announcement , the possible creation of a permanent unit to fight corruption and collusion, many observers continue to call for the creation of a public commission of inquiry.
Minister for Public Security, Robert Dutil, is aiming to make the idea go unnoticed: Quebec intends to consult the Department of Investigation from New York as early as January next year.
Metropole has had a permanent anti-corruption unit at its disposal since 1870.
That's why Tuesday's announcement surprised more than one of us.
It should be noted that in the meeting of the Permanent Council of Police Offices in Quebec 29. October last year, the measure was not discussed even though Robert Dutil himself was also present.
More was needed for a public-security critic, PQ party member Stéphane Bergeron, to rate this announcement as "the rabbit pulled out of the hat" and "amateur's solution botched on his knee."
Minister Dutil himself has responded to those who fear that political power has too much influence over the possible future of unity.
"It's all right to confirm: you'll see the result when we announce it."
"We are aware of the problem."
For the president of CSQ, Réjean Parento, nothing can replace the establishment of interviews of witnesses at a public hearing.
"Moreover, Mr. Charest is confirming that he does not want to create this commission of inquiry, and people think, like you and I, that he is hiding something," he explains.
"The only means of achieving the creation of a commission of inquiry is the resignation of Jean Charest," explains Yves Boisvert, a professor of ethics and political science at the Institute for the Education of High Civil Servants.
In order to emerge from this impasse, he suggested to Quebec that he give special empowerment to the inspector general to be able to investigate the collusion and the corruption.
"We must be able to extend the mandate of the Inspector General," he decided.
He also considers that Quebec could give the inspector the same powers as the commissioners to force people to testify.
The creation of a permanent working group is not the only proposal in the Charesto government's writings.
Quebec would also be after Ottawa to change the Criminal Code to be better suited to this type of crime.
That request would be based on the commissioner for Operation Marteau (Kladivo), who informed Minister of Justice Jean-Marco Fournier that the case-law for this type of investigation was not explicit.
The Federal Minister for Public Security, Vic Toews, confirmed that his colleague in the judiciary, Rob Nicholson, was in the process of looking into some of the amendments associated with the dossier.
In Operation Spring 2001, which affected groups of bikers, even though the Criminal Code has not yet been amended, 131 people were arrested.
Ottawa subsequently had amendments made to the Gangster Act.
Rivers under close scrutiny.
Several watercourses have come under severe control due to heavy rainfall that have fallen since Tuesday in several provincial regions.
On Wednesday afternoon in Shawinigan, Mauritius, there was a landslide.
Two houses were evacuated as a precaution.
In the evening there was another landslide in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, in Lanaudière.
The road is dented.
From Tuesday to Wednesday evening, several regions suffered heavy rainfall, i.e. it rained from 40 to 70 millimetres.
From 20 to 40 additional millimetres was not expected from today until Thursday evening, by region.
The sections in the north of the river and in the Outaouais Valley were hit hardest.
It could fall there for a total of up to 100 millimetres.
If we add up these precipitation with the melting of the snow accumulated in some sectors, we may fear floods for some watercourses.
Quebec's ambulance service issued a flooding warning on Wednesday evening for the Ouareau and Achigan rivers, in Lanaudière.
Rivers to the north, in Saint-Jérôme, in the forest of Laurentides, and in Chêne, in Lotbinière, have been subject to flood alert and continuous inspection.
In the de Lanaudière area, heavy collisions caused flooding of some lakes, in Sainte-Julienne, in Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare, as well as in Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, one makeshift bridge was torn down as a result of heavy rains.
Two residences had to be evacuated as a precaution.
In Outaouais, the spilling of some lakes from the shores was caused by the closure of some roads, particularly in the municipality of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
The ambulance service is on standby and oversees the situation in the area, said Annika Bouchard, the safety adviser.
The Quebec Floods Predictation Center issued a flood warning on Wednesday for several rivers, notably Maskinongé, Assomption, Ouareau, Achigan, Batiscan and Loup.
Dupont was partly a bind
Quebec radio host Stéphane Dupont suffered a partial setback to the Canadian Council for Radio and Television Standards Standards (RRTV) for controversial statements about social assistance and Haitians, as well as for rude expressions during the broadcast.
The Broadcasting Council reckons that Mr. Dupont and his group from the CHOI,88,1 FM, had the right to express their views, but some of the statements contained "inaccurate information about social assistance and the inappropriate negative depiction of the Haitians of crude language that does not correspond to the broadcast broadcast during the day."
The Council also concluded that the discussions on suicide, including the broadcasting of the name of the two people who had taken their lives, had not contradicted the regulations for radio broadcasting.
The Broadcasting Council received several complaints about the comments made during the broadcast, broadcast between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was made following a complaint by the Common Front of the Social Support Beneficiary of Quebec.
The group complained that the sums indicated on the broadcast were inaccurate.
Moderators must provide reliable information, not deceptive.
As for the suicide, host Stéphane Dupont thought suicide was a gesture of despair.
The majority of the Commission members concluded that the carry-on report was such that suicide cannot be seen as a solution to the problems of everyday life.
"Most of the Commission considers that the disputed episodes of the broadcasting of the "Duponton Noon News" have come across a delicate subject in an impartial and appropriate manner."
There has been no complaint against him.
The latest dispute concerned the statements that followed the Haiti earthquake.
So Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort engaged in a media firefight that drew many responses.
The CHOI host said he had not sent any donation to help the Haitians because we could not know for certain that the needy would actually receive the money.
The Commission considers that these comments were not unjustified, but that their cumulative effect creates an unduly negative picture of the Haitians.
"I've already atoned for my three-day delay on the matter."
"My file has been intact for a year and a half," the presenter said.
In all decisions, the Commission refuses to use gross expression in broadcasting.
In any case, CHOI-FM radio broadcasting cooperated "beyond its duties."
For a station that will have to notify those decisions once during the main broadcast within three days, the consequences are minimal.
King du kung-fuvà Montreal.
The Montreal resident, originally from Algeria, Nacereddine Zemmal, has an extremely special run-off.
The athlete who excels in the "sanda" (kung-fu "full contact"), enters the tatami and rings of the world in kickboxing and Thai boxing and looking for new challenges.
"I started with martial arts as kung-fu and kickboxing 12 years ago, in Algeria, explained Zemmal, who has lived in the capital since 2008 to learn from professionals."
"In my case, I'm looking for fights a little bit everywhere, because for those who don't like the game on the ground that comes up for combat sports, competitions are rare in North America."
Recently, this person, who works as a security guard and as a helper for UPS, has just delivered bad news to his rivals when he won two gold medals at the World Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA) World Championships from 23. to 30. October, Edimburg, Scotland.
"I have won the kickboxing category full contact and Thai boxing categories, he said."
"I am currently preparing for China for the World Cup in the sanction of sh."
"They were invited to the opponents who finished the first four at the last World Championships in each category."
"I won bronze in Toronto in 2009."
"In 2005 in Vietnam, I finished eighth."
"In 2007 in China I finished in the fifth rank of the tournament, while in Toronto in 2009 I finished third , added.'
"Interest to be interested, I've made some progress in every competition."
"At this rate, I'll be the first one this year or next!"
"san shou" or "sanda" is a discipline coming from China, where punches and legs, as well as throwing to the ground, are permitted.
The matches are traditionally set on the platform and more rarely in the ring.
The most famous boxer, resulting from this form of struggle, is Vietnamese-born American Cung Le, well known in the world of martial arts.
While Nacer Zemmal is to retain only one result in his career, he will confirm his participation in the "King of Sanda" super-turnate, the Super Bowl in kung-fu.
"This competition is the highest and most prestigious in China, the likeable fellow explains."
"It's a bit of a tenetry equivalent for Stade Lumpinee (the biggest stadium in Thailand)."
"It was a great experience."
He had won his first match, in the semi-finals of his category (80 kg), before suffering a loss in the final.
"The one who beat me was a real pro, he analyzed."
"There are four competing categories (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 90 kg)."
"The winners of the semi-finals will meet in the final of their category."
"Then the winners of each category will meet to be crowned only champion, the king of kung fu."
450 contracted millions without public competitions
Hydro-Québec agreed by mutual agreement of 450 million in contracts with companies providing engineering to the hydroelectric project Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert.
At the heart of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts, it is the consortium created from BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor, which has won the most important contract, a contract to manage the entire project for a total of $295 million without a public tender.
This consortium, called Énergie gérance, was empowered in 2004 in parallel to the selection of Hydro-Québec to entrust its responsibility to the private sector for the management of this major hydroelectric project worth $5 billion.
At the beginning of 2005, the consortium "Énergie gérance" received a lucrative contract without any announcement of a public tender.
For the Quebec side, the complaint against a consortium of businesses confronts us with a serious problem of ethical nature, risking the exclusion of competition and triggering price increases.
"It's a new way to implement the collusion and eliminate the competition."
"This means that people, no longer do the side deals in secret, they are now open to making them openly," PQ MP Sylvain Simard said at a press conference yesterday.
A little earlier, in the morning, M. Simard asked this question to the National Assembly because he says it is hard to bear the difficulty for how the public interest can be sold in this way.
The Minister for Natural Resources, Nathalie Normandeau, said in the afternoon, dismissively denying that this contract was a collusion.
"I have my own path," she thundered, claiming that the PQ was "unhonest" and "ladging precision."
She said "it would be the least of it" that PQ would apologize.
The recipe for the creation of a consortium is a common practice worldwide.
This is usually a one-time-limited alliance that allows two or a few businesses to group together with their expertise to respond to a call for tenders.
The Eastmain project is very complex with regard to the complexity of the work.
Construction is already underway and must be scheduled for 2012.
However, the contract was awarded without the competition being able to negotiate; it was a deal.
It must also be admitted that the formula of consortia is no longer an exception in Quebec, even for relatively simple projects.
As revealed last week, Le Devoir, a consortium consultancy's formula in engineering is under investigation in government.
Flying at speed at a speed of the commercial register of Quebec firms will allow us to discover more than 200 consortia, some of which seem to be created permanently.
This is how Dessau operates in partnership with most of its main competitors; let's name CIMA+, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin and Roche and Tecsult.
Each combination, and there are dozens of them, leads to one and the same legal person, and that is Dessau.
As for the Énergie gérance consortium, Minister Normandeau underlined in particular the fact that "the Territory of La Baie James is characterised by the special dynamics of the workforce and that Hydro-Québec has responded to it since the 1970s."
The main patron of the Eastmain project, Réal Laporte, of the Energy Company Baie James (SEBJ), gave an explanation to force us to wrinkle the forehead at the fact that the project management contract was concluded by mutual agreement.
"If you are going to the contest and if there are few bidders to the contest, your offered prices may be higher."
"You have two options to choose from: i.e. that you're going to pick up the people who are in that contract as the contestants, and that you say, "Let's make a deal of a satisfactory and good price."
"But the main idea is that what matters is not the price, but the competence of the people," Mr. Laporte confirmed.
This contract awarded to the consortium of Énergie gérance is part of a long list of contracts for more than $50,000 received by the Quebec Party.
The contracts were concluded with Hydro-Québec or SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
After verification, Le Devoir counted 109 contracts for consultancy in the field of engineering, concluded between 2002 and March 2010 with companies or their branches, in particular with laboratories performing soil samples analysis.
SNC-Lavalin has gargled 22 contracts, of which Génivar won 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10 out of them, without having a stake in the "Énergie gérance."
All contracts were concluded.
Together, they add up to $449,783 344,34, including a contract with Énergie gérance at $295,131 564.
Sylvain Simard suggested that the four companies that are part of the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) are "very good acquaintances of the Liberal Parties to the Quebec."
Minister Normandeau leaked the report that PQ was also linked to companies that would "fund" her before clarifying that they were more concerned with her management.
Barometer of responsible consumption - 'green' etiquette does not inspire confidence
More green, but openly skeptical.
The Quebec consumer has very little confidence in the players in sustainable development, but also of "impartial" brands and environmental certificates, to follow it in product selection.
The worst of all is that even bathing in the media universe, which urges us to consume more socially responsible, this media universe laments the lack of credible information, the failure to fulfil obligations that it qualifies even as a brake on its commitment, Baromèètre reports responsible consumption, the first article of which was published yesterday.
Even though the consumption of so-called socially responsible products increased in 2010, the people of Quebec who are trying to sell them do not trust them much
In fact, two-thirds of us say that we do not believe in the promises of environmental-related companies, simply because the green advertising of the companies is identifying a measuring tool developed by the Sherbrooke University's Responsible Consumption Observatory.
Other findings: half of consumers doubt the credibility of the official certificates, given to so-called just products, but also the credibility of the products and brands, which are known as the ecologically responsible, Barometre says.
In the same way, the debate of politicians on the subject is accepted as a serious only 14.6% of Quebec residents.
However, information on responsible consumption appears to be paramount to stimulate this consumption site, revived at the moment by almost a third of Quebec consumers.
Indeed, the vacuum and the dubious nature of the information would ease the enthusiasm of 46% of consumers.
This is the second brake identified by Baromètre, after the higher price of these products.
After all, a third of Quebec's population is incredulously pondering the reported data on the products or the "green" services we're looking for to let them through our hands.
On the other hand, in 2010, almost half of consumers were willing to change their habits and, in particular, to change the brand name of one or more for several products, responding to their beliefs.
A full 61% of them favoured purchases from merchants' quarters and preferred to buy food grown in their region, says Baromètre.
More "green" and responsible - the responsible consumption index has reached 64 of the maximum of 100 this year - Homo consumus Québeku likes to present himself as the king of recycling, who strives for the least possible impact on the environment by caring for the protection of animals.
But their social and environmental conscience was clearly left somewhere outside their car, Baromètre reports: in 2010, barely 28% of Quebec residents said they were using public transport or that they recommend the use of a car to travel for at least two people, in the interest of conservation.
The walk-and-browe was also supported by 39.1% of participants in this extensive behavioural survey who used this cliché.
Loan to the state to buy the cinema complex eXcentris
The Quebec government, which we asked for a financial participation in the purchase of the eXcentris cinema complex by the eXcentris by the Angus et le parallèle, agrees to participate, but only up to the amount of the loan.
The development company "Angus et le Parallèle," which sought a $7 million donation from the Minister of Culture to buy the cinematographic complex on the Saint-Laurent tabloid and which demonstrated its mission as a film art lover, has not won what it demanded.
The government accepts the fact that it will be included in the dossier, but in its own terms.
Rather than the expected donation, the government of Quebec proposes a loan, the amount of which would be lower, some of which could build the basis for a viable solution on favourable terms and with resources from the state.
The first action plan and the $12.8 million demand were already rejected by Quebec last spring, but applications have already been revised to the reduction.
The draft and the work plan were sent to Minister St-Pierre by the president of the Society for the Development of Business in Culture (SODEC), François Macerola, who directs the eXcentris cinematographic project.
The final report was sent ten days ago.
But the government's counter-propos came to SODEC on Tuesday.
Le Parallèle et Angus have until December 31 to respond.
However, it seems that the state's gift-taking hypothesis must be indeed rejected.
Recall that the Association of Cinema Owners and Cinematographic Centres in Quebec was opposed to the state's direct investment in order to support the purchase of the eXcentris, judging that the Minister of Culture should not finance the real estate project when he did not do so for other theatrics.
But several participants in the discussion, on the other hand, demanded substantial economic support.
Daniel Langlois, the owner, was given to the space of his cinema during his ten years of film art after he himself financed the construction of the complex, which may have been the reason for the modification by the State's Financial Council.
The lack of the halls for independent films is gairdled in Montreal, and eXcentris was able to win over a permanent clientele.
Angus et le Parallèle, with Christian Yaccarini at its head, is running a campaign to release funds to the private sector, in the belief that it will take out the $700,000 to push through the acquisition.
Since the spring of 2009, the only one of the three film companies, Le Parallèle, has continued to distribute films for eXcentris.
The aim of future acquirers is to reopen all three halls on 27. February next year and screen Xavier's most beautiful film, Men and Gods, with Xavier's The Man and the God.
But Christian Yaccarini did not like Le Devoir and is so ignored, so he and his group think of the shrinkage proposals made to him.
The raised curtain to Canada as a whole...
The new diplomatic sources of America's acquaintance through WikiLeaks reveal what the United States sees as a complex of inferiority of Canadians against Americans, but by the same blow, they reveal their sense of superiority to Canada.
American diplomats are therefore surprised that every Canadian voter has Canadian-American relations at the heart of voting when they go to vote, and they believe that President Obama's visit to the conservative government has helped the conservative government to adopt its budget in 2009!
four new reports, which were the US Embassy in Ottawa and Washington, yesterday outright on the public, provide sensitive details to get each other "under the skin."
The Communication, with the date of 22 September 2008, i.e. in the middle of the election campaign, sets out in detail at what point the United States is not part of the betting debated by political leaders.
Awe-premediments of the American ambassador to Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr. Wilkins is providing some explanations for this situation.
"The Canadian inferiority complex, almost obsessive, makes perhaps political leaders conditional on talking about internal betting rather than realizing that these elections also involve the United States (as in the free-trade campaign of 1988) ", he writes.
"The United States is therefore," he concluded, "a convert elephant in this election:the pomposable but potentially too threatening to be talked about."
The ambassador understands this "enignant silence" all the less because both countries maintain intense political and economic relations.
"It is logical that the ability of a candidate, party, or, better still, the head of the party to manage these important relationships, should be a key factor in the electorate's mind when they go to the polls."
A further expression of this sense of importance can be read in a report sent by Terry Breese, the chargé d'affaires in Ottawa à Ottawa, preparing President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
"Your trip will help ensure that the government is maintained in a confidence vote in early February, regarding the federal budget by which Canada will publicly award its first deficit in more than a decade, due to a recovery plan of $30 to $40 billion," writes M. Breese.
No mention of the fact that the government had to adjourn the pre-Christmas session of parliament so that it could not be defeated by the coalition, and that the opposition parties condition their survival with the quality of the proposed recovery plan.
Another January 2008 report, signed by Ambassador Wilkins, points out Washington's increasingly negative image that is being cast by the United States with a dramatic series broadcast on CBC.
The ambassador is concerned about the aired of Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence, and H2O, in which not very savvy references to Maher Arar, "No-Fly-List" or kidnapping for the purpose of violent CIA interrogation can be observed.
Another report reports that at their first bilateral meeting, Hillary Clinton asked her French partner, Bernard Kouchner, whether Europe was ready to receive some of the Guantánamo prisoners.
Mr Kouchner replied yes, but on the "case-by-case case" principle.
At the end of the meeting, it says, "he forwarded some paper to the secretary of state's secretary of state about Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian descent."
"The secretary has accepted to revise the file."
Let us note, finally, that the people involved in WikiLeaks are sweating.
Tom Flanagan, a former adviser very close to Stephen Harper, said on the CBC that the person responsible for this massive leak should be "destroyed."
It broke down, and Mike Huckabee heard about it in the United States.
World Plan to restore lighting
Yesterday, the UN proposed a plan in Cancún to restore home lighting, store and industrial space lighting in 100 countries to achieve a reduction in the greenhouse effect (GES), which corresponds to almost one-third of the other constraint to stabilise the planet's climate from now until 2020.
This ambitious plan is at the stage of large concrete projects that the UN wants to push through in Cancún to compensate for the absence of difficult-to-reach reduction commitments on the part of industry-led advanced countries.
According to the plan presented yesterday, if the red-hot bulbs that monopolize the market still make up for 50 to 70% of the market with light bulbs with fluoccuphetti or, better, with electric-luminocent diodes (DEL or "LED" in English), a substantial amount of the 1.8 billion tonnes (Gt) GES emissions on the planet due to lighting would be dismantled.
Lighting is responsible for 8% of the world's emissions.
It's the equivalent of 70% of emissions from a car park on the entire planet.
In Copenhagen last year, major countries with a significant share of emissions such as the United States, China, Europe and others, among them Canada, joined the voluntary reduction plans to allow for a drop in GES global emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
But it will be necessary to deduct from this score of 5 Gt to achieve climate heating stabilisation at 2 degrees Celsius by 2020 to avoid being out of control.
In incandescent incandescent bulbs, 95% of the energy is dissipated in the form of heat and the rest, i.e. 5%, the light product.
With fluco-combustible bulbs, the energy consumption is reduced by 75% and with new bulbs with DEL, we reduce this consumption twice more.
Fluocompactic bulbs last averages from 6000 to 10,000 hours.
The new DEL bulbs, the kind he put into production this week - the company reportedly participated in the UN study - have a projected life of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than a glowing bulb, which gives us an idea of a possible saving with a replacement plan that would be applied in 100 countries.
All of these new bulbs can also work with the reactat and emit less heat.
And they don't contain any mercury.
Several experts have expressed reservations about fluocom-compact light bulbs because they contain mercury and need to be sorted as hazardous waste, which is still not possible in developing countries, and manufacturers would set up collectors.
Of course, as the report states, the main source of mercury emissions on the planet is not a fluoccuphettiered bulb, but rather thermal coal-fired power plants that emit many mercury needed to produce electricity wasted in hot light bulbs.
In the United States alone, these headquarters put 25,000 tons of mercury into circulation annually.
The report also sets out in detail the gains that each country would make to this international programme.
Indonesia, for example, would thus save $1 billion a year for buying electricity and eight million tonnes of CO2, which is equivalent to 3.5 thermal power plants, which would cost 2.5 billion to build
Ivory Coast is eagerly awaiting the results of the election results.
The UN Secretary-General, Ban Ki-moon, requested the results of the Presidential Election in Côte d'Aff cui after the deadlines set expire.
"The Secretary-General underlines the need for an independent Electoral Commission to complete its work and to immediately announce the preliminary results, the spokesman for the President of the United Nations stressed."
"It asks all parties in Côte d'Ivoire and the institutions to prove their sense of responsibility and to refrain from any initiative until the provisional results are announced."
Despite the pressures exerted by some foreign governments, the electoral commission let the latest date go - Wednesday's half-night - without releasing the results, three days after Sunday's scrum.
About forty minutes before the deadline, the president of CEI confirmed on television that the commission "continues to work" in order to announce the results.
On Wednesday, calls were august around the world for CEI to finally announce the name of the second-round winner, between the outgoing Laurent Gbagbo and opposition member Alassan Ouattara.
But Camp Gbagbo relies on the annulment of the Constitutional Council for the "fraudulent" vote in the north, administered by former New Army Rebels (FN) since the failed coup d'état in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, director of the Côte d'Ivoire presidential election campaign, confirmed that voter intimidation's maneuvers practiced by the FN (New Army) in the north of the country have deterred supporters of the Ivorian President of the Ivorian President from voting.
The election could be annulled if the Constitutional Council took into account the complaints filed by Gbagbo.
However, opponents of President Gbagbo consider that the country's supreme court is not neutral because it is run by Paul Yao N'Dré, a very close political ally of President Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a man from the north who debunked any connection with the former rebels, denounced the delay in the announcement of the results as "unacceptable" and asked Gbagbo to respect them but not go so far as to demand victory.
His allies confirm that Gbagbo is blocking the release of the results because he knows he has suffered a loss and that it would be illegal to file a complaint with the Constitutional Council after he prevented the election commission from broadcasting the results.
The second round of the presidential election, underway on Sunday, was seen as a coronation of the reunification and reconciliation process of a country that has been divided into two-half for years.
The United Nations warned the Ivorian political faction on Wednesday that it could be held responsible for any violence.
Laurent Gbagbo finished in the first round, 31. October, the winner with 38% of the vote, up from 32% for Alassan Ouattara, who received public support from former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round).
The unemployment rate remains stable in France in the third quarter.
The unemployment rate in France, according to the International Labour Office (BIT), remained stable at 9.3% in metropolitan France (9.7% including overseas areas), as provisional data with the adjustment of seasonal deviations (CVS) shown on Thursday.
The number of unemployed has stabilised at 2.631 million in the metropolis.
The second-quarter figures were confirmed at 9.3% of the active population in the metropolitan area and 9.7% including overseas areas.
In one year, the unemployment rate is increasing by 0.1 points.
In a wider frame, 3.4 million people in metropolitan France do not work in the third quarter, but would like to work, regardless of whether or not they are available in two weeks to work, regardless of whether they are looking for work or not.
The situation of the current young people on the labour market has escalated with a new rise in the unemployment rate at 24.2% in metropolitan France (+ 0.9 points in three months, +0.5 points in one year) and 25% including overseas areas.
In the third quarter, according to the International Labour Office, there were 6377,000 young people between the ages of 15 and 24.
As for the elderly, they saw a slight increase in unemployment in Metropolitan France to 6.4% in metropolitan France (+0.2 points in three months, as well as in a year), that is, 482,000 people from the age of 50 up and 6.6%, including overseas areas.
Only the population aged 25-49 recorded benefits from unemployment stability to 8.3% in metropolitan France (-0.1 points in three months, +0.1 points in one year) and 8.8% across France.
Insee no longer publishes the monthly unemployment rate since 2006, following a polemic about its method of calculation.
Eurostat, the statistical agency of the European Union, is continuing to produce monthly statistics and on Tuesday announced a rate of 9.8% for France (including DOM) in October after 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini is charged and put into custody
Alexandre Guérini, 53, one of the chief executives of the waste processing companies and the brother of the PS of the Administrative Council of Bouches-DPRhône, was charged and imprisoned in a prison in Luynes, near Aix-en-Provence, in the context of a public procurement investigation, supposedly underhanded.
Alexandre Guérini was charged with misuse of company property, misuse of public funds and public property, concealment, bribery, bribery to accept bribes to influence the office and possession of ammunition, says his lawyer.
"Alexandre Guérini is belligerent and insists that he and the judge explain all the questions he intends to ask him, rather than some delusions."
"It is easy to pursue him for many reprehensible reasons, but it is another matter to prove them," his lawyer, Florence Rault, told AFP before questioning her client.
Mr Guérini said through his attorneys that he had sent a brief statement to the judge before his interrogation to explain.
One of his loved ones, Philippe Rapezzi, was also charged and imprisoned on Wednesday night.
According to his lawyer, Lucien Simon, his client never did anything but ensure the operation of the landfills he was supposed to manage.
As for the award of contracts or the destination of the funds associated with their operation, he was never aware of any of this, Mr Simon said.
In this matter, Daniel Pinna, the former director general of the services of the Aubagne agglomeration, was charged on Wednesday for the misuse of public funds and the plot, and allowed the protagonists to be free, under judicial supervision with a restraining order.
"My client was able to give an explanation to all the facts he was accused of."
"The investigating judge takes this into account and lets him go free," said his lawyer, Mr. Yann Arnoux.
Four more were charged and released on the night of Tuesday to Wednesday, with two of them under judicial supervision, said U.S. Attorney General Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadakian, deputy director-general with the elegance of Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM), is being prosecuted for accepting bribes to influence the office and for passive corruption."
Two Aubagne conglomerate officials, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringuier, are charged, one for "ceasing and misusing the company's property," the other for "filling in the misuse of public funds."
Finally, business associate Alexandra Guérini, Jeannie Peretti, was charged with "capturing the misuse of the company's assets."
Among those confronted by Mr. Guérini is Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, who was recently charged with a parallel case of fraudulent public contracts.
Investigators suspect his company of aiding aided to lacerate money from a large-scale gangster.
The investigation is conducted in the framework of several open court investigations against X in April 2009 following the adoption of anonymous letters concerning presumed fraud in the conclusion of public procurement, in particular in the matter of waste.
From a source close to the investigation, the search focuses in particular on the conditions for the allocation and operation of the landfill in La Ciotat, which collects garbage from Aubagne, as well as from some cities from the Marseille Municipality (MPM).
The Case of the Clotilde Reiss: Elysee Palace exaggerated by the Mediation of Syria
Over the course of more than ten months, from July 2009 to May 2010, the fate of Klotilda Reiss, a young researcher arrested in Iran for "shpionage," unifying views in France, has put diplomacy on combat alert and stressed relations between Paris and Tehran.
All this is being closely watched by diplomats from the United States.
American documents, received through WikiLeaks and consulted with Le Monde, reveal some of the drawbacks of this crisis.
They describe how the Élysée Palace explained its strategy to the Americans, going so far as to give them advice on how to handle such hostage cases in Iran (a small group of hikers).
They show how leading French officials have tried to convince Washington that the young Frenchwoman's release was not a compensation for parole for Majid Kakavand, an Iranian imprisoned in France and wanted by the US judiciary for the underhanded trafficking of material for the benefit of Iran's nuclear program.
Finally, they are subjecting the sharp light to the way the French Presidency sought to manipulate the media to accredit the idea that the Syrian president, Bachar Al-Assad, played a central role in the liberation of Klotilda Reiss.
He didn't really do anything about it.
The diplomatic telegram, drafted in Paris on 12 August 2009, has a headline: "Iran:French comments on how to resolve in the case of hostages."
Advisor from the Élysée Palace for Strategic Affairs, François Richier, accompanied by the director of the Quai d'Orsay for North Africa, the Middle East, Patrice Paoli, speaks to a representative of American diplomacy, Allegrone.
They explain the French method to him.
They advise the Americans to do as much as to be brought back to the country by their own nationals by the violence-refiring in Iran.
"Make noise," they say, "still emphatically pronounce "in the media, the words "fundamental rights of man," "invile," "an immediate deliverance."
It is necessary to bring to the trouble the Iranian regime, sensitive to its image.
"Do it the more they ask you to stop doing so."
As there have been attempts to negotiate through discrete channels, "no matter to the silence," the Iranians are "champion of evasive manoeuvres."
Mr. Richier recalls that arresting foreigners is "a country family tactic: taking hostages for the purposes of "political extortion."
It announces that the liberation of Klotilda Reiss (which will occur on 16 August, on the day on which the French Embassy will give her a refuge) "call for a large sum of money for the Iranians" (a €230,000).
And he announces that the Élysée Palace is anticipating the instool of hostages, a phenomenon that "will be escalated."
The Iranians "could arrest an additional 1,800 or so French living in Iran in the future," he says.
28 August 2009.
Klotilda Reiss left prison 12 days ago, but still remains blocked in Iran.
The information is being circulated: Iranian Majid Kakavand, about whom the United States claims to have been expelled for illegal e-freel-sensitive trafficking in relation to Iran, is released in Paris on the basis of a judge's decision.
The US embassy, as many observers, has been questioning this disturbing match.
For Washington, which is haunting Iran's illegal networks to extract material destined for the nuclear program, the expansion of Majid Khakavand is bad news.
France agreed to bargain?
The liberation of the Iranians to free the young Frenchwoman?
In another interview with Kathleen Allegrone, on 4 September, François Richier assures that this is not the case.
The Élysée Palace, as he states, was not only "scored by this judge's decision" but was looking for a way to oppose it.
"There have been talks between the presidency and the Minister of Justice" (at that time, Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French government cannot change the court's decision," he notes.
Mr. Richier also wants to demonstrate that Majid Kakavand is under the "limited" supervision of the French intelligence service.
An adviser to the Elysee Palace is dialing a phone number, hangs up the phone phone, and then informs the American diplomat that the Iranian is currently in the Paris buildings run by the Iranian embassy."
At the time of Klotilda Reiss's imprisonment in Iran, the Elysee Palace is making an effort, negotiating, through a communiqué and organized "leak" to the media to convince Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad that he plays a "significant" and "influential" role as a "mediator."
The Americans observe this activity, not without irony, stating that the manipulation bears its fruit, for several press articles reflect the French official version.
Telegram of 25 August 2009 evokes the media "blest" of French official officials.
What is the basis of such a degree of "gratefulness" expressed to M. Assad, the embassy in Paris is asking.
"Despite their statements full of praise, French officials privately acknowledge that they have only a vague idea of what the Syrians have actually done."
The document then discusses the reasons that forced the Elysee Palace to pay in this fiction.
Intense communication "shall be measured to validate President Sarkozy's policy of opening up to Syria," he analyses.
The policy pursued in 2008 "was observed by many critical voices in France and abroad and described as premature and undeserved."
By "exaggerating the Syrian role," Paris is trying to "demonstrate Syria, what a shycomers can earn when it plays a constructive role in the region."
The aim is also to "send the grain of discord between Syria and Iran."
The American Embassy knows this from a very good source.
On August 11, François Richier confided in him: "of course, we don't know if the Syrians did anything, whatever it is"
"But we thanked them anyway."
"This should at least bring confusion and confusion among the Iranians."
Klotilda Reiss returns to France on 16 May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy receives it at the Élysée Palace.
In the communiqué, he thanks the presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for their "active role in favor of the liberation of our compatriot."
The end of online games after midnight for young Koreans
The South Korean government will adopt a law called "Peciváln" that will ban adolescents from playing online games after midnight by blocking access to them, government officials in the airlined.
The bill will be presented to Parliament in December in order to ask online game companies to block access to these games after midnight to those under 16 for people under the age of 16, officials from the Ministry of Culture and the Ministry of Family said.
"Many children play these games all night long and then have trouble learning at school and are unable to lead a normal life during the day."
"We consider that this law is necessary to ensure their health and their right to sleep," Jo Rin, the lead official at the Ministry in charge of the bill, told AFP.
Online games will be newly available from 6 a.m.
Companies will have one year to prepare for the application of the law, he clarified.
The government also assumes that it will ask companies to limit the daily subsistence time to these young people's games, whose parents so request, the worker in charge has added.
It will also make free programmes available to people who request it, allowing you to limit their time spent on the internet.
South Korea is one of the countries most "affected" and the daily newspapers regularly bring different facts linked to the intensive use of the Internet.
The country is also an undoubted champion in world competitions in online games.
In November, South Korea won four gold medals at the World Cyber Games, in the face of 58 other nations.
World Championships 2018-2022: Fifa establishes host countries.
The full unrest on suspicion of corruption is being established by the Fifa Executive Committee on Thursday by the host country of the World Cup in 2018 and 2022, a selection of the supremely politically motivated party, where the fight for influence and lobbying risked the overtaken technical criteria.
The matter is certain, the Fifa Royal Competition in 2018 will be held in Europe , the traditional bastion of this discipline (4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, the Netherlands-Belgium).
The 2022 Championship will be far more exotic, with the International Federation hoping to conquer new territories (Qatar, Australia) after its premiere on the African continent in 2010, or continue to be set in the United States or the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities to be attended by delegations (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, Prince of Qatar, Belgium and the Netherlands, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) gives the opportunity to create an idea of the scale of the world's economic and political betting.
Behind the scenes, the negotiations face the risk of last minute.
It is difficult for the rest to establish the hierarchy according to the candidates.
According to the evaluation report of the Fifa dossier, the English, Spanish-Portuguese (2018) and the US (2022) contain the best arguments, as do the documentation of their competitors.
But those reasons will not carry too much weight for the 22 members of the executive committee at the hour for voting.
The Sunday Times at the outreach, leading to the suspension of two CE/European Commission members?/ for corruption (Reynald Temarii et Amos Adamu), may have ruined the chances of its country, the cradles of the soccer, which has so far hosted the world championship only once, in the year.
The BBC crown on Monday, broadcasting a documentary that "bugged a pin" by three influential CE (European Commission?), Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
How to make Fifa dissatisfied and to bring to the predicament English leaders with David Cameron in the first row.
The Prime Minister hopes to repeat the move by his predecessor, Tony Blair, who managed to win the London Games organisation in 2012 for the 2012 London Games.
Will this intensive activity be enough for England to give new shine to its name with the CE (European Commission?)?
Nothing is less certain as the pair of Spain-Portugal are not lagging the trumps of the stadiums already prepared, his testimony (World Championship in 1982 in Spain, the 1992 Barcelona Olympic Games, the Euro-2004 in Portugal) and their football culture.
But the gloomy economic and financial perspectives of both countries could give these ambitions a cold shower.
Any retaliatory measures against the English and doubts about the payment of Spain and Portugal only increase the position of Russia, which was an outsider despite the gaps in its documentation (stadions, hotels, transport).
But Prime Minister Vladimir Poutin decided not to move the Championship to Curich and publicly declare "unflat competition in the preparation of the vote," in verbal references only fumble at the accusations of the English press against the CE (European Commission) members.
"We'll be throwing mud at them, we'll try to compromise them," said Mr. Poutin.
For 2022, the United States appears to be the logical favorite, with its considerable experience in 1994.
The world's highest performance of the economy, the headquarters of Fifa's major sponsors, seems to be well ahead of Japan and South Korea, which, separately, have produced a beautiful project.
But these candidacies seem premature for the two countries, which together underwent a "test" in 2002.
Another threat: the 2026 World Cup awarding to China, which is bucketly desired by Fifa, made the Asian chances invalid for 2022.
With Qatar, which has pulled a large ace in the form of futuristic stadiums, and Australia, Fifa would continue to expand into new landscapes, but these two countries pose more risks than certainties.
Australia, like Japan and Korea, could pay for the TV's flimsy charges (due to the time shift) paid for by European countries, creating the momentum for Fifa.
Second mandate: obvious (certainty)
De Gaulle was really hesitant.
Mitterrand gave the appearance of his hesitation.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing et Jacques Chirac did not hesitate in the slightest.
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less than they are.
The mandate of the Élysée Palace calls someone else.
The current head of state will therefore be a candidate in 2012.
But the obvious is not in good agreement with the share of the secret associated with the Presidency's post.
So it is necessary to act as if doubts are constantly persisting.
In one and the other.
In 2006, if one would have wanted to believe it, Jacques Chirac's friends made claims to keep the third mandate out of the question.
On November 15, with a serious expression, Nicolas Sarkozy assured that "it will be decided sometime in the fall of 2011."
As he recalls in front of the members of the UMP Parliament on Wednesday evening at the Élya-Sée Palace, the prospect of "two mandates" sowed a low-frequency.
Was it the official announcement of his candidacy?
He was not far away.
The president merely recalled that the amendment to the Constitution in 2008 limited the number of five-year terms to two.
It was just a statement on his part, not a notice.
This is not the first time he has resembled such meetings in the humorous tone of the presidential election.
"At worst, or at best, you still have seven and a half years ahead with me," he said in July 2009.
Rebellion in May 2010: "Don't think I'm not considering the next stage."
His statements the day before yesterday will not make him more candidate than the previous day; he will not be made by a candidate or less.
If they call out comments, it's because of the two truth.
Speeding up the trip to the PS, on the one hand.
But that's not the entrance to the Ségolèn's arena, which is pushing Nicolas Sarkozy to convict himself.
On the contrary, it is because his candidacy in 2012 is evident that many in the PS want to be in the battle-mates of the premature rather than intended.
Bad reconnaissance on the other side.
First, the right's voters would prefer François Fillon's candidacy to the nomination of Nicolas Sarkozy (46% against 44% against BVA-L'Express).
"We have a candidate and we are not discussing the matter with the UMP ", the people in the immediate and circumspectia of the Prime Minister responded immediately and cautiously.
"If he believes in a possible defeat, he will not run," says Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"He will still believe he can win," corrects Alain Juppé, balanced with the obvious.
Euro: The Central European Bank forced to continue its purchases of state titles.
The last meeting of the Governing Council of the Central year was to be an opportunity to clarify the conditions for lifting out of the crisis or, at least, the announcement of the cessation of a large number of unusual monetary policy operations that must be completed by the end of this year.
The crisis is binding on sovereign European claims, the Securities Issouachet Issourably Institute will no doubt be able to afford to be so categorical under the threat of a deterioration of the situation already strained on European securities markets.
The political price in that case would be all the higher.
Yesterday, on the occasion of a press conference, French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde paid tribute to the active role played by the Central European Bank in favour of addressing the crisis of claims by European states.
She would not say whether she thought the bank could have done more, for example by increasing their program to buy up the sovereign bond purchase program.
"I am relying on my consideration for my European partners (...) "'
The night before, in Brussels, in his interrogation of the European Parliament's Economic and Monetary Affairs Commission, the President of the Central European Bank, Jean-Claude Trichet, did not appear to be more articulate in terms of his intentions and was content to say that the programme of buying state titles on the secondary market was "conting up" and that we would "see how we will make a decision" during the meeting this Thursday.
The only certainty: The Central European Bank will be guarding its basic unchanging interest rate at 1%, its historically low level since May 2009.
In fact, the purchases of bonds from the Treasury by the Central European Bank have doubled to almost €1.35 billion in the last week.
And thanks to the unreasonableness of the market agreements, she made new purchases of Irish and Portuguese bonds yesterday.
Overall, the euro-system's central banks have purchased €67 billion since May 2010.
Among the market's agreements, the anticipation of the continuation of purchases is no doubt (see page 29).
Nor do economists expect any significant exchange rate change.
If the loan operations for more than three months have already disappeared from the Central European Bank's arsenal, the latter goes to the unlimited provision of liquid funds under generous terms and for a period of between one week and three months.
Economists expect this mechanism to be extended by several months today.
"I can't imagine changing her agenda in a significant way."
"If not, it would mean accepting the risk of creating short-term new tensions," says Michael Schubert, an economist at Commerzbank.
"The progressive outlet announced during the first quarter of 2011 seems more likely," anticipates Norbert Bräms, an economist at Sal.
Oppenheim.
On the plan for its interventions in the public debt market, "should the European Central Bank have to maintain the volume of buying up its bonds to revive the dull market," joins Norbert Bräms.
With regard to the exposures of European banks in the sovereign debt markets in the euro area, the choice of no longer has the choice but to maintain its presence in the market.
"It needs to replace the market's shortage of investors at all costs and act in such a way as to prevent the outburst of paid performance from being the most spectacle," the major bond administrator testified yesterday.
Because if interest rates take off, states will be all the more troubled to reduce their debt rather than stabilize it.
It's saving the euro at this price.
In Italy, Berlusconi's government hunches the back
After the start of the week, the worrying situation for Italy relaxed a bit, with the return flow of the bond interest rate for 10 years yesterday.
A return to temporary peace.
At the end of the meeting with the Minister for Economics, the presidents of the regions said they had heard Giulio Tremonti qualify the situation as "inadregorsible" and that he expected an "unpredictable" weekend, which he then debunked.
In any case, on Tuesday, the deviation from the long German interest rates reached a record of 210 basis points and the cost of the bankruptcy risk contracts (CDS) topped up to 263 points, which caused some upset in Rome.
In the Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi noted that in Spain the deviation with German interest was higher than 400 basis points.
But his right-hand man, Gianni Letta, said he was "too busy" with the "murdy development of the markets" and a possible outbreak from Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the eurozone's third economy, is not like Greece or Ireland."
"The bad news is that he is like Portugal," explains Irwin Stelzer, an economist at the Hudson Institute.
Clearly and uncorrupted, its problem is the absence of growth and lacklustre fiscal input, which goes hand in hand, exposing the state to the risk of not being able to cover its financing needs.
Brussels' latest forecasts were a cold shower for the government.
Italian growth is now expected to be at 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012... while the budget available to the Senate to analyse it is 1.3% and 2%.
Under these conditions, the European Commission calculates, the public deficit will still represent 4.3% of the gross domestic product next year (against 3.9% projected by the government) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
Hence the rumour of a new summary of the additions to the draft state budget, which could be introduced after the holidays, of €7 billion.
"If necessary, new stringent measures will have to be taken," says the Commissioner for Economic Affairs, Olli Rehn.
For the moment, Italy is accepting the support of international institutions.
"The bases of its economy are fine and its calculations are correct, we have been repeating this for a long time," assures Arrigo Sadun, an Italian member of the Governing Board of the International Monetary Fund under the pressure of Italy on the International Monetary Fund.
"There is no immediate problem, not a short-term or long-term one, because despite its significant debt (119.2% of gross domestic product of 2011, NDLR), the stabilisation effort required in Italy is less than the effort required of other countries," notes Pier Carlo Padoan, chief economist at the OCDE.
The question of political instability remains.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion of no confidence in the Chamber of Deputies and, subsequently, the elections to be expected at the end of March could begin to be organised.
This would trigger a period of time, not suitable for a decision in a serious crisis.
Europeans are thinking about strengthening anti-crisis mechanisms.
Christine Lagarde reiterated this in a press conference in Paris yesterday: 'I think Europeans demonstrated this throughout the day and the night on Sunday, they are obviously very committed to defending their currency and their currency zone.'
Although everything is relative, yesterday's recorded expansion, concerning interest rates on European national bonds, has brought water to the mill to governments and the Central European Bank.
But we can't talk about the start of normalisation yet.
The Standard & Poor's Notation Office announced that it could downgrade the Portuguese debt record, the targets to be the most focused on various speculation.
"Because in May, a real, insufficiently transparent and obvious policy, resting mainly on banking systems," says economists at Exane BNP Paribas.
All the more so because "political time runs slower than market time."
Aware of this broken context and the dangers it hides, European countries are intensifying the debate, to strengthen the already existing crisis mechanisms.
Informal consultations between the finance ministers, the most affected by the problem, and on a wider scale with their G20 counterparts, are progressing very well.
This is with regard to the Eurogroup meetings (Eurogroupe) and the Ecofin grouping from the beginning of next week.
The meeting of the Central European Bank takes place today.
The programme includes the fate of unconventional measures to support euro area countries with a focus on markets (see above).
As for the European Finance Fund (FESF), its Chief Executive Officer, Klaus Regling, bounced a tour of Asia in Singapore on Tuesday to inform investors from the Far East of the development of the crisis in Europe.
If the aim of this trip is not to increase funds, it is certainly preparing the ground to achieve this goal.
The first issue of FESF securities is expected for next month.
Yesterday, a U.S. official official told Reuters that the United States would support a possible increase in the mobilised funds with additional direct involvement in the FMI.
The countries at issue in the first instance, Portugal and Spain, are preparing to adopt structural reforms, in particular as regards the organisation of the labour market.
Reforms that join the strict measures with quick effect.
Lisbon and Madrid took a different path from that used by Greece and Ireland.
The two countries want to avoid, at all costs, to ask for international assistance before applying their own budgetary corrective and deciding on the structural reforms necessary to regain their continued confidence.
The European funds' equity involved finally talks about options available to speed up the process of normalising the sovereignty bond markets.
On his trip to Paris on 24 November, Axel Weber came up with the idea of whether the €750 billion mobilized by Europe and the International Monetary Fund would not be enough, the Union would not hesitate to revisit the stock of securities.
Economists at Barclays Capital, an actor in the very first trade plan for European sovereign claims, reckless reckons that an addition of around €100 billion would be enough, "better" in the form of direct provision of financial liquidity.
The means there is: it is the European Financial Stability Mechanism, subsidised by EUR 60 billion to date.
The Council, which has all the chances to be tested in European capitals.
Especially when market conditions deteriorated.
Snow and ice: 24 counties are on an orange alert.
Snow rations are still causing traffic difficulties, particularly on the second-class roads in Brittany, and there is a risk of disrupting some economic activities.
Twenty-four districts are now on an orange emergency for the risk of snow and ice.
L'Eure, l'Eure-et-Loir, forest Deux-Sèvres a la Vienne, joined the 20 districts that have already been declared for an orange emergency, 18 as early as Wednesday afternoon and two, la Dordogne and la Gironde, later at night.
According to Météo France, significant flurries of snow cause problems in the north of la Gironde and les Charentes and lightly snow on Ile-de-France.
Snow cover from 2 to 5 cm, in places from 7 to 10 cm, is expected in the districts concerned and a blanket of 1 to 3 cm, in places up to 5 in the Paris region.
The districts of Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, du Poitou and the districts of Basse-Normandie, Ile-de-France and Limousin are affected.
The flurries of the snow are large enough to cause transport difficulties and disrupt some economic activities, predicts Météo France.
On the coast of the Côtes d'Armor, some districts have banned the passage of heavy freight - lorries over 7.5 tonnes with the Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac route.
Road traffic on the roads of the second tiers in Brittany is, according to the officers, very difficult and the police recommend to drive their vehicle out of the way only when it is really necessary and the operation of some trucks has been cancelled for this day.
In Pikardia, school connections were banned for Thursday.
No specific measures are foreseen for restrictions on freight traffic on Wednesday evening.
The district office "calls on all car drivers to be as careful as possible on the roads and to adapt the driving of the nature of the road."
The General Directorate of Civil Aviation (DGAC) asked airlines to cancel 25% of their flights at Paris's Roissy airport on Thursday and 10% to the Orly due to expected snow flurries.
DGAC recommends passengers using air transport services to join their company.
In the UK, Gatwick Airport in the south of London and Edinburgh Airport in Scotland are closed until Thursday's shot.
Metro Grand Paris: first financial proposals
Since the debate about the modernisation of transport at Ile-de-France is in full swing, billions have been raining.
At least during the discussion.
We are particularly reminded of the 23 billion for the Grand Paris metro, to be built by Société du Grand Paris.
To launch this construction, the state announced a grant of €4 billion.
In theory, this is an amount that will then allow SGP to use part of the financing from its dual source for contracts.
Today we finally come to the first additions.
The 2010 Reinforcention Law, which is being examined by the Finance Committee of the National Assembly this morning, contains the mechanisms provided for to secure these funds.
There are two: creating a special equipment tax and an increase in the tax on the offices at Ile-de-France.
The first, we will read in the text of the bill, Article 15, reads "in favour of the public institution Société du Grand Paris."
It is quantified: 'The yield on this interest is 117 million euros per year'.
The second is the reconstruction of the office rate, which already exists "to be modernised, to increase the yield from it and to affect Société du Grand Paris" to the increase.
How much would it bring?
Přelost.
This is not quantified in the text.
We're far from 4 billion.
"It is specified that these fiscal resources are joining the 4 billion euros of the capital injection, which will be mobilised by the state and put into Société du Grand Paris according to the project," we can read in an explanation of the reasons.
To us at SGP, this system doesn't seem shocking.
"From the moment we created the revenue (both taxes, ndlr), we can cover up the studies for three years and then go up to 4 billion, it's explained."
"This will be budgeted and applied as needed'.
SGP considers that 4 billion will not be credited until 2013 for the 2014 budget.
This mechanism, in which the $4 promised billions, still benefits from absent subscribers, risks provoking a rather busy parliamentary debate.
The first public session will be on 7 December.
Facasive hackers and hard-working spies
The WikiLeaks case has a double meaning.
On the one hand, an overt scandal is exposed, a scandal that seems to be a scandal only in the face of the hypocrisy that governs relations between states, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it speaks of deep change at international level, and anticipates the future dominated by the regression.
But let's do it first.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks, this is a confirmation of the fact that every document compiled by the Secret Service (any nation) consists entirely of press cuts.
The "extraordinary revelations" of Americans about the way of Berlusconi's sex life announces what everyone has been able to read in any newspaper for months (all owned by Berlusconi except these two), and the infamously cartoonistic profile of Cadhafi has long been the example of a sketch for the cabaret performers.
The rule, according to which secret documents are only allowed to consist of reports already known, is essential in the dynamics of the secret services, and not only in this century.
When you go to a bookstore dedicated to esoteric literature, you will see that each work is repeated (on Graal, the mystery of Rennes-le-Château, Templars or Masons) exactly what was already written in previous works.
This is not only because the author of the occult texts does not like to search for new information (he doesn't even know where to find the non-existent news), but because those who devote themselves to occult believe only what they already know and what they confirm what they have learned before.
This is the Dan Brown's success mechanism.
The same goes for secret documents.
The informant is lazy, and the lazy (or limited spirit) head of the secret services (and, if he is not, he could, I know, be the editor of the newspaper Libération) who considers only what he admits to be true.
High-secrecy information about Berlusconi, sent by the U.S. Embassy to the state department, was the same one that Newsweek had published the week before.
So why did there be so much fuss about these documents?
On the one hand, they say what every cultured person already knows, namely that the embassy, at least since the end of World War II and since the heads of state can make calls or fly by plane for dinner together, have lost their diplomatic function and, with the exception of a few small representational exercises have been transformed into spy centers.
Any viewer watching the films about the investigation knows very well that it is only out of hypocrisy that it is seemingly ignored.
However, the fact that this is repeated publicly is defaced by the duty of hypocrisy and casts a bad light on American diplomacy.
Second, the idea that any hacker can obtain the most highly classified information of the world's most powerful country is a hard blow, not a not insignificant, for the prestige of this state department.
The scandal affects both the victims and its "executors."
But let's move from here to the deep truth about what happened.
Once, in the days of Orwell, all power could be taken, like a Big Brother who controlled every move of his people.
Orvell's prophecy has been proven since the ability to check each movement through the phone, every transaction you've done, the hotel visited, the highway used, and so on, has made the citizen a complete victim of a wreath of power.
But when we demonstrate how it goes now, that even the "trooks" with the most secret information of the powerful cannot resist the intervention of a hacker, the inspection report ceases to be one-way and becomes a circular.
Power is controlled by every citizen, but every citizen, or at least a hacker - elected as a citizen's avenger - can know all the secrets of power.
How can a power be sustained that no longer has the ability to preserve its own secrets?
It is true that Georg Simmel has already said that a true secret is an empty secret (and an empty secret will never be revealed); it is also true that all information about the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is a truly mysterious, empty secret because it is drawn from public life; but to reveal, as WikiLeaks did, that Hillary Clinton's secret was an empty-inct mystery is to take away all his power.
WikiLeaks made no mistake with Sarkozy or Merkel, but he did something big to Clinton and Obama.
What will be so significant the consequences of this wound by the established powers?
It is clear that in the future states will not be able to send online sensitive information - that would be tinged for its publication on a poster plastered on the corner of the street.
But it is also abundantly clear that with current technology, it is useless to hope that it is possible to keep messages confidential by phone.
There is nothing easier than to find out if and when the head of state was travelling by plane and contacting one of his colleagues.
How will private and sensitive messages be maintained in the future?
I know well that for the moment my prognosis belongs to science fiction and is therefore fantastic, but I have to imagine government officials who are transported discreetly filling formalities along uncontrollable routes and carry only those messages that they know by heart or rather hide the precious information in the backbeat of the shoe.
The information will be preserved in unique copies in drawers sealed with key: all in all, the attempt to spy in the Watergate scandal was less successful than the WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that the technology is now moving sideways forward, that is to say backwards.
One century after a wireless telegraph revolutionized communications, the Internet was rehabilitated by a telegraph based on wire (telephone).
Video cassettes (analog) allowed cinema lovers to capture the film step by step, move it forward and backward and unveil all the secrets of assembly,while now CDs (numbered) only allow you to jump on the chapters, that is to say, after macro mills.
We arrive from Rome to Milan in three hours via high-speed trains, while we arrive for a journey by plane and transport, which includes we need three and a half hours.
It is therefore not extraordinary that politics and communication techniques will return to horse-drawn cars.
Last note.
At other times, the press tried to understand what had been made about the secret of the embassy.
Now it is the embassies that demand confidential information from the press.
Climate: How France hacked its funding vows
A year after the Copenhagen Accord, it is time to test up to the promises of fast-blocked funding (fast start-up or early) implemented by developed countries.
And the great French hacks were revealed
In the Copenhagen Accord, the developed countries pledged to provide $30 billion in 2010-2012.
The European Union has promised €7.2 billion for three years and France €1.26 billion (i.e. €420 million a year).
At the launch of COP16, the EU drew a large ace to convince its partners of the reality of its fast-start commitment to finance the fast start: a report specifying the action of its member states, the press conference, the grand side event, the distribution of brochure...
A transparent operation invaluable and appreciated on its true value: developed countries and civil society would like all developed countries and civil society to do them the same and with equal degree of accuracy.
The EU announces that it made €2.2 billion available in 2010, which puts it on the right path to upholding its promise of €7.2 billion in 2012.
But if we focus on the detail, we find that things are much more complicated.
These funds are "new and additional" under the Copenhagen Accord to ensure that the increased burden is implemented without the detriment of Public Development Assistance.
Unfortunately, there is no consensus on what "new and additional" means.
While the European Commission has proposed harmonisation, some Member States, including France, have blocked the process.
Today, everyone chooses the reference that suits them best.
The European Commission, for example, saw 2009 as a reference: international funding has been preserved and it adds 150 million to it for a three-year fast start funding title.
Other countries have selected similar references with annual payment terms or terms at the level of public aid for development.
By contrast, France considers that the financing of "all new projects" of 2010 is 'new and additional'.
In other words, there is no reference to the expenditure of previous periods or to the global level of Public Aid for the Development of d'Aide publique au développement.
In particular, the total amount of support for France towards developing countries may remain constant (or even reduced), it is to honour its commitment to "new and additional funding...
Another crucial element is the distribution of donations and loans.
There is no rule yet, and each chooses their own method of calculation.
Some, such as. France, they are considering that 1€ borrowed is equal to 1€ donated.
Evidently, this is hard to prove: the effort is not comparable.
If the use of loans can be substantiated for some investments that are profitable (often to be projects linked to a reduction in emissions, consisting of more efficient technologies), it is foolish to present one euro that we receive as the equivalent of one euro we give... , we should not understand it as a loan price for the creditor country (i.e. the equivalent of the interest rate).
But France can only make such a justification: "compensating" its commitment of €420 million, of which 91.5% is the loan (€389.8 million) and 8.5% of donations (€36.11 million) - see the EU document to check for yourself.
It is the only country in the Union that uses a loan on such a scale.
Germany has requested 46% of there, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia (among others) abide by their commitments with 100% of their gifts.
In other words, when the vast majority of the European Union gives €1 to its promise in satisfaction, France will only give 10 centims and consider this effort to be comparable.
A beautiful juggler piece!
To summarise, in its financing of the "fast start" France operates with a double cheat: on the one hand, the development of the share over time and, on the other, with a real financial burden.
Although it is spending only €36.1 million, he can convince to spend €420 million "new and additional" in connection with her promises.
The manipulation of the Chancellor of the Exchequer (because it seems that although it is Bercy who made such decisions) could have a double negative impact, at the same time within the EU (why would the Member States continue to donate when just to lend?) and in the negotiations, because developing countries are not entirely naive...
The early financing chapter is just a small question, relatively short-term, in relation to a series of climate discussions.
But it could be a grain of sand in an enormous machine like the UNFCCC.
Let's hope that's not the case for us.
Whatever this is, it is essential to draw on the lessons of this first year of early funding.
First, France should announce a change in its way of keeping the accounting records for 2011 and 2012, in a spirit of respect for its commitments and decency and fairness to other European Union countries.
But above all, France should avoid a debate on deposits in long-term financing (another crucial chapter currently discussed): we will not escape the issue of 'additionality' or how loans are booked.
France should change its position to become as progressive for these deposits as the others.
Hope is therefore being put in the new Minister for the Environment, Mrs Kosciuo-Morizet, who will come to Cancun next week.
France's surprise fast-track announcement and its vision for "additional" and the use of loans could trigger an increase in the level of international confidence, necessary to move forward in discussions.
A pesticide-related alarm that children ingest.
A 10-year-old child will be devoured one day by 81 different chemicals, according to one study published this Wednesday, by the Future Generations Association (ex-Movement for Rights and Conservation of Future Generations).
The Association, which points out that its results "do not have a significant statistical value in view of the low number of samples analysed, but are characteristic of the processed issue," bought between July and September foods commonly consumed in four meals and one light meal as a light-hearted snack per child of roughly 10 years in supermarkets in l'Oise and Paris.
These typical dishes, including official recommendations - five pieces of fresh fruit and vegetables, three dairy products and 1.5 litres of water a day - as well as confectionery,they were analysed by research laboratories for chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other polluting agents.
The plate's balance is overwhelming: 81 chemicals, of which 42 are carcinogenic, possible or likely, and five substances are among the clear carcinogenic substances, as well as 37 substances that could act as disruptive to internal excrement glands (PEs), according to studies by several institutions such as the International Cancer Research Center.
"While in almost all cases the legal limits for each chemical admitted individually are not exceeded, in our research we can see well that the reality in the exposure of consumers to contaminating substances, possibly carcinogenic, and/or PE is striking," the association says.
For breakfast, butter and tea with milk contain about ten résidu, with possible carcinogenic effects, and three proven to be shown as certain carcinogens, as is the case with about 20 residues that could disrupt the hormonal system.
The apple, imported from Brazil, reported by the study as a small snack, contains traces of six chemicals, including a banned fungicidal agent in France.
The same goes for the green beans of Kenya, included in lunch, where studios have discovered traces of strong insecticides banned in the EU.
In addition, minced meat steak, tuna in a can, and even a bun and chewing gum were riddled with pesticides and other chemicals.
In the water from the tap, the analysis revealed the presence of nitrate and chloroform.
The salmon's steak for dinner was "richest" with 34 discovered chemical residues, and even the analysis of the plastic plate used to heat meals in the microwave did not avoid analysis.
The final risk for consumers of this "contaminant coke shell" is likely underestimated," the study shows.
The Association of Ecological Europe-Greens (EE-LV) proposed "facilitating to the emergency" to establish a moratorium on the use of pesticides to stop the "increase of civilisation diseases."
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Agency (EFSA) examined the residue status of 365 different pesticides identified in fruits and vegetables consumed in Europe, including 76 in cereal.
