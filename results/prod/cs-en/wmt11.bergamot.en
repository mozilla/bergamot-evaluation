What's he gonna do? CSSD in Prague does not know Voldemort or the pastry shop
The new councillors of the capital from the ČSSD will probably have to overcome a certain language barrier to understand their old ODS colleagues in the Prague Council and the council.
The daily Aktuálně.cz "tested" members of the new ČSSD council, as they know the notoriously established slang that was created at the town hall during the last years when Prague was governed by the current coalition partners.
The coded dictionary introduced by Prague's political elite during the previous era of Mayor Pavel Bém describes some of the most notorious figures, situations and cases in the metropolis.
Surprisingly, it turned out that the new councillors did not understand the familiar terms very well.
At least that's what he says.
"Who is Voldemort?"
"I really don't know."
"I am more of a newcomer to Prague politics," Lukáš Kaucký, a councillor for culture, responded to the "Godfather" test.
And while he is a political veteran, Councillor Karel Březina responded in kind.
Like the term "golf hole."
"It's the only expression of those you give me, which I sometimes use."
"Otherwise, I don't generally accept slang."
From the vocabulary, whose terms were published by Aktuálně.cz in June this year before the ODS election congress, the editors selected six examples, mainly of those notoriously associated with the Prague Municipality.
The Socialists were to explain the terms "Voldemort," "the biggest golf hole in Prague," "go to the confectionery," "the steep neck," "the capital's fame" and "noch"
The trio of the councillors agreed to the quiz, the fourth - Antonín Weinert, who is to head Prague's education in the future - first promised the interview, but later did not answer the phone.
Fifth councillor Petr Dolínek rejected the test outright.
"I don't care about these things at all, and I'm not going to evaluate the Civic Democrats."
"I'm now discussing how we're going to get along in our programs," he responded.
As has already been said, Councillor Lukáš Kaucký would reportedly not recognize in the headline above that we were talking about an influential businessman and friend of the ex-mayor Bém, Roman Janoušek.
"Voldemort" Kaucki means nothing to him, and the only term he correctly estimated in the test is "the biggest golf hole in Prague."
"That's the Blanka tunnel," Kaucký says, adding immediately: "But I know that from the newspaper."
"I'm going to have to pay for some language course," he jokes.
The golf hole is then decrypted as the Blanka tunnel to the administration not only by the matador Karel Březina, but also by the councillor for the environment Lukáš Plachý.
The two Social Democrats then know who Voldemort really is, and Lukas Plaché is familiar with where to find this character - he suspects the meaning of the term "go to the pastry shop" .
"I think that means going to a Prague business," Plachý is close to deciphering that it is the headquarters of Janoušek's companies.
Consistently with Březina, he recalls that he drew the knowledge from the newspapers rather than using such a vocabulary.
In social democracy, according to the test's frequented, there is no such concordised dictionary of slang terms.
"I went along with my colleagues, too, but it looks like we really don't have anything like that."
"We call ourselves more names, sometimes using shortcuts and garbles of names," says the chairman of the Prague ČSSD, Petr Hulínský, whom the partisans nicknamed Hulda.
"I was called Birch at the school, but I don't know if my colleagues call me that," confesses to his own nickname Karel Březina.
The daily Aktuálně.cz has tried the name and is working.
Councillor Weinert is nicknamed for partisans of Grandpa or less amicably, deputy Miroslav Poche, who drew attention to himself in the sponsorship of the party before the election, is nicknamed "Igracek" by some colleagues.
The nicknames are also the only thing the Social Democrats in the intra-party talk admit.
Hulínský is said to be disliked by Hulda, but Aktuálně.cz also noted another nickname for this Prague president.
"Dr. barend" is said to be reminded that Petr Hulínský received his JUDr. degree at the Bratislava Police Academy.
Government wants to limit the torture of 'witches', issue a brochure
The women declared to be the witches in Burkina Faso have several common traits.
They are more likely to be the older generation, unable to get involved in work for medical reasons, for example, and are unmarried and have no children.
The one who "stands" with the witch is sent to isolation so as not to endanger the rest of the village.
"The man will befall this fate very rarely."
"Nor are not the young healthy women who help at work and give birth to children," describes the nun, who takes care of more than a hundred women in a special home in a special home in the capital of the West African state of Burkina Faso.
The local government has now decided to take action against the unusual "social measure."
She issued an information booklet to help curb the witch-hunt.
But there is a catch to the Thing.
"More than 70 percent of adults in Burkina Faso can't read," Die Standard pointed out the disadvantage of the written education.
Proofing witchcraft is also common in other African countries.
In Ghana, bordered by Burkina Faso, 72-year-old Ammy Hemmah, died last week after being tortured by three women and two men to do so, doused with kerosene and set on fire.
The case was reported by the BBC.
The perpetrators claim that this was an unfortunate coincidence.
According to their version, the woman's oil was ignited, which is used for ritual rally anointing.
He said he caught fire after the group wanted to "kick up the evil spirit" from the woman.
The insulation of "witches" is supported by people, regardless of the level of educational attainment.
Der Standard quoted the 42-year-old businessman from Burkina Faso as saying: "The urges of human souls have always been a danger," he said.
While the government is trying to moderate the witch hunt in Burkina Faso, the president himself participated in Gambia last year.
"Gambia's President Jammia, after the death of his aunt, unleashed a massive witch-hunt that was supposedly to be involved in her death and seek to use black magic to kill the president himself."
"He has invited shamans from nearby Guinea to help himself, who, accompanied by police officers, soldiers and personal security guards, forcibly diverted randomly selected men and women from the Gambian villages to the President's farm in Kanilai," Amnesty International said in its report.
On the farm, trapped people had to drink a potion of herbs with hallucinogenic effects, which also caused bowel and kidney problems.
Two imprisoned stay on the farm did not survive.
After international pressure, nearly 1,000 of those imprisoned were eventually set free.
Bakala's tenant: He's drowning in a stove, a higher rent signed
An older, stocky man stepped out of the door of the client centre of RPG Byty Byty "uuhlobaron" Zdeněk Bakala, the largest private owner of rental flats in the Czech Republic.
He carried a folder under his arm and new lease agreements for the three apartments: his daughter and his son, who is in the execution of the sentence.
All three of them were just rented by deregulation.
Instead of 3,500 a month, the son will pay CZK 4100 for a 2+1 second-category apartment from next year.
"And there's no hot water, and petrama (fat tune-fuel, pictured)," the man says, pointing to the finger in his son's new contract, for which he has a power of attorney.
"But I signed it," he says, half-an angry and half-resigned.
The civic association BytyOKD.cz, which described the new lease conditions as "incorrect and immoral," advises the tenants not to sign the new contracts and wait until 7 December to publish instructions on how to proceed against them.
But the man is just waving his hand at it.
"One says it, the other says it," he frowns.
Ostrava is becoming a large laboratory of deregulation.
After the New Year, a large majority of flats, which still have non-market rent in the Czech Republic, are expected.
Aktuálně.cz therefore decided to visit the "laboratory" in person.
The RPG Havering House of Arc, it is one of four in Ostrava and is already full-time at 9 a.m. on Tuesday.
Next to the door is a security guard from the security agency and a kit machine.
"Ninter 2011", the special button on its touchscreen.
One tap and a paper with the number comes out of the machine.
You can't even read "157" and your figure is already beeping on the big display under the waiting room ceiling.
You're up in half a second.
The rent is asked to ask an older married couple after a while, but the rush in the waiting room is clearly not relevant to the new rents at all.
Most people came to solve common problems as usual - requests for repairs, insurance claims and the like.
Letters with new lease contracts have been given to the postal boxes by tenants in the post office boxes of the majority of the total of 44,000 flats of the RPG portfolio since about mid-November.
RPG Apartments are proposing in their letters to increase the rent by 15 to 38 percent.
The special counter to the new rents was opened at the client centre on November 18.
"It runs through the week, so it's only in the run," the desk worker replies after a moment's hesitation when the client introduces himself as a journalist.
Deregulation and Bakala's former mining apartments are a local impulsive subject.
He was taken up pretty loudly before the election by the deputy speaker of parliament and Ostrava-born Lubomír Zaorálek of the ČSSD, and even now the local paper is full of it.
"Twenty-years after them, I want a new floor."
"Nor did the "tranny board" was not exchanged for me in the bathroom," the man in question relieves himself in the introduction.
The most so far, according to the female workers, are pensioners coming in to see if they will receive a discount on the lease if they sign on time, as the RPG promises them in a special offer.
A half-term discount on the February rent will also be given to other tenants who will sign the new contract by December 15.
The Havířov "deregulation" counter, however, is certainly not overwhelmed with the questions.
"Overta's 360 clients, only about forty to fifty people were here because of the 2011 rent," the workers at the counter estimate.
RPG, on the web and its bulletin boards, proposes individual contract negotiation where necessary.
However, if neither party agrees to the lease, it will have to be determined by an independent court.
"This is not about threatening, but about information about only possible and completely legitimate legal procedure," the RPG points out on its website.
"No one will sue here," one of the RPG Byty workers thinks, and the man on the street in front of the client center partly agrees with her.
"I have a pension of 13,000 and I have five grand left to eat, I don't have the gives to sue," he claims.
The worker, however, is insecure afterwards.
"We'll see."
"Mr. Zaoralek tells them in the media not to sign, so people are probably waiting," he muses.
The regulation of rents ends in most of the Czech Republic with the New Year 2011 and according to the RPG Byta, increasing them is an economic necessity.
"The current rent is still not even above necessary for the simple maintenance of the housing stock," recalls Pavel Klimeš, director of the residential portfolio of RPG Byty, recalls that the just-effreated tenant's accused neglect of the housing stock is the main reason for the increase in rents, according to the homeowners.
While in the five years between 2005 and 2010, RPGs could have invested four billion in rentals, this is expected to be 5.2 billion in the four years from 2011 to 2014.
Meanwhile, a large screen hanging by the ceiling opposite the padded seats of the mining waiting room is repeating a few red-refounded information.
"The rent increase in 2011 is 15% or less of 31,200 flats, that's more than 90% of RPG flats."
"And it will always be the most of £7.50 per square metre per month," he says on the screen.
Only 400 flats in the RPG portfolio will the rent increase by 38 per cent.
"In these cases, this is an increase from an extremely small amount of CZK 19.66 per square metre," the RPG points out.
For 2600 flats, the rent will remain the same next year.
RPG Byty promises that deregulation will not cut rents in leaps and bounds, but will be spread out into four to eight years.
In addition, it adds another commitment: all the money from the rent increase (see chart) will be put back into the apartments by the company, mainly in the heat savings - new windows and insulation.
They are to be given to people who sign an agreement to increase rents.
The offices also include a nursery, the architects understood
The Avriopoint office building in Brno is the new headquarters of Arch.Design.
No one would have expected him to also be hiding a mini-chauet with everything that goes with it - with colored walls, imaginative furniture, a bunch of toys and even a miniature playground on the outdoor terrace.
Since October last year, it has been visited by the children of the employees of Arch.Design.
The archithentics-architectural-archite-the-theming company Arch.Design, from whose studios the emergence a number of important Brno buildings, counted on the space for its corporate mini-gallery from the first drawings of the Avriopoint building.
It employs nearly 90 people mostly in the age of the babyboro, and she cared about allowing the women of the designer and the architects to return to work quickly.
Together with the option of part-time work, the nursery is a benefit offered by Arch.Design to its employees as part of the social programme.
Builders and architects have the opportunity to combine a demanding job with child care.
The mini-church was invented by the employees of Arch.Design and, with the support of the management, they managed to obtain a European Union and a Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
The company mini-chool is funded by the European Social Fund through the Operational Programme Human Resources and Employment and the State Budget of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to the grant funding (an subsidy of 2, 8 mil. CZK) could purchase the equipment and equipment and provide qualified staff and operations for two years.
After the financial grant is exhausted (2 years), Arch.Design is obliged to operate the mini-chairs at its own expense for 3 years.
The project was prepared for one year and was significantly assisted by Economy Rating with the application for the grant.
The care is provided by qualified staff, the children are being cared for by a nurse and a kindergarten teacher, so children can attend kindergarten without age restrictions, yet most of them are over the age of 3 years.
Because it is a "minorchic," only 5 children can be present at the same time, but more will be replaced during the day.
The operation of the nursery is flexible according to the needs of the parents, and the children of all employees have the same right to use the nursery regardless of the hierarchy of position in the company.
Although it is an individual education and care, the programme content in the mini-tradle is comparable to the pre-school framework programme.
Children not only play here, but are also provided with quality teaching - from basic cognition to school bench preparation, English language is also taught.
The class is equipped not only with toys, inspiring games, but also with a computer that children can use.
The presence of young children right in the company creates a friendly and positive environment.
Parents can check their child at any time and the stressful situations are eliminated with the delayed collection of kindergarten children from their parents' workplace.
Parents thus use working hours more productively.
No wonder the employee's loyal relationship - the employer - is created here.
Arch.Design thus joined the ranks of Czech companies offering a significant benefit in the recruitment of new employees, being a family-friendly and through this program reinforced personnel marketing.
The Bone House is still fascinated by 100 years. Take a look at the interiors from Gaudi
The roof looks like the back of a prehistoric lizard, the staircase resembles the backbone of a dinosaur, and the balconies are an open fish mouth.
Such is the house of Casa Batlló in Barcelona by the Catalan architect Antoni Gaudí.
From the locals, the house earned the nickname The House of Bones thanks to its organic shapes.
Organic shapes, wild colors, unusual use of stone, tiled and mosaic fragments, a scales-like facade and ubiquitous soft curves are all typical of the Art Nouveau by Antoni Gaudi.
The facade of the house plays out the dreamy lines, tender colours and textures reminiscent of nature and animals.
In a detailed observation, you can see the geometricity, rhythm and the precisely thought-out order.
At night, the entire facade of the houses is even more dramatic, illuminated to make the impression of the glitch of the colours even more amplified.
The induction and twisting of shapes appears equally in the interiors.
The wood in the waves follows the window frames, the railing, the decorative elements of the door, the peepholes and the malls.
The Batlló house, which is located in the Eixample district on the bustling Passeig shopping street Grácia No. 43, was created by the reconstruction of the 1877 house by the architect Emilio Sala Cortese.
The renovation took place for two years and the house was completed in 1906.
The investor, wealthy industrialist Josep Batlló, had originally insisted on demolishing the old structure and building a brand new one, but soon embraced Gaudí's idea of an unusual and cheaper rebuilding.
But the Taam Batlló apartment house was not proposed by Antoni Gaudí himself.
It was co-operated with architect by architect Josep Maria Jujol.
It was on his design board that decorations for the representative apartment of the owner of the property were created and the use of the mosaic on the facade.
A number of other creators and artists also worked on the facade.
Working together on the designs of the Casa Batlló house started with Jujol's successful collaboration with Gaudi.
Yujol participated in the construction of Gaudí's house Casa Milá as well as Park Güell, which houses other of Gaudi's works.
From the locals, the house soon after completion was revived by its organic shapes, the nickname "House of Bones."
Others, because of the specific mechanism of window opening, began to call it a "slowing house."
It is also said that the Lord of St. George, the patron saint of Catalonia, is depicted at the top of the structure.
The hidden religious motifs also contain other sculptural elements of the building.
Gaudí designed for the house for his time a unique system of central heating with ventilation vents and typical chimneys.
Bizarre may seem to be their forty-five-degree slope.
In the creation of Gaudí, Gaudí absolutely disregarded the building regulations of the time and did not allow himself to be constrained by them.
At the beginning of the construction he obtained a building permit from the city, but the data provided by him were so vague that two years later, when the city council was horrified by the result and asked for a remedy.
Councillors were concerned, for example, that the structure had also affected the pillar and the public sidewalk.
There was never a correction, on the contrary: just fifteen days after the city's call to the city district, Josep Batlló applied (and successfully obtained) permission to rent the two highest floors of the building.
The owner himself moved into the lower levels.
The second-floor gallery featured a formal salon and a bedroom and a private part of the apartment on the third floor.
The ground floor was rented to a jewelry store.
The entire six-story house is intersected by a staircase to climb to the roof terrace itself.
The essential elements of the redevelopment were the abolition of all the right angles and straight lines and their replacement with curved walls.
Gaudí also worked with the modern concept of connecting space.
The social part can be completely connected by opening the parlour doors, and the larger company can communicate comfortably without at the same time preserving the privacy needed for more intimate conversations.
The house with the Gaudí reconstruction also received an unconventional roofing and two extra floors in addition to the new facade.
Also impressive is Gaudi's play with light, blue and white glazed tiles, with which the inner courtyard is lined with, and skylights.
The game of two colours adds maximum light to all floors of the house.
Simply betting on the principle that the white reflected light more than the dark, which absorbs the sun's rays.
The house Casa Batlló, which was included in the Unesco World Heritage Fund in 2005, can be visited by anyone.
On the first floor of the house, the roomiest and most ophazeshomed apartment is made available to the public.
The owners did not oppose the move until 2002, to mark the 100th anniversary of the famous creator's birth.
They remained at the tours, finding that it was a very advantageous establishment and, in addition, they extended the tours with joint and attic spaces, including the roof terrace.
Admission to the monument is by no means insignificant, at €16.50 and students, pensioners, groups and tourist card holders have a 20% discount.
The sum greatly exceeds the price of admission to other Gaudí buildings in the city.
If you want to get a taste of the real atmosphere of the house with the dragon's turrets, you have to make a quick makeover with one of the residents of the apartment building and visit it right at home.
How to choose a mattress and a grate: women have different requirements than men
Not the opulent bed frame, but the quality of the lounging surface, the mattress and grate, give the base of a really good bed.
However, they must be complemented in a harmonious way to suit a particular user.
A lot of things make up for the selection, from weight, height, age, health and gender of the owner.
Also important is the type of interior in which the mattresses and grate are purchased.
A typical example?
For example, weekend cottages, where they don't regularly heat up, there are no suitable latex mattresses because they are slower to "heat."
In addition, they have a significantly higher weight than a standard polyurethane mattress.
It is necessary to turn them over regularly.
For if they don't have a lot of venting ducts in the core, and they're still on the solid slab, they hold back the humidity: Mold could appear underneath them.
The choice is also decided by habit.
Who has spent a long time abroad, where very high mattresses are often used with a softening layer, will find it difficult to feel comfortable on a low and hard surface.
"Perhaps all the hockey players who were coming back from the NHL complained to me that they wouldn't get any sleep."
"For their battered shoulders, heels, and hips, they needed mattresses with a softening layer of lazy foam."
"Such is recommended for people with diabetes who have a nervous system disorder, so they misread "information" from the joints and the skin," explains Sylva Hadamczik, who specializes in upholstered furniture.
For many hockey players, as well as other customers, they were looking for lazy foam mattresses years ago.
"Today it's fine, the mattresses have for example Tempur, the Italian Magniflex, but also the Czech Tropico."
You don't have to be the NHL guy to appreciate the lazy foam.
This "miracle" works simply.
It optimizes its stiffness and the shape according to the absorbed heat, or adapts to your warm body.
Nothing is pressifying you, you won't be flipping over at night like a tough match.
You just get better sleep.
The lining foam also acts as a protection against bedsores.
When choosing the size of the mattress, add the foot length to your height, which is usually about 21 to 34 cm.
The man and woman, with a height of about 180 cm, so need a bed of 210 to 220 cm.
The minimum width for one should be 90 cm for the double bed, i.e. 180 cm.
For stand-alone beds, such as singles, at least 120 to 140 cm is recommended.
For comfort and a possible visit.
"Otherwise, the bed width rule is simple: when lying on your back, your hands should be comfortably slightly bent at the elbow," says Ing. Helena Prokopová, a guild of the upholsterers and decorators, who has been involved in the issue of healthy sleeping and ergonomics of furniture for many years and has been lecturing it at vocational schools.
At the double bed, everyone needs their own grate and mattress, but here you are careful to buy to reconcile the height of the mattresses.
Otherwise, you'll have no choice but to mount the grids to different heights, but you may not be able to do that with each bed frame.
The foam mattresses should have a height of at least 14 cm, the types with a spring skeleton of at least 15, of which at least three centimetres count on the moulding and raising layer.
"When you touch your hands or touch the mattress, you definitely mustn't feel the springs," warns Helena Prokopová.
Each mattress requires a certain type of grate.
The all-rounded beds, when the mattresses and the base are like the fused siam twins, have no business in the bedrooms.
Mattresses are poorly ventilated, you can't wash their upholstery, which is now common.
And because we normally sweat 0.2 to 0.75 l of sweat per night, it is clear that after five to seven years of the mattress, it will start to resemble one large (and clogged) sieve.
That is why experts reject advertising slogans on the lifespan of mattresses for up to 25 years, or even life-long warranters.
But everything has its but.
And that's why the advice from the salesman's practice: for a mattress with a width of 120 or 140 cm of hygiene and a removable coating, but add a mattress guard, which you can easily remove and wash.
Although mattress covers are commonly made today, they have been plugged all over the perimeter, so that after unbuckling we get two parts (for washing and washing machine size a lot important!), the handling of larger types (and in one person) could resemble a lightweight battle in the ring with the heavy when it is taken.
Do you have a solid slab in your bed instead of a grate?
Never!
Maximum for a bed designed for one-night stays.
However, you still provide the plate (if it no longer has them) with ventilation holes and use a mattress with a spring skeleton and a height of at least 15 cm with springs in sachets (Taschenfederkern) and a raising layer.
The polyurethane mattress does not belong to such a base.
For non-catching vane grids with 14 to 18 lamellas, latex or sandwich mattresses (such as a combination of latex and coconut) will be suitable, but you will always be worth grind with more slats of slats, 28 or more, where the lamellas are doubled in the liny burner area and can be regulated by the tunic.
The positioning lamellar grid does not include a mattress with a spring skeleton because they do not respond to positioning.
In addition to setting the stiffness of the slats, you can also indulge in the so-called shoulder cradle.
It is a special attachment of the slats, which allows you to push or even tilt the slating so that the sleeper's shoulder is pretty much "backed."
For men who have "the back of the top of the back," an important thing.
It is even remembered by mattress manufacturers, who in the "men's" have started to use the softening zone just in the shoulder area.
They also remember women - they are given a softer surface in places of hips.
For the most demanding customers, the wings or platelet grates with so-called multitorous suspension are intended.
The pressure is spread down into more points and the voltage is reduced.
But beware, once you use the wrong pillow on the correct mattress and the grate (big and "super-suit"), most "plus" disappears.
The basic rule is simple: the cushion is supposed to support the head and toe-topping only to the shoulders so that the shoulder muscles can be relaxed.
It is recommended to be a suitable size 50 x 60 cm, which they prefer in Scandinavia, for example.
When lying on the side, the cushion should be balancing (along with the shoulder cradle of the grate or the softened zone in the mattress) the height of the shoulder.
Modern mattresses have something to do with the original mattresses filled with grasses.
Their manufacturers are increasingly using natural materials or at least admixtures.
The trend is simply for the mattress bio.
Raw materials from oil from which polyurethane foam are made are replaced by natural oils, such as jumping and soy.
It is soy that all the manufacturers known use.
"Bio at the mattress means that the core is made of a material of purely natural origin," explains Petr Vašíček from Tropico Plus.
Natural substances are also used in the production of mattressing covers, one of the first being aloe vera.
But you can also indulge in microcosps to release the fresh scent of the forest or lavender.
There is also a division for men and women.
While the men are "cooled down" by a herbal birch extract to absorb the heat of the mattress and cool the body, women's upholstery "heat" upholstery.
Red pepper extract increases blood circulation, making it warmer for the weaker sex.
Today's favorites?
Mattresses made of cold foam (it has larger pores with a broken cellular structure, making it more breathable than a normal polyurethane and offers better elasticity.
A combination of various stiffness of cold foam and "lazy" foam creates multi-zone mattresses that know exactly where the head, loins and heels should be.
You will pay for a quality mattress from seven thousand crowns and above.
Those that meet health parameters tend to have a lower VAT rate, they are taken as medical aids.
He was the first to reach this advantage in the Czech Republic for Gumotex.
Saving on a mattress and a grate is not easy.
Sometimes you can use, for example, the actions of manufacturers or retailers, which offer two mattresses at the price of one.
For example, the Magniflex brand offers a Duofreeze mattress with a sewn Memory memory foam to the coating for £11,990.
The second, however, can already be purchased for free.
The era of lazy, or viscoelastic foams with an open cellular structure and high density, kick-started Tempur material at the "space" pace.
It was originally created as NASA material because the launches were subjected to enormous overload.
Tempur softens in the warmth, while it is strengthening in the cold.
It adaps perfectly to the warm human body and sets its pressure on optimally.
It is therefore ideal against the emergence of bedsores, but also to increase the comfort of sleeping.
Viskoelastic foams are used not only for mattresses, but also for medical products, like special cushions under the feet, which lighten the feet and the venous system.
Domestic manufacturers use eucathm C or Twinsaver, for example, and the like.
More and more parents want to watch people, so they want to watch their children
Fear for his own child is bringing more and more people to the idea of watching via GPS.
The system originally created to search for cars can also track the movement of people, thus helping, for example, in such cases as the disappearance of nine-year-old Anička Janatková.
The device is as big as a matchbox yet, but it can soon be as big as a watch.
A number of people were startled by the case of the missing Annie and began to look for the means to protect their children better.
Even at the cost of invading their privacy.
"We try to tell everyone that it is not about spying, but another means of reducing the likelihood of a tragedy," says Petr Pilin of Macro Weil, which is one of the suppliers of surveillance equipment to the Czech market.
"I admit that in some case, such devices may be misused, like when they're put in someone's bag who doesn't know it, but we haven't encountered a case like that yet."
"Most of the time, customers actually buy it for safety reasons," Pilin added.
According to him, the child should always know for what purpose the "box" is for and how it is used in the event of an emergency.
Child psychologist Dana Bočková points out that if the child does not want to wear anything like this, he will simply get rid of it.
"Even very young children show great creativity in how to deliberately lose some things when they don't want to be under control."
"Large expectations were raised earlier for parents by cell phones, which, however, can be turned off just like these tracking devices," says Bočková.
It is also questionable whether such a device would actually help in the event of an attack.
"As far as the upcoming kidnapping is concerned, the perpetrator will virtually always ensure that the child has no electronics on him to reveal his location."
"Now it's the phone."
"When the tracking devices start to expand, they will also look for them, because their sale will certainly be supported by massive advertising."
"In that case, the criminals will always be one step ahead of the police," the psychologist says.
However, he admits that a similar device can help in the event of a paedophile assault.
According to Robert Čech of RC Monitoring, which offers tracking services for both cars and people, even if the tracking device is immediately destroyed after the attack is attacked, its presence can help.
The device may be set to be sent to the positioning periodically after a certain period of time."
"If it is damaged, at least the last position of the person concerned will be available."
"The more expensive devices have also built-in tilometers, so even if one merely slimes and remains lying motionless, the device will immediately send a warning with the location," says Čech.
According to him, a similar service can be done by smart mobile phones with navigation, where you only need to upload special software.
The problem with the current surveillance units is that they are either appliances similar to pendants the size of a matchbox or smaller mobile phones.
They are always at risk of losing them.
According to Pilin of Macro Weil, this is why a device that looks like a regular digital watch is being tested.
"That's the biggest advantage that a possible aggressor doesn't have to recognize the tracking device at all."
"Or he'll recognize them after a while and that can give the police extra time," he adds.
Whether the tracking devices are developed into bracelets or pendants, they will still use the same technology used to guard wagons.
It is a combination of positioning through the GPS system (used by common auto-favigation) and a mobile phone feature that reports the car's current position.
The army has incendiary cords that they would arm the Czech Republic. But it will only last two years
The Czech army purchased 445 kilometres of tins to be used to set off the explosives.
Already last year, the Ministry of Defence delivered 224 kilometers of cords to the warehouses.
The army has supplies for 225 years.
The problem is that the shelf life of the caucus is two, four years at the most.
The army bought the fuse lines from the stock STV Group, a. s. for CZK 40 million.
The general staff, in the justification for buying such a huge number of incendiary troughs, wrote off the MF DNES that the soldiers in training consumed 60 kilometres of foulers a year.
However, calculations of the army's bomb squad, which were approached by MF DNES, show that then all generals, army command officers, secretaries or cleaners would have to undergo very intensive pyrotechnical training each year.
Defence Minister Alexander Vondra and army commander Vlastimil Pick included.
Only then could the annual consumption of the army of sixty kilometres of fittings be justified.
This length is equivalent to 25,000 explosions.
And even if it did, the army's supplies would be enough for more than a decade.
If, on the other hand, it would be true that at most two meters of fuse, as the experts say, it is enough to train each new professional that a minimum of two meters of fuse, the army, with a fresh purchase, secured - with increased consumption of the gene or special forces - supplies for the aforementioned 225 years.
Soldiers of the Rapid Deployment Brigade complained to Minister Vondra in person recently that they had almost no rounds of handguns, so even the shooting for lack of money was limited.
Not to mention the lack of underwear.
"It doesn't give me any head that they're buying such a large number of fuses from us repeatedly."
"But it's their decision, and I'm sure they know what they'll care for."
"For us, the army is a good customer whom we try to accommodate as merchants," says STV Group business manager Jan Děcký.
Defense Ministry spokesman Jan Pejšek justifies hundreds of kilometres of purchased cord and that the army will have supplies of this "ammunition" for at least ten years.
However, Jan Děcký of the STV Group speaks only of the four-year life of the fuse and the police or army bomb squad only about two years.
"With the perfect storage, it can be the four," says one of them, who as a soldier does not want to disclose his name as a soldier because of criticism from the army.
After life has expired, each ammunition must be carefully tested to see if it is still reliable and endangering the soldiers' lives.
However, these tests are not free and cost more money.
Another Ministry's argument is the quantity discount on the 445-kilometer incendiary of clashes.
"We were 60 percent less than last year's van two hundred and forty-four kilometres," the Pejšek spokesperson relayed the position of the Defence Department's purchasing.
Just for the sake of comparison, the annual consumption of the firing strings of police bomb squad, which is destroying World War II ammunition or the Soviet army, has not exceeded 1,500 metres for several years.
And the police always order enough to consume this ammunition before the end of their life.
It has worked for her to ensure the safety of the bomb squad, and can also more flexible in obtaining more modern, and therefore more reliable, cords.
The Ministry of Defence is already in considerable difficulty in eliminating tens of thousands of tons of ammunition from the Warsaw Pact, when the 200,000-strong Czechoslovak army was preparing to campaign on the Rhine.
The Czech one, according to the bomb squad, which was approached by MF DNES, is the same problem in a few years: it will eliminate hundreds of kilometres of old fouls that the "cheap" is buying today.
To this day, I draw from the contacts I received thanks to the competition
The winning place in the Entrepreneur of the Year competition helped Lukáš Pytloun in the sale of the franchise of his hotel.
The winner of the previous year's Entrepreneur of the Year competition was the 28-year-old entrepreneur Lukáš Pytloun from Liberec.
His story of success is like a movie.
Lukáš Pytloun liked to travel.
And abroad he realized that Liberec lacked quality accommodation at a reasonable price.
From savings from foreign jobs and a bank loan, he bought a half-ruined house with five flats.
For a student of his third year of college at the time, he was a great courage.
"The ratio between the quality and price of accommodation at the time did not give me to try to do something about it," says Lukáš Pytloun.
The first renovated apartment began to be leased to foreign workers.
He invested all the profits back into a house, which he gradually turned into a guesthouse with 54 beds.
Since then, in seven years of business, he has gradually opened four guesthouses in Liberec, two stylish restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of over 300 beds of all accommodation categories.
The most comfortable of these until recently was the four-star Pytloun design hotel.
This year, however, there was another, of the same quality.
"We are currently signing a contract with the hotel in Ostrov u Tisé, where we have sold our franchising concept and other bidders for the hotel's hotel franchise, Pytloun is applying," says last year's number one tradesman.
"And in this sale the licence to operate the hotel was largely the result of the victory in the Entrepreneur of the Year competition," adds Pytloun, appreciatively.
The victory brought him more acquaintance and popularity in Liberec and its surroundings.
"People got to know me on the streets, they often congratulated me afterwards, and I have to say it was nice," he recalls.
Participating in the competition is definitely recommended by everyone who is trying to do something.
It is not even necessary to win, any visibility is good.
He says he still draws on contacts and connections he might not have gotten to in any other way.
"I started doing business with some of the contest because of the competition."
The fame associated with the success, according to him, also fared a bit on each employee.
And that he's in his 70s.
"I see more loyalty and pride in participating in something that has gained widespread recognition."
"It's not just my personal achievement, it's the result of a good job for all of us put together."
"Only my name is being pushed to the forefront," says Lukáš Pytloun modestly today.
I wish your successor a quieter year than we had in the Farmet
The euphoria of the victory was quickly replaced by the effects of the crisis.
But the winner's purposefulness has given Farmet a rainy day.
For the award for first place in the last year's Vodafone Company of the Year competition, the owner of Farmet, Karel Žďárský, came to the owner of the company in the Slovanský dům last year.
The jury at the time praised the efforts through which he built a small tool shop in Česká Skalice into a company with hundreds of millions of turnovers.
"I can say that the award has encouraged not only me, but all my team-workers and has increased our confidence for the match with the competition," says last year's winner today.
At the beginning of Farmet's history, there was a desire to do something useful.
So, when the state offered the father of Karel Žďárský to rent a small workshop as compensation for communist-confiscated property, he did not hesitate for a long time, he refused to have a career at the firm where he was then working, and he and a few friends around his dad set up a plastic bathtub company.
Soon later, they began to specialize in the presses of vegetable oil.
After 18 years, they became the largest automotive press manufacturer in Central Europe.
The company got more awareness even among the non-professional public after the success achieved in the competition through the media.
"Not only did our customers start to perceive the Farmet brand significantly better, but also foreign partners began to appreciate that they were working with a company that achieved greater success in their country," says Karel Žďárský.
But the past year was not just a sign of euphoria from the victories in the Farmet.
The award was based on the company's economic results until 2008 and only partially from 2009.
And it was 2009 that was the toughest year for selling engineering goods.
A crisis that has not touched on citizens has taken all the upside, but companies have already stopped their investment projects and have started to cut back on purchases of new machinery and technology.
"Of course, this situation has not escaped us."
"Revenues fell by 40 percent, we had to cut production and there were layoffs," explains Karel Žďárský.
A viable company must be able to take such unpopular measures at times.
But they handled the situation and kept the company in profit, albeit smaller than before the crisis.
What they did not discount at Farmet, however, is the investment in research and development.
"We built a research and training centre from the subsidies, we strengthened the presentation at international trade fairs, they won the main awards in domestic exhibitions," says Žďárský.
All indications are that the crisis is behind them.
Sales are up again, and with them the number of new employees.
"I wish the new winner a pleasant feeling of winning, but in a calmer atmosphere," says Karel Žďárský.
Poll that removes nonsensical regulations
The poll on the Absurdity of the Year is part of the business race for the fourth time.
Some nonsensical regulations have already been repealed.
The famous winner of the next edition of the Absurdito of the Year poll was the obligation to wear documents to the office that are also accessible to officials online.
More than a third of the less than 4,000 voting members have made the decision.
For example, the Social Security Administration required a paper extract from the Commercial Register, even if the official can obtain it with two mouse-click.
The poll will change that.
"The Czech Social Security Administration will no longer require an extract from the Commercial Register for inspecting insurance payers," said ČSSZ spokesperson Jana Buraňová.
A light on all the regulations and regulations that companies and entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic have to comply with, and the nonsensical ones are to be repealed by the Absurdity of the Year contest.
It is part of the business race organized by Hospodářské noviny for the fourth time this year and is increasingly popular among the public.
If some three thousand voted vote last year, there were already nearly four thousand of them this year.
And no wonder, all sorts of legal obligations that only serve to delay business is still enough with us.
"For example, in the number of paperwork for tax returns, we are at the forefront in the world," notes Karel Havlíček from the Association of Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises and Trades Employers of the Czech Republic.
In recent years, business simplification has become a professed target for all governments.
Compared to the world, however, the situation in the Czech Republic is not particularly improving.
According to the World Bank, the Czech Republic ranked 74th in terms of conditions for business, that is eight places worse than last year.
The Absurdity of the Year competition was first announced in 2006 and is conducted annually in the same scenario.
Anyone can sign up for administrative and bureaucratic nonsense every year from April to the end of September, when the competition is the deadline.
The web address www.firmaroku.cz The organizer of the contest will then select seven candidates for "anticena" and let the public vote on it over the internet during October on the website www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz.
The absurdity that gets the most votes wins.
More than a hundred were entered for this year's poll, or 105 regulations and regulations that lacked meaning.
Tips were sent by entrepreneurs, as well as by professional associations and journalists.
Among the "finalists" of the competition, among the nominees, there was, for example, a requirement that cars toll pay for motorway and express road maintenance vehicles, or for entrepreneurs with 20 employees, two offices and two toilets to paint every two years.
The list of this year's seven designs is published on the competition's website.
The announcement of the competition, which takes place at the beginning of November on Wenceslas Square in Prague, is part of the hapenning, which is regularly attended by the personalities of political and social life.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodová, the director of the Association of Small and Medium Enterprises and Craft Professionals of the Czech Republic, or Petr Kužel, the president of the Chamber of Commerce of the Czech Republic, assisted on this climax of the competition.
"Economic prosperity cannot function where the state throws businessmen in the face of it, so my aim is to cancel at least three dozen paragraphs every year, which today only unnecessarily complicate business," said Minister of Industry and Trade Martin Kocourek.
The effort to repeal senseless regulations does not come to be empty.
In 2007, people were most bothered by the obligation to report the entrepreneur to the trade office three days in advance at the place where the permanent establishment is located, the intention to go to an exhibition or pilgrimage with a stall.
This obligation was removed by the amendment to the Trade Licensing Act.
The second most voted obligation in 2007, which was the report to the employment office for its foreign employee, a business trip of up to 30 days, was removed by the So-Green Card Act.
And for the third time, all the charm.
The absurdity of the year in 2009 was the regulation of physiotherapists to have a large mirror, a refrigerator and two treadmills in the office.
This has been avenged by a decree of the Ministry of Health this year - the obligation to have a refrigerator has fallen by the wayside.
The new category awards socially responsible companies
Environmental, humanitarian, educational or sports projects are evaluated.
A new feature in this year's fifth edition of the competition of Hospodářské noviny is the category entitled Responsible Company of the Year 2010.
The mission of this competition is to promote a sensible and fair business.
"We want to support companies that take into account the environmental impacts of their business and support socially responsible activities," says Patrik Bartholdy, regional manager of the mobile operator, Vodafone, which is the promoter and guarantor of the competition as well as in the rebel-of-year competition.
Companies entered this first edition of this special subcategory of the main competition Vodafone The company of the year, for which success in doing business is not the only long-term goal.
The story of each of them is very inspirational and would be published on a separate article.
Although the subject-matter of its activities is diametrically opposed to one's activity, support and consideration can be considered as common denominators of their endeavor.
In one case, it concerns, for example, disabled people and elsewhere, for example, with personal problems or the health of their own employees.
Among the 14 nationwide finalists were, for example, the Prague software company Et Netera, which supports the creation of informal sports teams among employees, who then take part in a number of tournaments in various sports.
Another example of the responsible company from the Pardubice Region is Isolit-Bravo, which has been the main contributor to the endowment fund sponsoring handicapped children for seventeen years.
Its disabled employees are again cared for by a paper mill from Poděbrady, which has more than 70 percent of them, which therefore won the title of Responsible Company of the Central Bohemian Region and placed third in the Vodafone Company of the Year competition in the Region.
In Olomouc, the accounting firm MiRyz Soft, which introduced flexible working hours, was also reduced to an average 35-hour per week, but without proportionally reduced pay.
The title was also awarded to her by the jury for preferably buying from Czech producers, supporting civic activities in the surrounding area and saving the environment.
"We are trying to recycle as much as possible so that our business and our administration have the least impact on the environment," explains Managing Director Miluše Ryznárová.
Responsible IT company Enlogit from the Ústí Region is thinking about the health of its employees and has got them ergonomic chairs and keyboards for each laptop, supports their work from home and uses catering services provided by the local protected workshop at its corporate events.
"In addition, we support the People in Need Foundation, which specifically helps the local Roma community," says Ondřej Suchý, a representative of the company.
Last but not least, it is also worth mentioning the activity of the company Ping and Cleaning from the Karlovy Vary Region, which contributes to their supplementary pension insurance in the form of above-standard bonuses.
"In our country, we give contributions to food, transport, upskilling and recreation," says Josef Strapáč of the Bruntal construction company Czasch, the winner in the Moravian-Silesian Region.
All the regional finalists of the Vodafone Company of the Year competition were automatically entered into the category Responsible Firm of the Year, who answered the questions of the questionnaire attached to the application and sent it to the organiser by 15 August at the latest.
Incorrectly completed or incomplete replies in the questionnaire were then removed from the evaluation by the organiser.
"If the competing company representatives did not answer the questions, they could not participate in the Responsible Company of the Year competition, but are not disqualified from the "main" competition Vodafone Company of the Year."
"A separate entry just for this competition is not possible, as it is a sub-category of the main Firma of the Year competition," explains Karel Goldman from the organizing agency Bison & Rose.
At the Land Fund in Pilsen, police arrested during a public tender
The Land Fund building in Pilsen has been arrested by anti-corruption police in recent days.
The school was deployed by detectives to a local businessman in the media sphere and real estate salesman Luboš G.
He allegedly attempted to manipulate the ongoing tender to settle the restitution claims so that the land offered in the competition was acquired by a specific bidder.
He was to pay Luboš G. half a million crowns for it.
"For the time being, I can only confirm that the police are prosecuting one person for the misdemeanour of the misconduct in a public contract and in a public tender," Antonie Zelená, the head of the Plzeň prosecutor's office, told Právo, noting that further details with regard to the ongoing investigation could not be provided.
The 46-year-old businessman was released by police officers after 24 hours.
The way he could have influenced the public tender is only speculated, given the minimum of official information.
Landftowner spokeswoman Lubomíra Černá, a spokeswoman for the Landftaccus Fund, said when asked by Právo that officers had actually made arrests at the secéřée workplace in Pilsen, during a public tender.
"It was a client, not our employee," she clarified.
The public tender is the correct name, according to the Black, "The Call for the submission of claims for the transfer of land under the Land Act" and takes place in the case of the offered land being taken in the interest of the offered applicants.
"As part of the call, these persons offer a higher value of their restitution claims to be settled by transfer than the declared value of the land."
"According to the claims offered, the order of the acquirers is determined and the Land Fund then transfers the land to the person who offered the highest claims," the fund's spokesperson explained.
Luboš G. apparently had information about who entered the challenge, and because he is also a beneficiary of the appeal, having bought up a number of restitution claims, he offered the landlord not to participate in the contest.
For that, he probably collected severance pay.
That would explain that he had such a large sum of money when he was detained.
Luboš G. had above-standard contacts at PF in Pilsen in the past.
He was in the case of former PF chief Václav Sankot, who was being prosecuted for issuing land in replacement restitution to which a decision on the location of the construction had already been issued.
It was then that Luboš G. received from the fund, for example, land for the construction of public roads, specifically the site where the access hall to the Borská pole industrial zone was to be built.
Later, he traded them very profitably with the Municipality to a house in the historic city centre itself, which was worth much higher.
At the time, the town hall had to accept it, otherwise it would have put the construction at risk by blocking the land.
Households pay hundreds a month for housing
From January, households will have to pay extra not only for all types of energy, but also for aqueous and sewerage, heat supply and rents to rise somewhere.
The families will have to withdraw from their wallets from their wallets by up to hundreds of crowns more per month than they do now.
Electricity will go up to 4.6 per cent more expensive, the gas will be about 2 per cent more expensive, up by a tenth in some cities you will have to pay extra for water supplies and in many cases also undercutting the supply of central heat.
The increase in electricity should be more expensive for households in the flats per year than it is now.
At the same time, power prices have been lowered by all the main suppliers, so a significant increase in support of the production of renewable energy sources, especially photovoltaics, is to blame.
Gas will become more expensive slightly, but at a time when people are the most heated and have the highest consumption.
They must therefore also expect an extra hundreds of crowns a year.
While electricity and gas become more expensive across the country, the change in the price of central heating varies from place to place.
The price increase is mainly planned by larger municipalities.
For example, households in Pardubice or Hradec Králové will pay an extra CZK 50 per month for central heating from January, with families in Liberec paying more than CZK 1,000 a year for central heating.
For its part, Prague residents are at risk of making water and sewerage more expensive for them by more than 9 percent if the city increases rent from infrastructure.
If the rent does not change, the Roasted 6.8 percent will be paid.
However, the price in Prague will still be among the lower in the national comparison.
In the north of Bohemia, where prices are already among the highest, the water and stodgy is expected to increase by 7.4 percent.
For example, the rent price in 450,000 rental apartments may rise significantly, where regulations expire from January.
For example, CPI Byty, which owns about 2,500 flats in Ústí nad Labem, intends to increase the rent by up to one hundred percent from January.
Those who do not agree to the new renting will be put in court by the company.
Regulated rents, paid by people in around 300,000 apartments, could grow by up to ten percent next year.
Czech children get drunk with fernet and rum. Beer is out of fashion, works slowly
Fernet, rum, vodka, exceptionally a better brand of whisky stolen from their parents.
These are the drinks, after which the drink is most often ended up in the care of doctors by drunks who were not yet even fifteen years old.
The exception is not children who are treated repeatedly from the monkey at the hospital.
This is according to the experience of doctors who encounter similar cases in the income of children's ward of hospitals.
"Some beers or wines are completely immoder, because it takes a long time to get drunk with them."
"The trend is definitely hard alcohol," Luděk Pelikán, head of the children's department at the Hořovice Hospital in Central Bohemia, told Právo.
"If they manage to pull the bottle out of your daddy's closet, it's a whiskey, but otherwise the fernet and the vodka predominate."
"The water has the advantage of pouring it into the juice and not feeling that much of it," the chief surgeon explained.
And he is supported by the spokesperson of the University Hospital Motol, Eva Jurin.
"It's fernet or rum most of all."
"This is modern alcohol today especially in elementary schools."
"In some cases, it was a slivovitz they brought from home," Jurin said.
According to the head of the Pelikán, 13 or 14-year-old female drinkers are a relatively common occurrence at hospital intake.
In front of Hořovice, where he has been since this year, he worked for ten years on pediatrics in Motol, where ambulances bring in underwatched schoolchildren from a wide area.
"One girl lay with us about four times."
"She started her career at the age of 12, when she was brought to us with a blood alcohol level of 3.5 extra in combination with ecstasy," the doctor said, describing a particularly serious case.
"She was at the Exhibition Centre in Holešovice for a dance party."
"Interestingly, her mother didn't find it strange at all that she didn't know about her daughter for 48 hours," the chief surgeon said.
It is the lack of interest of parents, or even their considerable tolerance for drinking their own offspring, that is considered the main cause of the growing childhood drink.
However, addiction in the truest sense of the word cannot be discussed in children.
"Actober to the term of alcohol, several years of chronic alcohol dependence with all the phenomena that are not there for this, and that is not the case with children."
"For those who use alcohol repeatedly, it is more of a characteristic unsuccessful family-social background," explained the head of the Pelikán.
According to Jurin, a spokeswoman for Jurin, they hospitalized some forty drunk children at the pediatric clinic in Motol this year.
However, only those with severe intoxications that had to stay in the hospital get into the statistics.
The child drunks, who are taken away by their parents after outpatient treatment, or are brought home by the police, do not count in any way.
Except for children to just sit down after school and drink a bottle of liquor, there are three seasonal upsides that can be relied upon to: the witch, New Year's Eve and the end of the school year, according to Pelikán.
"They either drink the sorrows from the wrong report card or celebrate the start of the holidays."
"Of course, I've had seven child drunks on the witch at theus at theus at theus at theus at the same time," the Pelican said.
Ironically, a drunk who spends the night detoxifying under the supervision of doctors is at an advantage over the one who suffers an unpleasant hangover at home the next day.
In fact, morning headaches caused by dehydration and lack of glucose are driven by the induction infusions with glucose and nutrients that the body is missing.
"They're actually better off, because they have a good awakening after that beautiful evening experience and they're not in pain."
"They are only confused about where they are," the Pelican admitted, sometimes spoiling the patients' pleasant mood by at least an account of the costs they had taken to treat them.
Transportation by ambulance and hospitalization on an acute bed will cost tens of thousands of crowns.
"Sometimes I applied it as an educational tool when I then directly calculated on those children's rounds how much their drunkenness cost and that they could also spend the whole summer on a part-time job to earn a single party," the Pelican added.
But health insurance companies, he said, do not approach regression proceedings in which the parents would recover the costs of treatment from their parents in cases of child drunks.
Two L-159s are in foreign hands in Spain for the first time
Two L-159s out of a total of five units, for which the Czech Ministry of Defence exchanged the Casa C-295M, flew to Seville, Spain, on Tuesday, where the aircraft manufacturer Casa - EADS is based.
This is the first time that machines of this type have appeared in the possession of someone other than the Czech armies.
So far, they have only been on drills or demonstration flights.
These are two-seat versions of the L-159T1, which were still operated by the Czech army and which were air-competent.
The remaining three machines are a single-seat L-159.
These, meanwhile, are mothballed in Aero Vodochody and the broker of the deal - Omnipol - took over last week.
When the aircraft will physically dispatch from Vodochod is not known so far, according to Jan Pejšek from the Defence Press Department.
"The L-159 for the shift was earmarked from long-term stored aircraft, with no further deposits and investments from the Ministry's ministry."
"The two-seat L-159T1 was exchanged in its current state and form," he told Právo Pejšek.
He added that the army would not be left without two-seat aircraft, as the Ministry signed a CZK 200 million contract with Aero Vodochody in May 2009 to rebuild four unnecessary L-159s for two two-seat machines.
One new aircraft was taken over by the military in July, the other will take over by the end of this year.
According to Pejšek, EADS has pledged to push the aircraft into the armament of some of the alliance countries.
"It is clearly stated in the contract that the customer of the L-159 is EADS and will be used to train pilots from NATO countries."
"It is therefore a matter for the customer to implement this matter," said Pejšek.
Hospodarske noviny reported some time ago that e.g. The Spanish army is not interested in the L-159.
The exchange of five L-159s for one Casa and the purchase of three more aircraft for 3.5 billion crowns was approved by the government of Mirek Topolánek last year.
The Ministry of Defence did not launch a tender for the purchase and approached EADS directly.
The defense leadership at the time argued that the exchange would support future L-159 exports abroad.
The Czech Army has bought 72 machines from Aero and only uses 24, the rest would like to sell.
The purchase of Casa aircraft is likely to have a court case.
The European Commission sued the Czech Ministry of Defence in a European court because it was to select the aircraft on the basis of a pan-European tender and not by addressing one manufacturer.
The army has already taken over three Casa aircraft, the last one should arrive at Prague's Kbely Airport in a fortnight.
Longer index finger than ring finger indicates lower risk of cancer
Men who have a fingerprint longer than a ring finger are at less risk of getting prostate cancer.
This is the surprise conclusion of a study published on Wednesday by the British Cancer Journal.
It may be related to the level of the male hormone testosterone.
"Our results show that the relative length of the finger can serve as a simple test of the risk of prostate cancer, especially for men under 60, especially for men under 60, said co-author Ros Eeles, a professor at the Cancer Institute at the University of Warwick.
The finger could thus help identify which men should undergo a prostate cancer test, particularly in combination with a genetic risk or other endangering factors such as the family health burden, Eeles added.
In the period 1994-2009, she and her colleagues in Britain tracked more than 1,500 prostate cancer patients, along with over 3,000 healthy men.
More than half of the study participants had a finger on their right hand shorter than the ring finger.
They were as likely to have prostate cancer as the 19 percent of those whose fingers were the same length.
However, in the case of those with a finger-point longer than a ring finger, this risk fell by 33 per cent, for a man to the age of 60, the decline was even 87 per cent.
The ratio of the length of the two fingers mentioned - shaped in the prenatal period - appears to reflect the different levels of the sex hormones to which the child is exposed in the womb.
Less testosterone is more than a longer index finger.
Earlier research has shown that it is testosterone that promotes growing prostate cancer.
The leading Czech geneticist and former chairman of the Academy of Sciences, Professor Václav Pačes, told the Czech Press Agency that he was a cursory one-figure knowledge of the study, but he said he did not seem to have the relationship between the length of the finger and cancer "completely proven."
Czech Republic under snow, D1 and D5 are closed
The Czech Republic, like most of Europe, is covered with snow on Thursday morning.
On the roads and sidewalks lie mostly driven snow, with road crews in many places driving all night.
The D5 motorway between the 89th and 93rd kilometres in the direction of Rozvadov is closed in the morning due to several accidents of trucks and cars and also stands the D1 at Brno in the direction of Prague.
News was told by the Central Automobile Disco dispatcher (ÚAMK).
A truck crashed there at mile 1, two trucks collided at the 93km, the accident resulted in injuries.
Several passenger cars also ended up in the ditch.
There are also problems on the D1 motorway at the 185th kilometre in the direction of Prague.
Two trucks collided there.
Drivers should go down just behind Brno at the 190th kilometer or go through Brno and then drive at the 182nd kilometre on the Riddler.
There are several-kilometre columns.
There is also an accident on the D11 motorway, right at the arrival in Prague.
In Prague lies a several-centimeter layer of snow, the thermometers showing minus seven degrees Celsius.
Columns of cars are created on Prosek, for example, and Štěrboholská is also clogged.
The surest means of transport is the metro.
Trams run late, for example, on the line between Charles Square and Náměěstě Mir.
At 8 a.m. the Prague Emergency Staff is scheduled to meet again.
There are also problems with railways and airports.
Czech Railways has already had to cancel seven express trains due to the snow.
For example, the line from Prague to Kralup or from Prague to Beroun has problems.
Passengers should check the current situation.
Ruzyne Airport was closed from 11 a.m. on Wednesday night until 5 a.m.
Most roads in southern Moravia are already passable, but only with increased caution.
Three side roads are impassable in Vyškov, snow is forming in places in Brno and snow chains are needed to climb some roads in higher places.
The most affected places were Vyškovsko.
So far there are closed roads: Rousínov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Kucherov and also Šaratice - Milešovice.
They will be stretched to be fitted with cutters.
When they will be cleared, it is not yet possible to estimate.
In Hodonín, caution is required in the area of the White Carpathians.
On the roads, which are only maintained there for nature conservation, there is up to a five-centimetre layer of snow, according to ČTK.
In the Czech Republic, from two to ten centimetres of snow fell, the most falling in northern Bohemia, often up to 18 centimetres.
The Moravian-Silesian Region received about 15 centimetres of snow.
The snowfall in the Czech Republic is gradually ceasing.
American soldiers have a new "smart weapon"
The U.S. military has deployed a new "smart" weapon in Afghanistan, known so far only under the codename XM-25.
The generals hope that the new automatic rifle will affect the conflict with the Taliban there and "turn the game" to their advantage.
The new weapon is like a little super-precision cannon.
Her projectiles are guided by a laser with an accuracy of several meters.
The 25 mm special cartridges, developed for this rifle and containing a high-explosive explosive, effectively act as small grenades.
The bullets can be programmed by exploding not only when they hit the target, but at any point of their ballistic path.
They can therefore be used against an enemy hiding behind an obstacle, behind a wall or in a trench.
For he is not usually protected from above, and when the deadly rain of steel shrapnel is brought down on him, it can take him out of the fight.
According to Richard Audett, who was involved in the development of the XM-25, the new rifle is the first weapon for the infantry to use "smart" technology.
"The soldier basically treats it by finding the target, sends a laser beam to it to determine the distance, so he gets a specified deliberate point, adjusts the icing and pulls the faucent."
"Let's say you've measured 543 metres."
"When you pull the trigger, the weapon is charged and fired a missile at a range of 543 metres, plus or or minus one, two or three meters," Audette said.
Overwhelming 400 jobs
Fujitsu Group will move its branch from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
400 employees will move their job to Astro Park in July next year from the existing office building to the Marienbader-Nace-Nazi in Bad Homburg.
The Japanese concern Fujitsu will move its branch from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As the industry's specializing in computers and maintenance, the giant told Wednesday, 400 men and women's jobs will be moving their job from the existing office building to the existing administrative building at the Marienbader-Suscuit in Bad Homburg to Astro Park, a large administrative complex in Lyon Street, in a part of Frankfurt called Niederrad.
According to the Fujistu spokesperson, another 100 more 100 jobs of the concern, which are so far divided in the region, should be moved there in the foreseeable future.
The offer of the lease was said to be very attractive and the large-scale offices in the Astro Park are said to be more suited to the working method of employees.
Also in Bad Homburg, Fujitsu was only rented.
Competent agent Bernd Wagner said, "in Frankfurt-Niederrad, we have found a central headquarters with excellent infrastructure."
Excellent connection to the airport is just for a global company like Fujitsu very important.
The recent move of an important business within the region drew joy for the winners and the disappointment of the losers yesterday.
Frankfurt's head economic officer, Markus Frank (CDU), said this had succeeded in acquiring a "global player."
It is said to be a "fantastic show of confidence in this site."
Fujitsu is said to be suited to the city, settling is an important impulse for Niederrad.
The mayor of Bad Homburg, Michael Korwisi (The Gregets), regretted Fujitsu's decision.
The city was said to have been informed in time by the company's management of its intention.
"Of course we offered the company our help," Korwis said.
But the friendly contacts could not change the difficulties of the computer manufacturer with the landlord's landlord at the Marienbader-Nace.
As a result, economic reasons were decisive.
Now it is a question of avoiding a long non-admission in such a prominent place.
"I hope the owner and landlord of the building will be cooperative."
The Rathaus-Scretet House, which has so far used by Fujitsu, and the neighbouring "Kleine Vertikale" were one of the most discussed buildings of the spa town, along with the other buildings on Marienbader-Nace, to the most discussed building projects of the spa town.
It was created between the station and the town hall as a joint project of the city and a private designer of the so-called city entrance, which was criticised both for the massive area of the areas that had previously served as a parking lot and also because of the height of the buildings.
In 2001, investment consultancy and ratings company Feri, the manufacturer of travel distribution systems software, Start Amadeus, moved into the home, as well as the computer manufacturer Fujitsu, which was then associated with Siemens.
The buildings used by Fujitsu were jointly acquired in 2006 by the Frankfurter Deutsche Immobilien-Chancen-Gruppe and Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund, and the Spanish Falcon Real Estate Investments SA were sold in Madrid after a year.
The Fujitsu-Concern from Tokyo is the third largest IT-provider in the world.
It offers computers and servers available to companies, for example, and also takes care of the necessary service.
The branch in the Rhine and Main region is one of the largest in Germany, but Fujitsu's most employees are in Munich.
A subsidiary of Fujitsu Technology Solutions is moving from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt-Niederrad, and other subsidiaries in this location will be Fujitsu Services and a company called TDS.
The Astro Park administration building was leased 7,000 square metres to this end.
In the complex - his name draws attention to the star ground plan, which is twenty years old, which is also based, among others, the central association of the electronics and electronics industry.
Amazon shuts down server - threats against Assange
Wikileaks is getting in the spot.
Amazon's internet service has turned off the unveiling platform on its servers.
It is possible that this was done under political pressure following the release of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic dispatches.
The founder of Wikileaks, Assange, is reportedly staying in the UK.
Wikileaks, the unveiling platform, is coming under increasing pressure in the United States.
Online activists have lost access to their previous home site in America and are now looking for an internet home in Europe.
Meanwhile, prominent U.S. Senator Joe Lieberman called on other countries and businesses to boycott Wikileaks.
And Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, who is listed on the wanted list of Interpol, is to be lingering in the UK, according to a newspaper post.
"Wikileaks is no longer on Amazon."
"Free speech in the country of the Free," the activists told the publication of the Facebook News service Twitter on Wednesday (local time).
Shortly before, the internet company Amazon downloaded Wikileaks' documents from its servers.
Online activists used to publish the secret Amazon Web Service (AWS) diplomatic dispatches to handle the high number of access to documents.
Using Twitter, Wikileaks explained to this move: "Fine - we will now spend our dollars by employing people in Europe."
With Amazon having such problems with freedom of expression, "then they should stop selling books."
Amazon stopped using its servers for Wikileaks after Senator Joe Lieberman's associates were told to conduct a search, CNN reported based on information from Lieberman's office.
The chairman of the Senate Home Defence Committee threatened to boycott Amazon, the British "Guardian" reported.
"I would have liked Amazon to take this step earlier, given the earlier disclosure of classified information at Wikileaks," the senator said.
Meanwhile, Lieberman has called for the platform to be prevented from using the servers in other countries.
"Wikileaks acts illegally, outrageously and recklessly, and thus our national security is put at risk and endangered life on the entire planet," a statement from the nonpartisan senator said.
"No responsible firm - either American or foreign - should be Wikileaks to assist in their efforts to expand the stolen material."
The founder of Wikileaks, Assange, who is wanted by the Swedish authorities on suspicion of rape, is on the list wanted by Interpol.
Based on a report in London's "The Independent," the 39-year-old Australian is staying in the UK, with Scotland Yard said he knows the exact location.
The online activist has always called the investigation in Sweden the intrigue of his opponents.
Wikileaks spokesman Kristinn Hrafnsson said in London that there were also threats.
"There were even appeals to the assassination of Julian Assange."
That's why Assange is right to worry about his safety, Hrafnsson said.
That is why the founder of Wikileaks will continue to hide.
Hrafnsson apparently responded to statements from North America.
In America, the former Republican governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, asked the former Republican governor of Arkansas to be charged and executed for the Wikileaks publication for the betrayal.
In Canada, a senior government adviser, Stephen Harper, said on television - probably ironically, Assange should be "murdered" and Obama could use a "goal aircraft."
Meanwhile, a verbal altercation was unleashed between the White House and Assange.
US President Barack Obama's spokesman, Robert Gibbs, called it "ridiculous and absurd" for Assange's demand for the resignation of Secretary of State for Secretary of State Hillary Clinton if she was responsible for recently released espionage calls to diplomats.
"I'm not quite sure why we're interested in the opinion of one person with the website," Gibbs said.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are far more significant than its website."
The US government is now extensively examining the security of its databanks.
A special commissioner was appointed deputy director of the Center for Anti-Iterorous Measures, Russell Travers, the White House said.
Travers has become responsible for developing the "needed reforms in the structure" required following the publication of the reports from the embassy at Wikileaks.
The White House also wants to review the ways in which the entire government exchanges and protects information.
The US government also announced that it wanted to take care of the safety of dissidents and activists if they were to be put in danger because of the publication on Wikileaks.
"We have made all of this to come into contact with them," said State Department spokesman Philip Crowley.
"We are ready to protect them if necessary."
Ice cream university
At "Gelato University" at Bologna, ice cream paste are prepared for a better season.
There is great interest in the basic course for future ice cream makers, which lasts for three days, and visitors come from all over the world.
Where does the ice cream come from?
Gelatatiere and Gelataio.
Gelatiter, a slightly outdated ice cream maker, makes cream by all the rules of Italian ice cream.
Gelataio takes the ice cream out of the cooling booth with a spatula, wipes it off in the waferch, and sells it.
To find out this, you do not have to go to Anzola dell'Emilia in Bologna Province.
But who wants to learn even more about ice cream, one cannot avoid the "Gelato-University" of the Italian company Carpigiani.
In 2003, he set up an ice cream maker at ice cream at the ice cream company to make the ice cream from his machines matching the world's high Italian ideals everywhere.
There is a huge interest in the base course for the future Gelatieri, which lasts for three days, and visitors come from all over the world.
But there are also several days of special courses on chocolate ice cream and a practice in your own ice cream parlor.
Some yearn for a new career in their Midlife-Crisis, others vent the thin ice of their vague desires.
This time it is 40 participants from 19 countries of all continents - from Brazil to Hungary to Saudi Arabia.
Jacky, an art teacher from California, loves the movement of Slow-Food and would like to offer a quality European product in the future in the country of the industrial Ice-Cream.
Anke from Berlin is a business consultant and would like to start something of her own after years of stressful work.
Two young Egyptian women dream of opening an ice-cream plant in Kair.
One man from Malta and one from Brazil wants to improve the quality of ice cream in their bars - and the Canadian housewife in the home of Julia came because her children love Italian ice cream.
Maestro-Gelatiere Luciano Ferrari first explains the ideal features of the perfect ice cream to the participants.
Not only is the good taste that is crucial, but also the silky softness and good consistency.
Luciano will not forget the Southern and Patriotic icing on the cake during his training: "The Italian Gelato is simply the best - and then there is a good dose of romance."
The first step of production seems to be quite simple.
Luciano puts in the basic ingredients milk, whipped cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilisers in a large blender that heats everything up to 85 degrees with an electronic program and then cools down to four stages immediately.
Then they turn the faucus on the machine and leveled the pasteurised white base cream, the basis of all kinds of milk ice cream.
Immediately, the docent is filled with questions: Is it possible to make ice cream only from natural substances without a stabilizer?
How can one experiment alone?
Luciano warns to get carried away by the spirit of the time into the unknown.
Those who speak of ice cream "only from natural ingredients" apparently used the stabilisers anyway - mostly a natural product, such as guar flour from guar flour from guar beans.
Of course, it is possible to make ice cream without stabilisers, but it has to be sold in one day, otherwise it will collide and the customer will collide with the same ice beans.
Some variations of the basic mass are vacations.
It will be more exciting with aromatic essences.
Maestro Luciano distinguishes the taste of ice cream according to ingredients that are bought at the supermarket in either the fruit department or the sweets department.
In addition, there are pills and creams.
"The dividers will try to impose a lot of aromatized ingredients on you."
"You should simply experiment."
Be with fruit sorbets with sugar and fresh fruit.
Or with white base-grade ice cream, which turns the eggs into yellow cream and cocoa to the base for all sorts of chocolate temptations.
Now the attending a course is allowed to the ice-cream machines.
Luciano will always have them made by four different types of vanilla, chocolate, coffee and hazelnut ice creams - either with or without eggs in the base mass, with more or less vanilla flavourings or other natural ingredients.
The same experiment will be conducted with fruit types of ice cream.
More aromatic substances, more fruit puree - due to taste, it is not always better.
Listo-sarešková ice cream doesn't have to taste more hazelnut when it contains more hazelnuts.
The most popular kiwi ice cream is made by a group that will use more fruit, less water and a little less stabiliser.
Only when the balanced mixture has been properly highlighted by Gelato's taste, says Luciano.
Making ice cream is a purely numerical task: If peach puree with a lot of sugar is used, the share of sugar in the basic recipe must be reduced.
Lemon ice cream requires an extra portion of sugar.
Luciano takes out the device to determine the sugar content of the fruit (threaths the cider is measuring the must of the grapes).
Fortunately, the tables relieve the numbers.
Making ice cream no longer requires as much physical exertion as it used to.
It is not only aided by a device for the automatic production of basic mass.
There is also a device that simultaneously mixes the finished ice cream mixture into the cream and cools to the minus temperature.
Despite all the automation, we can't avoid small accidents.
Brazilian Gustavo soils himself and also his colleagues from top to bottom with a fruit puree when a huge blender gets out of control.
"In every course," believes Maestro Luciano, "it's only a matter of time before something like this happens."
Reviewers in double light
The European Food Authority, Efsa, is intertwined with an industry that experiments with genetic plants.
This accusation has now been voiced by a group of experts Testbiotech, which is considered an independent institute for estimating the consequences of biotechnology.
"It's like a conspiracy theory, but we've documented it well," Testbiotech's chief executive Christoph Then said in Munich on Wednesday.
The head of the Efsa expert group for the gentichetically altered plants, Harry Kuiper, and another expert, Efsa, have had a contract with the Isi lobster union for several years.
It is funded by concerns such as Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer.
Kuiper was a decisive contributor to the Ephso control regulations for genetic plants, and is thus in clear conflicts of interest, the Then criticizes.
The Efsa regulations are said to be in complete agreement with the documents of the Isiso, and thus bear the manuscript of the industry, which should be controlled by the office in Parma, Italy.
This is the second time that Testbiotech has highlighted a conflict of interest.
Recently, the senior executive from Efsa went from Efsa without additions or transitional times to the Swiss agrio concern Syngenta - and thus changed the parties.
Also, the Central Germany (MDR) radio has recently revealed the EU-control personnel link to the industry lobby, attracting interest from both the Ministry of the Environment and EU Members.
In the meantime, Efsa cannot discern a conflict of interest.
It works with all the serious data, i.e. those from the industry, if they are of high-quality quality, is mentioned in one statement.
Experts who work for the Ephesus are not required to have contacts with the industry.
But they must be substantiated.
Kuiper is committing his work for the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the US.
It is itself referred to as a neutral forum of experts in science, industry and politics - among other things, to estimate the risk of biotechnology without a contract by a lobbyist.
Independent experts such as the Then-Sofiling criticise the fact that the currently permitted gentechnically altered plants in animals are allowed without any attempt at feeding, and that the response of genetic plants to the environmental influences is not tested.
"We want to know what the gentichnically al-curled corn in the field will do, for example," says the Then.
Current practice is to only test isolated proteins and not the entire genetic plant, which will not be supported by reliable results.
"If they're not looking for risks, how would it be possible to find them then?", the Then asks the lawsuit.
Angelika Hilbeck agrees with this.
The science expert has been studying gentenika since 1994 and is currently working at the Technical University of Zurich.
In this area, industry, as in the US, is now increasingly influencing or discrediting critical scientists in Europe.
That is why there are almost no longer scientists who are not connected to the concerns.
Most of the time, no studies are published, which are critical of the company.
"The industry is reviewing security research," Hilbeck believes.
Footprints of stones
Uli Gsell also acquired some, a total of about 400 kilograms.
On Monday night, he was standing in front of the station in Stuttgart, a tube on his back.
There was a demonstration.
It was snowing.
The story is known: In September, the backhots arrived and began to tear down a large piece of the north wing.
The world in Stuttgart was no longer the same: Thousands demonstrated against the S21, a billion-dollar reduction in the railway station.
When the construction was stopped, most of the wings were in ruins.
Broken to 6,000, 7,000.
The limestone of Crailsheim, a soft coarse stone that was used in 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a sculptor in Ostfildern, 43.
He secured several of these pieces.
"These stones are relics."
"He mustn't disappear."
He dissolves: "Fal and poor stone, simple and original."
When one cut it open, he smelled of cigarette smoke.
What he'll do with the pieces, he doesn't know yet.
Stones have time.
Uli Gsell, too.
A trail of Stuttgart stones leads to the forest at Tübingen to the former deponium of the French army ammunition, where Manuel Rongen built his stone empire.
A 44-year-old man deals with old stones.
He bought all those created during the demolition in Stuttgart.
"It would be a shame if they were to grind to the gravel or disappeared to the deponium," he says in his office, a wooden booth that was previously a guardhouse.
He tells us that he was being scolded and threatened when it said in September in the newspapers that he had bought the remains of the northern wing from the company that was demolished.
But he spoke to opponents of the S-21 for days.
And he explained to them that it was not the demolition at all.
And when it's happening, it's the most sensible thing to do when the stones continue to be used.
Then, about 200 S-21-openers took in each of the roughly 80 kilograms heavy block, the price for a piece of 6.50 to 14 euros.
As a memory, some also in the hope of returning it in rebuilding.
Rongen bought 500 tons, a cargo of 25 large trucks.
About half are still in the woods, the rest sold long ago.
Gardeners, landscape gardeners, home builders.
They came from all corners and pulled away what could be do to the trunk and the trailer.
The Stuttgart litigation stems had long since been turned into "Sandles" or as the edges of herb beds.
"This stone is actually nothing special," Rongen says.
"If it weren't for the political interlude."
He rises to his SUV and goes for a ride on his 20-hectare kingdom.
He studied law first, interrupted his studies, later biology, then took an interest in computers, and eventually became a stone trader.
And a lover of stones.
It has stored 400,000 tons of stones.
He's making his treasures from all over Germany.
He says he's the biggest old-tone trader in the Republic.
Brake.
In the snow lies the artistically worked sandstone.
"Once belonged to Marien-bloum in Dresden," she tells us.
The sandstone from the Elbe, yellow, warm, is thrilled.
"My favorite stone."
We're going on down the road up through the woods.
It points to a pile: a red sandstone, formerly part of the railway station in Karlsruhe.
And beyond.
"Nice travertine."
Once the blocks belonged to the Neckarstadion grandstand in Stuttgart.
Everywhere in the snow lies the stones and stories, the Cannstatt-travertin from the police presidium in Stuttgart, the red granite from the Sankt Blasien temple, the tuf from the hospital in Heilbronn.
What work, what an effort, what a sweat.
When Rongen thinks of how the stones were first broken up by hand and transported by means of simple hoist and bull wagons, he becomes entirely respectful.
"It would be a scandal if something like this was being crushed."
He didn't become rich, he didn't become very rich at all.
But the stone businessman now employs 14 people, and in addition, the upstairs in the forest seated the stonemasons, one sculptor, one blacksmith, one glassmaker and one gardener.
"We work hard, but it's satisfying," says the one who evaluates the remnants.
He must go to Cologne for the foreseeable future.
There, too, will be rescued with stones.
The Battle of the Talents for the High-Potencials
There's a lot of people at the snack.
16 students are crowded with sandwiches with salmon, tomato soups and sweets.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and the carmaker Volkswagen invited the students of engineering and design to a workshop.
Together with the developers of VW, they are here to talk about the car of the future - and to get to know Volkswagen, by the way.
Many companies are trying to succeed in the plant for the smartest heads, as well as VW, and are betting on cooperation with universities.
Their mission is: Recruit the most gifted graduates in the auditoriums as soon as possible, before they reach the job market and others are interested in them.
Since universities do not issue any lists of success of their students, companies are trying to discover and win extract exceptional talents in and get from practice-oriented projects.
At TU Braunschweig, the car concern is trying to acquire the talent for the second day.
One young lady from the personal department handles out pens, gummy bears and VW logs boards.
He tells promising young talents about programs on practice, student jobs and hints at them for travel to the group.
Nico Selle of TU Braunschweig takes care of the project with VW.
They see the benefits for both parties: "Students come into contact with the industry and gain experience."
"The VW can get to know the students at the same time, get to know the interesting candidates, and think about who would be useful as an associate."
Such coöps, according to Selle, are not uncommon.
But the news is that there is such an open struggle for students.
"Otherwise, there was more of a substantial expert project," says Selle.
The fight for fresh graduates will probably be even tougher.
In many industries, companies can no longer choose their employees from long crowds of applicants.
Instead, it must try and try to lure a particularly highly skilled workforce.
In particular, graduates in engineering are in an excellent negotiating position.
According to data from the Union of German Engineers of the VDI, 40,000 civil engineering positions remained vacant in October.
And according to VDI forecasts, the so-called shortage of engineers will grow.
For the auditing and consulting firm KPMG, Roman Dykta goes to talent theaters.
Organizes challenging Recruiting-events, such as. KPMG-Race, a kind of modern treasure troop race, in which participants must find their way according to the GPS coordinates.
The company plans to send eight promising students to the US this way next year.
Participants can also view KPMG's branches and get acquainted with the company.
It will be decided in advance in two selection rounds to see who will participate.
Only the Crème de la Crème of many interested parties will fly to the US.
In the battle for High Potentials at universities, the laws will apply to the Dykta.
"We want to set ourselves apart with our Race from the others."
"A simple trip on a sailboat was too little for us."
It seems Dykta's talent scorer is lucky.
"We've been in contact with all participants in a similar event last year."
"Some will soon be finishing their studies and are planning to apply for a job," he says.
In addition to direct appealing on campus, small and medium-sized companies are presented in classics in the labour markets.
"We try to contact graduates at professional exhibitions."
"As e.g. at Intersolar," says Sitha Stübe, head of personnel at the solar equipment manufacturer Solarworld.
The company from Bonn employs around 1,500 employees in Germany.
Stübe knows the issue with young workers.
Currently, there are 35 positions listed on the company's website.
"At the moment, it's just the trouble to fill vacancies."
"It costs a lot of time and money," he says.
Another option is contact through professors at universities.
Solarworld works with various universities, such as the University of Freiberg.
"Professors inform us that it is possible to do a practice or write a thesis."
A solar specialist does not hold any expensive advertising events.
Instead, the company tries to attract other benefits: a personal atmosphere, a low hierarchy, and light communication.
"The big concerns often can't offer it," says Stübe, head of the personal department.
In search of work, money has not played a major role for a long time.
Flexible working hours, caring for children or good practice options are other decisive factors.
Solarworld has taken the top 100 employers in one study at the Great Place to Work 55.
The institute is compiling an annual list of the best German employers.
In addition, it is asked by co-workers how satisfied they are with their work and the working environment and monitors the framework conditions of the staff.
Head of the personal body, Stübe, hopes that the placement will bring her points with job seekers.
"I believe that those interested are particularly briefed on the external assessments of the potential employer," he says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler of the German Employer Branding Academy advises companies that want to build a good reputation as an employer with a long-term strategy.
He advises his customers to be more authentic.
And, according to Mr Kriegler, that means above all internal measures.
"The best way to make yourself visible as an attractive employer is through its own employees," he says.
It is technically called the indoor Employer Branding, that is, the promotion of the employer in the market within its own employees.
"Satisfied staff are the best ambassadors."
If a company takes good care of its people and they identify with the company, then they advertise on their own to their employer between friends and acquaintances.
"This is like a game with a string," says Kriegler.
Obama halts new oil drilling
Over the following years, new oil drilling will not be created in front of the US-wide Florida coast in the Gulf of Mexico.
The government in Washington has issued a corresponding ban - and thus, definitively, canceled earlier plans.
Also in front of the Atlantic coast, new wells are forbidden.
Interior Minister Ken Salazar said on Wednesday.
The reason for the strict ban, which should apply for at least the next five years, is an explosion at the "Deepwater Horizon" drill tower in April.
Before this disaster, which cost eleven employees to live and led to the largest environmental disaster in the US, President Barack Obama signalled his willingness to pressure the opposition and industry to allow new drilling in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico.
In doing so, advocates are trying to reduce the US's dependence on foreign oil supplies.
To date, it is not clearly explained who is responsible for the devastating oil disaster in the bay.
The focus of the criticism is the British energetic concern BP, which is confronted with billion-dollar requests.
The Commission of Inquiry, commissioned by Obama, should present the results during December.
In October, Interior Minister Ken Salazar lifted the ban on drilling that had been in place since the explosion.
Subsequently, various oil concerns submitted applications for new drilling projects.
Obama and Salazar want to prevent a similar catastrophe from stricter controls and strict security regulations.
Currently, a bill is being reformed, drawing attention to many corrupt allegations.
At the same time, Obama announced that he would lift the lucrative possibilities for tax evasion for oil and gas concerns.
Industry is now openly warning that stricter regulation will fundamentally shrink the volume of oil drilled in the Gulf.
"Government plans are the biggest brake on the growth of the gas and oil industry," reads the result of the current survey in the industry by the consultancy firm BDO - before the ban on drilling on Wednesday.
The American Energy Alliance, on top of that, complains of uncertainty in the field: "No one knows exactly what regulation will change."
Investments in new mining projects are moving until further notice - at the expense of growth.
The Ogoni region burned down
The water in the rivers is oil-brown, it smells like a pump: billions of gallons of leaked oil have destroyed nature in the Ogoni region of Nigeria.
People steal, corruption and illegal oil cooking for a living.
Celestine Akpobari means well.
"Don't worry," an environmental activist reassures the journalists: "Today, you'll get a lot of oil mud in front of the lens."
The 37-year-old Nigerian watched an attempt to photograph a boy who waded up to his chest with the smudges surrounding the smudges: the scene was almost nice in the aquatic gloss with its rainbow colors.
The fact that brown oil clots float beneath the surface is not visible.
Previously, she collected enough garnles in the containers, told by Esther Badom on the banks of the Bodo-Jetty River.
Meanwhile, the slow-moving water became completely dead.
Five years ago, a large amount of oil spilled into a huge warm area from a broken line.
Fishermen from the nearby town of Bodo must paddle for at least six hours to reach the waters where the fish are: the Ogoni area, located in the heart of the Niger delta delta, is one of the world's worst-imported areas.
On the way down the river, the mangroves' swamp with a lot of side tributaries is only noticeable to the full range of the trigger.
The boat engine boils brown porridge instead of light water, and whoever immers his hand in the water pulls out the oil fingers.
The roots of mangrovesliwers towers from the ground like black sticks of the licorice, the rarely occurring palm trees leave their leaves sadly hanging.
In vain we search for flocks of birds that are commonly found in damp areas: Once the engine subsides on a boat, it dissect in an earlier paradise where it smells like a pump to befelt.
"What's happening here is the environmental warfare," says Celestine Akpobari sadly: "We live in constant fear of health."
Comparison with the war is justified.
The Ogoni Settlement Area is a battlefield where the fighting has been fought for several decades: more than 60 years ago, the first conquerors from Europe were flocked here, where the first reelection was formed in the 1980s with the later executed writer Ken Saro-Wiwa, here the Shell Group had to stop its production in 1993, because it was too dangerous for the staff.
To this day, the company is not allowed to return to the Ogoni area: while the entire delta is mined daily from the delta's triple-sized area, with more than 5,000 mining drilling and 7,000 kilometres of running more than two million barrels of black gold, the oil fields in the Ogoni area lie fallow, the situation is too unstable for the group.
Every few hundred meters, the steel structure is towered from the water of the steel structure as bizarre sculptures: "Christmas trees," so they are too tenderly called the head of the drilling holes.
They're 50 years old, most of them rusted to the core.
Every so often, the head of the drilling hole breaks, Akpobari tells, and then a constant stream of oil flows into the water.
Experts estimate that more than two billion litres in the Delta ecule leaked more than two billion litres in 50 years: Every year, the amount of oil that leaked into the sea off the Alaskansk in the "Exxon Valdez" super-tanker crash 21 years ago - one of the largest environmental disasters in the history of mankind.
There are controversy over who is responsible for the continuing environmental misery.
While Shell calls the sabotage and organised oil theft at more than 90 percent of pollution, environmental conservationists talk about the crackling heads of wells and leaking lines as the main cause.
Shell requires far less safety regulations in Nigeria than is customary in the world, the Concert accused in 2008 of the US-American scientist Richard Steiner: Only the number of disorders in the leadership is said to be "twice higher than elsewhere."
In a place that looks from a distance like deserted, oil-sinched open-air workshop, a figure emerges from the mangroves: they are completely naked and up to their necks from the oil.
Beneath one of the many barrels, which is partly connected by the lead, partly arbitrarily scattered on the ground, there is a fire: an illegal small refinery.
Oil heats up in a barrel over the fire for several hours, explains Michael, the group leader.
First, gas will flow from the lead to the catching pot, later dripping at the end of the kerosene management and finally the diesel.
In this way, Michael and his four co-workers make up to four barrels a day for 300 litres: "We make about 34,000 Naira" - about $22.
The delta dwellers are taking advantage of chronic fuel shortages in the largest oil nation in the largest oil nation in Black Africa.
Nigeria owns only one refinery.
A hilariously low price of 40 cents per litre of diesel can still be beaten by illegal producers: because they have the raw material for free.
It comes from the "bunker" who are joining the leadership everywhere in the Ogoni region: according to experts, at least 16 million litres of oil are lost daily in the entire Niger Delta area.
But only a negligibly small portion of the makeshift raw material is being illegally refined: the largest share will be filled by organized criminal networks, which include politicians and high-ranking military officials, tankers, and to sell it on the world market.
The debate on whether the people were caused by the disaster and their interventions or lax method of production is considered purely academic by the activist.
"If the oil companies didn't consider themselves intruders, and if they hadn't completely destroyed the life nature of the fishermen, then there would be no sabotage, nor theft and illegal refinery."
In the meantime, however, the Ogoni's relationship, above all, to Shell, is so damaged that only the departure of the concern can be considered: "Maybe other nations will turn out to be better for the Chinese."
Michael will be disturbed.
"Time to get out," says the muscular manufacturer.
"Some soldiers can come in any minute."
If a special military unit found them, they wouldn't be in danger of jail, but a painful bribe.
The soldiers, who mostly come from the north of the country - like all Nigerians - want to profit from the raw material.
"The cursed thing has brought our country to the bottom in every way," says Akpobari.
Investigators discovered a dangerous construction flaw in the A380 engines
The A380 clearly has a major safety malfunction.
Investigators found a possible construction error during a search of the machine that made an emergency landing that could lead to a "catastrophic engine failure."
The airline Qantas wants to sue the engine manufacturer.
The passengers of the Qantas Airbus seemed to have had more luck at the emergency landing in early November than was previously known: the Australian Air Safety Board found a major safety fault with the engines of some of the A380s in its investigations - and is now warning of a possible building error.
Perhaps the defect would have severe consequences: one oil connection could have cracks due to wear and tear, a statement released by the ATSB was said this Thursday.
This could lead to a "disaster engine failure."
These are engines made by Rolls-Royce in 20 A380 Series aircraft.
Among them is the Qantas Airbus, which had to make an emergency landing in Singapore on 4 November.
The Australian airline has now taken legal action against the British turbine manufacturer.
It filed a statement of reasons for the action before the Australian Federal Court of Sydney, which is allowed by another legal measure against that company.
The head of Qantas, Alan Joyce, said his company would seek compensation for the incident at the beginning of November.
Parts were released during the engine fire and they damaged the load-bearing surfaces.
Rolls-Royce identified the burning oil as the cause of the damage.
After this event, up to 40 engines have to be replaced worldwide.
Australian investigators have announced that they will conduct further safety tests with the giant aircraft, which are equipped with the engines in question.
The safety recommendation is the result of cooperation with Rolls-Royce, said ATSB spokesman Martin Dolan.
The safety deficiency was considered important enough to inform all those concerned.
After the emergency landing of the Qantas, the airline left its A380 fleet on the ground for several weeks.
Singapore Airlines has kept three of its eleven A380s on the ground on a temporary basis.
Lufthansa replaced the engine as a safety precaution for one A30.
The two-storey aircraft is the largest passenger aircraft in the world.
National snowfall will create chaos in transport
Germany in all in white: it snowed almost all overnight in the country.
There is chaos on many roads, with trains and airplanes being jammed.
At least three people have died in traffic accidents.
Winter frosts Germany: almost the entire republic fell into the snow during the night of Thursday at freezing temperatures - leading to the chaos of the traffic in many places.
To the north and east, up to 15 centimetres of snow lies in some places.
On several motorways and many roads, traffic is heavily restricted.
At the A7 at Flensburg, the road service was still in deployment, but it could not cope with the newly blowing snow.
There was also a strong gusty wind over the Baltic Sea.
The Federal Office for Cruise and Hydrography (BSH) expects a storm surge on the Baltic Sea coast in Schleswig-Holstein this morning with a water level of 1.2 metres above normal.
Snowdrive drifts have caused significant problems in Saxony on motorways and state roads.
According to the Meteomedia bad weather headquarters, the level of alarm was therefore in Saxon Switzerland on the purple - the highest level ever.
In part, 30 centimetres of new snow fell, with heavy and fresh winds causing drifts.
There were several trucks and passenger cars left at night.
Also in Saxony-Anhalt, police authorities reported major difficulties on the roads.
The A2 was caused by wind and slow operation and traffic.
There was trouble in Thuringia because of the snow on the A4 and A9.
According to the German Railways, there are major problems in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia and northern Bavaria.
The main problems are snow on the tracks, overturned trees on the tracks or broken upper lines and switches.
In Saxony, long-distance traffic from Leipzig to Nuremberg had to be stopped.
In Jerusalem's Saalfeld, he had to stop an ICE in Munich.
165 passengers were given woollen blankets, food and drink by the train by fire and rescue workers.
Snowy winds blew over the roads.
At major German airports, many flights were cancelled due to snow winds.
According to a spokeswoman for the flight information headquarters, an overlapped flights have already been reported from Munich.
In Frankfurt am Main, 40 flights have been cancelled, according to a Fraport spokesperson.
Road maintenance is in constant deployment.
Although there are few passengers left at the airport without a connection, 400 field beds are prepared for them.
On many roads, accidents occurred as early as Wednesday evening.
In the evening, one lorry driver died in a collision with a train at a railway crossing in eastern Holštýnsk.
The driver was slightly injured.
The snow-covered road caused a similar accident close to Nuremberg: a lorry was also caught on at a railway crossing as the vehicle was stuck.
The driver died.
Four passengers were injured on the train - the route from Bayreuth to Nuremberg remained closed until the early hours.
In addition, a 30-year-old woman died after she rolled over on a slippery road at Aschaffenburg with her car.
But meteorologists do have good news: the snow will remain in the form of light powder, and will therefore be lifted up even with light glats of the wind.
But the wind will weaken.
Only by the Baltic Sea there will be fast winds with a gale force.
But it will be very cold - locally to minus 15 degrees.
Deutsche Bank looking for buyers for twins-twins
Deutsche Bank wants to say goodbye to its sign: according to a newspaper post, the bank is looking for a buyer for two towers with offices at Frankfurt headquarters.
The property could raise up to 500 million euros.
Deutsche Bank has just renovated its headquarters: Twins' towers in Frankfurt's banking district have been upgraded; in the meantime, the bankers were allowed to see their old jobs again.
But now the financial concern seems to want the cost of the renovation back - and is looking for a buyer for the two skyscrapers, as the "Financial Times Deutschland" reports, citing the spokesman.
The spokesman did not name the reasons for the planned sale.
"We are still investigating whether it is more meaningful to own or sell the property and then lease it again," he said.
This is again the largest credit institute in Germany to give up its corporate headquarters after a short time.
The bank only took over the Twin Towers in mid-Petil in mid-2007, for 272 million euros, from investors of their own fund and subsequently renovated them expensively.
The energy reconstruction has swallowed around 200 million euros, according to the data.
Selling would probably bring a lot of money to the bank.
According to the newspaper text, industry experts estimate the value of the renamed to "Greentowers" to be "Greentowers" at a price of around 500 million euros.
The spokesman said it was not decided whether the building would be sold back to the fund's property or to an independent investor.
Thousands grieve for the dead miners
More than 10,000 people honored the sourdough miners in New Zealand who were declared dead after several explosions at the mine.
It has still not been possible to rescue the dead, as the security situation remains complicated in the shaft.
Almost two weeks ago, there was a powerful explosion at Pike River Mine, near the city of Greymouth.
The 29 miners, aged between 17 and 62, were overwhelmed in the mine.
There was a probe launched into the shaft where the disaster occurred, but found no trace of life.
Due to high concentrations of poisonous gases and subsequent explosions, the rescue forces were unable to descend for safety.
After the second strong detonation, the authorities and experts drew on the fact that the miners no longer had any chance of survival.
It still hasn't been able to be freed for the dead.
Now they have honoured the memory of the dead by relatives and friends.
In Greymouth, on the southern island of New Zealand, ten thousand people gathered in sunny weather.
They were quiet for two minutes.
To commemorate the buried miners, 29 tables were built, helmets, flashlights and the names of the miners.
Also pictures and personal belongings, such as clothing and surfboards, found their place here.
On the state government buildings, flags flew at half-mast.
New Zealand had hoped that the miners would once again come to the surface from the "deep of the country," New Zealand Prime Minister John Key told attendees attendees.
"But they never came home."
He cannot say goodbye to his son until he saw his corpse, said Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was swamped in the mine.
In addition to the prime minister's chairman and relatives of the victims, the commemorative ceremony was attended by several foreign diplomats.
During the explosion on 19 November, British and South African miners were also overwhelmed.
Rescuers started by putting out a fire inside a coal mine on the southern island of New Zealand.
As the poisonous gases dissolve, the high temperatures are cooled inside the mine, police president Gary Knowles told journalists.
To hell, warriors!
Is a horror movie going to an art theater?
Director Nicolas Winding Refn is attempting to re-run the old boundaries with his "Walhalla Rising" battle epic.
What audience was thought of by the Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn when he shot "Walhalla Rising"?
A captured one-fed-check Viking fighter (Mads Mikkelsen) breaks free from his tormentors and kills in a big way with almost the supernatural power of his opponent - it sounds ideal for young men's viewers looking for bloody action, because our hero helps himself with cruel killing methods and even tearing his enemies' guts out of the belly alive when he is in a bad mood.
On the other hand, the One-Eye, as he is actually called, doesn't say a word during the whole film, and even the other characters utter a fewences or sentences or get swayed to the harrowing dying screams.
Otherwise, they are silent and pour in the gruesome, hilly landscape of Scotland, which offers the backdrop to the Vikings world about a thousand years ago.
The film is more ideal for adult cinema enthusiasts with an interest in existencialism and very quiet camera footage.
It's good when a film has multiple target groups, it's just a shame when they're mutually exclusive.
Director Winding Refn, after making his wild and stylized trilogy about drug dealers, "Pusher" is considered a Danish version by director Quentin Tarantino, but stoically resists to bring his works closer to the mainstream's humor or less brutal to an artistic audience.
Most fans of the art cinema appear to be discouraged everywhere by spraying brains and guts.
The promoter of the action films will not be bored at the latest when the One-Eye goes for loosely explainable reasons with a group of violent Christian missionaries of the ship to Jerusalem and will remain hung in the airless and fogless for an eternity before the team appears to arrive in America and remain silent there.
It is no wonder, then, that in Germany the "Walhalla Rising" did not make it to theaters and was now released only on DVD.
It's a pity mainly for the beautiful shots, but also because behind the distinctive facade, in places to cunch the blood, hides an exciting cinema that deserved a bit of attention.
This film is not about dialogue or the exact plot, everything is an atmosphere, a feverish dream that has become a film.
And that's not for the spectator to escape.
Refn will give him no moment of release and slowly choke him with its chilling footage and gloomy hypnotic soundtrack, but above all, indescribable hatred that is said to come from the hearts of the characters.
Only a little blond boy who helps the One-Eye keeps something of innocence, everyone else is driven by malice.
Of all the most one-eyed hero, whose motifs are never explained, who will become, in time for enemies and transient allies, a warrior from hell, perhaps an ambassador of the devil.
It portrays destruction, but perhaps also only for the corrupt.
"Walhalla Rising" is a mysterious film that can be hated and admired, for angry, excitement and admiration.
Experience.
Mysterious earthworks
The IAEA's Nuclear Energy Authority has new alerts to the secret nuclear program in Syria.
But the country resists expression - and will not allow control.
Around midnight on September 5 to 6, 2007, at least four Israeli F-15 warplanes and a mysterious square building in Syria will be attacked.
It is on the shore of the Euphrat; the nearest larger city is 30 kilometres away and is called Dair As-Saur.
In the documents of the International Office for Nuclear Energy (IAEA), its name appears when it is a reactor allegedly built by Syria with the help of North Korea in this square hidden in a valley that turns away from the current.
Following a communication from the US-American foreign secret service to the CIA in late April 2008, the reactor, also known as the nearby village of el-Kibar, would be well suited to the production of plutonium - from which it is possible to build nuclear weapons.
The fifties technique doesn't fit in for anything else.
The CIA presented a video of unfocused satellite images.
Using computer animation, it explained where which reactor components might have been before the destruction were, it was to be a scaled-down copy of the North Korean model of Yongbyon nuclear center.
In addition, there were photographs presented that showed the building up close or even from the inside.
The reactor was said to be shortly before launch, but still without fuel cells.
Today, more than three years after the bombing, little is known for it than it was then, even the riddles have increased over time.
Earlier US President George W. Bush recently disclosed in his memoir that the CIA was very sure before the attack that Syria was building a reactor in an el-Kibar, but it basically had no basis that there was an "active nuclear weapons program" in the country.
Some intelligence retichete in Europe are even more cautious and talk only of a "allegal reactor," even if they see the CIA's presentation as "current."
They lack clear evidence, as does the IAEA.
When asked how he was sure he had a reactor in front of him, a senior UN diplomat replied in the summer, the IAEA said to be "a lot of material to ask questions."
The metal of the supposedly "unused military building" was quickly cleared away by the Syrians and also properly aligned the terrain.
Nevertheless, the IAEA team was found in June 2008 under the leadership of former chief inspector Olli Heinonen in the el-Kibar of a hint of uranium, which was made by humans.
In addition, the IAEA received satellite photographs of commercial vendors via a member state from just after the attack, which should be more apt than those presented by the CIA.
Unfortunately, these footage is not on the market because they were exclusively bought by an unknown customer - perhaps Israel.
The IAEA cannot therefore confirm their authenticity.
Syria has always maintained that it has never had a secret nuclear program or even built a reactor.
Uranus comes from Israeli weapons, Damascus has commented.
But this was refuted by the IAEA after the particle analysis.
Since then, Damascus has refused to discuss the matter - as has satellite footage.
In addition, he banned the auditors from a second inspection in the el-Kibar and access to the debris of the bombed-out building.
But Israel is also doggedly silent.
"We will never comment," the ruling Prime Minister Ehud Olmert recently confirmed the official position at that time.
The investigation into this case has thus dragged on to no avail since June 2008 and "gets a serious problem due to the credibility of the office," as a senior Western diplomat at the IAEA's headquarters in Vienna has admitted - a serious breach of the nuclear weapons ban treaty oversees by the IAEA.
The IAEA sees the next three devices to be the key to progress on the matter, to be "in a functional connection" with the alleged reactor - and, unlike it, still exist.
The auditors have not yet stated, nor which equipment, nor what their function is or why they are suspected.
According to information from the newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung, the IAEA internally refers to them as Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayaah, according to nearby cities.
The Independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (Isis) identified these objects and found a building complex that is believed to be one of the suspicious objects in satellite imagery.
It appears to be inside or in the immediate vicinity of a military base - for exactly that reason, Syria rejects the IAEA's access to these three locations.
In Vienna, it was said that the Syrians were afraid of a so-called fishing expedition - that the IAEA would be sent to the US to track down military bases.
Nuclear detectives were alerted to the facility by the US Secret Service.
The IAEA has the paperwork, as well as satellite images, that material transported back and forth between the three seats and the square at Euphrat.
In Vienna, a senior Western diplomat said that at least one furnished should be "in connection with fuel production."
But there are no "no evidence of sensitical activities," i.e. enrichment of uranium and new processing; the processes that are necessary for the production of nuclear weapons.
The reactor type is powered by uranium, which is not enriched.
But where the uranium came from, and where it would later be to be cut off from the plutonium to the bomb, there are only likely estimates for these central questions.
It is also unknown whether the debris that could hide important clues are kept in these three places.
As if hundreds of cargo trucks cost had disappeared from the face of the Earth, no one seemed to have information as to where the debris had come.
Only a few miles from el-Kibar, far away and on the other side of the Euphrat, the al-Tibni salt mine, which had been inspected by Syria in 1998 as a suitable warehouse for radioactive waste, is considered unlikely by the IAEA.
Earlier IAEA inspector Robert Kelley put it in a backgroundline in a satellite image analysis for the renowned Jane's Intelligence Review.
But images from space show that after the IAEA demanded access, Syria carried out groundworks at all the suspect sites and removed large containers.
It could have been a coincidence, but it didn't help clear up the suspicions.
In addition, diplomatic circles speak of the fact that the IAEA has spent many months creating a plan for auditors that would allow Syria to preserve any military secrets - only the effort shows how much the interest of auditors is.
Meanwhile, Damascus rejected the proposal.
If, just a year ago, Western diplomats were reassuring in Vienna that the reactor was being destroyed after all, and therefore the matter was not burning, for months, the US ambassador, Glyn Davies, was talking about so-called special inspections, one of the harshest funds that the Vienna Nuclear Authority has to enforce controls.
The head of the IAEA, Yukiya Amano, who would have to propose inspections, has already spoken of the "option to be inclined to do in the future," but has so far hesitated.
This choice places a big risk: On the one hand, a majority in the IAEA Governing Board is needed, and many of the 35 countries represented are certainly not interested in escalating.
On the other hand, as one diplomat points out: "What happens if they don't find anything in the end?"
Love in the Time of War
Since Angelina Jolie started working on the still-name directorial initial in the summer, there has been trouble.
She wrote the script herself, a love story about a woman from Bosnia and a man from Serbia.
Much more is not yet known - but this, too, causes restlessness.
There has been a persistent conversation about the woman, who is a Muslim, falling in love with the Serbian man who raped her during the war in Yugoslavia.
The Bosnian women's associations protested immediately, so the planned filming from Sarajevo to Hungary in a hastily moved.
The film, meanwhile, has been finished in Hungary and is in post-production, but there is still a protest in Bosensk.
Bakira Hasecic of the Organization of Women's War victims wrote Jolie via UN-organization to help refugees, calling for a meeting with the actress, the Bosnian newspaper reported now - Jolie is also the UN-Freig Organization Ambassador to Aid for Refugees.
It is not exactly diplomatic - she offered to meet the women in Hungary weeks ago, but they refused to do so.
The meeting must take place in Bosnia, Hasecic said.
There were no love stories in the campus where the rape was raped, and Jolie's attitude toward the victims reveals a lot about the script.
So her organization recommended the UN-organization to help refugees release Jolie as ambassador, reports the Guardian.
What scenes did Jolie write exactly?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which received its script to be read, allowed filming after minor tussles in Sarajevo - it is not entirely clear why Jolie did not come anyway.
The young author stresses that in her film she does not follow any political intentions, that she has done a great effort to the conflict in Yugoslavia, that she wants to show the terrible consequences of the war and give all the parties involved the space.
Due to the content, it remains vague.
There is another version of the film circulating on the internet, which sounds rather different: the lovers knew each other before the war began and meet again when she, like a Bosnian Muslim woman, is brought to the Serbian campsite, where he serves as a guard.
Which does sound a lot different than "a victim of rape falls in love with his tormentor."
The fact that Jolie's film really starts before the war - is true.
Jolie argues that there is pressure on her, which is "not fair and based on faulty information."
Now they can be rescued by the hecklers of Hollywood: By posting her script illegally online, as they've done many times before.
Nothing but gone
This evening is good for the Irish again.
No sign of grief.
The home team dominates power significantly over its guests from Sweden, Finland and the USA.
Fans roar with joy to the sound of loud music, stamp their feet.
Bailey-Pub booes in Corc, South Ireland, because players throw tennis balls at a distance of three metres into beer cups - and hit.
"Beer Pong" is called the bizarre theater and can be won 500 euros as a winning bonus, plus tickets to Las Vegas at the World Beer Pong Championships in January.
Cian Tanner is a calm type; this shouted beer game and a restrained computer scientist doesn't really match.
Still, the 26-year-old man tries to entertain himself, to unwind from the plight of what the future will bring.
His plan is not a playing passion in Las Vegas, he goes to the interview in New Zealand in January.
"I get this weird feeling," he says.
"It's so far away and I don't have a job there yet."
Still: His girlfriend is already waiting for him in Auckland - "Immediately she got her dream job as an Eventmanager, maybe a good sign," says the young man, smiling.
Due to poor prospects at home, two of the Tanner siblings have attempted their luck abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sydney, his brother Colin now has a place as an IT-adviser in London.
The boys leave: As with the Tanners, it looks like in many families on the island.
100,000 Irish will leave the country in the foreseeable future, predicts experts at the ESRI scientific institute for the Economics and Social Affairs in Dublin.
They even count on 200,000 emigrants by 2015.
For such a small country with only 4.5 million people, this is a major loss.
If the forecasts are confirmed, there will be a similar expassing wave to the one that Ireland suffered in the 1980s.
After a decade of rise to the Irish that brought great welfare to the Irish, dismalness is now once again expanding.
The economic crisis is particularly unsettling for young, educated Irish people, who have only experienced a rise so far.
Losing a job and a social descent seemed absurd to boom in these years.
Everyone needed to be needed, the money was in store for.
Meanwhile, three out of ten women and men under 30 are out of work.
There are many letters from readers in the Irish Times complaining: 'Everything goes downhill in Ireland.'
"There should be an uprising against politicians and bankers - but whoever can, he goes away, and it loses our country for a generation."
"Please let him go out."
Law student Leanne Caulfield, president of the Irish Student Union, sees the future in black because the government is said to be deceiving and offering no prospects for the future for young people.
"They are cutting the minimum wage, but they have no strategy to create new jobs," says the 20-year-old.
She watches for her classmates to milling from one unpaid practitioner to the next.
Her biggest concern is that she will have to move out on her own in four years.
"This thought is sad and depressing."
Men like Stephen McLarnon try to see the subject positively.
McLarnon organizes "WorkingAbroadExpo," an exhibition that offers a full service on the topic of work abroad.
"For job-booters in the market, working abroad is an excellent chance to take the first steps on the rankings of a career," says the manager.
His website shows photographs of surfers in Australia and snowboard skiers in Canada.
The message is clear: Working abroad is not galleys, but freedom and joy.
Seán O'Donovan has known about what it's like to build something somewhere else for six months.
Since the 29-year-old engineer had no job in Ireland, he is now employed by 15 Irish colleagues at a construction site in Germany.
He's building a fashion house in Gelsenkirchen right now.
In January, he continues to Hanover or Berlin for another project.
O'Donovan, meanwhile, rarely gets home because he works in extra shifts to pay off a home loan at home.
"The situation is sometimes really a bit crazy," she says, as she crosses the threshold of her own house for the first time in a long time.
"I make money in Germany for a house in Ireland that I'm not in at all."
He laughs awkwardly and walks through the cooled rooms.
The small house is in a good neighborhood with well-maintained gardens, with large expensive cars parked in the entrances.
O'Donovan bought the house with his sister four years ago for 380,000 euros - 100-percent loan-funded.
"It was a crazy time, simple money was without many questions," he says.
Is he worried that it might not go well with the loan?
O'Donovan thinks for a while, hot tea is coming down, and he says, "I don't have children to feed and I'm young; even if everything goes wrong, I can start all over again."
The construction engineer doesn't like the moaning he's so often hears now.
"No one has to starve - our situation is not at all as dramatic as it used to on this island," he says.
"Working abroad for a while, that's not the worst thing that can happen - maybe we'll just feel like the Irish afterwards."
He laughs and then tells of his father, who left for England in the last economic crisis.
"He was back again after seven years, and life went on in Ireland, quite simply."
Cian Tanner likes this idea.
To have an open future and simply wait for life to develop elsewhere.
He has also had several years of work in London, and why shouldn't it be good for him and his girlfriend in New Zealand as well?
But there is one more thing that worries him these days: his 27th birthday party Friday in Dublin.
She's worried she'll go wrong for the farewell party.
"Just no emotion," he says, drinking a lot of beer.
"Goodbye, that sounds disturbing."
"Let's call it a celebration of the departure, quite simply, with a few friends, a few drinks, a few games."
The standard practice of democracy
Democracy support for Latin America is growing, as is the promotion of private enterprise.
Criminal activity is more apprehensive than unemployment.
And Brazil is considered more influential by many regions than the United States.
These are some of the results of the current Latinobarómetro survey, which took place in 18 countries and was published exclusively in The Economist.
As the survey has been held regularly since 1995, it can thus follow changes in attitudes across the whole area.
This year's survey, which took place in September and early October, is dominated by two related items.
The first is that Latin America is in a rather cheerful mood.
The second is to increase the stability of attitudes towards democracy and its key institutions.
Democracy support in several countries on the outskirts of the Pacific in South America has increased significantly (see Table 1).
For example, in Peru, where economic growth averages 6% per year since 2002, democracy support has risen from a 40% low in 2005 to 61% this year.
It also rose in Mexico, where economics was recovering after a deep decline in production last year.
But only about half of those polled in Mexico and Brazil, the two most populous areas, are convinced Democrats, which is pulling down the regional average (see Figure 2).
About 44% of respondents across the whole area expressed satisfaction with the way in their country of democracy works in practice, it is the same figure as last year, but compared to 2001, when it was 25%, it is a large increase (Figure 3).
Roughly 34% said they trusted the Diet in their country and 45% trusted the government, again the same figures as last year, but there is a large difference compared to 2003 (17% and 24%).
Ten years ago, democracy was undermined by the economic crisis in Latin America.
Support was created during the global financial crisis probably because many Latin American countries suffered only a short recession and enjoyed a strong recovery.
In addition, a stronger social security network has helped protect poor people.
(The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America announced this week that the Latin American Republic living in poverty ratio had risen only slightly in 2009, dropping back to 32% this year.)
But the mood is changing in a wide range from country to country (see Figure 4).
Brazil's strong economic performance and the popularity of its outgoing president, Luiz Inácio Luly da Silva, are reflected in the widely accepted sense of progress.
This situation is scarceier in Mexico and Central America, where the recession was more severe and the state of violent crime has deteriorated.
It is only for the second time since surveys began to be conducted that more respondents across Latin America see crime as the most important problem than unemployment (see Graph 5).
Roughly 31% say that either they or their close relatives were the victims of crime last year, but that's a drop compared to the 38% figure of last year and is also the lowest number since 1995.
More massive economic performance is reflected in the growing support for private enterprise and the market economy: about 71% of respondents across the board say that private enterprise is essential for development, a percentage of 56% from 2007 (see Figure 6).
About 58% agree that the market economy is the only system that will allow their country to develop, a percentage that has grown from 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of respondents in Venezuela have the same view (and 80% there support private enterprise), even though their left-wing president, Hugo Chávez, expropriates many private firms.
Brazil is a country of leading the region, as mentioned by 19% of respondents (up from 18% last year), followed by the United States (9%, unchanged from last year) and Venezuela (9% compared to 11% last year)
However, the United States is considered the most influential country by respondents in Mexico and in much of Central America, with Venezuela enjoying its success in Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
Criticized elections
No one expected the general election in Haiti on 28 November to be perfect.
But they were far worse than the outsiders, who are trying to help the affected country to be afraid.
The election meant filling-up urns and repetitive voting, ballots scattered across the sewers, broken polling stations and intimidation.
Election stations open after hours of delay.
Many Haitians, including many of the movements due to the January earthquake, were wandering around, trying to find out where to vote.
Some of them eventually gave up.
More than ten presidential candidates, including several presumed preliminary preschays, shouted that it was a hoax and called for the election to be cancelled.
Protests, some of them of violent nature, spread across the country.
Yet Edmond Mulet, a senior UN official in Haiti, said that "it was a pretty good election in many ways."
Observers from the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community cautiously said that "they would not believe that these irregularities, however serious, did not necessarily have to cancel the process."
In other words, the show continues.
The electoral body, whose opposition votes are beholdled by René Préval, the unpopular outgoing president and his candidate, Jude Célestin, is due to give preliminary results on 7 December.
The expected deciding contest is scheduled for January.
All electoral hopes are not lost.
Two leading opposition candidates, Michel Martelly, the rapper and Mirlande Manigat, the former first lady, have withdrawn from their original call to declare the vote invalid.
But a problem can arise if Mr. Célestin, who has small or negligible support among voters, is described by the electoral commission as having achieved a decisive contest.
The rampaging cholera epidemic and the more than 1 million people still living in tents after the earthquake were concerned that the turnout would be low.
In the end, many Haitians wanted to vote, but were prevented from doing so because of disorganization.
The roughly 250,000 identity cards that are necessary for the vote remained undistributed shortly before the election.
There's a lot at stake.
Donors see the choice of a legitimate and popular government as a major step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
And it is clear, then, that the Haitians will push for it themselves.
Topic to the center
In weeks of suddenly widowed, Cristina Fernández, the president of Argentina, benefits from public sympathy, when her popularity boosted from 20 to more than 50%, the highest level since she was elected in 2007.
Yet the reversal of this success in the successful campaign for a second term in next year's elections may depend on whether the grieving Mrs. Fernández gives up the uncompromisingness of her late husband, predecessor and political partner, Néstor Kirchner.
And on these characters, everything will be based.
Mr. Kirchner, who continued economic policy after his wife successfully became president, was in the habit of compiling budgets that underestimated tax revenues, economic growth, and inflation.
This allowed the first couple to spend additional income at will.
Mrs Fernández's government lost its majority in Congress last year.
But the opposition split and was further destabilised in Mr. Kirchner's death for a heart attack on 27. October.
Some members of the ruling Peronist political movement have joined Ms. Fernández.
But after chaotic meetings (on which were slapped and blamed on the government for corruption), Congress failed to pass the 2011 budget.
"I'm not going to argue," the president said.
The 2010 budget will now also be in place for next year, with the president having more room to spend at will.
The economy is overheating: growth to be as high as 9% is likely this year.
The official inflation rate is now at 11.1%, but many private estimates and trade unionists are talking about a figure close to 30%.
Mr Kirchner, who took office in 2003, when Argentina was plagued by economic collapse, made it a priority for rising and reducing poverty, rather than controlling inflation.
He declined to deal with the IMF, burdened the private sector and purified the INDEC, a statistical agency that agreed to monitor the official inflation statistics.
Can President Fernández now moderate this policy?
It called for negotiations between private businesses and trade union leaders.
And its officials say they want to limit wage growth to 18% next year.
The economy was supported by rising world prices for the export of Argentine agricultural products.
But inflation was disrupted by growth based on a major devaluation in 2002.
This may be why President Fernández is to know that she wants to renew Argentina's financial ties to the rest of the world.
Earlier this year, the government formed an agreement with bondholders who previously rejected a debt restructuring that Argentina failed to pay in 2001.
Now, President Fernández faces an agreement with the creditor governments, which are grouped in the Paris Club, which he owes around $6.7 billion.
Kirchners always insisted that he not have that fact in the IMF's oversight, as is usual.
But last month, Amado Boudou, the Minister of Economy, announced that the fund would provide "technical assistance" to design a new national consumer-price index to commemorate the introduction to the clean-up of INDEC.
It is not yet clear whether President Fernández will want to remain in politics after the end of her term, when the husband is no longer at her side.
If he wants to stay, he needs to gain the support of the middle class, which is tired of kirchnerism.
At the time of the Argentines' return from their summer vacation in March, the wave of sympathy will be in decline.
If she wants to win another election, she will have to decide whether it will be necessary to quietly renounce the many views her husband has held in politics.
Half-avings for China
The Taiwanese voters are closer to a closer connection to the mainland.
What does Taiwan think of its big brother across the sea?
More than 7.5 million voters, 70% of those eligible, voted on November 27 for the city's mayors and the city council in five city districts, which may be seen as a broader assessment of President Ma Yingjea.
President Ma himself is a representative of the feelings that prevail on the mainland and have a strong set in business relations, including the partly free trade agreement, in the greatest straightening of relations with China since 1949.
President Ma passed the test, but only narrowly.
Although his Kuomintang (KMT) party ended with the win of three of the mayor's five offices, she failed to win by a majority of the vote.
In addition, the Democratic Progressive Party, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which is in favor of Taiwan's greater independence, won almost 50% of the total vote against 45% of the KMT party.
If this were a presidential election, President Ma would be in trouble.
Since he was elected two years ago, his party's vote rate has fallen by around 8%.
For the first time, the DPP was with the KMT in the city councils.
The election took place like most of the Taiwanese elections, which include noisy campaign trucks and mass gatherings with flags with scantily cape girls.
It even included a mandatory mysterious assassination attempt.
Sean Lien, the son of Lien Chan, honorary chairman of the KMT, was agitating for KMT's candidates on the eve of the election.
A man from the crowd shot the young Mr. Lien purely over his face, wounding him and killing the viewer.
It was not bizarrely determined whether the militant intended to injure Mr. Lien or settle a dispute with the candidate.
In any case, Tsai Ing-wen, the DPP's leading, claims that the shooting has affected the election, suspicions are on the DPP and leading voters towards KMT.
Perhaps the only big winner of the campaign was China.
It was remarkable how the question of the land itself remained behind.
Instead, the candidates were wrestling over plans for state housing and job creation.
Taiwan usually enjoys its de facto independence and hates the military threats of China.
So KMT tends to avoid ties to the government in Beijing.
But this time, the DPP also abandoned the uproar of anti-Chinese attitudes.
It is a response to the fact and realisation that Chinese trade is crucial to Taiwan's economic survival.
President Ma for his party confirmed that China's policy is acceptable to most of Taiwan.
The government in Beijing can be expected to continue to pursue commercial bribes, together with his strategy, to lure Taiwan back to the herd.
China wasted no time in sending a negotiator to Taipei to arrange an investment protection and medical cooperation summit.
They would also like to see political integration, too, but in the first place.
It will be better to wait for this after the 2012 presidential election.
In any case, the DPP discovered itself.
Two years ago, she was at the wrong level: her former leader, Chen Shui-bian, was sent to prison on corruption charges.
The president in 2000-08 was a rebel and a champion of clear independence.
But under the leadership of Ms Tsai, a new generation has developed, which is moderate and the DPP is working hard to attract experts and young people.
Ms Tsai was proclaimed as a DPP candidate for president, such as Su Tseng-chang, who held the office under Mr. Chen.
Their party is now doing everything they can to show that they can also work with Beijing.
Ms Tsai published plans for research institutes serving as a contact point between the DPP and China, provided that their negotiations can take place without any of the previous conditions.
Ms Tsai is telling the Taiwanese public that her party represents a "credible alternative" to Mr Ma's hasty approach to China.
Mr. Chen seems to be angry with this shift.
In a statement issued from his cell, he expressed the view that the DPP's candidates would do better to insist that Taiwan was a separate country.
He even ordered Mr. Su, the pragmatist, not to run for president.
But even without Mr. Chen's intervention, the DPP will fight to choose between potential candidates.
KMT is justified to search for its own people.
Mr Ma's assessments were poor, despite the rapid pace of economic growth; the KMT candidates did not want to go into the campaign with him.
His unpopularity seems to be based mainly on unemployment and a widening gap between the rich and the poor.
A KMT spokesperson says he will reorganise his cabinet, as well as the local branches.
The strong-praised proposals to support Taiwan for the establishment of friendly contacts are limited.
At the same time, most Taiwanese citizens see economic integration with China as inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent columnist, "a point from which there is no return has passed."
Grammy Award nomination: Jazz singer Esperanza Spalding is a surprise in the category of best new artist
The appearances at the request of the president and people are bound to be noticed.
Esperanza Spalding, a 26-year-old jazz bassist and singer, chosen by President Obama to perform at the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize ceremony, is described as one of the surprises of the Grammy Awards this year with a nomination for Best New Artist.
Since Spalding has been a glorified character on the jazz scene since her album "Esperanza" was released in 2008, the nomination came a little late, but it's in line with the Grammy rules, when the artist must not release more than three albums before "the public identity of the artist is established."
Her ambitious 2010 album "Chamber Music Society" has certainly taken a step forward, and thanks to her carefree vocal style and a nimble hand with elements of pop, funk and Latin influences, we can speak of Spalding as the success recorded by Norah Jones in 2003, the closest equivalent for Grammy voting in this category.
Elsewhere Grammy judges rightly award the album Vijay Iyer Trio "Historicity" in the instrumental album category, an exciting, refreshing ride of the album, which was the hot favourite last year.
Iyer will compete against the album by veteran saxophonist James Moody's "Moody 4B" and keyboardist John Beasley's "Positotola."
Trombone Shorty, the hoarse favorite from New Orleans and a frequent guest on HBO's "Treme" was awarded in the current jazz category, which is otherwise in favor of Stanley Clarke, John McLaughlin and Jeff Lorber's albums.
The wild band Darcy James Argue's Secret Society, with knowledge of steampunk, has received several well-deserved acclaims in the category of major ensembles, with the chamber jazz Childs Ensemble in competition and the still-beast Dave Holland, whose live album with the "Pathways" octet created a beautiful example of how a bassist can be free to use as a bandleader.
Grammy Awards nominees: Michael Daugherty, Steve Mackey lead the classic music category
Nominations for classical music have a wide range of music for the 53rd annual Grammy Awards for musicians and composers from around the world.
The nominee's leading position is Michael Daugherty and his "Deus Ex Machina" for the piano and orchestra, with five points and Steve Mackey with his album "Dreamhouse," an eclectic orchestral work, with a score of three points.
Among the nominees with a link to Southern California, Estonian composer Arvo Pärt and his Symfonie No. 4 "Los Angeles," a work commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonic and debuted at the Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
The composer, based in L.A. Avner Dorman and his Mandolin Concerto also have a shot at the award.
Nominations in classical music are divided into 13 categories, which include orchestral, opera, choral and solo recordings.
The category for classical music producer of the year has five nominees, Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin, and James Mallinson.
The nominations for the classic album were won by Bruckner and his Symphony No. 3 a 4 by the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra; Daugherty and his "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" by the Nashville Symphony Orchestra; Steven Mackey and his "Dreamhouse" project from the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; "Sacrificium - the Art of the Castrati" listing various artists; and Verdi's "Requiem" by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Chorus.
As far as the opera category is concerned, the nominees are Berg and "Lulu" by the Orchestra of the Royal Opera House; Adolf Hasse and the "Marc Antonio e Cleopatra" by Ars Lyrica Houston; Kaija Saariaho and "L'Amour de Loin" by the Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin; Rodion Shchedrin and "The Enchanted Wanderer" by the Orchestra and Chorus of the Mariinsky Theatre; and Arthur Sullivan and "Ivanhoe" by the BBC National Orchestra of Wales.
Among the composers nominated for the Grammy for contemporary compositions are Pärt for Symphony No. 4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina," Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionatamente Plus," Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Enchanted Wanderer."
Pärt's Symphony No. 4 premiered at Disney Hall in January of 2009 for a performance that was recorded by L.A. Philharmonic under the baton of Esa-Pekka Salonena.
The approximately 30-minute episode is called "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to former oil tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who is imprisoned in Russia.
Dorman and "Mandolin Concerto" were nominated for the instrumental performance of the soloist with the orchestra.
The composer from L.A. said that he had written a 15-minute work specifically for the mandolin performer Avi Avital, who performed at a concert with Metropolis Ensemble, based in New York.
"I wrote it using tones from the Middle East and many North African rhythms," Dorman said in a telephone interview.
Conductor Pierre Boulez, 85, received a nomination in the orchestral performance category, for the management of the Chicago Symphony in the recording of Stravinsky's work.
The instrumental soloists who received the nomination include the pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin; the organist Paul Jacobs; the violinist Julia Fischer; and the harpist Sarah Schuster Ericsson.
Only women were represented among the nominees nominated by the vocal soloists this year, with Anne Sofie Von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucia Duchon, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the category of transition of the classic, soprano Jessye Norman received a nomination for her recording of "Roots - My Life, My Song."
Planned mosque in Temecule receives approval of the Planning Commission
The planned mosque in Temecule received unanimous support from the local planning committee after more than five hours of often a heated public testimony.
Critics have attacked the project for promoting terrorism and leading to the suspension of trade.
However, the judges decided on Wednesday night that the new religious center was in accordance with local laws and would be aesthetically impressive.
"Many good people came to support this project - the Christians, the Jews, who you can think of," said Hadi Nael, chairman of the Islamic Center in Temecula Valley, on Thursday morning.
"I'm very proud of it as an American citizen."
"It implies that justice always wins."
"The opposition is minimal" he added.
"Those who oppose merely shout loudly."
"We have really good people in our valley."
The meeting began at six o'clock in the evening and lasted until almost midnight, when discussions with people who were pro or against the center took most of the time. These voices were evenly divided, says Press-Enterprise.
The discussion continued on the newspaper's website.
"There is no more America," appeared one comment.
"We are Planet of the Apes with the Statue of Liberty sunk in the sand."
"America has dropped."
The planned Islamic Centres also sparked protests in other parts of the country, including proximity to Ground Zero, the site of the tragedy that took place on September 11, 2001, when New York was attacked by terrorists.
In Temecula Valley Imam Mahmoud Harmoush condemned the violence.
His religious community of around 135 families plagued Riverside County for years without incident, but wanted a larger and more suitable space than the storage space he rented with a filter system manufacturer.
The new 3,944-square-foot mosque in the Mediterranean style of architecture will also have two minarets and will grow to a height of 43 feet.
It should take up a space of 4.32 acres on Nicolas Road, approximately three kilometres east of the Chaparral High School.
Opponents can still appeal to the city council on the project.
Microofs with arsenic resilience increase the possibility of new types of life on Earth or elsewhere
The discovery of a strange bacterium that can use arsenic as one of its nutrients extends the space for the search for new life forms on Earth, and perhaps further.
Researchers have discovered an unusual bacterium here on Earth, claiming that this is a sign that life has options that stand outside the main elements that have been considered and basic to date.
"This organism has a dual ability."
"It can grow either because of phosphorus or arsenic."
"This fact is very strange, but it is not proof that this is a form of truly 'extraterrestrial' life," Paul C commented on the fact. W. Davies of Arizona State University, co-author of the report that appeared Thursday in the online edition of Science.
For a long time, six main elements were considered necessary for life - carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulfur.
However, scientists have found that the bacteria, discovered in Mono Lake, California, are able to continue to grow after phosphorus is replaced by the arsenic.
"It will begin to astonish you of all that is still possible," said Ariel D. Anbar of Arizona State University, co-author of the report.
This find is important for the search for life outside the Earth, because researchers must be able to recognize life and know what life might look like, Anbar said.
The study focuses on the microbes found on Earth.
However, the news release to discuss it, which did not reveal the details of the find, sparked widespread speculation on the Internet that the report reveals the discovery of extraterrestrial life.
It's not so.
The discovery "shows that other planetary organisms may be able to use other elements that power biochemistry and that a set of elements that we consider 'standard' may not be so absolutely necessary for life," explained Charles Cockell, a professor at the Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute, Open University, at Milton Keynes, United Kingdom.
Cockell was not a part of the research team.
"This work is unusual because it shows the replacement of one element with another in the basic biochemical structure," Cockell added.
It wasn't a random find.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of NASA's Astrobiology Institute, which conducted the study, focused on Mono Lake for showing high levels of arsenic.
Arsenic and phosphorus are chemically very similar elements, so she considered that the microbe that is exposed to both elements may be able to replace one by another.
"Arzen is poisonous mainly because his chemical behavior is very similar to phosphorus."
"The result is that organisms can very hardly separate these elements from each other."
"However, the arsenic is so different that it doesn't work, like phosphorus. When he gets into the organism, he starts working in biochemical processes," Anbar explained.
Scientists are gathering bacteria known as GFAJ-1 and exposing them to an increasing concentration of arsenic that the bacteria are able to adapt and to grow.
Microbes grow better when phosphorus is applied, but as they can also survive with the replacement of the arsenic, the possibility of a life-form that uses arsenic is increased to occur naturally, either elsewhere on Earth or on another planet or a month where arsenic is more common.
Jamie S. Foster, an assistant professor at microbiology at the University of Florida, said the idea of arsenic that could be replaced by phosphorus was not new, but there was never an example on which to prove the fact.
Arsenic was more common in earlier times on Earth, she said, so scientists speculated that it could have been used by the former life forms.
"This suggests that there may have been other ways to create life, not just the way it was created in the early Earth," said Foster, who was not part of the Wolfe-Simon research team.
The research was supported by NASA, the Ministry of Energy and the National Institute of Health
The remaining stolen dogs were found in Compton
The other two of the four showy dogs stolen from the Bellflower Motel were found. The sheriff of the Los Angeles area reported on Thursday.
Four showwalk dogs - two Akits and a Grand Masters Pembroke corgis - disappeared on Tuesday when the Chevrolet Express van was stolen in 2006, in which they spent the night at the Bellflower 6 Motel, the authorities said.
Two dogs were discovered on Wednesday afternoon and the other two dogs were discovered late Wednesday night, said Steve Whitmore, a spokesman for the Los Angeles Police Department.
"The good news is that the dogs are fine," Whitmore said.
"They're in good shape."
"They were handed over to their rightful owners."
Whitmore refused to say exactly where the dogs were found, in what location, nor did he share detailed information about their discovery.
"The investigation is still ongoing."
"We don't want to talk about it," Whitmore said.
"We follow the rules."
Dog owners, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, were not caught up in the case.
They were very pleased when their two Akits were found at the Downey shelter on Wednesday afternoon.
The sheriff's representatives found the van and two dogs separately in Compton.
Akity Trace, a three-year-old dog Trace and 10-month-old dog Didi, were uninjured, authorities said.
But Bunny and Peter, the Welsh Corgi Pembroke Rickard and Peek, who had planned to participate in regional competitions on behalf of their Japanese owners this week, remained uninvited until their discovery late on Wednesday.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, are in town this weekend to take part in the AKC/Eukanuba National Championship at Long Beach, where they planned to show off Trace.
The other dogs were to compete in other competitions, scheduled for the AKC/Eukanuba show in the days before the AKC/Eukanuba show, Peek told The Times on Wednesday.
Southern California is only one stop for the couple's nearly monthly travel in dog shows.
On Monday night, Peek and Rickard registered to the motel.
They often sleep in the motels and park their car in front of the room window.
They also took three dogs with them - a boxer puppy, Parson Russell Terrier and a Breton Hound - who stayed with them in the motel room.
The Akits and the Pembroke Welsh corgis were left in the car, where it should have been colder.
They opened the windows a little to get the dogs in the car of getting enough fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported the car theft at 6 a.m. on Tuesday.
Peek said he would offer a reward to anyone who led them to the missing dogs. Dogs are implanted with microchips to identify them.
On Thursday, it was unclear whether the prizes would be awarded.
The lion is ready to roar again now that the restructuring of MGM receives final approval from the court
After 18 months of tremors and uncertainty, MGM finally got the green light to start again.
Federal insolvency judge in New York on Thursday officially blessed the creditors' plan to settle about $5 billion in debt, clearing the trip for an 86-year-old entertainment company that focuses on the production and production of movies and TV shows.
With a donation to Thursday's fact that the plan meets the requirements of the U.S. bankruptcy order, there are no legal obstacles to the MGMs to re-ignite, to be able to restart the founders of Spyglass Entertainment, Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, who will become the main leaders of the downed studio's downed team.
The number of employees will drop to about 320 from the original more than 400.
MGM will not emerge suddenly from Chapter1 until JPMorgan Chase agrees on a planned financial resources to allow a $500 million loan to be funded by new operations and MGM productions.
It is now a merger with an investment bank that needs $75 million on its own and funding is expected around mid-December.
The restructuring process began in May 2009, when the investment bank Moelis & Co. was hired to advise management on how to resolve its finances, as management struggled to afford interest payments of $300 million a year.
That August, Chairman Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, the former CEO of Enron and the Rift Expert, known for his work for Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Attempts by Moelis and Cooper to resolve the financial difficulties of MGM and 140 studio creditors took much longer than expected.
After several months of discussion, the parties agreed to put the company up for sale at the end of 2009.
Although the auction attracted several bidders, none of them were willing to pay US$2 billion, plus the funding demanded by the creditors.
In the spring of this year, everything was back on the drawing board and the MGM team started working on the restructuring plan. After months of debate and internal disagreements, the plan was eventually approved by the creditor at the end of October.
When MGM officially rises out of bankruptcy in the coming weeks, Moelise and Cooper receive multimillion dollar bonuses for their work.
Moelis & Co., which has already received $1.2 million, will receive a payment of $9.5 million.
Cooper's firms that collect $375,000 a month for their services that govern the company's run-up will receive a $4 million reward for their success, the so-called "success fee."
Barber and Birnbaum plan to resume production at MGM, which released only one film this year and put together a proposal for seven or eight films that will be released in early 2012.
They also plan to participate in the financing of two films, the model of which will be the book "Hobit," together with Warner Bros.
The studio needs to arrange a special loan of between $265 million and $275 million to fund its share of these two films, which will be directed by Peter Jackson.
Investor Carl Icahn, who owns approximately 18% of MGM's debts, was looking for the possibility of a merger of the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, in which he is the largest shareholder.
However, the recent negotiations between the two companies did not result in an agreement.
Technology toys that will keep your budget for gifts in balance
The leading candidate this year is the most amazing toy iPad, followed by the video game system. In both cases, however, this is a significant hit to the gift budget.
Consider that for the price of one iPad you can buy five BMX bikes for $99 and one game Kinect costs as well as 10 bead jumpshoe or about 48 Play-Doh cups.
But there is a way to balance your gift budget.
I recently visited three national toy retailers - Wal-Mart, Toys "R" Us and BJ's Wholesale Club - and watched what electronic toys I could buy for less than $80.
It was immediately clear that Moore's law was working; this year's technology toys had far more energy, at the same prices, if not slightly lower, compared to past years.
While there have been relatively fewer new toys with associated sites, the two most famous toys of this type, Webkinz and Club Penguin, offer more.
The number of toys with button batteries is increasing, as are the charging toy toys.
Here are some recommendations.
(All the aforementioned prices are from Toys "R" Us, except in cases which are indicated differently.)
Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, 13, 3 years old) are stuffed animals that sing when you squeeze their tummy.
At one press, the animal sets out a tone and the other grip begins to form a song.
If you buy more than one, they will sing together and harmoniously.
Warning: Once you start squeezing, you can't stop.
The best choice in a combination of singing and dancing is Dance Star Mickey (Fisher-Price, $60, from the age of 2)
Last year, I rented a 14-inch animatronic doll on Elmo Live technology, which can play Simon Says and can also walk a month-long walk thanks to its innovative folding leg with bike blocking.
Children test the Mickey Dance Instructor's toy, though their parents complain about the lack of volume control.
If you're a child of the '80s, you might think of Alphia, one of the first computer educational toys.
He's back, (Hasbro/Playskool, $40, for children from 3), with a backpack full of quiz cards that are designed to be car-driving to be fun with a self-corriitable, funny workbook.
If you're eyeing a smartphone for your child, there are three independent alternatives.
VTech's MobiGo ($60, for children aged 3 to 8) is the cheapest simple-use option, with qwerty keyboard, although games do not have as effective teaching as the Leapster Explorer ($70 for children from 3 to 12 years old), the first major change to Leapster's Leapster series, with a newer and brighter display.
No version is compatible with older units.
iXL by Fisher-Price ($90, for children aged 3 to 7) uses the iTunes-like system to introduce games and e-books and has an SD card slot that allows you to display family photos.
And finally, Scrabble Flash ($$, Hasbro, for kids from 8 years of age) is a set of five cubes that aren't bigger than a matchbox, each with an LED display.
The goal is to create the words by placing the cubes in a row before the time runs out; it's great for competing in improvised form of words.
More and more toys have at least some kind of online connection.
To the highest extent, two Webkinz and Club Penguin toys were represented in the toy stores.
For example, if you want to buy your child an online toy from Club Penguin, you can choose, for example, the Disney Club Penguin 2" Mix 'N Match Figure Pack, $5 for children from 6 to 12), which contains a coin with a hidden code.
When you activate the code online, your child receives enough credits in the Club Penguin store on any two items.
This could include, for example, roller skates or a Puffle pet.
A little bigger than your toothbrush's bun is the Hexbug Nano (10$, for kids from 5 years), the latest from a series of microrobots on a button battery.
The beetle moves quickly on 12 vibrating silicone legs in accidental direction.
It's fun to make a maze of dice and watch to see if he can find a way out.
It is also very resilient.

Introducing a more subtle police check in China
As a city military instructor, Tang Shenbin walked around the square, strictly checking his orders, and making orders in a low voice with military authority.
He wanted female members - a Chinese sturdy enforcer of the city's order, feared and despised for their hard-line interventions and a pencise to be violent - to convey some impression of a cluster of insurers.
"Stand up straight!"
"Hurry!"
Show them, she whispers softly, "how pretty girls look!"
Four very young girls wearing white gloves and the same olive coats and trousers came to attention.
Four pairs of black shoes are listed as a ruler.
Four headgear perfectly sits on the hair, which are perfectly bound by blue and white ribbons.
"Personally, I think they look average," Mr. Tang said dismissively.
"The men are nice."
More than one government tried to revive the image of the city's guards in China.
One city ordered the new conscripts to have a college degree.
The Guangdong province turned the gray-green uniforms into the supposedly more appealising blue.
Wuhan replaced his stares of heavy weaponry in central China: in 2009, one report said that 50 officers had been adamant to have been apprehensively rounded by a snack cart and stared at the owner until the door-to-door salesman packed up and left after half an hour.
Xind, the city district of 680,000 in Chengdu, chose the operation as their main painting.
Since 2003, the district has supplemented its municipal police with 13 women who have been selected specifically according to their appearance, affinity and young age.
The aim is to show, in addition to the rough side of the police, a more subtle, female side.
Unfortunately, even Scarlett Johansson herself would be in trouble to get into secret Chinese urban groups.
The critics would argue for a good reason.
Unlike the police, these officers are only allowed to enforce the city ordinance, impose fines and other administrative penalties.
But the Chinese media routinely capture a different reality.
In January 2008, police inspectors from Hubei province beat the detached viewer to death after using his cell phone to film how they were acting in the crackdown on the crackdown.
Last year, the training of police officers in Beijing was carried out, the manual for this training was stolen and posted online. The manual included a description of how to effectively beat up the perpetrator with no blood sign.
This year, a door-to-door meloner in Shanghai got into a brawl with five police officers and suffered injuries to the left side of the brain.
One video game full of violence that can be downloaded online depicts Chinese police officers attacking street vendors.
"Chengguan has startled the government," China Daily, the national edition, was wailing last year after another discussion about the tactics.
The paper said "really a thorough cleansing."
Skeptics say such an approach is not enough.
After the county advertised interest in eight new female female police officers in October, The Beijing Evening News was an editorial about whether women have real duties or are merely a distraction.
The answer seems to be a bit of both.
The district requested female applicants between the ages of 18 and 22 with a good physique and "five facial features in the right proportion."
Adepts should have a height higher than the diameter - that is, more than 1.6 metres.
The service at the age of 26 is compulsory.
Officials say the job is mentally too demanding for women over the age of 25.
"Their image is an important thing," an unnamed police officer said on Rednet.com, as a government website.
"Candidates must first demonstrate the external qualities, which are then determined by others, including height, weight, facial features, etc."
Then comes the character and "inner quality."
Women are like flower vases, he said, and added, "In addition to being vases, they will also have other responsibilities."
Zheng Lihua, the deputy director of the district's city management, disagrees with this description.
But he noted that height requirements are also common in China for other jobs, for both sexes.
As is the requirement for symmetrical facial features.
Which means that the issue of good looks is the subject of discussion among the Chinese.
Disabled or mutilations will certainly not apply.
"He cannot allow a lame or hunchbacked man to serve in our country," Mr. Zheng said.
"His image wouldn't be good."
Liu Yi, who is keeping watch in Baoguang Square near the monastery, has 22 years old, faces like apples and a finely shaped mouth.
She did not think that the emphasis on her appearance might have a sexist character, she said.
"Do you think I look sexy in this uniform?" she asked with an ironic look.
Her co-worker with doe, 21-year-old Xu Yang says "Our job is to represent the city's image."
They have no objection to their limited performance, they said, because their career ambitions are greater than merely waving traders away from the aisles where they can do their business.
Each morning, the group stands against the more than ten market traders, who are running around on foot or on bikes, trying to sell as many dumplings and tofu bowls as possible before they are banished.
"Mr. Wang, you must leave."
"We've told you this many times!" said Miss Xu when the jerseem started to run, and for a time left his wheelchair with noodles.
Officers describe their duties as more monotonous than strenuous.
"Every day it's basically the same thing," said Huang Jing, 20, who is studying marketing on her day off.
"A big routine."
One reason is that female policewomen do not have the powers of their male counterparts to confiscate the merchandise.
They can only threaten to report the fact to their male leaders.
The tendency is then to protect them from the sudden public displays of hostility against the official apparatus, which are common across China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in Kunming, the capital of Yunnan Province, rebelled after false rumors spread that police officers had killed the vendor.
More than ten police officers or police officers were injured in the night hours; 14 government vehicles were overturned or set on fire.
Xindu, meanwhile, has escaped such violence.
But peace can hardly be guaranteed.
Only two blocks from the quiet Baoguang Square, where the policewomen were on patrol that morning, had gathered at the corner of the street.
Officers confiscated a motorcycle that was being repaired on the sidewalk instead of inside the shop, as required by the regulations.
The bike owner could have cried as he wanted.
15 minutes' left in front of the cops, looking angry, with his elbows on the vehicles, and quickly away with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, the coordinator affiliated with the men's group, stayed behind, his white badge turned to hide his name.
Like female police officers, the coordinators are men over 40 who already have only an auxiliary role.
Unlike them, they are not educated in the maintenance and smoothness of the image.
"Sometimes we fight verbally."
"Sometimes we fight physically," Mr. Li said matter-of-factly.
"Most of it is the public who start it."
Prosecutors won't blame Senator Ensign sign
Prosecutors from the Justice Department cleared Senator John Ensign on the criminal charges of his affair with a former campaign adviser and his efforts to secure the lobby, the senator's lawyers announced on Wednesday.
The decision ends with the most serious legal threat that Mr. Ensign, a Republican innochen, has faced, and which, until the scandal, has been considered a possible Republican presidential candidate for 2012 to be considered a possible Republican presidential candidate for 2012. His affair went into national headlines and damaged his career.
Mr. Ensign, the Bureau said he was "consciously pleased" by the decision that followed almost a year's investigation.
The senator could still face disciplinary action at the Senate Ethics Committee.
Mr. Ensign's lawyers said that the Justice Department "informed us that Senator Ensign would no longer be the target of the investigation and that there was no plan to press charges against him in this matter."
The Justice Department declined to comment on the case.
The decision came as a surprise to many ethics lawyers outside the Justice Department who argued that there was serious evidence that Mr. Ensign was preparing to violate the ban on federal lobbying.
Interviews, e-mails and other documents published in the New York Times in October 2009 reported that Mr. Ensign had assisted Douglas Hampton, one of his assistants, to secure a lucrative lobby to lead to the silence of Mr. Hampton and his wife, Cynthia, the senator's affair with her.
Mrs. Hampton once worked as a treasurer in the Ensignna campaign.
Mr Ensign contacted a number of political backers to find work for Mr Hampton and to support their views after Mr Hampton were hired to lobby for them, so much to cite documents and interviews.
As Hampton was until recently the assistant to Mr. Ensign, he was expelled by law from the lobbying of his former employer or the Senate for a year.
Ethics experts argue that the unusual settlement of Mr. Ensign and Mr. Hampton, who were friends before the affair, has arisen in violation of the lobbying ban.
From the evidence that was released "it has revealed that this is a clear case of drafting a violation of the law," said Stanley Brand, a Washington lawman who specializes in defending clients who are under investigation by the government.
While Department of Justice officials declined to explain the reasons for the decision in Senator Ensignne's case, Mr. Brand and other ethics lawyers said the department was cautious about political lawsuits, after a large number of setbacks, including a decision last year to suspend a lawsuit against former senator Ted Stevens in the midst of charges of misconduct by the prosecution.
Federal prosecutors "clearly hid the weapons," said Melanie Sloan, executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington), a law firm that filed several complaints against Mr. Ensign in the case.
"It basically points to the fact that high-ranking government officials are not covered by the law," she added.
Paul Coggins, the chief attorney for Mr. Ensign, said in an interview that he had been called by the Attorney General of the Ministry of Justice on Monday and then the next day, and told him that the department had found no charges against his client.
Mr. Ensign's defense team is working with the plaintiffs to convince them that the senator, as his office reiterated in a statement on Wednesday, "acted in accordance with the law."
Mr Coggins declined to elaborate on the legal arguments he had given to the prosecutors.
"I'm not comfortable with the details of my discussions with the Justice Department, except that we think they made the right decision," he said.
Last month, the Federal Election Commission decided to halt the investigation into a separate complaint in which the ethics group is filing allegations that Ensignna Hamptons' parents' payment to the Hamptons of breach of federal electoral law.
The Electoral Commission said it did not have enough evidence to prove that the money meant nothing more than a gift.
One company that Mr. Ensign helped Mr. Hampton find a lobbying job was NV Energy, the main non-Nazis company that had long supported the senator.
One December 2008 email showed that after Mr. Hampton began working at the company as a lobbyist, Mr. Ensign's senior staff - John Lopez - communicated with Mr. Hampton and told him that he had "beamed" the Interior Ministry regarding the subject under discussion.
Mr. Ensign also attended a lunch with Mr Hampton and another Nevada client, Allegiant Air, and called on the Transport Minister to arrange a meeting on behalf of the airline after hiring Mr. Hampton for lobbying work.
When the news of the affair first surfaced last year, Mr. Ensign apologized to his constituents and resigned his post, as the fourth Republican leader in the Senate.
After a months-long stagnation, Mr. Ensign told reporters two weeks ago that he planned to participate in his third term in the Senate.
In the report that Mr Ensign was no longer the target of the investigation into the crime, his spokeswoman Jennifer Cooper said the senator hoped the Ethics Committee would quickly follow the Justice Department and end the investigation.
"The Ensign's Senator is looking forward to continuing his strenuous work in the name of the non-Nazi people," she said.
The Municipality's call by Cheshire turns to Twitter
In the ranks of the courtroom, half a dozen of them wrote.
Minute to a minute later, they sent reports of the gruesome testimony via Twitter.
Finally, the defense says that more than 140,000 Twitter messages were looking at rape and tying up the children to the beds in the house that was set on fire.
On Thursday, Steven J. Hayes, who was convicted of killing three citizens of Cheshire, Connecticut, family, and was to hold an official end to impose the death penalty for which the jury voted.
But Mr. Hayes' lawyers have already appealed to the court with requests and arguments that would probably have employed the court for years.
One of the most provocative is that intensive reporting of the process - including the widespread use of Twitter by the main reporters - created a "circus atmosphere" and this widespread, immediate, uninterrupted information with outcribing details was then introduced by the jury in a decision to influence public opinion.
This claim could force the judge to address the question of whether to require new rules in the courtroom with the emergence of new technologies.
"As I have experienced with this trial, I think there is a real danger that the inclusion of new technologies in the courtroom affects the rights of a fair trial for the individual," said Thomas J. Ullmann, the chief defending officer, Mr. Hayes.
Judge of the trial, Jon C. The State High Court of Blue briefly rejected the claims regarding last week's decree, saying that the media was "taking care of it" and that there was no evidence to point to the jury acting under the influence of the public.
But it's probably not the last word in this case.
For decades, the courts have acknowledged that reporting on notorious cases may raise questions about the justice of the trial.
In a court order of 1966, the U.S. Supreme Court of the United States overturned the conviction of a Cleveland chiropractor, Dr. Sheppard herself for the murder of his wife, when he said in his decision that in the case of Sheppard versus Maxwell, it was a "carnival atmosphere" at the trial.
Some believe that this offence was the inspiration for the TV show and the film "Refugee."
Some lawyers have said that the appeals courts that reviewed Hayes' ruling half a century later might be surprised by the argument that new rules could be necessary to determine the way communication is directed from the courtrooms, as was in the case of Dr. Sheppard unimaginable.
"There is a general reason for concerns about the impact of the new media" in high-profile cases, said John J. Donohue III, a professor at the Stanford Law School, who studied the death penalty in Connecticut and wrote a report saying it had been performed at will.
Professor Donohue said that some judges may be intrigued by the idea that restricting imminent communication from courtrooms can make the trial more just.
The Twitter case is only one of the many outlined lawyers, Mr. Hayes, who would be able to argue for years to delay the execution of the sentence.
Defense attorneys also argue, for example, that it may be a bias in the case of Mr. Hayes, when Judge Blue refused to allow him to test the reactions of potential jurors by showing them criminal photographs of the horror in the selection of the jury.
Some of the jurors said they were appalled by the victims' photographs of the victims, which was Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48, and her daughters Hayley, 17, and Michaela, 11.
Defense attorneys say they will also reject the constitutionality of the death penalty, claiming that the judge wrongly appealed the juror, who was critical of prosecutors and that his decision wrongly put more pressure on the verdict and directed the jury to think over the weekend.
The jurors were not separated.
But their arguments about the influence of the scale of the process can attract the most interest.
They stated in an objection to the verdict last month that the case dominated the reports in Connecticut and had been discussed during the election campaign by the candidates for the governor and the Senate of the United States.
They argued that the media kept foment the flames of emotion in the case.
"Darday rush of media, cameras and reporters in court," the lawyer wrote, "it has been something that has not yet been seen here in New Haven, and it may also be a nationwide rarity."
Their focus on Twitter's actions is controversial.
In interviews, some journalists argued that the immediate reporting was more outrageous than the reports listed at a later date and, from their point of view, the judicial police should direct the scope of other trials.
But some lawyers have called for the appeals courts with frequently used arguments that social and technological changes require the adaptation of the courts.
Mr. Hayes' lawyers are seeking this right.
In their archives, they referred to the Supreme Court's decision of the 1966 Supreme Court in the case of the Dr. Sheppard, because of the breadth of the process's action and wanted to clarify the demand that the new media required new rules.
"This case," they wrote, "it represents the case of the Sheppard versus 21st-century Maxwell."
Can courtesy overcome the abyss?
Following the campaign, which was notable for its insult and negativity, a small number of courtesy appeared in Washington this week.
Is this the first swallow of genuine cooperation between two political parties or merely an illusion moment before the swift return to the party fight in the capital?
Tuesday's meeting between President Obama and the parliamentary leaders produced no major discoveries about the major issues that must be discussed during the session.
In any case, however, it was a polite discussion about the differences of opinion of two parties, as well as defining their shared responsibilities, rather than another blank episode of the party's struggle.
Wednesday's public session of the President's deficit commission was also civilized, despite the political differences that remain among the members.
It seems clear that close cooperation for several months has built up a mutual respect that transcends the ideological gulf that still divides the members.
And it's kind of hard to say that a new era of collaboration has begun.
Both sides are now in the trial period - probing each other with signs of collegiality and compromise, seeking to assess the boundaries of public opinion and voter patience against the renewed party war.
That is why Tuesday's meeting and its later assessment by the participants were also conducted with a minimum of requirements or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too extensive and too deep to propose a rapid change in the circumstances that have prevailed here for the last two years.
Whether it's the issue of taxes, spending, health care or rights, both sides are miles away.
However, the November election was prepared by Washington, at least quickly.
"It's not a question of whether regulatory matters have changed," said Pete Wehner, Bush's administrator, now at the Ethics and Public Policy Center.
"They are inevitable after the election.
The election galvanized the partisans' emotions, and they fell silent.
It's good."
On several issues, especially those to be discussed at the meeting, Republicans and Democrats have little chance of finding a solution.
Bush's tax cut expired at the end of the year, and no one sees this as favorable.
Both sides want to find a way to protect some or all of them, both sides permanently or temporarily.
Like the likely compromise on unemployment benefits simply because Republicans cannot watch how they support a tax cut for the wealthy while rejecting unemployment benefits for the unemployed.
After Tuesday's White House meeting, there is more optimism about a possible agreement on these issues, together with the ratification of the new opening treaty.
But William Galston of the Brookings Institution points out that successful cooperation on major issues will not necessarily lead to the relationship of two political parties when the 112th Congress convenes in January.
Rather, a likely period of disagreements, or even inevitable, he said.
"After doing the things that must be done, psychology will return to one of the confrontations in a short space of perspective," he said.
Wehner also expressed scepticism - which is largely widespread - to the conclusion that courtesy will lead them to real cooperation.
"I look at all events between the present and 2012 as a shadow box, when the main events will occur in 2012," he said.
The reasons are largely linked to the formation of a new Republican majority in the White House and the tea party voters who helped create it.
Republican leaders now face the danger of exaggeration, know that they must behave according to their promises and must cut government spending and repeal the new health care law.
These adherence lines are clear in the initial responses to the recommendations on the deficit, which include reforming the tax code and raising some taxes, an increase in the retirement age and a reduction in spending.
The Joint Presidents Alan Simpson and the Erskine Bowles have taken the task of one of the toughest challenges in Washington and, in their view, are to put pressure on the deficit to the public program in ways that cannot be ignored.
But they need 14 votes in the 18-member commission to present their plan as an official recommendation and thus fight to get as close to this figure as possible.
The biggest opposition is among the elected officials in the jury, who suggest that in the case of financial issues, we have, at least today, a small foundation or a will for compromise.
Galston predicts two phases in the battles between the White House and the parliamentary Republicans.
The first will begin next year in the form of party conflicts, with Republicans calling on Obama to address the budget, taxes, and health care, when a period of greater party cooperation will be followed.
What causes a shift?
Public opinion.
There is much evidence that despite the party's partisanship at the last election, the majority of Americans want to continue to see two parties that work together.
If it could be directed to the heel, as it was in 1995, then both sides will be watching the public's reactions very closely.
Anyone at risk of reducing the votes, it is likely to change the course and seek a compromise.
That may be an optimistic point of view.
The partisanship and the direction is greater today than they were in the mid-1990s, and it turns out that a larger ideological gap between Obama and the parliamentary Republicans has emerged than it was for Republicans and Bill Clinton.
At the same time, activists on both sides see 2010 as a prelude to more important elections in 2012.
Based on this reality, the courtesy that emerged this week, many Americans would welcome.
But it will cost a lot of effort on both sides to find common groundwork on the issues that still divide them.
A striking American documentary portrays Moscow as a haven for corruption
The city's management is in the hands of the "clucktoracy" and it continues with some of the bribes and bribe for protection that come to the Kremlin on the way to the Kremlin, the U.S. Embassy in Russia reported in records from February.
Both the police and the Federal Security Service largely hold protective wings to help explain the high cost of living in Moscow.
They collect money not only from legal trades but also from organised crime groups.
Every layer of bureaucracy - which Prime Minister Vladimir Putin called the "total of the office" - takes its toll as the money starts to move up the ladder.
The footage, which was sent to Washington under the name of ambassador John Beyrle, was posted on WikiLeaks' website on Wednesday.
The footage is based on the sources whose names were redacted.
The footage was written at a time when Yuri Luzhkov was still mayor and accusing him of a large share of corruption.
He was dismissed in October by President Dmitry Medvedev, but since then we can only follow minimal changes in cleansing.
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena Baturina, who owns a prominent design firm, have consistently denied corruption charges for many years, and won several lawsuits for perjury charges for such allegations.
He told a Russian television station in September when he was asked about proven evidence of corruption: "It's crazy, it's dirt, it's crap."
The Russians, with absolute conviction, believe that if their society is corrupt, it will turn out to be a vote.
But it is unusual to meet such details spoken in such a way, in the embassy report, and it is also unheard of for diplomats to do so.
"The government of the city of Moscow and its association with the criminal elements led some to call it 'dysfunctional,' and confirm that the government functions more as a kleptocracy than as a government," the report says.
"Criminal elements are enjoyed by the so-called 'khereha' (a term from the world of jail and mafia, which literally means 'roof' or protection), provided by the police, the Federal Security Service, the Federal Security Service (FSB), the Ministry of the Interior and the Office of the Public Prosecutor, as well as everywhere in the government's bureaucracy of the city of Moscow.
"The Analytiks have identified and a three-stage structure in the criminal world of Moscow."
"Luzhkov is at the very top."
"The Federal Security Service, the Ministry of the Interior and the militias are in the second tier."
"And finally, at the lowest level, there are ordinary criminals and corrupt inspectors."
"It is an ineffective system in which criminal groups fill in the blanks in some areas, as the city does not provide some services."
The report says the FSB is taking money from the biggest companies and the police are targeting smaller businesses.
A source said, "trademakers in Moscow are aware that it is better to obtain protection from the FSB or the Ministry of the Interior (rather than from organized criminal groups) as they have not only more weapons, resources and forces than criminal groups, but they are also protected by the law."
"For this reason, protection from criminal gangs is no longer so on course."
The footage says that while the withdrawal of the money is complex, the protection itself can already be in trouble; even those who pay can sometimes be arrested.
To those who do not pay quickly enough, their business is closed under various pretexts.
Medvedev spoke several times about the fight against corruption, but admitted that he had made little progress.
The bass report speaks of men taking suitcases, probably packed with cash, to the Kremlin itself.
"In his fight against corruption, Medvedev must rely on bureaucrats," Georgy Satar, director of the Moscow research team, Ind, said in a recent interview.
"But it is part of this bureaucracy."
"It is not part of the political class because there are no longer political classes in Russia."
Without politicians, without opposition, without the separation of powers, corruption is inevitable, he said.
The Indo estimates that corruption costs Russia more than $300 billion a year nationwide.
The country ranks 154th in a recent survey on the global perception of corruption by the NGO Transparency International (the countries ranked from at least to the most corrupt).
The unveiling of the report by the U.S. Embassy, which appeared in Moscow in the late hours of the evening, certainly did not elicit enthusiasm with the Russian government, although only to the extent that Luzhkov may be charged for Moscow's shortcomings, may be a chance for the Kremlin to argue about the solution to the problem.
In an interview with CNN with Larry King, Putin reported that the documents that WikiLeaks released may have been counterfeit and reacted angrily to a statement that American diplomats called him Batman and Medvedeva Robin.
"The truth about the matter is that it is about our interaction, which is an important factor in domestic policy in this country," he said.
"But to be honest, we didn't think it would be done with such arrogance, with such coercion, you understand, so unethically."
Khmer Rouge veterans forced to come to terms with the past
In a dimly lit concrete classroom with tarnished and peeled walls, the headmaster of the Anlong Veng High School recalled the man who had built it, the leader of the Khmer Rouge, Ta Mok.
"Everyone here loves Ta Moka."
"He was a good leader and cared for his people," said Sreng Kor Ma, 42.
Known as a "cutter" for his savagery during the Khhmer Rouge, the commander remains popular in this remote Khmer Rouge in northwestern Cambodia, where he built hospitals, bridges and other infrastructure, and where thousands of former soldiers of the organization still live.
But this year, 12 years after the Khmer Rouge surrendered to reign, there is also a shattered long-standing loyalty in Anlongen.
In April, the victims at the forum of truth and reconciliation were allowed to publicly confront people who were part of the regime.
In June, the government provided textbooks that for the first time explain to children the history of the Khmer Rouge and their former soldiers.
And in July, jointly, the UN and the Cambodian court to raise the first conviction of a former Khmer Rouge member, the sentencing of the former leader, the notorious violent association Tuol Sleng, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as the Ghost, to 35 years in prison.
With each such advance, the unrest of the Khmer Rouge veterans in Anlong Veng grew, complicating the efforts to reconcile and their attempts to re-engage in the Cambodian society.
"There is a grudge and fear among the former Khmer Rouge, but they are helpless to do anything," said Chhang Youk, head of the Cambodia documentation centre, an independent organization that examines the regime.
"For them, life among the Khmer Rouge was a wonderful one, but the regime became a symbol of evil."
"It separates the families."
During the Khmer Rouge rule in Cambodia, from 1975 to 1979, an estimated 1.7 million people were executed or died of hunger, for illness or overwork.
When the Vietnamese attacked and overthrew the reign of Pol Pot in 1979, the remnants of the regime and its soldiers fled to the Cambodian border with Thailand.
There, they launched an uprising that lasted until the last movement in December 1998.
Pol Pot, Nuon Chea, and Ieng Sary ran guerrilla warfarean from their bases in the mountains and jungles in western Cambodia, while Ta Mok cultivated supporters in Anlongen.
But in the mid-1990s, after the UN-sponsored peace agreement, the country was led to the first democratic election in 1993. Large groups of Khmer Rouge fighters began to move to a government that culminated in the surrender of Ieng Sara in 1996 and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died of natural causes in 1998, and Ta Mok, who persevered, was captured by government forces in the undergone mountains of Dangrek in 1999.
He died in Phnom Penhski prison in 2006 while awaiting trial.
Their benefactors were no longer cared for, with most of the former Khmer Rouge fighters descending into ordinary Cambodian rural life, and many of them nostalgically remember the time of the movement.
Although several of the elite Khmer Rouge have maintained their local government position in exchange for their weapons, their position remains weak, like unskilled farmers.
"These people have had minimal benefits from the surrender," said Sok Leang of the Center for Justice and Reconciliation, led by public forums across Cambodia, including Anlong Veng.
"They are surrounded by the regime's utopilic agrarian ideology."
"They were manners without any idea of doing business."
Sor Lim, 55, who entered the Khmer Rouge as a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle around Anlongen in the jungle before settling as a poor farmer in 1998.
"Life under the Khmer Rouge was a good one," he said.
"The Mok fed them all."
"But now life is hard, because we must secure everything for ourselves."
The ongoing Khmer Rouge court has also raised concerns.
Early next year, the court will begin investigating Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Rouge Minister.
The court has a mandate to prosecute the lead-in-holders and the people responsible for the crimes, but it has not been said whether it will continue in the four cases.
It was little to be reassured by the fears in Anlongenway.
Recent media speculation focused on Im Chaem, 64, who was the regional leader in the province of Banteay Meanchey during the Khmer Rouge's rule in the late 1970s.
In 2007, she told researchers at the Information Center in Cambodia that she oversaw the construction of the Trapeang Thma Dam, a project that was believed to have killed thousands of forced workers.
On a recent hot evening, Im Chaem returned from a field job to her wooden cottage on a dirty journey outside Anlong Veng.
As the sun began to descend and shadows appeared across the parched grass, Im Chaem refused to speak of her past among the Khmery Rouge.
If the court summoned her, she would refuse to go.
"Miun reigns in Cambodia and it is stable," she said.
"If there are further prosecutions, there will be war."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who defected from the Khmer Rouge in 1978 also repeatedly warned that there would be instability if the court sought out other suspects, even though experts and historians disagree.
"The Cambodia must dig a deep hole and bury the past in it," he said.
But confronting the past is only what Cambodia has to do to move forward, said Chhang Youk of the documentation center.
"Reconciliation in Khmer ratios means gluing together broken pieces," he said.
"It is our duty to put these broken pieces together so that we can understand each other."
The center published the first textbook approved by the Khmere Rouge, the Khmerch Rouge, and is named "The History of the Democratic Cambodia."
It was distributed in Anlong Venga in June as an addendum to the history book of the Ministry of Education, which contains fewer than four parties on the Khmer Rouge.
Like many people in Cambodia, young people in Anlong Veng knew only a few details about the Khmer Rouge, despite the city's association with the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19, a high school student at Anlong Veng said the new textbook helps students understand important parts of their history.
But his parents reacted skeptically when he took home a book to study.
"My family rejects many parts of the textbook and the courts," he said.
"They're suspicious because they're not sure how many people the trial will prosecute."
Such resistance makes the reconciliation process more complex and difficult, said Sok Leang.
But public forums, textbooks and the court are beginning to have an impact, he said.
The Khmer Rouge still have a strong charm here.
Up in the Dangrek Mountains, the Dangrek Mountains is a road overgrown with weeds and dumped in discarded plastic bags that lead to a rectangle of black soot, covered with a rusted tin roof.
The body of Pol Pot was burned here in a pile of tires after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, 31, a cell phone clerk on the side of the road said she didn't know much about the man who was cremated in that spot.
"But he has a strong spirit, many of the locals come here and pray to him," she said.
Nom Sothea had her birthday and planned to visit Pol Pot's resting place later, where she would bring a bundle of ripened bananas in the hope that it would bring her luck.
Belarus agrees to find its uranium-based stockpiles of weapons
In a surprise victory in President Obama's campaign to secure nuclear material around the world, the Belarusian government announced on Wednesday that they would renounce their stockpile of highly enriched uranium, a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The agreement was made public in a joint statement, issued after the Security Summit by Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov.
The US government has spent years trying to persuade Belarus to give up highly enriched uranium and the stumbling block seemed to have been hit by last spring.
But US officials told The Washington Post that in the last two months, a pair of classified operations have been carried out with Belarus to remove 187 pounds of uranium-based weapons from a Belarusian research facility.
This set the stage for Wednesday's agreement to remove the rest of the material - around £500, according to the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because it is a sensitive matter.
The agreement proved to be one of the most important results of Obama's 47th National Nuclear Security Summit in April, at which Belarus was scrapped.
And it was apparently a good move to secure the invitation of the former Soviet Republic to the subsequent 2012 summit.
"I was really fascinated by the fact that they wanted a place at the Nuclear Safety Summit 2012."
"This proves that the process is working," said Ken Luongo, president of the Global Security Partnership, the Nuclear Safety Group.
Clinton called the agreement a "very important, important step" from Belarus.
Obama promised in Prague in April 2009 to secure all sensitive nuclear materials worldwide within four years.
Since then, the U.S. government has helped six countries to get rid of all its stockpile of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will be the seventh.
The country's Tucet did so under the administration of George W. Bush.
At the time of the Obama Summit on Nuclear Safety, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko announced that his nation would never give up its uranium.
"We have highly enriched uranium - hundreds of kilograms of what is basically the basis for a weapon and less enriched uranium," Lukashenko said afterwards.
"It's our commodity...We're not going to make dirty bombs, and we're not going to sell it to anyone."
"We only use it for research purposes, that's all."
Nevertheless, Belarus joined the United States a few months ago and signaled an interest in reaching an agreement.
The first commitment to remove Belarusian uranium in October was particularly complicated because the material was slightly irradiated, officials reported.
It was loaded onto a special train that traveled more than 1,300 miles to a Russian storage and disposal facility, officials said.
The second operation was closed on Monday and was carried out by air, officials said.
The US government spent $13 million on the program, most of it on the supply of a Belarusian research institute less enriched uranium, which is not suitable for nuclear weapons production.
"Everything was coordinated very carefully and controlled by trust," which led to the agreement signed by Clinton, said Andrew Bieniawski, an official at the Department of Energy working for Global Threat Reduction.
This year, the James Martin Martin Center for the Study of Nuclear Non-Proliferation, estimated that Belarus had at least 88 pounds of uranium used to produce weapons.
According to the Joint Statement, Belarus will seek to withdraw its stockpiles by 2012.
Relations between Belarus and the United States have been strained for years, mainly due to Lukashenko's cruel repression of human rights.
But Wednesday's statement suggests the possibility of gradual melting.
"We welcome progress on these global security issues, the United States and Belarus have recognised that more rigorous respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains the basis for improving mutual relations and this is essential for the progress of the country and its people," he said.
The Spanish government has not made a stand-up for CIA flights
The Spanish government was not at a cost to the Canadian flights carrying the imprisoned talibans and members of Al-Qaida to Guantánamo via Spanish territory, as the United States envoy to Madrid said in his telegram.
This is the implication from the documents provided by the Wikileaks server to El País, where it is also reported that then-Froneral Premier María Teresa Fernández de la Veg asked for the Spanish executive to be informed and "so that it could show that it has the proper surveillance of foreign aircraft by passing through Spanish airspace."
In June 2006, following a communication from the Council of Europe, in which a dozen states, including Spain, were accused of complicity in human rights violations, a meeting took place between the ambassador of the US, Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega.
The deputy prime minister said the message from the Council of Europe "dismissed the Zapater's Government out of the game" and insisted that Spain had nothing to hide in the matter.
De la Vega stressed that Spain has no problem with secret service flights through its territory.
"They simply want to be informed so that they are not "fished unprepared," Aguirre tells one of the documents.
The then Secretary of State, Miguel Ángel Moratinos, also suggested to the US ambassador that the Spanish government "wanted to give the matter the lowest possible outlines, but by the fact that the matter was in the hands of the judges, the cabinet had limited possibilities of influence."
In February 2007, prosecutor Vicente González told the Embassy that, as far as he was concerned, he had no intention of blocking the judge's initiative to request the declassification of documents from the National Intelligence Center (CNI) and the Ministry of Defence concerning CIA flights.
"This information contains no of the incriminating file or any sensitive information," the Embassy explained after talking to the prosecutor.
However, the US has expressed concerns for" manifest coordination between the Spanish judge and the German prosecutors" than to declassify CNI or the Ministry of Defence.
"This coordination between independent experts will complicate our efforts to address this case discreetly between governments," regrets Aguirre.
In March 2007, on the occasion of the lunch of US Ambassador and Interior Minister Alfred Pérez Rubalcaba, he told this ambassador that "although Spanish judges are very jealous of their independence and will do what they think is appropriate," he has already instructed his coworkers to "excite up to the uproar comments with the intention of reducing the tensions."
The ambassador also expresses his concerns about the actions of the political party Partido Popular (PP; Czech Republic).
"Despite her widespread pro-American orientation, our experience tells us that the Partido Popular party will not hesitate to take advantage of any hints that the Zapatera government has tolerated or intentionally ignored US actions that could be interpreted as possible a violation of human rights, even if these revelations could have negative consequences for the United States government," he notes.
Confirmed mother-in-wrenching woman complained on the network on maternal "game"
The young woman spoke of the child when it was already dead and had her blog: "Teror after gallequin"
Mónica Juanatey Fernández calls herself "Muki" on the Internet.
with this nickname, which she had used since she was a child, she communicated with her cousin and at least one friend; both of whom are from the village of Noia in the area of La Coruňa, from which the young woman is from.
The news is from 2008.
In order to be understood, it is necessary to know the woman's emotional life, which is reconstructed by the ABC daily with the help of the testimony of her family members.
A 30-year-old woman from Galicia entered into a relationship with industrialist Iván Túnez in 1998.
They dated for a year.
Shortly after they broke up, she found out she was pregnant.
The man wanted to know if the newborn child was his, but his ex-girlfriend never had his own DNA tests done.
Soon she found a new acquaintance.
Her chosen one was Alberto, a young man from the nearby town of Lousame.
Their coexistence took a long time.
Little Caesar lived with them.
When the girl left for a job in the Balearic Islands, the little one stayed with her partner, who even came to see her for a week at the Palma.
However, the content of her communication shows that the relationship has broken down.
In March 2008, she is alone at Menorca, writing, "Alberto is some angry that I left for work."
"When I told him, it seemed good, but now he realizes that he has to be with the little one all day and can't do what he wants."
Then he talks about the text message she just got: 'I want you to come back this month or give me an address to send you the child'.
He complains: "If he doesn't like me leaving the little one with my mother, I'll marry him when I come back," he claims.
in May he talks about his return to his residence: 'I'm going to go there this week, but I'll only stay until the 19th, '20s, because I have to go for a job so I don't miss the job'.
He explains that if all goes well, he will take his son in with him.
"He'll be with who she's supposed to be with, with me, and it's never going to happen again that I'd leave him with someone else besides my mother," a dubious intention given her bad relationships.
there's another post in July.
When he taps out this report, it is assumed that the child who arrived on the island on the first day of this month, and was probably murdered, is already dead.
"César is satisfied on the one hand, but on the other hand he is not."
"On the one hand he's with me, and he kind of likes it here, but on the other hand, he goes to school almost every day."
He's talking about moving to Mallorca.
"He'll go there (son) to summer school, so I'll save a little money for a nanny."
Seventeenth regards and complaints.
"A big kiss from Caesar who asks me when you're coming."
"Alberto says he sent you I don't know what videos on your email, look at the way he wants, he's meeting with me, sex is needed."
Thirty-fifth next message: 'The boy is well, he goes to summer school to learn Catalan's.'
There is also one report about Víctor, the current partner: "He gives me money."
On the internet, Mónicca's posts are on blogs devoted to anime and mango.
She even had her own on MySpace, now revised, where she called herself "Muki ex-Rubbad."
"Teror after galicius (motto) ".
The last man with whom she lived, the guard, expresses his pity and feels guilty.
He doesn't want to believe that everything would have happened because she hadn't told him she was a single mother.
Mónica entered the provincial penitentiary in Palma yesterday, where she arrived from the Menorca detention centre.
The defense attorney, Carlos Maceda, said the defendant did not remember how everything happened and "that she had no intention of harming the little one in any way."
Earlier, however, she admitted that she had drowned Caesar in the bathtub and placed his body in the trunk.
Both the defense and the prosecutor are requesting a psychiatric evaluation.
The People's Party would win 4 seats in the House and the PSC (Socialist Party of Catalonia) would lose 9 seats
with the results of 28 November, the PP side could have the lead at the town halls in Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona.
After a significant increase in votes won and the number of experienced MPs during the recent autonomous elections, the Catalan PP (Katalanska's Peoples) already has a given idea of the general election, whether or not there is an increase, its prospects are more than positive, as the number of votes in the national elections is usually one of those compared to the Catalan elections.
In 2008, the Catalan People's Party won the general election by 610,473 votes, while in the autonomous elections of 2006 it was only 316,222.
Last Sunday, the PPC (Katalan People's Party) received a vote of 384,091 votes.
If this tendency of upward, supported by the PSC's transfer of votes and the loyalty of the PP voters, the party's analysts calculated that if the general election was held, PPC could win 12 members in the House as opposed to the current 8, CiU party (Convergencia i Unio, Czech Republic and Union).
These calculations would confirm that Catalonia is of fundamental importance for the PP and PSOE (Spanish Socialist Workers' Party).
According to this Peoples' Peoples' Analysis, the ERC (Left Republican Republican Party) would lose one MP - it now has 3 - while the JGA's (Green Initiative for Catalonia) would continue to have one mandate, or won another one.
However, according to the election calendar, the next appearance will be held in May 2011 on the occasion of the municipal elections, where the People's Party could also have a decisive influence on the end of the Socialist dominance in the four main provincial cities, as well as the changes in the Barcelona Council (Diputación de Barcelona), which is one of the administrations with the largest projected budget - 661 million euro for 2011.
Both the nationalists and the Peoples agree with the possibility that the PSC could lose the town halls in Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, where the Socialists would not receive a majority and would not be able to turn to their traditional allies, the ERC and the ICV parties.
Given the Republican debacle, it would be impossible for the party to lose its representation in the Barcelona City Council - as a minimum of 5% of the vote must be won.
The PP increased the number of votes received in four capitals and could have decisive influence in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
Nationalists believe they could play a major role in the turnaround in Tarragona, where they ruled together with the PP party in front of the current mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros.
in Lérida, the PP won only 500 more votes than the PSC, whose mayor, Angel Ros, has a very good relationship with Marian Rajoy - they met on several occasions during the last campaign.
The Peoples also won at other important town halls such as Badalona, Castelldeels and Reus.
the PP currently has a presence at 34 town halls in Catalonia and would like to create candidates in as many municipalities as possible.
Catalan cell grants Al-Qaeda to thousands of passports
In addition to the seven detained in Barcelona, three more were detained in Thailand
The seven Pakistanis and a Nigerian who had been detained by agents of the General Information Commissioner in Barcelona formed a jihadist cell run from Thailand, which arranged the passports of the Al-Qaeda groups, among whom were also the "Tigers of the Liberation of the Tamil Ílam" or "Lashkar-e-Taiba," with the latter being the author of the bombings in Bombaji, in which 106 people were killed in 2008.
The Interior Ministry attaches great importance to the investigation of the matter, aiming to ensure the weakening of the Al-Qaeda counterfeiting at international level by "Operation Kampai" and "restricting its operational capabilities."
Investigators estimate that this cell could have sent thousands of passports to Thailand within the two years of active Catalonia, where they were then forged and then supplied to groups that form the Al-Qaeda's criminal galaxy so that their "fighters" could travel across borders in Europe and other Western countries with impunity.
This broken cell was not the only active one with the jihada network in Europe, which is why other European police units participated in these investigations in addition to the Thai services, and it cannot therefore be ruled out that there will be no similar interventions in other European countries as the one in Barcelona last Tuesday night.
In connection with this operation (when the Pakistanians Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabranghar, Malik Iftikhhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and Nigerijec Babatunde Agunbiade were detained), another developed in Thailand in which Pakistanis Mohammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt and Thajec Sirianlaya Kijbumrua were capturedng.
It was these men who ran from Bangkok a cell based in Spain and others in other European countries.
The Catalan network, part of which was liquidated in 2009, was stealing, in particular, travel passports from tourists that met the Islamists' demands.
This means that the documents had to belong to the men aged 25 to 45, they had to be valid for several years and be without the visas indicated.
The investigative documents stress that no facts are yet to be known to link the detainees from Catalonia to the assassination in Mumbai, even though the author of these attacks, "Lashkar-e-Taiba," was to be one of the groups that accepted passports stolen in Spain and then falsified in Thailand.
However, it is worth noting that a few days before this assassination, a transfer agency of about $1,000 was sent from Catalonia by a transfer agency, which was "insored" to buy mobile phone cards that were later used by members of the "command" that killed 106 people.
The police have already seized a lot of evidence.
People's Party (PPP) demands from Mas to stop the fiscal agreement
The president of the PPC (Golden Party) party member Alicia Sánchez-Camacho had the opportunity yesterday to present to Arturo Mas in his own terms under which she is willing to support his induction as President of the Generalitat; these terms are identical to those proposed during the campaign, and their priority is to revive the economy and renounce risky businesses such as the economic agreement that the nationalist leader wants to propose during his mandate.
The Speaker of the Catalan Peoples attended a meeting with Arturo Mas with the certainty of the 18 congressional seats received in last Sunday's election, a figure of more than satisfactory to gain popularity, so the CiU candidate needs at least one of the formations making up for the opposition to abstain from voting to take him into office.
The possible consensus with the PP depends on the future alliances that the nationalists would like to keep in the House when the general election is held, but so far the talks on the talks on the previous days by Mas and the rest of the political leaders are in the Catalan spirit.
As for the PP president, to get her support for the inauguration, "she will have to end all the sovereign and liberation speeches," as well as the economic agreement - similar to the one from the Basque Country - which the CiU leader even wanted to vote on in a referendum.
The two leaders would like to slim down the bloated political apparatus of the autonomous administration and reduce inheritance and gift taxes.
Details of the negotiations on Mas's inauguration will be addressed within the PP Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
Mas has already met Joaquin Nadal (PSC), who promised tough opposition, Joan Herrera (ICV) and will meet today with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Riva (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The director of the geriatrics facility assures that the deaths were not due to the "lack of action"
Olot Center's performances do not rule out that their carer killed more than 11 clients
The management of the geriatric center La Caritat de Olot (Gerona) gave a press conference yesterday to describe the damage to the criminal behaviour of Joan Vila Dilmé, a caregiver who - having been employed here in the meantime - killed at least eleven of the elderly in his care.
The director of this senior home, Joan Sala, accompanied by a lawyer at the facility, Joan Canada, announced that "the wish of La Caritat's home would be to be able to bring charges against the culprit" responsible for the killing, but "legality and responsibility oblige us to leave this trial to the appropriate authorities."
In addition to the damage to the reputation that the institution may suffer because it has failed to detect the criminal activities of the carer in a timely manner, the major threat to La Caritat's home is now a major threat to the demands for material compensation, which are already calculated by the legal representatives of the bereaved families.
Joan Vila Dilmé admitted that his first crime had already taken place in August 2009 and that he had not stopped killing since
The judge ordered the exhumation of the eight bodies of the clients of the home for the elderly, suspected that in many cases no doctor had inspected the deceased personally, but that - due to the patients' age and ill health - everything was handled over the phone.
La Caritat resolutely rejected this extreme yesterday through its director, stressing that "lack of action could not in any way be the cause of what had happened."
The legal representative of La Caritat added that " there are no indications in the case that any third party has been wronged except for any third party."
The man dubbed the "Angel of Death" admitted to killing 11 yesterday, clarifying that he committed the first crime on August 29, 2009 and killed a second old woman a month and a half later.
in this case, he caused death by administering an overly high dose of insulin, as opposed to the first case of using a mixture of tranquilisers.
The director of La Caritat said it was complicated to control the access of personnel to medication.
Insulin and a seduce cocktail were probably six out of the nine-seater using to kill patients in their efforts to relieve their suffering.
However, it is only the analyses that are now taking place in the laboratory that should show whether the Villa is lying and actually sought a less cruel death for its first victims or, on the contrary, killed them by filing a lye, as he has already admitted in the case of three women killed between 12 and 17. October.
in La Caritat, they do not believe in the health claims and do not rule out that the number of killed may be higher than he has confessed to, and they justify their behaviour in the various versions given to Vila to the court, knowing that he must change his actions when it became clear that he had killed eight people.
That's why they say they want to be available to the judiciary to illuminate the full scope of this matter.
European Central Bank threatens
Investors reacted sharply yesterday to the threat of European Central Bank President Trichet yesterday, warning that "the markets should not underestimate our ability to react."
Fringe differentials closed with force, and European banks' shares fell by more than 5%.
However, we should also not underestimate the European Central Bank's ability to be wrong - the euro has just risen above critical value.
What happened yesterday is typical of the illiquid market, which, although a downturn, is recovering - thanks to short and very speculative positions.
It will take the investor some time to lose his concern.
A month ago, the European Central Bank quoted us as saying that it would be withdrawn from the liquidity rate today, and it would have to be called off for the fourth time in two years tomorrow.
The Bundesbank requested the termination of the plan to buy the national debt to be ineffective and eliminated all exceptional liquidity measures within the deadline and to leave unrestricted access for only one week.
After the Irish crisis, we expect the liquidity rate to be predicted by 'at least by March' and to comply with the three-month royalty with unlimited access until the end of this trimester to guarantee liquidity until at least in June.
We also hope that they will continue their bond-buying programme and even announce its intensification.
If the expectations created are not, it will re-establish the reaction of the markets from yesterday, and if they continue to blindly continue to withdraw the liquidity rate, God be with us!
It was the same at the congress in May, where they claimed that they had not even considered buying bonds, and the markets collapsed - tomorrow, history could repeat itself.
The European Central Bank must be credible and persistent.
in May, the armored fist announced it on Monday and said on Wednesday that it had already bought many of them, triggering a further collapse of the market.
Yesterday's bidding of one-year bills in Portugal was very poor.
El Tesoro only issued 500 million with 5.28%, compared to 750 million at 4.81% of the previous one.
Which is why the rates in Portugal fell 30 points lower, reflecting a change in the mood on the market that occurred after the words of Trichet.
in Ireland the figures were published represent losses for Allied and the Bank of Ireland.
The estimated amounts represent about 10,000 million in short-term securities and another potential 15,000, with a chance to become private capital by February, otherwise they will be nationalized.
Although Ireland has no credibility, after the problem was not detected by stress tests in July, the sums are acceptable under the auxiliary plan and will help reduce the uncertainty.
However, next Tuesday the government will need to get approval from the new budget by parliament and still does not have enough support, so there is still uncertainty in Ireland.
Angela Merkel has softened the tone of her speech to ease the tension in the face for the next EU top-level meeting on 14 December, at which a political compromise is needed to show that we are the union and we are all in the same boat.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner, while the others would prefer Beethoven's Ode to Joy.
In Spain, the Prime Minister had the opportunity yesterday to present a plan for the measure to be approved at the Council of Ministers on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in autonomous areas and financial institutions, deficit reduction, liberalisation, privatisation, measures to boost employment - sounds like the Four seasons from Vivaldi in the ears of investors.
The dual effect of Trichet and Zapatera explains why the Spanish Stock Exchange rose by 4.5%, twice as much as other European stock exchanges.
Unlike in February, the government's response and the Spanish National Bank were swift and convincing - we are probably benefiting from the surprise effect.
Today we have a key three-year bond bidding, which will be favoured by the Trichet effect, which we hope, is a great demand for it to help dispel the doubts about our refinancing capabilities.
Asking for a rescue plan would be self-sacrifice for Spain.
They would give us the cash we don't need - there are 40,000 million in cash available in El Tesoro, three times more than in March - higher rates, and market access would close with sine die.
However, it is necessary to continue to use the strategy of Cesar's woman - "not only to be that, but also to be that."
We'll do it.
The president of the Eulen group attacks Vega Sicilia's meeting requested by his children
The storm in open conflict in the Álvarez family, the owners of Eulen and El Enebro, is not dingthling.
David Álvarez, the founder of the group, challenges him after being conceived as "completely insignificant," El Enebro's legal conduct planned for the 16th of this month and the requested five of his seven descendants, on which they should try to enforce their majority and seize, with the help of the administrative authorities, the pro-prosecutor of Bodegas Vega Sicilia.
David Álvarez and his sons Jesús David and María José are fine-tuning the legal group for a new chapter in their dispute over the control of part of society.
The founder of the largest business services holding does not seem willing to slacken his dispute over membership in the ruling bodies of El Enebro.
Her administration committee was deposed by five of his seven descendants, who were named leaders during a shareholders' assembly on January 18 this year and whose objection is lodged in the Commercial Register.
The El Enebro group's court hearing, scheduled for the 16th of this month, which was convened by the official of the Court of Commons 2 in Madrid, restored the thunder in the bosom of the Álvarez family.
Applying to the judges is the only legal means to guarantee the convening of the commission until the dispute is resolved.
The final move by Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marty and Elvira Álvarezova Mezquiriz is seen by David Álvarez as "a desperate means of his five children serving through judicial guise and a clear legal deception to strengthen and improve the conduct of January 18, which was completely invalid."
This line of argument will serve as a basis for the justification for the legal challenge to the conduct of this conduct as "completely insignificant."
The protagonists themselves, who are discreetly silent, have already attempted unsuccessfully for the court to convene a hearing in June.
in El Enebro, a group owned alongside other activities by Bodegas Vega Sicilio, it controls seven descendants of David Álvarez with 100% of the capital.
However, the group's founder is demanding a right to use for 51% of the capital, according to family protocols.
This matter is a key issue that the judge will have to decide when hearing the issue of court appeal. The date of this hearing has not yet been set.
Red Bull triumphs in Formula One with a secret weapon from Siemens
The software suggests upgrading in real-time vehicles.
Since Red Bull invaded the Formula One series in 2004, its history in this exceptional world of speed has been characterised by surprise and success.
At first, no one took the options of this newcomer team very seriously, and despite the upward trend of recent times, everyone was betting on the triumph of Ferrari Fernando Alonso.
Without wishing to diminish the riding abilities of the champion, German Sebastian Vettel, or the Renault engine's capabilities that propels his car, a legend has been born in the world of Formula One - the "secret weapon" that the multi-natural Siemens put in the hands of Red Bull to make him a winning team.
In fact, these are powerful software simulating marches that the German company launched in 2007 for the purposes of very remote automotive sport.
The so-called PLM, this powerful software device, was used to design assembly lines in manufacturing plants around the world, in power plants and for high-turmer devices.
Its aim is to faithfully reproduce the product or simulate the process before it is realistically created, thus avoiding unnecessary errors and expense.
PLM facilitated the development of a Canon, Sukhoi aircraft or Nissan's most renowned commercial vehicles.
Siegfried Russwurm, head of Siemens' industrial division, explains that the use of this software device allowed the Red Bull team to make the Red Bull team "within a few hours, in near-real time" of modifications and improvements that otherwise detect themselves during races and trials.
Russwurm says that in 1992, the stables employed an average of 10 technicians who were able to perform a maximum of three or four improvements in a single period.
The Red Bull team now works on 180 young highly skilled professionals equipped with powerful information technology to analyze and design each type of modification of racing vehicles.
The manager at Siemens explained that the PLM software is able to analyse and improve all elements of Red Bull racing vehicles with the exception of the engine for which Renault is fully responsible.
Materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety features are being modified.
Changes can be translated from virtual reality to reality in less than 24 hours thanks to advanced production systems using laser and highly technologically advanced autoclave.
The only limit of this technical conveniency is the $40 million maximum that each Formula One team can spend for each period to improve its competitiveness.
The Red Bull set up a high-tech plant about 50 km from London to design and manufacture its racing cars.
There are two buildings in which visitors are restricted - especially to journalists.
Everything that takes place here is considered a "big secret."
The list of participants in this project consists of 580 people, including two pilots - champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
The hero of Red Bull is the freshman champion Sebastian Vettel without a doubt in Formula One.
But the immeasurable technological means that the energy drink brand has put into its participation in the racing circuits is lurking, with other protagonists whose help is invaluable, and no one knows them.
The head of the manufacturing technology, Steve Nevey, says that five years ago it was possible to say that advances in the research and development of vehicles contributed to a 50% victory, and the rest was due to the riders.
currently the ratio has changed and the technology is worth its achievements of 85%, while the pilots are contributing 15%.
Nevey acknowledges that Vettel or Webber will never be replaced by computing, as they are "unpredictable gladiators."
HP will set up 20 of its own stores over two years in cooperation with local distributors
Hewlett-Packard (HP) in collaboration with its business partner Pont Reyes inaugurated its first exclusive shop yesterday in concert with its business partner.
The company will be the first of a network of 20 stores of 80 to 100 m2 that the multinational company plans to open in Spain in the next two years.
These stores will also be housed in 16 existing department stores such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
The vice president of Spain's HP, Helena Herrer, cited the newly converted shop to Barcelona's Gran Vía, owned by Pont Reyes, with which HP has been working with for 30 years, as an example.
The North American company has set up a plan to set up 200 sales outlets in Europe by 2013, which includes 20 Spanish stores.
The first stores were opened last week in Bucharest (Romania) and in Belgrade (Serbia), so the Barcelona deal is third.
Herrero did not want to reveal where more stores would be opened, but admitted that Madrid could be one of the following locations.
Herrero, who also runs HP's personnel systems, assured that the philosophy of opening stores would always be the same - using local distributors who have the experience and knowledge of the sector.
The North American company advises here with the exclusive design of the equipment of the outlets (with products that can be interactively tested) that will be identical in Europe.
In addition, HP is also involved in providing staff for shops.
Helena Herrer denied that it was a franchising process and stressed that the exclusive network of outlets was aimed at "improving customer service, services to SMEs when buying, service, service, after-sales and even packaging."
The Barcelona trade is part of a world-class pilot pioneer programme to address any problems with computer equipment under warranty.
The online service is linked to the technical centre located in Maastricht (Netherlands).
"Then we'll be able to solve problems in 10 minutes that might take up to two days otherwise."
"This system is designed specifically for small and medium-sized enterprises and for ordinary customers, as large firms already have contractual technical assistance service," Helena Herrerová stressed yesterday.
Sabadell is betting on "stolen" to his competitors a million clients over three years
More optimistic than other bosses, the delegated board member of Banco Sabadell's Jaime Guardiola, believes that 2011 will be challenging for the bank, but rejects the new liquidity crisis and predicts the end of the passive war.
Nevertheless, it envisages a reduction in interest rates, which they will seek to compensate by discounting bank charges and credit prices.
Sabadell expects to raise a million private clients over three years.
Sabadell found a way to take advantage of the next three years to survive in difficult economic conditions.
The Bank will launch a new strategic plan in 2011 with effect for three years.
The aim, in addition to surviving without having to turn to public aid at FROB, to gain market share by capturing a million new private clients - and 700,000, respectively, if those who eventually leave the bank are deducted - as until now, the institute rather cherished small and medium-sized entrepreneurs and large businesses than retail clients.
This year, the bank has already acquired 250,000 private clients and 50,000 businesses.
Its market share is 3.5% for private clients, compared to more than 10% for corporate customers.
Another of the basic ideas of the 2011-2013 plan is a commitment to productivity, or one can also say sober, in order to reduce the costs that the Bank will show the challenges of when it presents the results for the period.
At this time, a few banking institutions are at this time daring to set targets and disclose them, as the financial crisis has changed all the plans for world banking.
Sabadell will close its Optima program this year, set four years ago, although it was originally for three years, but the market situation required an expansion for the next period.
Clients who leave the savings banks will be their main target group.
At the meeting organised by APIE, Guardiola insisted that 2011 would be "heavy and very important."
Indeed, he believes that the road from the crisis in Spain will "will be lengthy."
In addition, it will be "very difficult to create employment" in two or three years, which is fundamental to the survival of the banking sector, he added.
And while he believes that the passive war - which reduces the margins - is giving way, the cost of the risk surcharges that banks and savings banks and savings banks pay for their issues to receive liquidity are already shifting to the prices of loans, offsetting the margin cuts.
"The subject of liquidity and financing is structural and will represent a coercive factor on credit."
"We haven't closed the tap yet, but the differentials are very high," Guardiola acknowledged.
Banesto has already issued orders to its network on Thursday to reduce long-term loans and increase the prices of differentials - see CincoDías on 22 and 27 November.
He also acknowledged that the trend in banking "is now being a reduction in commissions" but is a "competitive framework."
The Sabadell Bank's strategic plan is based on organic growth, but as usual the group does not rule out corporatist operations.
It is not for nothing that he assures that in Spain "more size will be demanded."
"Next year there will be no stone left on the stone," he assured.
It confirms that the needs of capital are "aeriously reduced" and does not preclude any Spanish institution from entering into red numbers.
And it points out that FROB can supple the market for fund-raising before the new capital measure.
After assurances that Sabadell may survive a temporary market shutdown, a serious problem remains what some bankers predict as a new liquidity crisis.
It notes that it is not possible to issue, but unlike what was in June, short-term funding can be received with repo rates, which alleviates the crisis.
CECA rules out the next wave of savings account for the mergers
The CECA CEO rejected yesterday that there should be another wave of savings-folder mergers and again insisted on the speed with which the sector reorganisation is being carried out.
When he started the process of associating Spanish savings banks, there were several institutions that assured that they would not take part in this first phase and wait for the second round.
However, the Director General of the Spanish Confederation of Savings Banks (CECA) José Antonio Olavarrieta yesterday ruled out that a new wave of these operations should be created.
"I believe that most of the merges have already been carried out, the incorporation of Cajasol to the Banca Cívica group cannot be considered as a second round, what is happening is the conventions."
"Most of it is completely implemented; it is possible that instead of 17 institutes we will go to 13 or 14, but all major processes are already ready and under the protection of the National Bank of Spain, which has worked very well together on this matter," the director noted.
In his statements at the ADEA meeting (Association of Aragon Leadens and Executive Officials). Olavarrieta described the concentration process being carried out "at the highest possible speed and we must be very satisfied, as is shown in the repayments that have appeared in the business plans with the Spanish National Bank in its time, not now, in the business plans with the Spanish National Bank," he stressed.
"To go from 45 savings banks with an average asset volume of 28,000 million to 17 with 75,500 million is a process that has no history of comparison, reducing the number of institutions by 62% to make them larger and thus underline in accordance with the Basel Treaty," he underlined.
Olavarrieta acknowledged that "there are a number of not-so-happy views on the slowness of the process" which show "lack of seriousness and understanding" because "it's what the National Bank of Spain is doing is to be at the end of the year."
CECA CEO José Antonio Olavarrieta assured yesterday that Spain has the strictest financial system in all of Europe and "probably" in the world, and attributed to those who question it was "a lack of knowledge."
The director noted that in the current favourable economic situation "we can be calm" about financial institutions and savings banks as well as a system that managed a "very important" concentration process and which continues at "the highest possible speed."
He also recalled that Spanish banking came out very well from the stress tests carried out by the European Central Bank in July.
Zapatero and red German line
Berlin opted to keep the euro, but set the conditions for the whole of the Union.
Tensions in the markets provoked a double government response.
On the one hand, José Luis Zapatero proposed new adaptation measures, from tax cuts for small and medium-sized enterprises, to regulating private brokerage agencies or the abolition of 426 euros for the unemployed without benefits, to the privatisation of 49% AENA (Spanish airports and air traffic management), airport administrators Barajas and El Prat and 30% state lottery.
Vice-President Elena Salgado, with the support of former Prime Minister Felipe González, joined the criticisms of Chancellor Angela Merkel over her responsibility to start the current crisis.
How to interpret these moves?
It should be said in advance that Merkel's position is not a mistake in her communication policy.
On the contrary, it is another point in the complex process of redefinition of the euro.
And here, Germany has a radically new vision of what its future is supposed to be, which alludes to the idea of respecting old traditions adhered to by a large proportion of other members.
In the face of European resistance, there is speculation in Germany of three possible journeys from the crisis.
The first is a strong eurozone, which would include Germany, but also Austria or the Netherlands, for example, while the southern states would leave the monetary zone.
The second is a return to the mark - although it may now appear to be scifi, this version has a broad public support, approaching 50% of the population.
The third option, according to the German proposals, is to revise the euro with more macroeconomic surveillance, budgetary aritness, fines for offending states, possible deferrals of payments for some of them, and with the extension of possible regulatory costs to the private sector.
The German position is clear and has been defined for some time, so there is no room for evicues now.
First, when both the International Monetary Fund and the European Commission were fuelled deficits in 2009, the German government pulled a constitutional reform out of its sleeve to prevent them from happening in 2016.
This was the first sign of contradiction between what Germany thought was right (benex austerity and stability plans) and what its European partners, including France, practiced.
The second was shown by this Central European country, when Merkel painfully dragged out the decision to save Greece.
It was already the subject of harsh criticism, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and the public opinion, which was also published, were strongly against the rescue of Greece.
Finally, in the last days of October, Merkel reappeared with a clear view of the clear mind, demanding that the European Union's conventions be reformed to be allowed to be rescued by a Member State, while at the same time allowing private creditors to be charged with a part of the costs.
This opinion was interpreted as anti-European as it accelerated the Irish crisis and everything else.
However, its proposal, although in a somewhat ablenail form, has been approved, and we should follow the reform process of the Union within the next few months, which should allow for these measures from 2013.
Germany has set out a red line that it does not intend to cross.
And it tells us all that, although measures need now need to be taken that he seems to disagree with too much, the old functioning of the euro will be over from that date.
2013 will represent the birth of a new currency zone in which the rule-breaking states will be severely sanctioned and may be forced to announce the postponement of payments, and the private sector will also have to bear part of the cost.
Germany is suggesting that we need to give us a rigorous path of growth, with an increase in the savings and investment rate, moderate consumption, improved productivity and competitiveness, and capital buffers.
Another option based on claims and building, with huge gaps in the balance of payments that prevailed in the years of the Spanish growth boom, is simply not to be tolerated.
The offer is clear.
And we'd make a mistake if we didn't understand.
This is not just about restoring the public deficit to 3% in 2013.
What they want us to do is much tougher.
And the worst part is that under these conditions, we might be wrong about ourselves.
I hope this current turbulence will be replaced by greater composure.
And that we would take advantage of the opportunity they give us by spring 2013.
Prime Minister Zapatero also seems to have understood this, and his double-declared statement (the reform promised after meeting with the big business last Saturday and the announcement of the new measures yesterday) suggests that, through critics to Merkel, the path has been opened up to the idea that things need to be put right.
But the red line that Germany has set out is here, and it doesn't seem to want to move it.
And out of the options to be considered, leaving the eurozone full of not-so-great-great countries cannot be excluded.
Well, Germany will always be able to tell us that it has warned us.
Sport and circumventing the rules
The phints shown by Alonso and Ramos in the match with Ajax show a wit not an intention to escape the penalty.
The presumed derailments of two players from Real Madrid (Xabi's Alonso and Sergio Ramos) in the Champions League match against Ajax on 23 November caused a sea of ink to be labelled whether or not this was unsportsmanlike conduct, and whether or not UEFA should punish the two footballers.
As is well known, a few minutes before the end of the game (which their team had clearly won) one by one, the players were deliberately wasting their time at the moment when the foul was about to be played to provoke the referee, who showed them a second yellow card.
In this way, both players will meet their prescribed penalty in the next game against Auxerre - with Real Madrid finishing in their group at the top - and be able, cleared of the cards, to continue to the next stage.
In the end, the UEFA Disciplinary Board awarded coach Jose Mourinho a two-game suspension and the offending players were fined in cash.
provoking a yellow card under similar conditions is no new practice, but is more or less common in football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos of football, the rules that are unwritten but watched.
Part of the discussion in this case was due to the fact that its participant was the Real Madrid team (which boasts of generosity and honour in its anthem, and who has already fined his players for similar acts), and, it seems, thanks to a dramatisation led by Mourinho, who is thus adding another episode to his long history as a comedian and provocateur.
in any case, the debate revolves around whether this type of conduct, which is not expressly prohibited by the rules, is contrary to the principles of sport, that is to say, whether these acts circumvent the law are circumvented; these are indeed actions respecting the sporting rules, the meaning of which, however, it seems.
It is being addressed the type of damage of such actions to sporting spirit.
One of the essentials of sporting behavior is the physical sanctity of the opposing players, which has not been violated in these cases, or there has been no violent play.
Another of these formalities characterising the clean game is to avoid players giving the opponent an advantage to their offence because of their misdemeanor - which has not happened here either.
Ironically, then, at the action of the Real Madrid players, the fact that there was no realisation of what we normally characterise as a ruse or circumvention of the law, there was no covert breach of the rules in order to avoid the sanction, but this behaviour should have been as noticeable as possible in order to receive the penalty.
They waited and gladly received the punishment.
But the other question is the benefit of the culprits for their deliberate offence.
It is necessary to state here that the opponent is in no hand at a disadvantaged position, and that he will achieve no benefit in the current match, as the obvious consequence is that the team itself will have fewer players.
Nor is it a useful strategy until the next game, as the club will not be able to count on these players.
The advantage is clearly that the players will start the next phase of the Champions League without cards, which could jeopardise their participation in the future match.
However, this is an advantage from a long-term perspective and with a degree of uncertainty, that is, at first glance, the team can be eliminated, and in addition to this act, the players will be punished, and they will go to the second round of the cards, in which one card is enough to be eliminated than in the first round.
So as the bikes continue, it will not be entirely clear whether this is an advantage.
In short, these negotiations do not go against the sporting spirit, which includes strategic decisions that will make it possible to obtain the maximum benefit within the rules.
in the case we are dealing with here, the players were not to aim to avoid the granting of a penalty (which would be a clear case of circumventing the rules), but rather chose to submit to it.
They made a strategic decision without shunting or running away from punishment.
Although the line between wit and circumvention of the rules is not entirely clear, I believe that this case was clearly a wit.
It seems to me that the controversy arises for two reasons: because it was two self-insolations and the way in which the instruction to provoke them from the management took place.
The damage to sporting principles by these actions is not as ethical as aesthetic.
Fight of offers for hosting Christmas parties in Barcelona
The calendar's dictate will concentrate an avalanche of bookings this year on December 16 and 17.
There is a fast increase in celebrations paid for by the employees themselves, who want to spend between 20 and 30 euros.
Like Turkish honey or lottery, with the arrival of December, the pre-Christmas parties are once again coming in, which still acts as an oxygen bomb for restaurants and leisure facilities in Barcelona, but have resulted in a fight to win clients by lowering prices thanks to the crisis: almost everyone wants to spend 20 to 30 euros on their food, agree the industry's surveyed businessmen and associations from the sector.
To complete the complication of the numbers, the calendar centered this year (when Christmas Eve fell on Friday) the application for the week from 13 December, creating an avalanche of bookings for the days to peak times (16th and 17th), while there was almost no operation in the previous week.
As has been the case since the lean years began in 2008, with many companies that have cancelled collective parties for budgetary reasons.
To keep traditions from leaving, many employees pay their spend at parties out of their own pocket.
Regardless of the situation, many are demanding prices on the verge of bearability, says the president of the association at the Gremi de Restauració de Barcelona, Gaieta Farras.
The patron saint of the restaurant establishments is not deting at the moment to predict what the celebrations will be like this month.
"People will think twice before making the reservation."
"They want to come out, but they are cautious when it comes to the subject of the awards," he adds.
Shops will go well for those "who will offer quality and good service at a favourable price," he says, recalling that the crisis makes customers tend to go down a notch and most of the customer now want to spend around 25 euros.
A survey at various facilities shows that the biggest surge in booking requests is for the evening of December 17.
The Soteras Group is reporting a real boom in reservations this Friday, with the most requirements for spending up to 30 euros, to which they have adapted the offered menus, with total prices ranging from 25 to 30 euros.
in another major company, which is Andilana, comprising 16 facilities in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), the peculiarity of this year's calendar has brought about more early bookings since early November.
"We have done the potential and the impossible to maintain prices from last year, and our menus, from which everyone should choose, ranges from 19.95 to 30 euros," they report.
In the AN Grup group, which includes El Mussol, Attic, QuQu and a total of 23 businesses, they remain optimistic after seeing an increase in profits from the second half of the year and have a relatively solid outlook for Christmas sales.
Sources at the company stress that December 18 will also be a busy day as there will be pre-Christmas celebrations between friends.
to their six group menu, they added a Christmas menu, with a budget of 30 euros or more, as they saw a tendency for guests to spend 10% more in exchange for other items such as cava (Spanish sparkling wine).
They also noted that companies are already appearing to invite their employees, and the size of the groups appears to be slightly larger.
Vice President Fecasarm (which includes institutions such as the Barcelona Bar, Restaurants and Leisure Centres Association) believes that it is beginning to see the end of the tunnel and claim that the number of bookings has "successful" the number of bookings, even though clients "talk to the max."
This impression did not back down even during the Christmas celebrations, to be paid by the person who pays, points out.
Pakistan's nuclear program spawned a major unease in the US
Islamabad produces atomic weapons "at a faster pace than any other country."
The Wikileaks documents confirm the taliban's tacit links and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the United States Embassy in Pakistan and the US State Department released by Wikileaks confirms the extraordinary unrest brought up by the Pakistan's nuclear program in Washington.
In addition to the elucidated and significant details they offer about the content of the communications and ideas of the representatives of North American diplomacy in Islamabad, these documents reveal that cooperation between the two states in terms of nuclear safety, instead of increasing, "is in decline," and that this unstable Asian country produces "more nuclear weapons than any other state."
The peculiarity of Pakistan's nuclear program - that its weapons are not assembled, but are stored after the works to make their destruction difficult to make it difficult to degrade in the event of an attack - is one of the main reasons for Washington's vigilance.
This is calculated by the ambassador to Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson in one report before a visit to then-national security adviser James Jones: "Middle of some nuclear facilities to the territory under the control of the Taliban, the alleged diversion of nuclear materials and the vulnerability of the transport of atomic materials."
The increased number of people associated with the nuclear arsenal and the missile program is no longer only observed by the US, but also by Russia, as propagating and presenting a reason to be on the lookout.
"Pakistan had to hire staff with strict religious faith to protect the nuclear facilities; given the decline of education and culture levels, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people who will work in nuclear programs or missile programs," said expert Yuri Korolev of the Russian Foreign Ministry at a meeting with his US counterparts.
The biggest news of the documentation published by the Julian Assange server is the increasingly lower cooperation between the US and Pakistan on the topics of nuclear proliferation and the increased pace of Pakistani production of these weapons.
Deposits issued by the embassy in May, which qualify for communication with Pakistan as "fruling," claim: "Transparency often does not exist; offers of aid remain unanswered or are rejected."
In another report, Peter Lavoy, a national intelligence official for South Asia, notes that "despite the economic disaster, Pakistan produces nuclear weapons as quickly as any other nation in the world."
Ambassador Petterson is also asking for Washington to make it very clear during a visit by the army's head of the army, Ashfaq Kayani, that "the Pakistani army must put an end to the tacit support of the terrorist groups."
The Wikileaks boss hunt
Obama appoints a high-ranking counter-terrorism worker to avoid new leaks.
Interpol issues a "red challenge" to trace and determine where Assange might be.
Everything about Wikileaks and its founder Julian Assange is a complicated labyrinth where it is hard to be sure of the facts.
Yesterday, Interpol announced an "extraordinary challenge," the so-called red notice, to "localize and track movement" of Assange.
However, this is not a classic detention order.
Moreover, this call is not new, but it dates back to 20 November.
And he has nothing to do with the latest leak of more than a quarter of a million diplomatic documents, but with allegations of sexual abuse that the Australian is facing in Sweden.
In addition, Wikileaks' attorney, Mark Stephens, assures that "the police know where and how to contact Mr. Assange."
It was on November 20 when the International Police Force, based in Lyon, France, issued the order at the request of Sweden, but did not disclose it until yesterday, when it received permission from Swedish authorities.
In this situation, 188 Interpol countries have instructions to identify or locate Assange "with the aim of introducing him to a temporary link and extradite him."
However, although Interpol cannot order the detention of a person to be detained by the red call, many Member States, as the organisation explained, consider the so-called red notice to be able to execute the arrest - this must be ensured by the national police force - especially when the states have a bilateral extradition agreement, as in the case of Sweden and England, where Assange should appear to be.
The move offended Assenge's attorneys, who published writing yesterday claiming that the 39-year-old founder of Wikileaks had shown a willingness to answer questions from the Swedish authorities by videoconferencing.
They also recall that Assenge applied for and subsequently received permission to leave Sweden from the prosecutor of his case, which they compare with the legendary Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, the head of Stalin's security.
"This is a hunt and not a legal pursuit," the letter says.
While the whole world is looking for him - and from Australia his mother defends her son's innocence - Assange is still in an unknown place, but he is silent.
on Monday, from an unknown location, he gave an interview to the editor-in-chief of Time magazine, calling for the resignation of U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
"If it turns out that it was responsible for ordering US diplomats to carry out spying at the UN to violate the international conventions that the United States has signed, it should resign," he said.
His opinion was rejected yesterday by the White House press secretary, Robert Gibbs, who qualified the resignation demand as "ridiculous and absurd."
"I'm not quite sure why we should care about the opinion of the individual who runs the website," he told CNN.
Obama himself has commissioned a senior official responsible for combating terrorism, Rusella Traverse, to prevent further leaks of documents.
President Obama's spokesman's intention to stop adding Assange to the importance contrasts with the views praised by conservative politicians and commentators these days.
Peter King, a member of the congress to chair the National Security Committee in the Lower House from January, asked the State Department to explore the possibility of including Wikileaks among terrorist organisations "so that anyone can be prosecuted and prosecuted who would contribute or otherwise provide assistance to them."
Even further went to Tom Flanagan, an adviser to Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper, who said that Assange should be "killed" to be called off.
"Obama should put a reward on him or use a drone or something like that."
Who did not apologize, was Mike Huckabee, a Baptist priest, a former governor of Arkansas, and a possible presidential candidate.
"Whoever is in the government, the one responsible for the leak, has committed treason, and any punishment other than execution would be too lenient," he said on Fox
Puigcercós seeks peace in the ERC by "snooping" on the follower of Carod
The Republican leader will allow the party a secret ballot to remain.
Huguet proposes a more plural executive and the end of the meeting system.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found a recipe to fight the umpteenth internal revolt in the ERC ranks (Left Republican Republican Party of Catalonia), fruitless due to the loss of 11 deputies and half of the votes.
The party chairman is aware that his gesture for resignation seems insufficient to the supporters of former leader Josep Lluresho-Rawovir, and he also knows that the sector's influence is now as weakened as its leader himself, and that he absolutely cannot do to him as much of a concern as he was with other extinct currents.
That is why the leader of the Left will seek to gain new reviews by winkling to help him brace for the municipal elections.
First, Puigcercós announced yesterday that more than 200 members of the National Committee would be able to make secret words of his stay in office.
Use the ballots, not to raise the hand.
If supporters of Carod want to give the Speaker a penalty vote, they will be able to do so without fear of retaliatory measures.
In fact, the boss wants to avoid the split and subjugate his person.
He argued in several interviews that he would not consider himself confirmed with half the vote and one more, but added, without specifying the percentages, that it would not be a good result "for Bulgarian" either.
Supporters of Carodo are asking the chairman to do more than make his post available - which they see as a gesture that has no weight, as Puigcercós controls the largest organ at the conventions.
But with not having enough of a majority to force resign, they will try to recall the executive's plan from now until May.
Because of this, they expect to participate in the drafting of a strategy reorientation document that the management will give the national council's vote on the national council on the 18th of the month.
Their aim is to support Puigcercós in exchange for this promise to move the congress as early as autumn 2011.
The ERC leader said that "multi-vote" harmed stability, and that his goal was for the organization to be able to wash its dirty laundry behind closed doors once and for all.
in this context, the article that the current advisor, Josep Huguet, has signed on his blog, seems to be symptomatic.
After taking into consideration by Puigcercós's ideologue, this innovation adviser took the fait accompli that the leader would be confirmed by the "in exchange for several goals."
And he named five of them, two of which stand out.
The first is to "overcomplige" the executive to represent at least 90% of the members, which also means including new faces who are from a sector in favor of Carod.
The second goal can be a big news.
Huguet proposes that the ERC should put an end to the meeting as a working mechanism.
And so he is fighting to reform the statutes in order to hold congresses through the delegates selected by the vote.
The end of the model of the meeting system, the exemption in the Spanish political party system, is the intended goal of the Puigcercós team, which has fought in this direction at the last two congresses.
However, the convulsive assembly of 2008 decided that the meeting must be assessed at a special congress on the reform of the statutes.
This matter is still pending, as the situation within the party has discouraged a solution to this matter.
Now, without the lurking critical sectors, it might be a good time to revisit the matter and try to close it once and for all.
23 murdered for the month of November; 390 for 2010
According to MILENIO, Mexico has seen a decrease of 4 cases compared to 2010.
During November, 23 people were killed in Mexico, four fewer than in the previous month, according to the daily MILENIO.
Among the murders, the cases of three women and the discovery of a pair of separate bodies in the Valley of Mexico stand out.
in the penultimate month of the year, Mexico has a total of 390 kills, probably linked to organised crime.
Among the cases, the discovery of a corpse in San Diego de los Padres Cuexcontitlan, in the district of Toluca, stands out.
The victim suffered at least three gunshot wounds, a coup d'etat to the head, and her arms and legs were bound by a rope.
The next day, the body was found in a trunk that was stored in the luggage compartment of the vehicle over Mixtecas Street, in the colony of Santa Cruz Acatlán, in the district of Naucalpan.
Early in the morning of Thursday, November 4, the co-cooperative discovered a body carrying signs of torture and at least three fatal missiles in the chest at the Tenango-Ixtapan de la Sal in the section of the Villa Guerrero district.
Next to the body was a report signed by the probably criminal organisation La Familia Michoacana.
A day later, a man in Nezahualcóotl was murdered with eight shots after he left his home and wanted to start collecting garbage.
On November 7th, two victims, aged 30 in the San Pedro Xalaxtoc Colony, Ecatepec County, were killed by a bullet in the head.
in Chalco, on a secluded road in El Naranjo, the corpse of a man shot to the forehead was found, and a shell casing from a 15-caliber weapon was found under the body.
in Ecatepec, parts of the human body were found in the sewage drain in the Playa Golondrino colony.
The rescuers carried out a thorough search for other parts of it, but they were not found.
The residents of the Temototlana reported the discovery of the body with their hands tied back and their heads wrapped in the place of Pena Colorado.
The man had a shot from a firearm on the back of his head.
in the middle of the month, the murder of two men who were packed in the bed underwear and left in the luggage compartment of the vehicle in the Villas de la Hacienda district of Atizapán de Zaragoza was reported, and there were also reports of death threats against the victims.
A day later, she was found in the Valle de los Reyes colony in the Los Reyes district of Los Reyes La Paz a cardboard box that contained a human head.
in the nearby colony, the rest of the body was found, wrapped in a black plastic bag, with a message from the El Incorreregible.
The seventeenth were found to have two dead women wrapped in bed linen in the settlement of Zoquapan in the district of Ixtapaluca, and the next morning a man was found in the Huixquilucan, wrapped in a yellow-moderate sheet, which was identified as Mario Ríos, according to a report by the killers left by his body.
in Ixtapaluca, a woman was found in the San Francisco settlement of life with two blows to the back of her neck.
The skin of the woman was discovered on the skin of the sacred figure of Santa Muerte (literally "The Sacred Death"), as well as necklaces with a likeness of her likeness.
At the end of the month, a man's corpse was found in the car in the village of Zinacantepec with at least a third gunshot wounds and a report signed by a criminal group.
Two days later, the bodies of two men were found wearing a head wrapped in tape and were also found in the village of Puente de Piedra, in Santiago Tepatlaxco.
For the victims, the report was probably written by one of the criminal organisations, which read: "This will happen to those who do not adapt."
Two bodies were found in Ecatepec, bearing signs of torture and bound with limbs bound, inside an abandoned taxi behind the Justice Centre in the San Agustín Colony.
On the last day of the month, the remains of two men were found in the districts of Los Reyes La Paz and Nezahualcóotl.
The first of these was beheaded and found in the colony of Cuchilla Ancón and was wrapped in black plastic bags, tied with tape, and had a message retained; while the second was tortured and was found in a plastic container in the streets of Colonia Juárez.
Along with him, the agents found a note with the message.
China adherents its goal of reducing greenhouse gases
At the UN climate change conference, a representative of this country assured COP16 that his country had made an extraordinary effort to reduce the carbon footprint, clarifying that he insisted on his promise to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45% by 2020.
China will keep its promise to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45% in 2020, Su Wei, the country's representative at the UN climate change conference, assured.
In his first public appearance at the 16th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, Su Wei assured that his country had made immense efforts to reduce the carbon footprint and transform it into its industry.
He said his country has already invested $245 million over the past four years in efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
But he said that China would not change its goals and would continue to work on this with the international community.
He reported that China's climate change strategy was being divided into the following four items: dialogue, capacity building, institution-building and supporting pilot programmes.
On all these points, they have already made progress, including last year's approval of the new Energy Act, which includes the proposed targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, he explained.
He also stressed that in China, federal authorities had cooperated in a coordinated manner with provincial and local authorities to achieve their goals in terms of energy saving, efficient use of energy and emissions reduction.
Furthermore, as he has said, various years of plans are being carried out or have already been completed, funded by both the Chinese government and the governments of other nations.
For example, it is, as it has said, the Energy Efficiency Programme, which has been in place over the last five years, and has received investment from the UN, the government and the private initiatives.
There is also a provincial climate change project, a project to exchange fluorescent lamps for energy-saving light bulbs and a mitigation and adaptation project, he clarified.
At the same table, Martin Krol, the country's expert adviser on climate change, assured that China's efforts were greater than widely thought.
For example, he has described, greenhouse gas emissions per capita represent 6 tonnes in China, while in the United States it is 100 tonnes; China is responsible for 9% of the historical share of emissions.
It has also made unprecedented efforts to use energy - for example, it has increased energy efficiency by 20% over the last five years and expects to make further progress by 2020, he added.
The enamel of the exclusion of Espina: César Nava
The national chairman of the PAN party (Partido Acción Nacional, Czech National Action Party) said that the former chairman of the party was entitled to demand to the National Order Commission of the Law.
The National President of the PAN party, César Nava Vázquez, assured that the exclusion of Manuel Espina Barriens had been enacted and that the former chairman of that party was entitled to contact the National Order Commission to demand his right.
said in an interview that was made before the State's challenger was raised by the state's governor, Gabon, Cué Monteagud, that the exclusion of Espin was in any event a decision taken at the local level.
"This is an autonomous decision of the State Committee in Sona."
"Man Espino has the right to turn to the National Council's Order Commission in his case by complaining that it should be a decision taken by the competent authority," he added.
He further explained that now was not the time to think about 2012, and that she had never been at the negotiating table for the chairmanship of the alliance.
Nava Vázquez expressed his belief that PAN would emerge from the internal elections held on the following 4 and 5 December, in which his successor will be elected, strengthened.
"This (Alianance in 2012) is a topic that has never been at the negotiating table, at least not for the time being, it was the intention for the local elections that was successful and fulfilled its purpose," he said.
The president of the PAN said there were 71 years of dialogue behind his party and therefore "we are not alarmed by internal competition, on the contrary, we are benefiting from it and strengthening us," he added.
He said the committee could, without question, elect the best chairman or chairwoman, whom the PAN deserved for the next three years, so he would hand over the relay to "whom the committee appoints."
"So I am absolutely calm and relaxed, to hand over the office of party chairman to any of the five with pride."
He predicted that the rise the party had seen in the last elections of July would be reflected in future races, although "there is still no time to think about 2012."
"Now it is necessary to accompany the governor, Gabon Cué, in this task."
In this context, he stressed that the three governments, rooted in the alliance in the Oaxation, Pueble and Sinaloe, would be a flag and would be subject to observation across the country, as "many expectations and desires are embedded in them, and I am sure that Gabon will live up to these expectations."
When we asked him about the critics of President Felipe Calderón by the PRI (Partido Revolucionario Institucional, Czech Revolutionary Institutional Party, ed. for) because of his speeches in the four years he governs, César Nava called on PRI members to think about the six-year terms of former presidents Ernest Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
"If the PRI believes that the governments of Zedillo and Salinas were better than the governing of Fox and Claderón, then let them start defending them, to come out of their shell," he agreed.
He argued that the head of the federal executive branch had the right to express himself as he did during his speech at the National Auditorium, as gagging or censorship is not used in that country.
Obama promotes Twitter bill to support undocumented students
"If you think that passing the Dream Act is the right thing to do, let your senators know and pardon this bill," the US president tweeted on a popular social network.
President Barack Obama today, with a post on his personal Twitter account, joined the national mobilization to support the Dream Act, which should legalize students without documents.
"If you think that passing the Dream Act is the right thing to do, let your senators know and pledge this bill to pass," Obama tweeted.
His short report draws attention to an online link to a more comprehensive document that asks the public to contact the senators immediately as the vote on this bill is imminent.
"Since the vote is expected to take place soon, now is the moment, to let your opinion be heard," he points out.
The report was released after 42 Republican senators threatened to block the passage of any law unless the extension of the Bush-era tax cut and the government's funding was approved.
Such a blocking, which was announced by a letter signed by 42 Republican senators, could influence the vote on the Dream Act and other projects, such as the ratification of the new treaty with Russia against nuclear proliferation, called START.
When asked about the Republican blocking of the Dream Act and other proposals, the presidential spokesman said he believed that once the fiscal issue was resolved, a calendar could be drawn up for the rest of the projects.
"I believe there's still plenty of time to do..."
"We all agree that we must resolve the tax issue before the end of the year ..."
I believe that we can reach an agreement on this at some point and then we will be able to plan the order of other matters," he said.
Democratic Majority Leader of the Senate, Harry Reid, announced on Tuesday that he would ask for a "vote to close the debate" on the Dream Act, so the proposal to legalise undocumented students could be voted on in the Senate from next Thursday, though next week is more likely.
The Senatorial Approval of the Dream Act, or the "U.S. Dream" Act, would legalize the roughly 800,000 young people who arrived in the United States before the age of 16, have resided in the country for the past five years, and have been admitted to an institution of higher education or the military.
But supporters need 60 votes to approve the motion, which is why they need the help of several Republicans, so his adherents' organizations are conducting an intensive agitation to ensure the passage of this bill.
The Democrats, whose majority of the Dream Act support, have 58 mandates.
However, at least one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, said he would vote against it, and only one Republican, Richard Lugar of Indiana, expressed his support for the law.
That's why Senators need to win several Republicans in case other Democrats decide to reject the proposal.
Among the Republican senators with whom the supporters negotiate the most, are Senators from Maine Olympia Snowe and Susan Colins, as are outgoing Florida Senator George Lemieux, who completed Senator Melo Martínez's mandate.
Other Republicans who supported the Dream Act in the past are Orrin Hatch of Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas, but they said they would not support it next time.
Another Republican who supported the proposal, John Mccain, has not yet commented at this point.
Although the House of Representatives is inclined to another version, according to a majority of analysts, the Dream Act will face the biggest obstacles in the Senate.
with literature, they put their finger in the wound ("poner el dedo en la llaga", translated "put your finger in the wound" is the equivalent of the Czech "to hit the cloves on the head).
The second round of the cycle Pleasing to the Language was a promenade where the participants performed a literary gala
"I understand that with Sex in the language, but... Finger to the wound? What is expected of me?", asked the writer Luisa Valenzuel, who was invited to start the second round of Pleasing from the Language, a cycle that celebrates literature written in Spanish, and whose question was used as a subtitle on this occasion (at another trade fair, they addressed the theme of Sex in the Language at the Round Table, she explained).
The finger into the wound "takes us into the pitches," the Argentine-born novelist said to the audience, composed mostly of young people who met at the Guadalajara International Book Fair to hear this round-table debate, moderated by Marisol Schultz, and with the participation of Valenzuel, Sergio Ramirez, Mayra Monter and Luisa García Monter.
Luisa Valenzuel read the text she gave to Gonzal to Celoria, which Schultz then described as a great story in which Luisa first appeared as the protagonist who, in search of the knowledge of what "home" she goes from doctor to doctor, from doctor, from which she receives answers, though the clues of the same story do.
From the infectolog, the convinced person goes: 'patience is not my strong suit, maybe it will be my shot'.
Finally, after the frustration with a traumatologist who took her breath away in the middle of the road, but explained that the blow was not a scientific term, he was a psychoanalyst who would reveal the secret: "the gate is really open and the symbolic is the scar."
The protagonist sighed in a lightest, concluding that "she had only learned so much about the blow that she was really open and that she did not exist," but she became convinced that the pleasures and pitfalls in the language had to go hand in hand with each other.
The writer Valenzuel played with both.
Nicaraguek Sergio Ramírez also made a look at the adorable narrative, which he called Pravála in Invention, in which the finger is not named in the wound, but appears at one point.
with elements of magical realism, it tells of a glorious witch who played the clouds, brought back people who had gone far, or corrected the honesty that a virgin had lost, this narrative, which was then reversed to be spoken by America, a great novel in which, from the beginning, his own chroniclers who told him, were not absent, and is quoted as being quoted by the Bernal Díaz del Castillo, who criticizes the exaggeration in the narration of the conquerors.
"Cervantes, who invented us all (the writer), mocked the fake testimony that was presented in the stories as real, but in other ways it was never possible to tell the story of America with such pictorialism that lacked even shame."
However, he stressed, "they are fools and liars who have a greater imagination" and precisely where the reality and the lie blends, where it is no longer known what of the story belongs to one group and what to the other, fictional literature reaches its climax.
He calls it a truly "Cervant tradition."
"Thanks to his legacy, we have what we have."
Subsequently, Mayra Monter emphasized and praised the variety of interpretations that the invitation to the International Book Fair with her sanging The Finger to the Shot allowed.
The Cuban-Pomortical Writer has pointed her finger at the great blow of social violence that passes through her country - and is shared by Latin America - and is the result of trade disputes and drug sales.
"I think that good literature, good poetry and good songs conclude a quiet compromise that is not intended, of course," she said, after stating that the reality of literature is the communication and dimension of the compromise that is created between the author and the readers - and in their "chemical reaction."
The evening was concluded by the Spanish poet Luis García Montero, whose performance also emphasized "on this finger in the wound of a writer-bound writer."
He said that in a world that lives in a hurry, also in intellectual customs and the control of consciousness, which is brimming with dogmatisms, it is forgotten "that behind each affirmation there is a small no, and behind every denial there is also a little yes."
"To be the masters of our thoughts and realities, we must color: and to colour means putting your finger in the wound many times and harassing those individuals who are much more comfortable, because they think in cartoons, in black and white, in fixed ideas and without colour, and also to annoy the authorities who prefer this black-and-white world," he said to promote the meaning of writing.
Romano goes for his first title
Rubén Omar Romano has three defeats in the final, having experienced both good and bad during his career, but has already achieved on three occasions on a crucial series.
in the duel of Santos Laguna and Monterrey in the final, two different styles collide with their techniques, teams that have a noticeable difference in results between them.
Rubén Omar Romano has three defeats in the finals, having experienced both good and bad during his career, but has been able to reach the decisive series on three occasions, but until now he has left with nothing but to now, and that is why this chance is extraordinary for him.
The Argentine had to settle for the silver medal, remained a step behind the winners and curiously played the following final with the same team.
As a coach, the Santratic strategist reached his first final in the Apertura 2002 tournament when he had the reins of the Morelia club, with whom he lost 4-2 overall to Tolucca; then, in the 2003 Clausura tournament, he again advanced to the decider and also lost to a total score of 3-1, which was against Rayados.
Already with Santos Laguna in the 2010 Torneo Bicentenario tournament, again against the "Devils" of Toluka, Rubén again suffered a defeat, although his team played against the "Dedes" (the club's other nickname Deportivo Toluca - re-runner-up after 210 minutes of the game, drew a tie 2-2, after a series of penalty shootings he came into the advantage of three to one and had two opportunities to seal the title, but in the end his three players missed from 11 steps and the team thus suffered a turnover to 4-3.
Rubén has already lost two finals against the "Red Devils" of Toluka and one against Monterrey, his future rival, he would like to avoid the same fate and get rid of the curse, and he was able to celebrate the title for the first time, though he says the most important institution for him.
"I want to come out as a winner, I don't want to break statistics, this is for the club, for the passion that I am bound to, and the title would be for me, of course, but the first one is the most important", the coach commented when he was asked about the numbers that speak against him in the final.
has a live memory of the previous final, in which, as he confirms, he learned a lot, "we learned the lesson that until the referee doesn't clip the end, we can't celebrate, we have to be ready for action, as well as the players, because last time with two penalties, we were already ready to run out to celebrate, and I think we have learned this in this, we cannot celebrate until the game is over.
He is not concerned that this series could be decided in the penalty shootout, he trusts his players: "You never try to come to a series of penalty kicks, you try to end up in a normal time, but sometimes there is no other option and it is necessary to be prepared for it, we were prepared in the last tournament, but unfortunately fate has prepared for us a bad move, perhaps because of the nerves or anguish we felt when the title was in our hands, but we lost it, that left us in something and hope that this will not happen this time."
Romano has a chance in his hands to stop being the other and taste for the first time the fame that the titles bring.
United States changes visa granting rules
People will have to turn to the centre of the Services for visa applicants before the interview in the Consulatory department; the costs will be lower and the waiting time will be reduced.
From 10 January 2011, the visa-taking process at the U.S. Embassy and consulates will be changed.
with the new procedure, the majority of applicants will have to contact the Services Centre for visa applicants (accomercacked from English: ASC) before the interview at the Consulary Department.
The staff from the ASC will withdraw the biometric information of the applicant and they will be evaluated by the Consulary Department before the interview.
The new procedure will have certain advantages, which are the following:
The total cost of processing the visa will be lower, no longer to be payable for the meeting to be agreed, the second for the processing of the application and the next for the delivery of the document by the transport service.
The applicant will pay only one fee to cover all three services.
The current tariff will remain unchanged: an amount equivalent to $140 for a tourist visa, $150 for visa cases with applications (including temporary workers' visas) and $390 for a visa for traders and investors.
People who want to renew their visa will not have to interview the consulator with the consulator, but will only contact the nearest ASC, where they will present their documents and take their fingerprints.
As the biometric information will be taken to ASC, applicants who will require a second meeting with an interview at the Consulatory Department will spend a shorter time here than in the past.
Likewise, those who will apply for a visa at the consulates in Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo will no longer pay an extra fee for the $26 service.

NASA announces discovery of extraterrestrial life
The U.S. Space Agency has called a press conference for tomorrow to present a discovery that could cause a break in the search for extraterrestrial life.
The United States National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) will announce an astrobiological discovery tomorrow, Thursday, that could corroborate the theory of the existence of extraterrestrial life.
The discovery will be presented tomorrow at 1 p.m. by experts in astrobiology, science that studies the origins, evolution, dissemination and future of life in space, at a press conference at NASA's Washington headquarters.
When it invited journalists, NASA assured that it would present "the sight that would cause a break in the search for extraterrestrial life," sparking speculation from experts from other countries.
The discovery could confirm the theory that there are, in addition to us, other creatures living in inhospitable conditions that were considered uninhabitable, and who might represent the possibility that they would one day become intelligent creatures like humans, if the conditions in which they live improved.
To appear, it is a microbe found at the bottom of Lake Mono in the Yosemista National Park in California, where it lives in an environment that was considered too poisonous for any form of life, as the lake is rich in arsenic.
The creature is somehow using the arsenic to live, and it is this ability that makes it more likely that a similar life could exist on other planets that have no atmosphere like the atmosphere on Earth.
According to astrobiologists, if these organisms use arsenic in their metabolism, it will be proven that "there is a different, second form of life, different from the one we know."
The space agency will announce the real reach of the discoveries at tomorrow's press conference.
The conference will be attended by geobiologist Pamela Conrad, who studies the possibility of living on Mars; the biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists who explores Titan (Silton's Greoplong's Greop) with the prospect of its chemical composition being similar to Earth.
PRD, PT, Covergencia and Patrón produce opposition "block"
Reforms of the Constitutional Law on Congress lead to the arrival of "Bipartism," they claim.
The 60th parliamentary term was not even opened when an opposition bloc, led by members of the PRD parties (Partido de la Revolución Democrática, Czech "Partrana of the Democratic Revolution" - note for the course), PT (Partido del Trabajo, Czech for "Prana práce" - ed."Bibipartism" to the House.
Before the start of the session for the opening of the 1960s parliamentary term, Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez of the Convergencia, Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza of PT, Javier Corvera Quevedo of the PRD and Patrón Montalvo "done" against the reform of the Constitutional Act as it eliminates them.
With this reform, they reiterated, "Bapartism" begins, because now it will be two people from the same number of parties who will control Congress.
These four MPs, together with Gloria Margarita Santos Aquilare, the PRD coordinator, were the only ones who voted against the Council, led by Salvon López by the PAN (Partido Acción, Czech for "National Action Party" - re-pays) and Luis Cárdenemem Fonseca as vice-president.
Corvera Quevedo said that these reforms institutionally form a political marginality at the instigation of the PRI (Partido Revolucionario Institucional, Czech "Revolutionary Institutional Party") and PAN.
He specified that during the coming days they would speak to the representatives of the PAN and PRI parties to modify the scheme on the basis of political will, and if they do not have it, they would again be subjected to these two parties, thus ending the opposition coalition.
"When I came here (the opposition coalition), I look at it, because we are excluded from any decision, even have no willingness to consider the opinion of others."
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez, said by Convergencia that they were aligning with the PRD, PT and Patrón and therefore forming a pluralistic group.
It is impossible to allow, he continued, that Congress, after being monopoly, that is now "duopon-special."
The airator of the reform of the law is not to have endless bipartism in Congress.
This group begins with five lawmakers, and its members are now talking with other colleagues to get more votes, as Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez added.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza explained to the PT that currently Congress has become a "rogue" of two - in reference to the PAN and PRI parties.
"It was previously controlled by only one side, today it is divided by two."
Patrón asked Montalvo to respect the personality of the MP, to be given a seat at the negotiating table.
"For the five Members, of which there are likely to be nine, but they see us in the five at the moment, not to stay away because of the vaulted agreements, each in a different faction, to unite to find a seat at the negotiating table, as the problem is that we are standing off the reform they have formed and agreed to, and we do not agree with this reform."
Another 200,000 pesos are issued for the "supplier"
The town hall in Mazatlán will pay for another cheque discussed to the owner of the company supplying the electric thermal.
Another check for a little more than 200,000 pesos was sent to Lorena Guadalupe Camacheus Palazuelos by City Hall.
This will be paid in this second half of the year to the owner of the company supplying the electric series to 1,200,000 pesos.
According to the transparency page of the town hall, this last cheque number 9258447 was sent on 16 November this year, was issued for a sum of 200.144.56 pesos and its subject listed "the settlement of outstanding payments."
Treasury Luis Miguel López Moreno noted that the municipality will pay this contractor, who was monitored by the High State Review Office for selling at high prices, with a further sum.
What was not said is the total amount that the town hall still owes her, and how many cheques will be sent to Camacho Palazuelos.
"Nothing has been purchased now, it is only paid for what we owe it, as well as to other suppliers," he said in an interview.
The last cheques were "released" in the last quarter of the year: 24 September, two days 15. October, 19. October, 29. October and this last November.
Although the entrepreneur has not yet been published in the Governmental Gazette, as the law states in the case of the firms examined by the High State Review Board, in order to prevent their services from being used by other administrative bodies, the treasurer assured that she had not again used the services of the City Hall contractors.
in the previous period, after 25. July, the Noroeste newspaper published a review of the cheques issued by City Hall to its suppliers, which revealed that between March 2008 and 9. July 2010, during the three-year period of Mayor Jorge Abel López Sánchez, the city of Camacho Palazuelos paid more than 10 million pesos through 42 cheques.
It also carried out transactions with Jumapam, where it collected cheques for more than 3 million pesos.
Tourist jobs in urgent need of maintenance
Tourist managers complain in connection with the accident of a foreign tourist because of the poor condition of the Sáncheze Taboada party in Mazatlann.
After the fall of a foreign tourist to the hollow at the Sánchez Taboada's gaze, the local sector in Mazatlán is asking the authorities to pay attention to areas and places that are in poor condition, so as not to show the port in a good light.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, president of the Zona Dorado Territory Traders' Association, recalled that they repeatedly asked to be taken into account to the destination, and the bad things tourists find here, to be replaced by new activities or routes.
He said that the poor state of the streets and sidewalks was affecting tourists who walk and see the mess, which adversely affects nearby businesses.
"Politicians don't know what it's like to close a business for a day, and they have no idea about the sales that are leaking, otherwise they wouldn't have dealt with these matters for so long and without proper planning."
Hotelier José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said the fall of the tourist was caused by a lack of preventive measures and maintenance by the town hall.
"The town hall will have to take responsibility and prevent something like this from happening again, will have to devote itself to preventive maintenance, not just to correct existing defects," he said.
We would like to enjoy a clean city, as it is not only because we are a tourist area that maintenance should be done, after all, even as residents we deserve a clean residence, the town hall should change its maintenance strategy for the city."
There are other places that look neglected and miserable, he noted, such as the mazatlánský Emblém and El Venadito (monument, the statue of the deer).
"Nowadays, for tourists to come, it is not just the promotion that matters, it is necessary to offer a good product, a city that abounds in the cleanliness of its beaches and streets where the permanent maintenance of tourist attractions is carried out," he said.
"The attention required of this was not reflected here, and these facts emphasize something that is well known to all, the maintenance is lacking.
He talked about a number of places to be put in order in cooperation with the town hall, he said that the priority must be to keep the city clean and in order to be attractive because it has tourist potential.
Raúl Llera Martínez, the subsecutor of the Tourist Forum, said that the rescue of tourist sites in Mazatlann was urgent as they were not used properly and did not make a good impression.
Fortunately, Mazatlan offers many historical and cultural goals and space, which will first be put in order to make these places more attractive and to put them in the list we have to promote this destination'.
IP requests results from Congress
Eduardo Dávalos, the president of the CCE, would like MPs to take on a great responsibility by setting an example in the search for a better Sinaloa, in the various challenges facing the state.
A parliamentary term full of decent work and without agreements between the parties and the State Executive is demanding the business sector in Mazatlán, as Sinaloa is in convulsions and facing major problems.
As of yesterday, the 60th parliamentary term, composed of seven political forces, 19 PRI MPs, 13 from PAN, three from the Partido Nueva Alianza party, two from the PRD, one from the PRD, one from the PT, one from the Convergencia party and the last of the PVEM party, has been launched, comprising a total of 40 national representatives.
The list of expectations from the new members of Congress is to be able to implement decent leadership, with commitments to society and various areas that require responsible legislative work, and that the same party and paternalistic patrons will not be repeated.
Eduardo Dalayo Zamora, chairman of the Coordinating Business Council (CCE), proposed that the recently elected 40 members of Congress take on a great deal of responsibility and set an example on the way for the better Sinala in the various challenges they face.
"We expect that Members will actually exercise their right, without agreements between the parties, because they usually make measures to promote their own interests and become carnival guides to the rulers and the leaders of the parliamentary factions."
That is why he talked about the need to reiterate the commitment to establish the necessary bridges to move the ruling forward in order.
"We want them to do a decent job and be, above all, indebted to society and the sectors, because it was the people of Sinaloa who gave them the confidence vote in the last election."
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, president of the Tres Islas Hotel Association, has commented that one of the biggest challenges for 40 national representatives will be to take all the strength in an effort to achieve the country's economic growth, because the current economic situation is very difficult.
The most important thing is that they encourage economic growth, to create incentives for investment and infrastructure, which will encourage job creation in a certain way'.
As far as tourism is concerned, he asked that the new legislators give him more weight within the state budget and support the Ministry of Tourism.
"I have learned that this is a ministry with the second lowest budget, which is disproportionate, given that it is an important economic activity, bringing currency and investment, which, moreover, directly competes with agriculture."
In addition, to issue funds for starter tourism projects, Congress should help the state deliver on the security and assistance with the Alcohol Act, which has failed to be resolved in previous parliamentary periods.
Looking for the Three Kings
The dolls, cars and bicycles, along with other toys, are on the children's wish list in the Coronado Valenzuel family.
Their parents will find it difficult to meet their ideas on the upcoming feast of the Three Kings, as their household is worth exactly 12 people and one ram.
But Adelaide, Isabel, Jesús, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaías, José Juan and Miguel do not lose hope that Kaspar, Melichar and Balthazar would give them the toys and clothes they so desire.
The family lives in a modest dwelling in the village of Colonia Salvador Allende in poor circumstances, as the father has no permanent job.
"Sometimes we have a hard time, because the husband is unlucky, but we sell tangerines and potatoes... In the afternoon I go out with the "plebejci" on the street to sell on the street," said Cayetana Valenzuel Andrade, the children's mother.
Four-year-old Adelaida wants a doll or a bicycle, while her three-year-old sister Isabel would like a Barbie doll.
As for ten-year-old José Alfredo, he would like a car for a while, and for his eight-month-old brother Jesús, Cayetana would like clothes in size for one year.
"He (José Alfredo) 'I would wish for this monster car', but I told him 'we'll see his son' because it was very expensive," he recalls with sadness Cayetana.
For the older children who were in the process of being at the school, the ideal clothes and shoes would be ideal.
María Guadalupe, who is 11 years old, is a size of 12, 10-year-old Isaías size 10, while eight-year-old Miguel wears a size 8.
Jose Juan, 14, is missing sneakers, so he could use a five-and-a-half-half-sized couple.
To help fulfill the dreams of the children of the Coronado Valenzuel family, you can participate in the "Steering Three Kings" campaign, and bring a gift or cash at the Noroeste reception.
14 supposed drug traffickers who were arrested
A dozen searches were carried out in the Asteries, Wednesday, as part of the destruction of the network for the production and sale of Indian cannabis.
Fourteen people have been arrested and face various charges.
The tours took place in Sherbrook, Orford and Stoke, mainly in places used to manufacture drugs.
"Approximately 750 Indian cannabis beds, four kilograms of hashish, money and equipment that was used for the production was confiscated," said Louis-Philippe Ruel, a spokesman for the Quebec police.
In all, eleven men and three women were arrested, including both the supposed bosses of the entire network, two men from Sherbrook.
The arrested persons had to arrive at the judicial palace in Sherbrook after their arrest.
They could face charges of Indian cannabis production, possession of it in order to trade, conspiracy and theft, among other things.
These searches were held subsequently after a long-term investigation that lasted almost a year.
"It was the information we received from the public that enabled us to proceed with these arrests," said M. Ruel.
This police operation involved 70 officers of the regional department of the investigation of the city of Estrie State Police of Quebec, the Sherbrook State Police and the Police Administration of Sherbrook, the Memphrémagog.
Illegal migration will be able to continue without any problems.
The Conservative bill, which the government says should regulate the problem of ships loaded with illegal immigrants, will evidently be overwhelmed, while all three opposition parties said on Wednesday that they could not support it.
"I lean significantly on the Charter."
"I stand upright on the side of the party that built the granite under your feet," said the Liberal chief Michael Ignatieff, surrounded by MPs after the weekly session of the weekly du caucus.
The Liberals insist that the bill, as proposed, a law that would allow for the detention of up to one year for any person from a ship, identified as a ship transporting illegal immigrants, would violate the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
The head of the Quebec Bloc, Gilles Duceppe, also said that he could not support the bill because it was moving towards the wrong goal.
"We are against it and all the opposition parties seem to be against it, so we will see what the government does," said M. Duceppe.
The NPD critic on the issue of immigration, Olivia Chow, has rejected critics who want her party not to be strong enough for illegal immigrants.
"The non-democrats agree to take measures against smugglers of illegal immigrants and that is what we consider to be the main part of another draft law, C-35," said Ms Chow.
"We do not support the Conservative Bill because it blames the refugees and puts children in prison for at least one year," explained Ms Chow.
Immigration Minister Jason Kenney has blamed the opposition parties.
"The Canadians are telling the MPs en masse that they are not tolerating this kind of illegal migration, these criminal operations, which take aim at Canada and treat it as some kind of patso-sollo."
They expect Canada to take consistent measures, Secretary Kenney responded.
The government has not announced a vote of confidence in its bill, which could lead the country to the country's elections to be rejected.
One conservative told the QMI Agency that the government would demand a vote for any female MP to answer for his or her position in front of his or her constituents.
New unity does not mean unanimity
Despite the announcement , the possible creation of a permanent unit to fight corruption and collusion, many observers continue to demand the creation of a public commission of inquiry.
Minister for Public Security, Robert Dutil, is seeking to ensure that the idea does not fade into oblivion: Quebec intends to consult the Department of Investigation from New York as early as January next year.
Metropole has had a permanent anti-corruption unit at its disposal since 1870.
That is why Tuesday's announcement surprised more than one of us.
It should be noted that in the meeting of the Standing Council of Police Services in Quebec 29. October last year, the measure was not discussed even though Robert Dutil himself was also present.
More was needed for a public-security critic, PQ party member Stéphane Bergeron, to rate this announcement as "the rabbit pulled out of the hat" and "amateur solution botched on his knee."
Minister Dutil himself has responded to those who fear that political power has too much influence over the possible future of unity.
"It'll be satisfied with the confirmation: you'll see the result when we announce it."
"We are aware of the problem."
For the president of CSQ, Réjean Parent, nothing can replace the establishment of witness interviews in a public hearing.
"In addition, Mr. Charest is confirming that he does not want to create this commission of inquiry, and people think, as you and I are, that he is hiding something," he explains.
"The only means to achieve the creation of a commission of inquiry is the resignation of Jean Charest," explains Yves Boisvert, professor of ethics and political science at the Institute for the Education of High Civil Officials.
To emerge from this impasse, he suggested to Quebec that he give special authority to the inspector general's office to investigate the collusion and corruption.
"We must be able to extend the mandate of the Inspector General," he decided.
He also considers that Quebec could give the inspector the same powers as the commissioners who are forced to testify.
The creation of a permanent working group is not the only proposal in the Charesto government's writings.
Quebec would also be after Ottawa to amend the Criminal Code to be better suited to this type of crime.
This requirement would be based on the commissioner for Operation Marteau (Kladivo), who informed the Minister of Justice, Jean-Marco Fournier, that the case-law on this type of investigation was not explicit.
The Federal Minister for Public Security, Vic Toews, confirmed that his colleague in the judiciary, Rob Nicholson, was currently looking into some of the amendments associated with the dossier.
In Operation Spring 2001, which affected groups of bikers, even though the Criminal Code had not yet been amended, 131 people were arrested.
Ottawa subsequently had amendments made to the Gangsterty Act.
Rivers under close scrutiny.
Several watercourses have come under strict control due to heavy rainfall that have fallen since Tuesday in several regions of the province.
On Wednesday afternoon in Shawinigan, Mauritius, there was a landslide.
Two houses were evacuated as a precaution.
In the evening there was another landslide in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, in Lanaudière.
The road is dented.
From Tuesday to Wednesday evening, several regions were hit by heavy rainfall, i.e. it rained from 40 to 70 millimetres.
From 20 to 40 more millimetres was not expected from today until Thursday evening, by region.
Sections to the north of the river and in the Outaouais valley were hit hardest.
It could drop in a total of up to 100 millimetres.
If we add up these precipitation with the thaw of the snow accumulated in some sectors, we may fear floods for some watercourses.
On Wednesday evening, the Quebec Rescue Service issued a warning of the danger of flooding for the Ouareau and Achigan rivers, in Lanaudière.
Rivers to the north, in Saint-Jérôme, in the forest of Laurentides, and Chêne, in Lotbinière, have been subject to flood emergency and continuous inspection.
In the de Lanaudière area, heavy collisions caused the flooding of some lakes, in Sainte-Julienne, in Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare, as well as in Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, one makeshift bridge was torn down by heavy rains.
Two residences had to be evacuated as a precaution.
In Outaouais, the spill of some lakes from the shores was caused by the closure of some roads, mainly in the municipality of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
The ambulance service is on alert and oversees the situation in the area, said Annik Bouchard, the safety adviser.
The Quebec Center for Floods predicting floods issued warnings on Wednesday for several rivers, notably Maskinongé, Assomption, Ouareau, Achigan, Batiscan and Loup.
Dupont was partly blamed
Quebec radio host Stéphane Dupont suffered a partial setback to the Canadian Council for Radio and Television Standards Standards (RRTV) for controversial social assistance statements and Haitians, as well as for rude language during the broadcast.
The Broadcasting Council considers that Mr. Dupont and his group from the CHOI,88,1 FM, had the right to express their views, but some of the statements contained "inaccurate information about social assistance and the improper negative recount of the Haitians of rude language that does not correspond to the broadcast broadcast on the day."
The Council also concluded that the discussions on suicide, including the broadcasting of the name of the two people who had taken their lives, had not contradicted the rules for radio broadcasting.
The Broadcasting Council received several complaints about the comments made during the broadcast, broadcast between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was made after a complaint by the Common Front of Social Support recipients of Quebec.
The group complained that the sums indicated on the broadcast were inaccurate.
Moderators must provide reliable information, not deceptive.
As for the suicide, the moderator, Stéphane Dupont, thought suicide was a gesture of despair.
The majority of the Commission members concluded that the report transmitted was such that suicide could not be seen as a solution to the problems of everyday life.
"Most of the Commission considers that the disputed episodes of the broadcasting of the "Dupe of the Noon Reports" have come across a delicate subject in an impartial and appropriate manner."
There has been no complaint against him.
The latest dispute was about a statement that followed the earthquake in Haiti.
So Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort embarked on a media shootout that provoked many reactions.
The CHOI moderator said he had not sent any donation to help the Haitians because we could not know for sure that the necessary would actually receive the money.
The Commission considers that these comments were not unjustified, but that their cumulative effect creates an unduly negative picture of the Haitians.
"I've already atoned for my three-day delay on the matter."
"My file has been intact for a year and a half," the moderator said.
In all decisions, the Commission refuses to use gross expression in the broadcast.
In any case, the CHOI-FM radio broadcasting cooperated "beyond its duties."
For a station that will have to notify those decisions once in the course of the main broadcast within three days, the consequences shall be minimal.
King du kung-fuvà Montreal.
The Montreal resident, originally from Algiers, Nacereddine Zemmal, has an extremely special run-off.
An athlete who excels in the "sana" (kung-fu "full contact"), enters the tatami and rings of the world in kickboxing and Thai boxing and looking for new challenges.
"I started with martial arts as kung fu and kickboxing 12 years ago, in Algeria, explained Zemmal, who has lived in the capital since 2008 to learn with professionals."
"In my case, I'm looking for fights a little bit everywhere, because for those who don't like the game on the ground that comes up for combat sports, competitions are rare in North America."
Recently, this man, who works as a security guard and as a helper for UPS, has just delivered bad news to his rivals when he won two gold medals at the World Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA) World Championships from 23. to 30. October, Edimburg, in Scotland.
"I won the kickboxing category full contact and Thai boxing category, he said."
"I am currently preparing for China for the World Cup in san shou."
"They were invited to the opponents who finished the top four at the last World Championships in each category."
"I won the bronze in Toronto in 2009."
"In 2005 in Vietnam, I finished eighth."
"In 2007 in China I finished in the fifth rank of the tournament, while in Toronto in 2009 I finished third , added.'
"Interestingly, I've made some progress in every competition."
"At this rate, I'll be the first this year or next!"
"san shou" or "sanda" is a discipline originating in China, where punches and legs, as well as throwing to the ground, are permitted.
Matches are traditionally set on the platform and more rarely in the ring.
The most famous boxer, resulting from this form of struggle, is a Vietnamese-born American, Cung Le, well known in the world of martial arts.
As much as Nacer Zemmal is to keep only one result in his career, he will boldly confirm his participation in the "King of Sanda" superturnaj, the Super Bowl in kung-fu.
"This competition is the highest and most prestigious in China, the likeable fellow explains."
"It's a bit of a tenetry for Stade Lumpinee (the biggest stadium in Thailand)."
"It was a great experience."
Zemmal won his first match, in the semi-finals of his category (80 kg), before suffering a loss in the final.
"The one who beat me was a real pro, he analyzed."
"There are four competing categories (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg et 90 kg)."
"The semi-finals winners will meet in the final of their category."
"Then the winners of each category will compete to be crowned only champion, the king of kung fu."
450 contracted millions without public competitions
Hydro-Québec, by mutual agreement, agreed to 450 million in contracts with companies providing engineering to the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydroelectric project.
At the heart of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts, it is the consortium created from BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor, which has won the most important contract, a contract to manage the entire project for a total of $295 million without a public tender.
This consortium, on behalf of the Énergie gérance, was empowered in 2004 in parallel with the selection of Hydro-Québec to entrust its responsibility to the private sector for the management of this major hydroelectric project worth $5 billion.
At the beginning of 2005, the consortium "Énergie gérance" won a lucrative contract without any announcement of a public tender.
For the Quebec side, the complaint against a consortium of enterprises confronts us with a serious problem of ethical nature, risking the exclusion of competition and triggering price increases.
"It's a new way to implement the collusion and eliminate the competition."
"This means that people no longer make side-by-partnership deals in secret, they are now open to doing them," PQ MEP Sylvain Simard said at a press conference yesterday.
A little earlier, in the morning, M. Simard asked this question to the National Assembly because he says it is hard to bear how public interest can be sold in this way.
The Minister for Natural Resources, Nathalie Normandeau, said in the afternoon, in a penny denying that this contract was a colouza.
"I have my own path," she thundered, claiming that the PQ was "exorse" and "laddered to accuracy."
She said that "it would be the least of it" that the PQ would apologize.
The recipe for the creation of a consortium is a common practice worldwide.
This is usually an alliance, capped at a time, that allows two or a few businesses to group together with their expertise to respond to a call for tenders for a comprehensive project.
The Eastmain project is very complex with regard to the skillet of the work.
Construction is already underway and must be scheduled for 2012.
However, the contract was granted without the competition being able to act; it was a deal.
It must also be admitted that the consortia's formula is no longer an exception in Quebec, even for relatively simple projects.
As revealed last week by Le Devoir, a consortium form of consultancy in engineering is under investigation in the government.
Flying at a speed of the business register of Quebec firms will allow us to discover more than 200 consortia, some of which seem to be created permanently.
This is how Dessau operates in partnership with most of its main competitors; let's name CIMA+, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin and Roche and Tecsult.
Each combination, and there are dozens of them, leads to one and the same legal person, and that is Dessau.
As for the Énergie gérance consortium, Minister Normandeau underlined in particular the fact that "the Territory of Laia James is characterised by the special dynamics of the workforce and that Hydro-Québec has been responding to it since the 1970s."
The main patron of the Eastmain project, Réal Laporte, of the Energy Society Baie James (SEBJ), gave an explanation to make us wrinkle the forehead at the fact that the project management contract was concluded by mutual agreement.
"If you are going to a public tender and if there are few contestants presenting the offer, your prices offered may be higher."
"You have two options to choose from: i.e. that you're going to pick up the people who are in that contract as the contestants, and that you say, "Let's make a deal of a satisfactory and good price."
"But the main idea is that what matters are not the price, but the competence of the people," Mr. Laporte confirmed.
This contract awarded to the Énergie Gérance consortium is part of a long list of contracts for more than $50,000 received by the Quebec Party.
The contracts were concluded with Hydro-Québec or SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
After verification, Le Devoir counted 109 contracts to consult the engineering sector, concluded between 2002 and March 2010 with companies or their branches, in particular with laboratories performing soil samples analysis.
SNC-Lavalin scoffed 22 contracts, of which Génivar received from them 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10 without having a stake in "Éergy géra."
All contracts were concluded.
Together, they number $449,783 344, including a contract with Énergie gérance at $295,1315 564.
Sylvain Simard suggested that the four companies that are part of the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) are "very good acquaintances of the Liberal Quebec Parties."
Minister Normandeau leaked the report that PQ was also linked to companies that "funded" it, before specifying that it was more likely to be its managers.
Barometer of responsible consumption - 'green' etiquette does not inspire confidence
More green, but openly skeptical.
The Quebec consumer has very little confidence in the players in sustainable development, but also of "non-partisan" brands and environmental certificates, to follow this in product selection.
The worst of all is that even when we bathe in the media universe, which urges us to be more socially responsible for consuming them, this media universe laments the lack of credible information, the non-fulfilling of obligations that it qualifies as a brake for its commitment, Baromètre reports responsible consumption, the first article of which was published yesterday.
Even though the consumption of so-called socially responsible products increased in 2010, the Quebec residents who are trying to sell them do not trust them much
In fact, two-thirds of us say that they do not trust the promises of environmental-related companies, simply because the green advertising of the companies, is detecting a measuring tool developed by the Sherbrooke University's Responsible Consumption Observatory.
Other findings: half of consumers doubt the credibility of official certificates, staked in so-called just products, but also the credibility of the products and brands known as the ecologically responsible, Barometre says.
In the same way, the debate of politicians on the subject is accepted as a serious mere 14.6% of Quebec residents.
However, information on responsible consumption appears to be paramount to stimulate this consumption site, revived at the moment by almost a third of Quebec consumers.
Indeed, the vacuum and dubious nature of the information would ease the enthusiasm of 46% of consumers.
This is the second brake identified by Baromètre, after the higher price of these products.
After all, a third of Quebec's population is incredulously opposed to the reported data about the products or the "green" services we look for to let them pass through our hands.
On the other hand, in 2010, almost half of consumers were willing to change their habits and, in particular, to change the brand of one or more products, thus responding to their beliefs.
A full 61% of them preferred to buy from merchants from their neighborhood, preferring to buy food grown in their region, Baromètre reports.
More "green" and responsible - the responsible consumption index has reached 64 of the maximum 100 for this year - Homo consumus Queeek likes to present himself as the king of recycling, who strives for the least possible impact on the environment by caring for the protection of animals.
But their social and ecological conscience was clearly left somewhere outside their car, Baromètre says: in 2010, barely 28% of Quebec residents said they were using public transportation or that they recommended the use of a car to travel for at least two people, in the interest of conservation.
Walking and the bike were also supported by 39.1% of participants in this extensive behavioural survey who used this cliché.
A loan to the state to buy the cinema complex eXcentris
The Quebec government, which we asked for a financial participation in the purchase of the cinema complex by eXcentris by the eXcentris company, agrees to participate, but only up to the amount of the loan.
The developer's "Angus et le parallèle," which sought a $7 million donation from the Minister of Culture to buy the cinematographic complex on Saint-Laurent's tabloid and which demonstrated its mission as a lover of the arts of film, has not won what it demanded.
The government accepts that it will be included in the dossier, but on its own terms.
Rather than expected, the government of Quebec proposes a loan, the amount of which would be lower, some of which could build the basis for a viable solution on favourable terms and with resources from the state.
The first action plan and the request for 12.8 million were already rejected by Quebec last spring, but applications have already been revised for the cut.
The design and plan of action was sent to Minister St-Pierre by the president of the Society for the Development of Business in Culture (SODEC), François Macerola, who runs the eXcentris cinematographic project.
The final report was sent ten days ago.
But the government's counter-proto came to SODEC on Tuesday.
Le Parallèle et Angus have until December 31 to respond.
However, it seems that the state's gift-taking hypothesis must be rejected.
Recall that the Association of Cinema Owners and Cinematographic Centres in Quebec was opposed to the state's direct investment in order to support the purchase of the eXcentris, considering that the Minister of Culture is not to finance a real estate project when he did not do so for other theatres.
But several participants in the discussion, on the other hand, demanded substantial economic support.
Daniel Langlois, the owner, was given film art to the space in his cinema during his ten years after he himself financed the construction of the complex, which may have been the reason for the state's financial council to be amended.
The lack of halls for independent films is gairdled in Montreal, and eXcentris could win over a regular clientele.
Angus et le Parallèle, with Christian Yaccarini at its head, is running a campaign to release funds to the private sector, in the belief that it will take out $700,000 to push through the acquisition.
Since the spring of 2009, the only one of the three film companies, Le Parallèle, has continued to distribute films for eXcentris.
Future acquirers aim to reopen all three halls on 27. February next year and screen Xavier's most beautiful film, Men and Gods, by Xavier's most beautiful film.
But Christian Yaccarini didn't like Le Devoir and so he's ignored, so he and his group think of the shrinkage proposals made to him.
The upward curtain to Canada as a whole...
The new diplomatic sources of America's acquaintance through WikiLeaks reveal what the United States sees as a complex of inferior to the Canadians against Americans, but by the same blow, they reveal their sense of superiority to Canada.
American diplomats are therefore surprised that every Canadian voter's heart is at the heart of Canadian-American relations when he goes to vote, and he believes President Obama's visit to help the Conservative government get her budget to be adopted in 2009!
Four new reports, which were the US Embassy in Ottawa and Washington, outright on the public yesterday, provide sensitive details to get 'under each other's skin'.
The Communication, dated September 22, 2008, i.e. in the middle of the election campaign, sets out in detail how point the United States is not part of the betting discussed by political leaders.
Much to the surprise of the American ambassador to Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr. Wilkins provides some explanations for this situation.
"The Canadian inferiority complex, almost obscured, makes perhaps political leaders subject to talking about internal betting, rather than realizing that these elections also apply to the United States (as in the free trade campaign in 1988)," he writes.
"The United States is therefore," he concluded, "a refusing elephant in the following election:the nationalist, but potentially too threatening to be talked about."
The ambassador understands this "enoughness of silence" all the less because the two countries maintain intense political and economic relations.
"It is logical that the ability of a candidate, party or, better still, the head of the party to manage these important relationships should be a key factor in the electorate's mind when they go to the polls."
A different statement of this sense of importance can be read in a report sent by Terry Breese, chargé d'affaires in Ottawa à Ottawa, preparing President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
"Your trip will help ensure that the government is maintained in a confidence vote in early February, regarding the federal budget by which Canada publicly grants its first deficit in more than a decade, due to a $30 to $40 billion recovery plan," writes M. Breese.
No mention of the government's need to adjourn the pre-Christmas session of parliament so that it could not be defeated by the coalition, and that the opposition parties make their survival conditional on the quality of the proposed recovery plan.
Another January 2008 report and signed by Ambassador Wilkins, points out Washington's increasingly negative image that is being cast by the United States with drama series broadcast on CBC.
The ambassador is concerned about the avenging Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence, and H2O, in which not very savvy references to Maher Arar, "No-Fly-List" or also to kidnappings for the purpose of violent interrogations at the CIA.
Another report reports that at their first bilateral meeting, Hillary Clinton asked her French partner, Bernard Kouchner, if Europe was ready to receive some of the Guantánamo prisoners.
Mr Kouchner replied yes, but on the basis of the "case-and-case case" principle.
At the end of the meeting, it says, "he forwarded some paper to the secretary of state's secretary of state about Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian descent."
"She accepted the secretary, saying she would revise the file."
Finally, note that the people involved in WikiLeaks are sweating.
Tom Flanagan, a former adviser very close to Stephen Harper, said on the CBC that the person responsible for this massive leak should be "destroyed."
It broke up, and Mike Huckabee heard about it in the United States.
World Plan to restore lighting
Yesterday, the UN proposed a plan in Cancún to restore home lighting, store and industrial space lighting in 100 countries to achieve a reduction in the greenhouse effect (GES), which corresponds to almost one-third of the other constraints to be achieved to stabilise the planet's climate from now until 2020.
This ambitious plan is at the stage of large concrete projects that the UN wants to push through in Cancún to compensate for the absence of difficult-to-reach reduction commitments on the part of industrialised countries.
According to the plan presented yesterday, if the incubator-on-heated incinerators, which monopolize 50 to 70% of the market, are replaced with light bulbs with fluoccompactic or, better, with electroluminiscent diodes (DEL or "LED" in English), a substantial amount of the 1.8 billion tonnes of GES of GES emissions on the planet due to lighting would be discharged.
The illumination is responsible for 8% of the world's emissions.
It's the equivalent of 70% of emissions from a car park across the planet.
In Copenhagen last year, major countries with a significant share of emissions such as the United States, China, Europe and others, among them Canada, joined the voluntary reduction plans to allow for the decline in GES global emissions from the 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
But it will be necessary to deduct from this balance of the 5 Gt to achieve stabilisation of the heating of 2 degrees Celsius by 2020 to avoid being out of control.
In incandescent incandescent bulbs, 95% of the energy is scattered in the form of heat and the rest, i.e. 5%, the light product.
With fluo-combacit bulbs, the energy consumption is reduced by 75% and with new incandescent bulbs with DEL, we will reduce this consumption twice more.
Fluocompact bulbs last from 6000 a.m. to 10,000 hours.
The new DEL bulbs, the kind he put into the production of Philips this week - the company reportedly participated in the UN study - have a projected life of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than a red-hot light bulb, giving us an idea of a possible saving with a replacement plan that would be applied in 100 countries.
All of these new bulbs can also work with the reacts and emit less heat.
And they contain no mercury.
Several experts have expressed reservations about fluo-complex bulbs because they contain mercury and need to be sorted as hazardous waste, which is still not possible in developing countries, and manufacturers would set up collectors.
However, as the report states, the main source of mercury emissions on the planet is not a fluo-complex bulb, but rather thermal coal-fired power plants that emit many mercury needed to produce electricity wasted in red-hot light bulbs.
In the United States alone, these headquarters put 25,000 tons of mercury into circulation annually.
The report also sets out in detail the gains that each country would make to this international programme.
Indonesia, for example, would thus save $1 billion a year for buying electricity and eight million tonnes of CO2, which is the equivalent of 3.5 thermal power plants, which would cost 2.5 billion to build
Côte d'Ivoire is eagerly awaiting the results of the election results.
The UN Secretary-General, Ban Ki-moon, requested the immediate publication of the results of the Ivorian presidential election following the expiry of the deadlines.
"The Secretary-General underlines the need for an independent electoral commission to complete its work and to immediately announce the preliminary results, the spokesman for the UN president stressed."
"It asks all parties in Côte d'Iraga and the institutions to prove their sense of responsibility and to refrain from any initiative until the provisional results are announced."
Despite the pressures exerted by some foreign governments, the electoral commission let the latest date go - Wednesday's halfnight - without releasing the results, three days after Sunday's scrum.
About forty minutes before the deadline, the president of CEI confirmed on television that the commission "continues to work" in order to declare the results.
On Wednesday, calls for CEI to finally announce the name of the second-round winner, between the outgoing Laurent Gbagbo and opposition member Alassan Ouattara, a member of the opposition, a succession, a successor, aroused.
But the Gbagbo camp is relying on the annulment of the Constitutional Council for the "fraudulent" vote in the north, administered by the former New Army rebels (FN) since the failed coup d'état in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, director of the Côte d'Ivoire presidential election campaign, confirmed that voter intimidation's maneuvers practiced by the FN (New Army) in the north of the country have deterred supporters of the Ivorian President of the Ivorian President from voting.
The election could be annulled if the Constitutional Council had taken into account the complaints filed by Gbagbo.
However, opponents of President Gbagbo consider that the country's supreme court is not neutral because it is run by Paul Yao N'Dré, President Gbagbo's very close political ally.
Alassane Ouattara, a man from the north who debunked any connection with the former rebels, condemned the delay in the announcement of the results as "unacceptable" and asked Gbagbo to respect them but not go so far as to demand victory.
His allies confirm that Gbagbo is blocking the release of the results because he knows he has suffered a loss and that he has filed a complaint with the Constitutional Council after he has prevented the election commission from broadcasting the results, would be illegal.
The second round of the presidential election, underway on Sunday, was seen as a coronation of the reunification and reconciliation process of a country that has been divided into two-half for years.
The United Nations warned the Ivorian political faction on Wednesday that it could be held liable for possible violence.
Laurent Gbagbo finished in the first round, 31. October, the winner with 38% of the vote, up from 32% for Alassan Ouattara, who received public support from former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round).
The unemployment rate remains stable in France in the third quarter.
The unemployment rate in France, according to the International Labour Office (BIT), remained stable at 9.3% in metropolitan France (9.7% including overseas areas), as shown by makeshift data with the correction of seasonal deviations (CVS) published by INSEE on Thursday.
The number of unemployed has stabilised at 2.631 million in the metropolis.
Data from the second quarter was confirmed to 9.3% of the active population in the metropolitan area and 9.7% including overseas areas.
In one year, the unemployment rate is increasing by 0.1 points.
In a wider frame, 3.4 million people in metropolitan France do not work in the third quarter, but would like to work, regardless of whether or not they are available in two weeks to work, regardless of whether or not they are looking for work.
The situation of the current young people on the labour market has escalated with a new rise in the unemployment rate reaching 24.2% in metropolitan France (+0.9 points in three months, +0.5 points in one year) and 25% including overseas areas.
In the third quarter, according to the International Labour Office, there were 637 000 young people between the ages of 15 and 24.
As for the elderly, they saw a slight increase in unemployment in Metropolitan France to 6.4% in metropolitan France (+0.2 points in three months, as in a year), i.e. 482,000 people from the age of 50 up and 6.6% including overseas areas.
Only the 25-49-year-old population benefited from unemployment stability to 8.3% in metropolitan France (-0.1 points in three months, +0.1 points in one year) and 8.8% across France.
Insee no longer publishes the monthly unemployment rate since 2006, following a controversy over its calculation method.
Eurostat, the statistical agency of the European Union, is continuing to produce monthly statistics and on Tuesday announced a rate of 9.8% for France (including the tide) in October after 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini is charged and remanded in custody
Alexandre Guérini, 53, one of the chief executives of the waste treatment enterprises and the brother of the PS of the Administration Board of Bouches-du-Rhône, was charged and imprisoned at the Luynes prison, near Aix-en-Provence, as part of a public procurement investigation, supposedly improperly obtained.
Alexandre Guérini was charged with misuse of the company's assets, misuse of public funds and public property, concealment, bribery, accepting bribes to influence the office and possession of ammunition, his lawyer says.
"Alexandre Guérini is belligerent and insists that the judge and his judge explain all the questions this one intends to ask him, rather than some delusions."
"It is easy to pursue him for many reprehensible reasons, but it is another matter to prove them," his lawyer, Florence Rault, told AFP before questioning her client.
Mr Guérini said through his attorneys that he had sent a short statement to the judge before his interrogation to explain everything.
One of his loved ones, Philippe Rapezzi, was also charged and imprisoned on Wednesday evening.
According to his lawyer, Lucien Simon, his client never did anything but ensure that he operated the landfills he was to manage.
As for the award of contracts or the destination of the funds associated with their operation, he never knew about any of this, Mr Simon said.
In this matter, Daniel Pinna, the former director general of the services of the Aubagne agglomeration, was charged on Wednesday for misuse of public funds and plot, and allowed the protagonists of the matter to be free, under judicial supervision, to the prohibition on seeing each other.
"My client was able to give explanations to all the facts he's accused of."
"The investigating judge takes this into account and lets him go free," said his lawyer, Mr. Yann Arnoux.
Four more were charged and released on the night of Tuesday to Wednesday, with two of them under judicial supervision, said prosecutor Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadakian, the deputy director general with the elegance of Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM), is being prosecuted for accepting bribes to influence the office and for passive corruption."
Two Aubagne conglomerate officials, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringuier, are charged, one for "ceasing and misusing the company's assets," the other for "a fallow in the misuse of public funds."
Finally, business associate Alexandra Guérini, Jeannie Peretti, was charged with "calling the misuse of the company's assets."
Among those confronted with Mr. Guérini is Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, who was recently charged in a parallel case of fraudulent public procurement involving Corsica.
Investigators suspect his companies of aiding aided to launder money from a large-scale gangster.
The investigation is conducted in the framework of several open court investigations against X in April 2009 following the receipt of anonymous letters regarding alleged fraud in the closure of public procurement contracts, in particular on the matter of waste.
From a source close to the investigation, the search focuses in particular on the conditions for the allocation and operation of the landfill in La Ciotat, which collects trash from Aubagne, as well as from some of the cities of the Marseille Municipal Community (MPM).
Clotilde Reiss case: Elysee Palace exaggerated Syria's mediation
Over the course of more than ten months, from July 2009 to May 2010, the fate of Klotilda Reiss, a young researcher arrested in Iran for "shpionage," unifying views in France, leading to combat diplomacy and emphasizing relations between Paris and Tehran.
All this closely watched by diplomats from the United States.
American documents, received by WikiLeaks and consulted with Le Monde, reveal some of the drawbacks of this crisis.
They describe how the Élysée Palace explained its strategy to the Americans, going so far as to advise them on how to handle such hostage cases in Iran (a small group of hikers).
They show how leading French officials have tried to convince Washington that the young Frenchwoman's release was not a compensation for the release of Majid Kakavanda, an Iranian imprisoned in France and wanted by the US judiciary for the underhanded labor of material in favour of Iran's nuclear program.
Finally, they are subjecting the sharp light to the way the French Presidency sought to manipulate the media to accredit the idea that the Syrian president, Bachar Al-Assad, played a central role in the liberation of Klotilda Reiss.
He didn't really do anything about it.
The diplomatic telegram, drafted in Paris on 12 August 2009, has the headline: "Iran:French comments on the way to be resolved in the case of hostages."
An adviser from the Élysée Palace for Strategic Affairs, François Richier, accompanied by the director of the Quai d'Orsay for North Africa The Middle East, Patrice Paoli, speaks with a representative of US diplomacy, Allegrone.
They explain the French method to him.
They recommend the Americans to do the same as so for being brought back to the homeland by their own nationals of the violence-resecured in Iran.
"Do the noise," they say, "still emphatically pronounce "in the media, the words "founding rights of man," "innocence," "an immediate deliverance."
The Iraqi regime must be brought into trouble, sensitive to its image.
"Do it the more they ask you to stop."
As there have been attempts to negotiate through discreet channels, "it will not solve anything," the Iranians are "extinct manoeuvres."
Mr. Richier recalls that arresting foreigners is "a family tactic of Iran: hostage-taking for the purpose of "political blackmail."
Announces that the liberation of Klotilda Reiss (which will take place on 16 August, the day the French Embassy will grant her refuge) "it will require a large sum of money to the Iranians" (a €230,000).
And he will announce that the Élysée Palace is anticipating the cases of the hostage, a phenomenon that "gets to escalate."
Iranians "could arrest another 1,800 or so French in Iran in the future," he says.
28 August 2009.
Klotilda Reiss left prison 12 days ago, but still remains blocked in Iran.
The information is being circulated: Iranian Majid Kakavand, about whom the United States claims to have been expelled for illegal e-freel deal sensitive to Iran, is released in Paris on the basis of a judge's ruling.
The US Embassy, as many observers, has been questioning this disturbing match.
For Washington, which is chasing Iran's illegal networks to extract material destined for a nuclear program, the expansion of Majid Khakavand is bad news.
France agreed to bargain?
The liberation of the Iranian to free the young Frenchwoman?
In another interview with Kathleen Allegrone, September 4, François Richier assures that this is not the case.
The Elysée Palace, as it says, was not only "scaorn by this judge's decision" but was looking for a way to oppose it.
"There have been talks between the presidency and the Minister of Justice" (at the time, Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French government cannot change the court's decision," he notes.
Mr Richier also wants to demonstrate that Majid Kakavand is under the "limited" supervision of the French intelligence service.
An adviser to the Élya Palace is dialing a phone number, hangs up the phone phone, and then informs an American diplomat that the Iranian is currently in the Parisian buildings run by the Iranian embassy."
At the time of the imprisonment of Klotilda Reiss in Iran, the Elysee Palace is making an effort, negotiating, through a communiqué and organized "leak" to the media to convince that Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad is playing a "significant" and "influential" role as a "media director."
Americans observe this activity, not without irony, stating that the manipulation bears fruit, because several press articles reflect the French official version.
Telegram of 25 August 2009 evokes the media "blest" of French official officials."
What is the basis of such a degree of "gratefulness" expressed to M. Assad, asks the embassy in Paris.
"Despite their statements full of praise, French officials privately acknowledge that they have only a vague idea of what the Syrians have actually done."
The document then deals with the reasons that forced the Elysee Palace to pay in this fiction.
Intense communications "shall be measured to validate President Sarkozy's policy of opening with Syria," he analyses.
The policy pursued in 2008 "was observed by many critical voices in France and abroad and described as premature and undeserved."
By "exaggerating the Syrian role," Paris is trying to "demonstrate Syria, what a loathoners can earn when it plays a constructive role in the area."
The aim is also to "send the grain of discord between Syria and Iran."
The American Embassy knows this from a very good source.
On August 11, François Richier confided in him: "of course, we don't know if the Syrians did anything, whatever it is"
"But we thanked them anyway."
"This should at least bring confusion and ambiguity among the Iranians."
Klotilda Reiss returns to France on 16 May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy receives it at the Élysée Palace.
In the communiqué, he thanks the presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for their "active role in favor of the liberation of our compatriot."
The End of Online Games After Midnight for Young Koreans
The South Korean government will adopt a law called "Peciválic" that will ban adolescents from playing online games after midnight by blocking access to them, government officials in the firm said.
The bill will be submitted to Parliament in December to ask companies operating online games to block access to these games after midnight to those under 16 for people under the age of 16, officials from the Ministry of Culture and the Ministry of the Family said.
"Many children play these games all night and then have learning difficulties at school and are unable to lead a normal life during the day."
"We consider that this law is necessary to ensure that their health and their right to sleep can be ensured," Jo Rin, the lead official at the Ministry in charge of the bill, told AFP.
Online games will be newly available from 6 a.m.
Companies will have one year to prepare for the application of the law, he clarified.
The government also envisages asking companies to limit the daily subscription to the day-to-day time to access these games for young people whose parents so request, the worker in charge added.
It will also make free programs available to people who request it, allowing you to limit the time spent online.
South Korea is one of the countries most "affected" and the daily newspapers regularly bring different facts linked to the intensive use of the Internet.
The country is also an undisputed champion in world competitions in online games.
In November, South Korea won four gold medals at the World Cyber Games, in the face of 58 other nations.
World Championships 2018-2022: Fifa establishes the host country.
The full unrest on suspicion of corruption is hereby established by the Fifa Executive Committee on Thursday by the host World Cup country in 2018 and 2022, a selection of the supremely politically motivated party, where the fight for influence and lobbying risk leading the technical criteria.
The matter is certain, the Fifa Royal Competition in 2018 will be held in Europe , the traditional bastion of this discipline (4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, Netherlands-Belgium).
The 2022 Championship will be far more exotic, with the International Federation hoping to conquer new territories (Qatar, Australia) after its premiere on the African continent in 2010, or continue to be set in the United States or the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities to attend in the delegations (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, Prince of Qatar, leading government officials in Belgium and the Netherlands, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) gives the opportunity to create an idea of the scale of economic and political betting around the world.
Behind the scenes, the negotiations face the risk of last minute.
It is difficult for the rest to establish the hierarchy according to the candidates.
According to the evaluation report of the Fifa documentation, the English, Spanish-Portuguese (2018) and the American (2022) contain the best arguments, as do the documentation of their competitors.
But those reasons will not carry too much weight for the 22 members of the executive committee at the hour for the vote.
The Sunday Times at the start of the revelation, leading to the suspension of the two CE/European Commission members?/ for corruption (Reynald Temarii et Amos Adamu), may have ruined the chances of their country, the cradles of the hockey that have hosted the world championship only once so far, in the year.
The BBC put the crown on Monday when it aired a documentary that "bugged a pin" by three influential CE (European Commission?), Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
How to make Fifa dissatisfied and to trouble to bring English leading officials to David Cameron in the first place.
The Prime Minister hopes to repeat the move made by his predecessor, Tony Blair, who was awarded the 2012 Olympic Games for London in 2005.
Will this intense activity be enough for England to give a new shine to its name with the CE (European Commission?)?
Nothing is less certain, as the pair of Spain-Portugal are not lagging the trumps of the stadiums already prepared, his showcasing (World Championship in 1982 in Spain, the 1992 Olympic Games in Barcelona, the Euro-2004 in Portugal) and their football culture.
But the gloomy economic and financial perspectives of both countries could give these ambitions a cold shower.
Any retaliatory measures against the English and doubts about the payment capability of Spain and Portugal only increase the position of Russia, which was an outsider despite the gaps in its documentation (stadions, hotels, transport).
But Prime Minister Vladimir Poutin decided not to move the Championship to Curich and publicly declare "unflat competition in the preparation of the vote," in verbal references only shrouded in the accusations of the English press against the CE (European Commission) members.
"We'll throw mud at them, try to compromise them," said Mr. Poutin.
For 2022, the United States appears to be the logical favorite, with its considerable experience in 1994.
The world's highest performance of the economy, the headquarters of the main sponsors of Fifa, seems to be well ahead of Japan and South Korea, which, separately, have produced a beautiful project.
But these candidacies seem premature for the two countries that underwent a "test" together in 2002.
Another threat: the 2026 World Cup awarding to China, which is keenly desired by Fifa, has made Asian chances for 2022 invalid.
With Qatar, who pulled a big ace out of his sleeve in the form of futuristic stadiums, and Australia, Fifa would continue to expand into new landscapes, but these two countries pose more risks than certainties.
Australia, like Japan and Korea, could be penalised for the flimsy TV fees (due to the time shift) paid by European countries that make up the momentum for Fifa.
Second mandate: obvious (certainty)
De Gaulle was really hesitant.
Mitterrand made him seem hesitate.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing et Jacques Chirac did not hesitate in the slightest.
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less than they are.
The mandate of the Elysée Palace summons someone else.
The current head of state will therefore be the candidate in 2012.
But the obvious is not in good agreement with the share of the secret associated with the Presidency's post.
So it is necessary to act as if doubts are constantly persistent.
In one and the other.
In 2006, if one would have wanted to believe it, Jacques Chirac's friends made claims to keep the third mandate out of the question.
On November 15, with a serious expression, Nicolas Sarkozy assured that "it will be decided sometime in the fall of 2011."
As he recalls in front of the members of the UMP Parliament on Wednesday evening at the Élysée Palace, the prospect of "two mandates" has sown a low-fries state.
Was that the official announcement of his candidacy?
He was not far away.
The president merely recalled that the amendment to the Constitution in 2008 limited the number of five-year term to two.
It was just a statement on his part, not a notice.
This is not the first time he has been reminded of such meetings in the humorous tone of the presidential election.
"In the worst case, or at best, you have seven and a half years ahead of you with me," he said in July 2009.
Rebellion in May 2010: "Don't think I'm not considering the next stage."
His statements before yesterday would not be made by a candidate more than the previous day; he would not be made by a candidate or less.
If they call out comments, it's because of the double truth.
Accelerating the path to the run for the PA, on the one hand.
But that's not the entrance to the Ségolèn's arena, pushing Nicolas Sarkozy to convict himself.
On the contrary, it is because his candidacy in 2012 is evident that many in the PA want to be premature rather than intended to be in the battle sets.
Bad poll on the other side.
First, the right-wing voters would prefer François Fillon's candidacy to Nicolas Sarkozy's candidacy (46% against 44%, according to BVA-L'Express).
"We have a candidate and we do not discuss this matter with the UMP ", the people in the immediate and circumspectised manner responded to the Prime Minister.
"If he believes in a possible defeat, he will not run," says Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"He will still believe he can win," corrects Alain Juppé, even with the obvious.
Euro: The Central European Bank is forced to continue its purchases of state titles.
The last meeting of the Governing Council of the Central year was to be an opportunity to clarify the conditions for lifting out of the crisis or, at least, the announcement of the cessation of a large number of unusual monetary policy operations that must be completed by the end of this year.
The crisis is binding on sovereign European claims, the Securities Issued Institute will no doubt not be able to afford to be so categorical under the threat of a deterioration in the situation now already tense on European securities markets.
The political price in that case would be all the higher.
Yesterday, on the occasion of a press conference, French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde paid tribute to the active role played by the Central European Bank in favour of resolving the debt crisis of European states.
She would not say whether she thought the bank could have done more, for example by increasing their program to buy up the sovereign-coupled bond purchase program.
"I am making my account for my European partners (...) "'
The night before, in Brussels, in his interview with the European Parliament's Economic and Monetary Affairs Commission, the President of the Central European Bank, Jean-Claude Trichet, did not appear to be more articulate in terms of his intentions and content to say that he said that the programme for the purchase of state titles on the secondary market was "conting up" and that we would "see how we will make a decision" during the meeting this Thursday.
The only certainty: The Central European Bank will be guarding its basic unchanging interest rate at 1%, its historically low level since May 2009.
In fact, the purchases of bunk bonds from the Treoid by the Central European Bank have doubled to almost €1.35 billion in the last week.
And thanks to the unreliability of the market conciliators, it made new purchases of Irish and Portuguese bonds yesterday.
Overall, the eurosystem's central banks have purchased €67 billion since May 2010.
Among the market agreements, the anticipation of the continuation of purchases is not in any doubt (see page 29).
Nor do economists expect any significant change of rate.
If the loan operations for more than three months have already disappeared from the Central European Bank's arsenal, the latter is acceding to the unlimited provision of liquid funds under generic terms and for a period of between one week and three months.
Economists expect this mechanism to be extended by several months today.
"I can't imagine changing her agenda in a significant way."
"If not, it would mean accepting the risk of creating a short-term new tension," says Michael Schubert, an economist at Commerzbank.
"The progressive outlet announced during the first quarter of 2011 seems more likely," anticipates Norbert Bräms, an economist at Sal.
Oppenheim.
On the plan for its intervention in the public debt market, "should the European Central Bank have to maintain the purchase volume of its bonds to revitalise the dull market," joins Norbert Bräms.
With regard to the exposures of European banks in the sovereign debt markets in the euro area, the choice is no longer to be made to maintain its presence in the market.
"It needs to replace the market shortage of investors at all costs and act in such a way as to prevent the outbreak of paid performance by the states, which are among the most fragile," the major bond manager testified yesterday.
Because if interest rates take off, countries will be all the more troubled to reduce their debt rather than stabilize it.
It is a rescue of the euro at this price.
In Italy, Berlusconi's government hunches the back
After the start of the week for Italy, the worrying situation has become a little relaxed, with the return flow of bond interest for 10 years yesterday.
A return to temporary peace.
At the end of the meeting with the Minister for Economics, the region's presidents said they had heard Giulio Tremonti qualify the situation as "inregheliable" and that he expected an "unpredictable" weekend, which he then debunked.
In any case, on Tuesday, the deviation from the long German interest rates reached a record of 210 basis points and the price of bankruptcy contracts (CDS) for cover contracts up to 263 points, which caused some upset in Rome.
In the Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi noted that in Spain the derogation with German interest was higher than 400 basis points.
But his right-hand man, Gianni Letta, declared himself "too busy" with the "murdish development of the markets" and a possible outbreak of the Irish.
"The good news is that Italy, the eurozone's third economy, is not like Greece or Ireland."
"The bad news is that he is like Portugal," explains Irwin Stelzer, an economist at the Hudson Institute.
Clearly and uncorrupted, its problem is the absence of growth and lacklustre fiscal inputs, which goes hand in hand and puts the state at risk of not being able to cover for its financing needs.
Brussels' latest forecasts were a cold shower for the government.
Italian growth is expected from now on to 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012... while the budget available to the Senate to analyse it is expected to 1.3% and 2%.
Under these conditions, the European Commission calculates, the public deficit will still represent the 4.3% of gross domestic product next year (against the 3.9% projected government) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
Hence the rumour of a new summary of the additions to the draft state budget, which could be introduced after the holidays, in the tune of €7 billion.
"If necessary, new stringent measures will have to be taken," says the Commissioner for Economic Affairs, Olli Rehn.
For the moment, Italy is accepting the support of international institutions.
"The basic stones of its economy are in order and its calculations are correct, we have been repeating this for a long time," assures Arrigo Sadun, an Italian member of the Governing Board of the International Monetary Fund under pressure from Italy.
"There is no immediate problem, neither short-term or long-term, because despite its significant debt (119.2% of gross domestic product 2011, NDLR), the effort to stabilise required in Italy is less than the effort required of other countries," notes Pier Carlo Padoan, chief economist at the OCDE.
What remains is a question of political instability.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion of no confidence in the Chamber of Deputies and, after that, the elections to be expected at the end of March could be organised.
This would trigger a period of time, not suitable for a decision in a serious crisis.
Europeans are thinking about strengthening anti-crisis mechanisms.
Christine Lagarde reiterated this in a press conference in Paris yesterday: 'I think Europeans demonstrated this on Sunday throughout the day and night, they are obviously very committed, committed to defending their currency and their currency zone.'
Although everything is relative, yesterday's recorded expansion, concerning interest rates on European national bonds, has brought water to the mill to the governments and the Central European Bank.
But we can't talk about the start of normalisation yet.
The Standard & Poor's Notation Office has announced that it could degrade the record of Portugal's debt, the targets to which various speculations focus most.
"Because in May there is a real insufficiently transparent and obvious policy, based mainly on banking systems," says the economist Exane BNP Paribas.
All the more so because "political time is running slower than the market time."
Aware of this interrupted context and the dangers it hides, the European countries are intensifying the discussions, aimed at strengthening the already existing crisis mechanisms.
Informal consultations between the finance ministers, the most affected by the problem identified, and on a wider scale with their G20 counterparts, are progressing very well.
This is with regard to the Eurogroup meetings (Eurogroupe) and the Ecofin grouping from the beginning of next week.
The Central European Bank meeting takes place today.
The programme includes the fate of unconventional measures to support euro area countries with a focus on markets (see above).
As for the European Finance Fund (FESF), its managing director, Klaus Regling, shrank a tour of Asia in Singapore on Tuesday to inform investors from the Far East about the development of the crisis in Europe.
If the aim of this trip is not to increase funds, it is certainly preparing the ground for it to achieve this goal.
The first issue of securities to the FESF is expected for next month.
Yesterday, an official U.S. official told Reuters that the United States would support a possible increase in the mobilised funds by additional direct involvement in the FMI.
The countries at issue in the first instance, Portugal and Spain, are preparing to adopt structural reforms, particularly as regards the organisation of the labour market.
Reforms that join the strict measures with a quicker effect.
Lisbon and Madrid a different path than that used by Greece and Ireland.
The two countries want to avoid, at all costs, asking for international aid before applying their own budgetary corrective to the adjustment, and before deciding on the structural reforms necessary to regain their continued confidence.
The capital participants in the European funds are finally talking about options available to speed up the normalisation process of sovereign bond markets.
On his trip to Paris on November 24, Axel Weber came up with the idea of whether the €750 billion mobilized by Europe and the International Monetary Fund would not be enough, the Union would not hesitate to rejoin the stock of securities.
Economists at Barclays Capital, the player in the very first trade plan with European sovereign claims, reckless with the exchange rate, reckons that an addition of around €100 billion would be enough, "more likely" in the form of a direct provision of financial liquidity.
The means exists: it is the European Financial Stability Mechanism, subsidised by €60 billion to date.
The Council, which has every chance of being tested in European capitals.
Especially when market conditions deteriorated.
Snow and ice: 24 counties have an orange alert.
Snow rations are still causing difficulty in transport, particularly on the second-class roads in Brittany, and there is a risk of disrupting some economic activities.
Twenty-four districts are now in orange on-line for the risk of snow and ice.
L'Eure, l'Eure-et-Loir, les Deux-Sèvres a la Vienne, joined the 20 districts that are already on the declared Orange Emergency, 18 as early as Wednesday afternoon and two, la Dordogne and la Gironde, later at night.
According to Météo France, the considerable flurries of snow are causing problems in the north of la Gironde and les Charentes and light snow on Ile-de-France.
Snow cover from 2 to 5 cm, in places from 7 to 10 cm, is expected in the districts concerned and a blanket of 1 to 3 cm, in places up to 5 in the Paris region.
The districts of Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, du Poitou and the districts of the Basse-Normandia, Ile-de-France and Limousin districts are affected.
The flurries of the snow are large enough to cause traffic problems and disrupt some economic activities, Météo France predicts.
On the coast of the Côtes d'Armor, some districts have banned the passage of heavy freight - trucks over 7.5 tonnes with the Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac route.
Road traffic on the roads of the second class in Brittany is, according to the officers, very difficult and the police recommend to drive their vehicle out when it is really necessary and the operation of some of the trucks has been cancelled for this day.
In Pikardia, school connections were banned for Thursday.
No special measures are foreseen for restrictions on freight transport on Wednesday evening.
The district office "calls on all car drivers to be as careful as possible on the roads and to adapt the driving to the nature of the road."
The Directorate-General for Civil Aviation (DGAC) asked airlines to cancel 25% of their flights at Paris's Roissy Airport and 10% to the Orly on Thursday because of the expected snow flurries.
The DGAC advises passengers to join with their company.
In the UK, Gatwick Airport in the south of London and Edinburgh Airport in Scotland are closed until Thursday's shot.
Metro Grand Paris: first financial proposals
Since the discussion about the modernisation of transport at Ile-de-France is in full swing, billions have been raining.
At least during the discussion.
We are particularly reminded of the 23 billion for the Grand Paris metro, to be built by Société du Grand Paris.
To launch the construction, the state announced the grant of €4 billion.
In theory, this is the amount that will then allow SGP to use part of the financing from its dual source to the contracts.
Today we finally come to the first additions.
The 2010 Finance Reinacification Act, which is being examined by the Finance Committee at the National Assembly this morning, contains the mechanisms provided for to secure these funds.
There are two: creating a special equipment tax and an increase in the office tax on the Ile-de-France.
The first, we will read in the text of the bill, Article 15, is "in favour of the public institution Société du Grand Paris."
It is quantified: 'The yield on this interest is 117 million euros per year'.
The second is the reconstruction of the office rate, which already exists "to be upgraded, to increase the yield from it and to affect Société du Grand Paris" to this increase.
How much would it bring?
The overt.
This is not quantified in the text.
We're close to 4 billion.
"It is specified that these fiscal resources are joining the €4 billion of the capital subsidy, which will be mobilised by the state and injected into Société du Grand Paris according to the project," we can read in an explanation of the reasons.
To us at SGP, this system does not seem shocking.
"From the moment we created the income (both taxes, ndlr), we can cover the studies for three years and then dig up to 4 billion, it's explained."
"This will be budgeted and applied as needed'.
SGP considers that 4 billion will not be credited until 2013 for the 2014 budget.
This mechanism, in which the $4 promised billions belongs to absent subscriptions, risks provoking a rather busy parliamentary debate.
The first public meeting will be on 7 December.
Feeling hackers and diligent spies
The WikiLeaks case has a double meaning.
On the one hand, an overt scandal is exposed, a scandal that seems to be a scandal only in the face of the hypocrisy that governs relations between states, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it speaks of deep change at international level, and anticipates the future dominated by regression.
But let's do it first.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks, this is a confirmation of the fact that every document compiled by the Secret Service (any nation) consists entirely of press cuts.
The "extraordinary revelation" of Americans about the way of sex life of Berlusconi is reported by what everyone has been able to read for months in any newspaper (all owned by all of these two by Berlusconi), and the infamously caricature profile of Cadhafi has long been a joke for cabaret performers.
The rule that secret documents are allowed to consist only of reports already known is essential in the dynamics of the secret services, and not just in this century.
When you go to the bookstore, which is devoted to esoteric literature, you will see that each work is repeated (on Graal, the mystery of Rennes-le-Château, Templars or Masons) exactly what was already written in previous episodes.
This is not only because the author of the occult texts does not like to search for new information (nor knows where to find the non-existent news), but because those who devote to the occult believe only what they already know and what they confirm what they have learned before.
This is the mechanism of Dan Brown's success.
The same goes for classified documents.
The informant is lazy, and lazy (or of a limited spirit) head of the secret services (and, if he is not, he could, as I know, be the editor of the newspaper Libération) who considers only what he admits to be true.
High-secrecy information about Berlusconi, sent by the U.S. Embassy to the State Department, was the same ones that Newsweek had published the week before.
So why did there be so much fuss about these documents to reveal?
On the one hand, they say what every cultured person already knows, namely that the embassy, at least since the end of World War II and since the heads of state can make calls or fly to a joint dinner, they have lost their diplomatic function and, with the exception of a few small national exercises in the representation, have been transformed into spy centers.
Any viewer watching the films about the investigation is well aware that it is only from hypocrisy that it is seemingly ignored.
However, the fact that this is repeated publicly is defamated by the duty of hypocrisy and casts a bad light on American diplomacy.
Second, the idea that any hacker can obtain the most highly classified information of the world's most powerful country is a hard blow, not a not inconsiderate, for the prestige of this state department.
The scandal affects both the victims and its "excerpt."
But let's move from here to the deep truth about what happened.
Once, in the days of Orwell, all power could be taken, like a Big Brother, who controlled every move of his people.
Orvell's prophecy has been proven since the ability to control every movement by making the phone, every transaction you've done, the hotel's visited, the highway used, and so on, has become a citizen the complete victim of a wreath of power.
But when we demonstrate how it goes now, that even the "trumbs" with the most secret information of the powerful cannot resist the intervention of a hacker, the inspection report ceases to be one-way and becomes a circular.
Power is controlled by every citizen, but every citizen, or at least a hacker - elected as a citizen's avename - may know all the secrets of power.
How can a power be sustained that no longer has the ability to preserve its own secrets?
It is true that Georg Simmel has already said that a true secret is a meaningless secret (and the empty secret will never be revealed); it is also true that all information about the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is truly a mysterious, uninvolved secret because it is drawn from public life; but to reveal, as WikiLeaks did, that Hillary Clinton's secret was an empty-hearted mystery is to take away all his power.
WikiLeaks made no mistakes with Sarkozy or Merkel, but he did something big to Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this wound of the accused power so significant?
It is clear that in the future states will not be able to send online sensitive information - that would be tinged for it to be published on a poster plastered on the street corner.
But it's also very clear that with current technology, it's pointless to hope that you can keep the messages undercover over the phone.
There is nothing easier than to find out if and when the head of state was travelling by plane and contacting one of his colleagues.
How will private and sensitive reports be kept in the future?
I know very well that for the moment my prognosis belongs to science fiction and is therefore fantastic, but I have to imagine government officials who transport themselves to discreetly filling formalities along uncontrollable routes and carry only those messages that they know by heart or rather hide the precious information in the backbeat of a shoe.
The information will be preserved in unique copies in drawers closed by key: all in all, the attempt at espionage in the Watergate scandal was less successful than the WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that the technology is now moving sideways forward, that is to say backwards.
One century after a wireless telegraph revolutionized communications, the Internet rehabilitated a telegraph based on wires (telephone).
Video cassettes (analog) allowed cinema lovers to capture the film step by step, move it forward and back and reveal all the secrets of the montage,while now the CDs (number) only allow to jump on the chapters, that is to say, after the macroprobes.
We arrive from Rome to Milan in three hours via high-speed trains from Rome, while we arrive for a plane and a transport journey that involves three and a half hours.
So it is not extraordinary that politics and communication techniques will return to horse-drawn cars.
Last note.
At other times, the press tried to understand what had become more stringent in the embassy's secret.
Now it is the embassies that demand confidential information from the press.
Climate: How France hacked its funding promises
A year after the Copenhagen Accord, it is time to test up to the promises of fast-blocked funding (fast start-up or premature) funding, implemented by developed countries.
And the great French hacks were revealed
In the Copenhagen Accord, developed countries pledged to provide $30 billion in 2010-2012.
The European Union has promised €7.2 billion for three years and France €1.26 billion (that is, €420 million a year).
At the launch of COP16, the EU drew a major ace to convince its partners of the reality of its fast-track commitment: a report specifying the action of its Member States, the press conference, the grand side event, the distribution of the brochure...
Transparent operation invaluable and appreciated on its true value: developed countries and civil society would like all developed countries and civil society to do them the same and with equal degree of precision.
The EU announces that it made €2.2 billion available in 2010, which puts it on the right path to keeping its promise of €7.2 billion in 2012.
But if we focus on the detail, we find things are much more complicated.
Under the Copenhagen Accord, these funds are "new and additional" to ensure that the increased burden is implemented without the detriment of Public Aid for Development.
Unfortunately, there is no consensus on what "new and an additional" means.
While the European Commission proposed harmonisation, some Member States, including France, have blocked the process.
Today, everyone chooses the reference that suits them best.
For example, the European Commission saw 2009 as a reference: international funding has been preserved and it adds 150 million to it for the three-year fast start funding title.
Other countries have selected similar references with annual payment terms or terms at the level of public aid for development.
By contrast, France considers that the financing of "all new projects" of 2010 is 'new and additional'.
In other words, there is no reference to the expenditure of previous periods or the global public aid level for the development of d'Aide publique au développement.
In particular, the total amount of support for France towards developing countries may remain constant (or even reduced), to honour its commitment to "new and additional funding "...
Another crucial element is the distribution of donations and loans.
There is no rule yet, and each chooses his or her own method of calculation.
Some, such as France, they are considering that 1€ borrowed equals €1 to the donated.
Evidently, this is hard to prove: the effort is not comparable.
If the use of loans can be documented for some of the investments that are profitable (often the projects linked to the reduction of emissions, consisting of more efficient technologies), it is foolish to present one euro that we receive as the equivalent of one euro we give... , we should not understand it as a loan price for the creditor country (i.e. the equivalent of the interest rate).
But France can only make such a justification: "compenses" its commitment of 420 million euros, of which 91.5% is made by a loan (EUR 389.8 million) and 8.5% of donations (EUR 36.11 million) - see the EU document to check it out for yourself.
It is the only country of the Union to use a loan on such a scale.
Germany has requested 46% of this place, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia (among others) are complying with their commitments with 100% of their donations.
In other words, when the vast majority of the European Union gives €1 to its promise in satisfaction, France will only give 10 centims and consider this effort to be comparable.
A beautiful juggling piece!
To summarise, in its financing of the "fast start" France operates with a double cheat: on the one hand, the development of the stock over time and, on the other hand, with a real financial burden.
Although it is spending only €36.1 million, it can convince it to spend €420 million "new and additional" in connection with his promises.
The manipulation of the Minister of Finance (because it seems that although Bercy is, who made such decisions) could have a double negative impact, at the same time within the EU (why would the Member States continue to donate when they only need to lend?) and in the negotiations, because developing countries are not completely naive...
The early financing chapter is just a small question, a relatively short-term one, in relation to a series of climate discussions.
But it could be a grain of sand in an enormous machine like the UNFCCC.
Let's hope that's not the case for us.
Whatever this is, it is essential to draw on the lessons of this first year of early funding.
First, France should announce a change in its way of keeping the accounting records for 2011 and 2012, in a spirit of respect for its commitments and decency and fairness to other European Union countries.
But above all, France should avoid a debate on deposits in long-term financing (another crucial chapter currently discussed): we will not escape the issue of 'additionality' or how loans are booked.
France should change its position to become as progressive for these deposits as the others.
Hope is therefore being put in the new Minister for the Environment, Mrs Kosciuo-Morizet, who will come to Cancun next week.
France's surprise fast-track announcement and its vision of "addeduit" and the use of loans could trigger an increase in the level of international confidence needed to be made to move forward in discussions.
A pesticide-related alarm that children ingest.
The 10-year-old will be devoured by 81 different chemicals one day, according to one study published this Wednesday, by the Future Generations Association (ex-Movement for Rights and Maintains of Future Generations).
The Association, which points out that its results "do not have a significant statistical value in view of the low number of samples analysed but are characteristic of the processed issue," bought between July and September foods commonly consumed in four meals and one light meal as a light snack per child of about 10 years in supermarkets in l'Oise and Paris.
These typical dishes, including official recommendations - five pieces of fresh fruit and vegetables, three dairy products and 1.5 litres of water a day - as well as confectionery, were analysed by research laboratories for chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other polluting factors.
The plate's balance is overwhelming: 81 chemicals, of which 42 are carcinogenic, possible or likely, and five substances are among the clear carcinogenic substances, as well as 37 substances that could act as disruptive to internal excrement glands (PEs), according to studies by several institutions such as the International Cancer Research Center.
"While in almost all cases the legal limits for each chemical admitted individually are not exceeded, we can see well in our research that the reality in the exposure of consumers to contaminating substances, perhaps carcinogenic, and/or PE is startling," the association says.
For breakfast, butter and tea with milk contain about ten résidu from themselves with possible carcinogenic effects and three proven to be carcinogens, as is the case with about 20 residues that could disrupt the hormonal system.
The apple, imported from Brazil, reported by the study as a small snack, contains traces of six chemicals, including a banned fungicidal agent in France.
The same goes for the green beans of Kenya, included in lunch, for which studies have discovered traces of strong insecticides banned in the EU.
In addition, steak from minced meat, tuna in a can and even a bun and chewing gum were riddled with pesticides and other chemicals.
In the water from the tap, the analysis revealed the presence of nitrate and chloroform.
The salmon's steak for dinner was "richest" with 34 discovered chemical residues, and even the analysis of the plastic plate used to heat meals in the microwave did not avoid analysis.
The final risk for the consumer of this "contaminating coke shell" is probably underestimated," the study suggests.
The Ecological Europe-Greens Society (EE-LV) proposed "face to the emergency" to establish a moratorium on the use of pesticides to stop the "increase of civilizational diseases."
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Agency (EFSA) examined the residue situation of 365 different pesticides identified in fruits and vegetables consumed in Europe, of which 76 in cereal.
