The Movement for Civil Rights issued a travel warning to Missouri
The National Association for the Advancement of Colorful People (NAACP) has released a warning to colourful people travelling to Missouri on the basis of the state's discriminatory principles and racist attacks.
"The NAACP's travel recommendation for the state of Missouri, with effect from 28 August 2017, calls on African-American passengers, visitors and residents of Missouri to pay extra attention to travel across the state as a result of a series of disputed racially motivated incidents that are currently taking place across the state," the association's statement reads.
The NAACP said it had taken this step on the basis of the current Missouri State Laws, which make it difficult to defend racially motivated acts in court, as well as as the conduct of law enforcement authorities, which unreasonably target minorities.
"There are violations of civil rights.
People are only stopped by police officers because of their skin color, they are attacked or killed," NAACP president for Missouri Rod Chapel told the Kansas City Star.
"We'll be stocked with the largest number of complaints yet."
This is the first warning of its kind issued by the organization for the US State.
Among the incidents cited by the organization were racially motivated profanity directed at black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, a man of black from Tennessee.
Sanders died under contentious circumstances earlier this year after he received gas while traveling across the state and was taken into custody by the police without charge of committing the crime.
The travel recommendation also draws attention to a recent statement by the Supreme Prosecutor's Office of Missouri, which states that black women's black women have a 75% higher chance of being stopped by the police.
"The purpose of the travel recommendation is to alert people and warn their families, friends and co-workers of what might happen in Missouri," Chapel said.
"People must be prepared - they should bring with them money to pay the bail, or alert their relatives that they are going to travel by the state."
According to the FBI's current reporting of hate crime numbers, there were a hundred cases of hateful behavior in Missouri in 2015, putting the state in the 16th place among all states.
The travel warning is also in response to the new Missouri law, which makes it difficult for the company to be sued for discrimination in the provision of accommodation or employment.
The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued a travel recommendation for Texas and Arizona after the states passed an immigration law allowing state officials to detain people on the basis of a violation of the law that the ACLU says is intended to improve racial profiling.
Travel recommendations are usually issued by the State Department for Foreign Country, but recently advocacy groups have resorted to these measures in response to specific laws and trends within the US.
The model was killed by the chef.
Her family doesn't have peace after 12 years!
The murdered one is model Sally Anne Bowman.
The Croydon-born girl was murdered in 2005 by Chef Mark Dixie in the restaurant she worked in, who inflicted stab wounds.
The victim and the killer were to have sex and smoke marijuana together, then killed her.
The killer then sat in a nearby cafe and watched the meticulous forensic work of examining the crime scene.
Dixie, a former chef, was sentenced in 2008 to a medical term in prison for the murder and rape of model Sally.
He admitted only assaulting the juvenile in court, and the lawyer claimed that his client had found the girl dead lying in the street.
After three years, the police convicted him.
Dixie claimed that Sally and her ex-boyfriend, Lewis Sprotson, were arguing on the fateful night.
The killer said, "He was really angry and the girl started screaming after his attack."
"It even attracted the attention of the taxi driver," he said falsely.
The girl, according to his testimony, should have defended herself as much as she could, but to no avail.
Lewis was supposed to stab her in the street.
Dixie's version was proven to be a lie and blamed him.
After the confession, Dixie spoke of his horneness and taste for the girl.
When he dressed her after sex, he felt satisfied and had to smoke marijuana.
Before the incident with Sally, he was at his ex-girlfriend's house, drinking alcohol and taking cocaine, that's what Dexie himself told the police.
He said he felt adrenaline.
Sally started screaming for help, so he attacked her from behind and put his hand over her mouth," Linda added.
And after twelve years, the family is facing further attacks by vandals destroying her grave.
It's been damaged four times in the last six months.
There are so cruel people on the loose who are digging up these graves.
"So our daughter is no longer there," the late girl's mother, Linda, told the Mirror about the disappearance of the ash urn.
Linda was waiting for the attackers, but they always had to attack when she left the cemetery.
Designer vibrators cost tens of thousands.
"Czechs are not prudish or conservative," says Martin Ráž, who runs the Intimity boutique in Prague.
In it you will find design and luxurious erotic aids.
Including those by Czech designer Anna Marešová.
It started quietly, about 12 years ago.
Martin Ráž went out with his friends on a cycling tour of Moravia.
One of them brought not only a bicycle, but also a box full of an unusual-looking vibrator.
"Different mole and dolphins and dolphins, and it was all green and yellow and just different," he tells me over lunch.
His friend and one other companion decided to work with the German manufacturer of design erotic devices Fun Factory, which intrigued Martin, so he offered to help out with marketing.
When the companion left to pursue another profession, he replaced him.
Today, he runs the Intimity boutique in Prague's Benedictská Street, where he sells erotic aids in the way that luxury handbags or shoes are usually offered.
And why would they?
It is also a design item.
Wait, wait a minute, this is what you're talking about at lunch, are you thinking?
Come on, don't be the puritans!
It was Berlin's Fun Factory store, designed by acclaimed designer Karim Rashid, that served as inspiration for the Intimity boutique.
It was opened in 2010 and it was a completely different concept of erotic commerce than everyone here is used to.
No covered windows, all made in a beautiful, demure style, products displayed more like a perfumery.
Martin and his business partner Zdeněk Šebelka began to consider how to accommodate the Prague store, where he should be and how he should be.
The name of Intimity was to both.
"It's related to intimacy, and it's gentle, you might say, as a matter of," he says.
It was followed by the purchase of an internet domain and a search for a suitable space that went in parallel with the various interior visualizations.
In the end, the option that had unfolded the shop into the pleasure garden and the bedroom dominated by the bed dominated by the winner.
It was prepared for us by Dagmar Štěpánová from the FormaFatal studio.
We found the space in 2013.
At first, he didn't seem exactly ideal to us, because he's not on the main street, but he sat for the name of Intimity.
It's intimate.
It's in the alley next to the main one, so no one is eyeing customers," says Martin Ráž.
We wanted to be first.
We wanted to make a business that would be different, with designer nice goods, in an environment where women, who are mostly our customers, feel good.
And not to be ashamed of entering such a deal in the first place.
When I entered the Intimity boutique half an hour earlier, the streets were empty.
Plus, I didn't even feel like I'd go to the sex machine store.
Right at the door, I was surprised by the pure elegance of the interior I know from fashion boutiques.
Even if there is only a female attendant in the store, the fact that women don't shy away from asking for help doesn't mean the man's foot doesn't come in.
For the most part, gentlemen come here to shop for gifts for their girlfriends.
"For the most part, the men can't guess the right size and choose more," Martin smiles at the frequent mistake.
Those are the kind of prejudices, the ingrained cliché that women need some big aids, and it's not true.
So a man in good faith chooses, for example, an unnecessarily large vibrator.
Likewise, men choose mostly black lingerie, whereas the woman usually gravitates towards pink.
The absolute bestseller is currently a product aptly called Satisfyer.
It must be clear from the look on my face that I don't know which one is beating, because Martin immediately explains how it works.
It's kind of a covardator-free stimulator.
I have an adolescent need to chuckle in me with admiration for the serious tone with which I am being given the interpretation.
It's like it's not fallow.
And it doesn't really boast.
It is at a good price and has the perfect user reference.
We didn't believe he'd be so well received.
It's some kind of revolutionary novelty.
The first revolution was caused by a sea-shaped vibrator.
He took the view of the fact that women became more interested in the design of such products.
The second was a vibrator for the We-Vibe pairs.
He completely demolished the taboos that may persist in some men, and that he sees competition in the erotic devices.
"Something different options are made," he continues.
With one engine, with two engines, with remote control.
That's a favorite category.
When a woman's love conjunction, she can have a control officer in her hand and determine the intensity of vibrations.
On the contrary, a certain flop is the category of keying vibrators.
At least for us.
Czech women, it seems, prefer multi-purpose aids and buy classic vibrators, even though they may only use it externally.
Yet in Western Europe, especially with younger customers, it is very popular.
What about the men?
It is hard to say whether a similar concept would work exclusively for men.
It would have to be a little different.
The question is what to offer men," Martin muses.
"We have aids for them, too, but to a limited extent." The most sold is a masturbator, in this case from the manufacturer Tenga.
It does not appear to be an anatomical imitation of the vagina, but "more like a shower gel or as an egg or a futuristic object.
They focus a lot on functionality and on the experience of use.
In Japan, things are very different.
It's astonishing in me.
I thought Japanese women were very partial to erotic aids, I object.
"That's the Internet reality," it's explained.
The mundane one is completely different.
Here in Europe, erotic aids are more associated with being used by women.
They are perfectly normal for men in Japan, and they are taboo for women.' Just out of curiosity - what the Japanese brand Tenga, which is represented at the Intimity boutique, sells globally, still accounts for about half of what is sold only in Japan.
In our waters
Czechs and Czechs are not prudish.
On the contrary, we are a fairly accommodating nation.
Certainly unlike in countries such as Catholic Poland or Italy.
The typical dealer of the store is between the ages of 35 and 50 and "already has some experience with both sex life and some aids.
She's coming for something nice, better of a quality to fill in her partner's life, or for herself." Martin Ráž and his business partner Zdeněk Šebelka take care of it in order to convince themselves with each product if it is perfectly functional.
We also don't want to go into specialities like bondage and latex, because we both have no space for that, and it doesn't really come here.
Such things could discourage the ones we're trying to target.
Which are people who have always been shy about going to the sex shop because they were afraid of something like that peeking out at them.
A lot of the products on the shelves are really appealing.
This is also due to the selection of renowned renowned brands.
Some of them even won design awards, including the Red Dot Design Award.
The first ever awards was the aforementioned seahorse "and this triggered a change in the whole industry.
It began to abandon cheap materials and, on the contrary, work with the wholesomeness, started to produce other designs, different colours...
The nice thing is that the Czech is behind the design of some, the popular designer Anna Marešová.
I have to say that I was quite pleasantly surprised by how many people buy those design items Whoop.de.doo from Anna Marešová, even though they are relatively more expensive.
There are customers who go directly for Venus balls by Anna Marešová.
She did a really huge piece of work by presenting exactly what we are trying to present in the Czech Republic and abroad - that erotic aids can be done differently, nicely, with a story.
Anna's story began as a school job.
Now it is a finished product, which is also produced in our country.
I wanted to control the production process and I also wanted to know from what materials and how Whoop.de.doo products are made.
Because it's not a mass-product, but a small series, it's certainly more expensive than the big series.
I may be going up a bit of a stream, but it seems important to me to maintain the development in the Czech Republic.
It could well be that in a few years we will no longer be able to produce anything," Anna, who agrees with Martin, describes the situation to me later in that our company is becoming more and more open.
It is not met with a negative or rejection attitude.
At most, people are said to be embarrassed.
"But they, too, start to smile." Currently, Anna Marešová has a vibrator on offer, for which you can have a personal message, and this year she is also planning her own lubricant.
The next year should be added to the vibrating eggs and other novelties.
Borders of healthy sex
I'm interested in where the line of what's okay lies.
Is there anything Martin Ráž doesn't sell anymore?
It's so hard to define.
What comes to one of them normal, another may find it absolutely abnormal, so we are more likely to define ourselves by the range of branded manufacturers.
None of them are embarking on any extremes.
Before we say goodbye, I have one last question: What was the craziest demand they got?
Just this week, an e-mail came in in which a lady was asking for a masturbation aid for her boyfriend with a naturate twenty-eighth centimeters long.
So we had to write to her that we didn't have anything like that.
There's still a question of whether we were being made fun of," Martin says to me with a suspicious look.
That, too, happens from time to time...
A shot for Karel Gott.
After two Alzheimer's cancer!
His friend Karel Štědrý is battling a serious illness.
Karl Gott's best friend is battling a disease that steals all people's memories.
"Yes, it is unfortunately true," the singer himself confirmed to the sad information.
I know about my illness and so far, given the circumstances, I'm pretty good at it.
"I take the medications to slow down the accompanying phenomena of the disease," he added, thanking the loved ones for their support.
The entire extended family rallied to make his life easier for Karl.
Wife Eva tries to be at home as much as she can, her daughters from his first marriage, and the daughters from their first marriage, Zuzana and Teresa, the son Karel said by Karlas, is also commuting to his dad's house in White Mountain.
Generally, he battled cancer twice, and passed on his experience to the Nightingale to support him in his demanding treatment.
He's done with sixty chemo treatments.
He was able to return to work and on the tennis court and the ski slopes.
"I have a dramatlogist foretold that I will be here by the age of ninety," Karel told Blesku.
He's a fighter.
He's still eager to sing.
"I still repeat the words of the songs so I don't forget them," Karl admitted.
The same illness is now being fought in the institute by the actress Květa Fialová.
Do you have a patient with Alzheimer's in the family?
Look at how to treat him.
The Chilean parliament has lifted the abortions ban, the law will be considered by the CPS.
In Chile, an absolute ban on abortion is still in force, so it must not be done for health reasons either.
"I am sorry that legislators have filed a complaint with the Constitutional Court and that now ten people will decide what we have been arguing about in parliament for more than two years," complained Socialist Senator Isabel Allende.
The Constitutional Court in Chile has ten members and is expected to receive a new president at the end of August, who is close to the opposition, according to AFP.
The law abolishing the absolute ban on abortions, initiated by current President Michelle Bachelet, was approved by the Senate 19. July.
The right-wing opposition then announced that it would challenge the law in court because it believed it violated the unborn child's right to life.
Members postponed the vote on the bill last month until it was being analyzed by a joint parliamentary commission.
On Wednesday, the motion was approved by the MPs, and after that the Senate did so again.
Under the new legislative amendment, abortion should stop being punishable in three cases: if a woman's life is at risk, if the fetus has no chance of survival, or if the pregnancy originated from rape.
Similar exceptions had existed in Chile since 1931, according to the Spanish newspaper El País, before women were granted the right to vote there in 1949.
The absolute ban on abortions in 1989 was imposed by right-wing dictator Augusto Pinochet, just a few months before he left the presidency.
Chile is one of the few countries in the world where there is an absolute ban on abortions.
The others are Nicaragua, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Haiti, Malta and Honduras.
In Salvador, for example, about 20 women are now behind bars serving up to 30-year prison sentences for abortion.
In many cases, according to human rights defenders, it was a spontaneous abortion, which the court called a murder.
Is there anything sacred?
The target of Trump's White House is now the Statue of Liberty
The unmistakable sign of regime change is the criticism of the statues.
The Americans could tell about it as well as everyone else's - see the carefully staged overthrow of the statue of Saddam Hussein in Baghdad's Firdos in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the Trump regime's key supporters, knew what was going to happen when, in a heated debate with CNN reporter Jim Acosta on the president's proposals to drastically restrict legal immigrants, set off with a symbolic axe on the Statue of Liberty.
It is fitting that Miller did not attack the statue as such.
For that, he would be lynched by a crowd of cruise ship owners and imitators of the Statue of Liberty.
However, he attacked its significance, specifically the fact that in 1903 a plaque with the famous poet Emmy Lazarus was placed on the pedestal, and only 17 years after the completion of the monument.
Miller rebuked Acosta by saying, "I don't want to go down in history here, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that casts light on the world.
The poem that was placed on the pedestal retrospectively, and to which you refer, is not part of it."
Miller is actually right, but as he put it, it's not about history.
These are, above all, the startling words of Emmy Lazarus, which resonate today - inviting them not only immigrants, but the poorest of the poorest: "Let it come to me who's down, who's poor, who can barely breathe freely, who's a miserable worm in the middle of the full cities."
And it is in modern times that we can better watch these "minded worms" on our screens.
Miller didn't try to criticize poetry - he wanted to make it clear that these people were not welcome in the US.
This conflict about the meaning of the statue is part of a comprehensive political and cultural war: it is essentially a conflict about the importance of America.
Emma Lazarus, like her friends, who had sought to set a plaque with a poem on the base of the statue after her death, knew well enough that she was embarking on a high political game.
The statue was supposed to express the union of the French and American Republican governments by representing the classic theme, the female embodiment of freedom.
Emma Lazarus has altered this meaning: in her poem, the female character is not abstract, but she has her own voice.
He also has a very different name: the mother of the exiled.
Merging the poem with the idea of a woman is a brilliant feminist move and a devastating attack on American nativism.
And in the same way that Emma Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, the right-wingers have long sought to reverse that meaning.
The well-known commentator Rush Limbaugh - Jana the Baptist on Trump's rise to power - argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty does not actually invite anyone to the country, but represents an early neo-constructivismism, bringing the American flame to the backward world: "The Statue of Liberty is striding forward.
It carries the torch of freedom from the United States and offers it to the rest of the world.
The march is not meant to illuminate the journey to the United States."
Surprisingly, Limbaugh is alluding to an important point.
The meaning of the statue depends on the point of view.
Emma Lazarus describes the statue from the point of view of an exhausted and damned passenger, who often arrives in a new land after a long and terrifying cross-air ocean voyage hopefully in his heart.
This is literally a view of the world through the eyes of people seeking refuge and the chance for a better life.
From this point of view, the statue expresses hope and listens to their needs.
And that, of course, is a perspective that Miller and Trump certainly won't recognize.
Their torch is not to illuminate the path, but to stir up the hatred that is their only source of power.
World Athletics Championships 2017: Neil Black sings praise for Scottish members of the British team
Eilidh Doyle recalls the days when the British team had only two Scottish members
The director of the United Kingdom Athletics Federation, Neil Black, said that the strong skit of 16 Scots in the World Cup team would be a "huge benefit for the team."
For the World Championships in London 2017, which starts on Friday, a record number of Scottish athletes has been selected.
Black believes that "something special is happening" in Scotland and British athletics could learn a lot from Scots.
"We are trying to understand this and adapt to it - we will work on it," Black said.
"I've spoken to the people of the Scottish Sports Institute, and they think it has something to do with what they've done.
Scottish athletics officials think it has to do with what they've done.
British athletics: it has to do with what they've done.
People on the streets think so, too.
Whatever it is, it's absolutely amazing."
Several Scottish athletes will seek medals, including Laura Muira and Andrew Butchart - who will compete with Sir Mo Farah in the 5000m race, while Eilidh Doyle has been elected captain of the team.
"The Eilidh is modest.
Her opening speech was amazing," Black said.
"Several athletes, whether Scots or athletes of other nationalities, came out of the room with a sense of overwhelming pride and motivation.
The passion and undisguised feelings Eilidh was talking to were unrepeatable."
The silver medalist at the Commonwealth, who will compete in the 400m hurdles at her fifth World Championships, said she was "unbelievable" that there are 16 Scottish athletes in the British team.
The previous record from 1983 and 2015 is seven.
The midfielder, Muirová set five British and two European records in the last year alone.
At the World Championships he will take part in the 1500m and 5000m.
Another of the great Scots Scots is Chris O'Hare, who will run the 1500m track. This season he won the British team races and the Annual Games.
Doyle recalls her first championship, in which Lee McConnell was the only other Scottish member.
The team captain led the team to be "very proud" of the fact that not only a large number of her female colleagues made it to the team, but in many cases will also be attacking the final and the medals.
"The extraordinary thing about being the team captain is that I was elected by the other members of the team. It was a great honour for me, but the knowledge that I was elected by the team members is all so pleasing,' she added.
"I'm obviously very proud of all the Scots who made it to the team.
It shows where we've moved up to.
They're athletes who will be thinking of the top spots on the stage.
And my opening statement?
Yes, I think she did well.
I merely drew attention to the fact that we can be proud of this year's championship because it is being held on home soil.
It is important to take advantage of the support of the home fans and rejoice in the fact that we are back at the Olympic Stadium.
I've been given a second chance to race and I'll enjoy the incredible atmosphere."
Blocking critics on Facebook: don't apply for public office unless you can't stand voter criticism
Our father knew about his criticism.
George Washington's Americans loved, but it wasn't long before the paper started to criticize him for anything, from domestic politics to his political views.
Yes, this criticism did not leave him cold.
But he didn't try to silence the critics.
Because in 1783 Washington said, "Freedom of speech can be taken away from us - and we will be guided as sheep to slaughter."
This brings me to Maryland is Governor Larry Hogan, who he needs to work on starting to behave like Washington.
Hogan's employees blocked and deleted the posts of at least 450 people who freely expressed their views on his official Facebook page.
This week, he was sued by the American Civil Liberties Union for these acts.
The governor's staff dismissed the suit as ground-evulously, and many views of "who cares" about the online commentaries.
"It's just Facebook," said many users.
Yet it matters.
Especially the moment it's when it comes to people like Hogan.
In an absolutely democratic state, he is a hugely popular Republican governor.
He boasts the second highest popularity of all 50 governors.
Hogan is not irascible.
As you can see, it runs its state with confidence in its own own and strictly adheres to the principles.
It turned out to be skilful in using Facebook as the main means of association with its constituents - the first photo with the bald head is no exception for the release of the first photo with its head after undergoing chemotherapy.
Blocking people who visit the governor's site - which is a public forum, labeled as official and managed by his employees paid with taxpayers' money - is pointless and ultimately dangerous.
In an interview with the Washington Post, Hogan's spokeswoman, Amelia Chasse, defended the governor, saying that the commentary was blocked from a position to host the posts.
But to use an image of Internet trolls, spamer or angry people is too easy.
The Washington Post interviewed several real people who had their contributions deleted.
And that is precisely what they are - the real people who speak to their elected leaders; the teacher, the entrepreneur and the pastor, no trolls.
As everyone said, their comments were polite and considerate, not blasphemous.
In his commentary, the pastor quoted the Bible, appealing to Hogan's Catholic faith.
Bowie Lakshmi Sarma Ramani's lawyer, Md. asked about hate crimes, but her comment was not hateful.
"I commented in a way that I was disappointed with his lack of response to hate crimes and other up-to-date news," she wrote in the Washington Post's notes.
"I don't like the idea that once a certain number of people comment on the same subject, they are described by some by some as a promotion of so-called collective efforts, instead of being recognized as a larger group of interested citizens."
What the governor's staff called "focused spam interest" would probably be called "obhaling."
The modern Facebook era allows us to easily manage posts by blocking critics or deleting negative comments.
It is far more convenient than in the past, when the same procedure would require staff to be taken to the streets, where they would collect and burn out all the printouts with criticism or arrest or silence the Protestants.
And that's exactly what's happening, only in digital form.
Hogan is not the last public official to be criticized for defaming Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is facing legal action from Twitter users who have been denied access to his account.
One of the first important regulations was born in Virginia last week.
Speaker Loudoun County Board of Supervisors violated, according to District Judge James C. Cacheris' first amendment in Alexandria, where she prevented one of the voters from accessing her Facebook page.
Governor Matt Bevin (R) from Kentucky also received a visit from the ACLU for his use of Facebook and Twitter.
This should not be so difficult.
In the days of Washington, the low cost of postage had virtually the same impact as the Internet.
Between 1776 and 1800 the number of daily newspapers was quadrupled, and his position as leader was questioned by many anonymous writers.
And even in those days, Washington had to deal with anonymous trolls.
People, writing under the pseudonymous as "Juricola", "Valerius", "Belisarius" and "Portius," wrote letters to newspapers and questioned Washington's decisions.
According to historical documents gathered by the people of the online project Papers of George Washington Project, petitions were hoarding in his office to criticize his position against the Treaty of Amity, Commerce, and Navigation deal with Britain.
He did not silence them.
Freedom of expression, disapproval and intimidation lies at the very foundations of our nation.
And the real leader must accept it.
Czechs quickly used free roaming, using more data abroad than at home.
Abroad, Czechs consume more of their tariff than at home.
They are most likely to move in Austria, but the consumption of data is dominated by Croatia in the summer season.
On holiday, they both have more time to browse on the web, under the umbilical institution they usually do not have the option to connect to Wi-Fi.
Beach, bathing and smart phone in hand.
This is the typical Czech holiday in Croatia after customers can use the services of the local operators at domestic prices.
This is clear from the fresh statistics of O2.
Thanks to the new roaming rules, most Czech travellers abroad have more data available within the flat-rate than at home.
It is therefore no surprise that in Croatia, where a minimum of our people travel over the winter, data consumption has risen 50-fold this summer season.
Italy came second in the list of data consumed.
The Czechs are summoned for the most minutes from Germany, where many go on business even during the summer.
According to data from the Association of Czech Travel Office, Croatia is visited by 800,000 Czechs a year, making it our most popular holiday destination.
However, people here have traded the book for sharing experiences using a mobile phone.
The record was this year's 7. July.
"Tens of a million photographs would fit into the transferred data," said the director of the O2 mobile segment, Silvia Cieslar.
Although Croatia leads in the volume of data, the highest number of Czech users are in neighbouring countries.
Austria is in first place, followed by Germany and Slovakia.
Croatia is fourth and Italy sixth.
We go to Austria for hiking and an active holiday for which we do not have as much time to browse the internet.
"In addition, the Czechs are heading to the Adriatic through Austria," Cieslarová explained.
While data has seen high year-on-year growth in data after the loosening of roaming charges, growth is much lower for telephony.
The number of minutes chewed in roaming has doubled compared to last year.
By a huge margin over other countries, Germany dominates here.
"Corporating calls are used by corporate business travel customers," Cieslar added.
Ronan Rafferty hopes for home atmosphere at Renaissance Club
Former golf leader Ronan Rafferty will hope for a relaxing atmosphere at the Renaissance Club in the Scottish West Lothian district over the next three days, hosting the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open.
Ronan Rafferty, who is from Northern Ireland, lost to Paul Eales to Paul Eales at the nearby golf course on his way to the final on his way to the final. This year, he will perform the role of tournament ambassador as the club's founder and CEO, Jerry Sarvadi.
"I watched the Renaissance Club grow up slowly in front of my eyes and this year's tournament will show the world its beauty," Rafferty said.
"Players will be able to enjoy the first-class quality of the pitch.
Jerry did a great job.
He is a fervor of this game and is proud of his achievements.
This year's tournament is in the right hands."
Englishman Eales will defend the championship for the first time, despite having won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour during his 32-year career.
"I feel good about it," the Southport golfer said.
"I didn't have the chance to defend my victory at the Extremadura Open because a year after my victory, the tournament was cancelled.
Returning to this part of the country is magical.
It's a beautiful place to play golf.
I remember last year when for me and my wife, Sharon, the win was a really big deal.
It was a beautiful time I won't forget."
Gary Orr, who joined the European Senior Tour, is returning to his home ground after turning 50 from the region this year.
This event will be his first appearance since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
'I'm always happy to play on home soil,' Orr said of Helensburgh.
"You want to do well and you feel a lot of pressure.
I really liked to play again and I think I'm doing well.
I'm happy with the result so far."
The trio of players will also be joined on the field by former Masters winner Ian Woosnam and senior tournament winners Paul Broad Broadstar, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are among the six Scottish players on the pitch; the others are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
Admission to the tournament is free. The parking fee is £5 for a car with one passenger and £10 for a car with two or more passengers.
All profits will be donated to Prostate Cancer UK.
Poverty and death in the Indonesian land of gold
When Bardina Degei cooks dinner, she doesn't use the stove.
In fact, he rarely uses a pelvis.
In her wooden shack, located in the capital of Paniai Enarotali in the Indonesian province of Papua, a woman usually simply throws a sweet potato - in the language of the local "nota" - directly into the fire.
After half an hour, he remembers the potato and he likes to enjoy it with unwashed hands.
Bardina sits on muddy ground - the cottage is not equipped with furniture - where he also performs his daily work, such as washing laundry in cloudy water from a nearby molding mold.
A bucket in a room without a roof substitute for the toilet.
As the youngest of her husband's four wives, she was not assigned any field to cultivation.
Polygamy is common here.
Working late at night poses a danger: most of the village's men are unemployed and often drink alcohol. In addition, the village houses soldiers.
"Friday after five o'clock no one dares to wander around the village," Bardina says.
It is a rare glimpse of everyday life in the highlands of Papua, the former Dutch colony, which was declared part of Indonesia in 1969 after a controversial referendum, when just 1026 elders were forced into voting in the form of a public hand-up in the hands before the occupying army.
The current movement protesting against the Dutch rules quickly turned its anger back to the Jakartan government, which controlled the entire region, with the exception of foreign journalists or civilian lawmakers.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua - the independent Papua New Guinea occupied the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is such a distant and ravaged city, which takes place after a 90-minute flight from the capital of the province of Jayapura to Nabire, and then a five-hour gicorn-covering gistling.
Mass transport at this point is not working.
The city of 19,000 people consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences, roofs of wool sheets in shades of grey and rusty.
Very few Indonesians, let alone journalists, and virtually no foreigners, looked at the post.
Before the arrival of Christians, the locals worshipped a god named Ugo Tame.
And that's not all.
"We weren't used to wearing these dresses," says Bardina, pointing to his colorful, hand-knitted turban, dark T-shirt and a shining skirt.
"We used to only wear leaves."
Papua is Indonesia's poorest province - 28% of the population lives below the poverty line, and the local infant mortality and literacy is one of the worst in Asia.
But it is also the Indonesian land of gold.
The world's largest and most profitable gold mine, Grasberg, owned by Phoemirox, Freeport McMoran, is only 60 miles from Paniai - a rocky province of about the size of New Jersey, home to about 153,000.
In 2015 alone, Freeport mined $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper here.
In addition, Papua supports logging worth an estimated $78 billion.
Nevertheless, these riches are a source of suffering for Papuans and a guarantee of oppression by the powerful Indonesian army.
An investigation conducted in 2005 by the New York Times shows that Freeport paid local military officials and troops about $20 million between 1998 and 2004, including $150,000 for one officer.
Papuans calling for self-government threaten this golden goose and are therefore severely suppressed.
According to human rights activists, more than 500,000 Papuans have been killed since 1969, and thousands more have been raped, tormented, and imprisoned by the Indonesian army.
Mass murders in the tribal area of Papua during the 1970s were equal to genocide, as the Asian Human Rights Commission said.
Last year alone, the region's Indonesian police arrested more than 3900 peaceful Protestants.
We Will Lose Everything, a 2016 report by the Archdiocese of Brisbanez. The 2016 Drawer, describes the atrocities that took place last year, such as extrajudoduced executions, torture - according to another report, is particularly popular with electrocution - and the brutal suppression of peaceful protesters.
"It is difficult to calculate the number of victims because incidents occur weekly," said Andreas Harsono, an Indonesian research fellow at Human Rights Watch.
The situation was aggravated by the fact that papuan sources attract colonists to Indonesia.
Of the provincial's 3.5 million people, 83% claim to be Christianity, but demography is changing with an influx of Muslim immigrants from the Indonesian islands - Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
The Java canteens sell fried chicken and gado, or a mixture of vegetables with peanut sauce.
Local people are fighting for survival.
"Imigrants started selling chicken and vegetables at traditional markets at lower prices than the local Papuans," explains 22-year-old Abeth You, who was born to Paniai and moved to work in the capital of the province of Jayapura.
"The original inhabitants of Papua - mama-mama (women) - have thus lost their jobs."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, who is nicknamed Jokowi, promised to address inequality and rights violations as part of his 2014 presidential campaign.
The former carpenter secured and secured his trip to the presidential palace in the Yard 27 of Papua's 29 districts, including Paniai.
But in Papua, very little has changed, and the locals feel betrayed.
"Our heart was broken because in 2014 we voted for the Jokpwi in the hope that he would heed our call for justice," You said.
The fact is that just two months after the inauguration of Jakowi inauguration in October, Paniai had a major shock.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children sang Christmas songs at a campfire in the town of Enarotali when two Indonesian soldiers on motorbikes emerged from the gloom of the night.
Two of the surprised children were told to turn on their lights.
One of the soldiers was touched by this rebuke and tone, which she was uttered and later returned with four other soldiers, local vicar Yaved Tebai said.
Two of the soldiers in the drunken state pursued a group of children and beat them with the butt of their weapons, the victims and witnesses of the event said.
One of the soldiers then fired at a group of children.
One of the children, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was beaten so hard that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, someone set fire to the nearby electoral commission building, and the following day things escalated.
About 1,000 young Papua men and women gathered on the football field in front of the local police station and army headquarters, demanding justice.
They came with the ceremonial hunting bows and performed a waita dance - in which it is run in a circle and the singing of the birds is imitated - the Papuan tribe of Mee Pago.
Several Protestants began throwing rocks at the buildings.
With escalating tension, the soldiers were ordered to the radio: "If the crowd tries to resist at least three times, you have permission to shoot," the TIME weekly said in an official document whose contents were never published in local media.
Yeremias Kayame (56), the head of the Enarotali district, recognized the imminent danger and urged residents to break up to their homes.
But no one was sloppy with his words.
"When I turned around, someone shot me in the left wrist," he told TIME on the porch of his brightly painted wooden house.
Kayame still doesn't know who the shooter was, but he said the bullet belonged to one of the soldiers present.
"There were a lot of people around and a lot of shots were fired," he added.
One of the local residents, Alfius Youw, was hit three times, according to his cousin, who witnessed the shooting.
"I ran to the body to make sure it was really him," Yohanes, who, like many Indonesians, used only one name, said to TIME.
"I saw that he was dead... I kissed him."
Papuan Police Inspector General Yotje Mende told the newspaper that his officers were merely "ensuring" a station under attack.
"We must defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us," Papuan Police Press Secretary, Commissioner Pudjo Sulistiyo, said in 2015.
"It's a matter of life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five protesters were killed and many escaped injuries.
News of the murders was overtaken by Jakarta media the following day.
Three weeks later, Jokowi gave a heated speech in Jayapura and expressed his understanding for the families of the victims and promised to deal with the violence in Papua.
"I demand an immediate solution to this problem so that it can never be repeated," he said.
National Security Minister Wiranto announced in October 2016 that he would introduce an out-of-court mechanism to resolve the violent acts that had taken place in the past.
Almost immediately, however, there were excuses.
"Most of the violent acts were long overdue.
Some of them occurred in the 1990s and some at the beginning of the 21st century.
What I'm saying is that we are determined to punish these acts of violence, but it will not be an easy task," he said.
In an interview from 5. However, for the weekly TIME, held in Jakarta, Wiranto claimed that he did not plan to introduce any measures in Papua.
Instead, he said that "all the cases will be referred to the court."
Wiranto, whom the UN has accused of "criminals against humanity" on the basis of more than one thousand deaths during the independent elections of 1999 in East Timor - said that 11 human rights violations in Papua have so far been settled, including the incident in Paniai.
Families of the victims of the shooting in Paniai welcomed his claims with mistrust.
"I've been asked four times in the last three years, but I've never done anything until now," Yohanes said.
"I'm tired."
As he says, a few years later, he still lives in fear.
"I'm afraid," as he claims.
"I'm afraid of being arrested by the army or being shot."
His brother, Yacobus, confirmed the view of many residents of Paniai, who are afraid to speak out about the incident.
In his words, he was beaten by members of the army after he helped bury four of the victims.
"After the body burial, the army started looking for me," he said.
And the shooting is not yet stopping.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police fired on villagers in the neighboring Deiyai.
The scuffle in which one person died and another 17 were injured were between villagers and a construction company manager who refused to provide assistance in transporting the man unconscious to the hospital.
Ravianus Douw (24), who drowned while fishing in a nearby river, died on his way to the hospital.
Angry villagers protested in front of the company building.
According to police, the villagers threw rocks at the members and were answered to them with a warning shooting.
However, local residents claim that the mobile brigade (Indonesian paramilitaristic police) has opened fire in a crowd, killing one person.
"About panic, we were afraid of retribution," said 9-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lives near the hospital and witnessed the arrival of the injured.
"I didn't leave the house two days."
The Deiyaisan Parliament demanded the punishment of the police officers involved and the withdrawal of the mobile brigade from the area.
The Paniai has always been a thorn in the Indonesian government's side.
The lack of meaningful development only exacerbates the separation of indigenous people of the tribes of the Mee, Moni, Dani, and Damal tribes, who live in the central highlands.
Many of them joined the Pasuai Liberation Movement (OPM) - an army of rebels that protects the Papuans' rights by attacking and abducting Indonesian police officers.
Some of the OPM leaders come from Paniai. He is one of Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
As a result of the attacks, the military has arrested and arbitrarily detained thousands of Paniai residents in recent years, all on the pretext of "ensuring national sovereignty."
Some of them will never be seen again.
Paniai is known among the people of Papuai as a "tragic and forgotten place."
Oil pets poverty in the fire.
The few rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for the locals.
And the bread is unattainable anyway.
The inhabitants of this growing their food: mainly sugary potatoes, fruit and leafy vegetables.
Women work in the fields; each of them cultivates four or five fields of sweet potatoes.
Most of the harvest is intended for the needs of the family, with the remainder sold on the local market.
Ten of the sweet potatoes cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Since Nabire Airport opened more air routes and new immigrants began pouring into the country, economic inequality between native-born Papuans and immigrants has begun to flow.
So many jobs are usually filled by more educated and richer immigrants.
Papuans rarely have the necessary capital and education to go into business.
"Young people are moving out of the villages because of a lack of job and money," said John Gobai, chairman of the tribal council of Paniai.
Thanks to the isolation, Papua province is hidden from the world.
This is also helped by strict rules for foreign journalists.
At the beginning of this year, two French journalists - Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp - were expelled from the papua for "lack of cooperation with the authorities" all this despite the fact that they were given such a rare filmmaking permit.
In his election campaign, Phelim Kine, deputy director of the Asian branch of Human Rights Watch, promised to abolish the strict rules for journalists and achieve transparency and development. However, this never happened.
"Free journalists who work in the rebellious easternmost areas of Papua and West Papua are at high risk: non-recognition of visas and blacklisting," he said in a statement.
The lack of news from the offshore of journalists means that the international pressure on Indonesia's in Papua is largely limited.
In March, six Pacific nations - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - urged the UN Human Rights Council to investigate "distortry and widespread violent acts" in Papua, including the shooting in Pania.
These countries have also supported OPM in the past.
Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesman Arrmanatha Nasir shook off the charges when he told journalists in Jakarta that: "A democratic system still applies in Indonesia and the media is free, so it is difficult to disguise evidence of human rights abrections."
Local people are calling for the participation of foreign governments.
When the official delegation from the Netherlands, headed by the Human Rights Envoy, Kees Van Baar, visited Jayapurau on 4 May, local people cheered, according to a source who also attended the meeting but wanted to remain anonymous, the slogan "we want to be free."
There are other elections scheduled for 2019 in Indonesia, but the peppers say they will not vote for Jokowi.
"Jokowi is a man with good intentions but is surrounded by people associated with the shooting in Paniai," said Gobau, the tribal council chairman.
He wants Jokowi to know that the people of Paniai - in addition to living in constant fear of a robbery army - were rolling in poverty, miserable education, and the health system.
Gobai argues that the people of Paniai, like the other Papuans, regard their vote as a "lu" to pay Jokowi back.
"They don't want money, they demand justice," he added.
Despite the threats and intimidation of the family of the victims of the Panya shooting, the last symbolic act of defiance continues: they are burying the bodies of the victims on the property opposite the police and army stations.
Knowing that justice will never be done enough, at least he will not allow the responsible persons to forget their crimes.
"A member of our family was killed," Yacobus said, his head down.
"What can we do?"
The French navy intercepted a huge cocaine shipment to Australia.
The French Navy intercepted a yacht in the Pacific carrying 1.46 tonnes of cocaine worth about $256 million.
The shipment was to Australia.
The intervention arrested the crew of the ship, apparently made up of people from Lithuania and Latvia.
The yacht, named Afalina, sailed from South America, and after being detained, towed it to the port in the city of Nouméa, the capital of the French overseas territory of the New Caledonia Ocean in the Pacific Ocean.
The Australian Intelligence Agency said it would seek, in cooperation with its international partners, to determine exactly where and where the drugs were directed and where to go and to uncover the "Lithuanian syndicate."
"We are grateful to the French authorities for the measures that have stopped a large number of drugs bound for Australia," said its Executive Director, Col Blanch.
The drugs were destroyed in Noumée this week.
Australia is an attractive target for their smugglers because of high street prices of drugs.
The country is also facing the problem of growing numbers of people suffering from drug addiction.
The current crackdown is not the first in recent times.
Last month, three men were charged with transporting large amounts of drugs from the United States to Australia, which they attempted to smuggle across the Pacific Ocean in a small plane.
Seniors don't feel thirsty, drinking has to be remembered.
The problem may be in homes for the elderly, the solution, according to the doctor at the Geriatric Clinic of the General University Hospital in Prague, Pavla Mádlová, could be an infusion of saline, which is injected with a thin needle under the skin.
But these are only applied in medical facilities.
The older you get, the more water in your body drops.
"Moreover, they lose their thirst, so seniors generally take in less fluids and dehydrate very quickly," said Madi.
Two grand should be drunk for sure.
"But getting so many fluids into the old person is a big deal," she added.
In homes for the elderly, she says, no doctor often does.
In hospitals, they routinely deal with dehydration with infusions.
"I think that it should be gradually introduced there, too, so that they can receive subcutaneous infusions," she said.
In a day, she says, up to two pint bottles of saline can be delivered to old people.
Fluid deficiency can cause malaise, headache and reduced performance.
Dehydration will prove to be a complete loss of self-sufficiency.
"One day, the old man says he can't get out of bed, he talks in confusion," she added.
In the case of neglect, it can result in a stroke.
The blood thickens and clogs the blood vessel in the brain, and there is also a risk of kidney failure.
Lying patients should not be covered with a blanket, a top-fat sheet.
The problem may also be one-off diapers.
"It is more nursing, but the ideal would be to uncover the patient from time to time and let the skin air out," the doctor said.
Dubai was on fire for the second time with the Torch skyscraper
In Dubai on Friday, one of the world's largest residential skyscrapers went on fire. Firefighters had to evacuate all residents of the 337-meter-high and 79-storey building.
In the last two years, this is the second fire in this high-rise building, which bears the fitting name The Torch.
All the residents of the building were evacuated and there were no injuries. The cause of the fire is unknown.
"We were asleep and the alarm woke us up. We heard the screams.
It took us ten minutes to run down from the 50th floor," Geroge, one of the skyscraper's residents, told Reuters.
Dubai Civil Defense said firefighters managed to get the fire under control around 4 a.m. (at GMT) and continued to cool the building.
Government officials added that they provide alternative accommodation for the affected residents.
The incident could again spark debate over the safety of the materials used to clad high-rise buildings around the world.
The results of an investigation launched by the Torch skyscraper management after a fire in 2015 showed that the most damaged linings and external panels used for decoration or isolation were the most damaged.
British police said the system of isolation and panelling of London's Grenfell Tower could have contributed to the rapid spread of the fire in the June fire, which killed nearly 80 people.
The survey results showed that more than one in five passengers to the US were leitting banned items on board the aircraft
A survey of passengers showed that more than twenty percent consciously or unconsciously made banned items through the U.S. government Transportation Security Administration checkpoint. At least six percent of the passengers boarded a plane with a knife or other sharp object.
Less than one percent of passengers say they belatedly found out they were traveling with a firearm, ammunition or an explosive.
The results of a survey conducted by the airline Stratos Jet Charters Inc. - to which more than 1,000 interviewers replied - showed that younger passengers were more likely to be violated.
Of the respondents who admitted that they had attempted to knowingly travel with a subject banned by TSA, 19.7 per cent of passengers were with several thousand hours of flight compared to less than 15 percent of Generation X members.
The most common items that leaked TSA's attention are food and alcohol.
More than three percent of respondents knowingly made a sharp object through security, while 2.2 percent of the women surveyed and 3.7 percent of the men surveyed also admitted that they had deliberately brought banned drugs on board the plane.
The company said it had conducted research among passengers around the world to find out how many of them randomly made unauthorised items through airport security and how much had done so on purpose.
Not surprisingly, most people who have transferred unauthorised objects - whether consciously or unconsciously - travel by plane very often.
As the company pointed out, the TSA directives are somewhat complicated and confusing.
People often don't know what fluids and how much they can deliver on the plane.
It is no surprise, then, that TSA confiscated the most precisely prohibited liquids.
For a time, people thought that TSA would handle books in the same way as smuggled goods.
Fluid transport is allowed in domestic flights, not international flights.
EPA chief Scott Pruitt on postponement of planned directives to reduce emissions from the Obama administration
After the Environment Agency was sued by fifteen states, its chief, Scott Pruitt, dismissed his earlier decision to postpone the implementation of the former Obama administration's plan to reduce carbon dioxide emissions.
Pruitt introduced changes to his plan. It responds more briskly than previous governments to the needs of the state's environmental regulators.
However, he did not mention the legal challenge against his previous position in the federal appeals court.
This concerns the last deadline set at 1. October, when states should start complying with the 2015 regulation to reduce the level of ground-level ozone.
In June, Pruitt announced that he would postpone the agreement for one year and order a more detailed study of the plan to avoid "interventions with local decisions or impending economic growth."
Pruitt, who held the position of state attorney general Oklahoma before being installed as head of the EPA by President Donald Trump, has served for a long time as a reliable opponent of stricter environmental regulations.
Since settling in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly moved or delayed the regulations proposed by the chemical and fossil industries.
The sudden turnaround on Wednesday is the biggest legal failure for Pruitt's regulatory agenda.
Last month, a federal appeals court in Washington ruled that the EPA executor had overstepped his authority in an attempt to delay the inclusion of the Obama administration's plan, which required the oil and gas companies to reduce methane spills.
In a statement issued on Wednesday evening, Pruitt proposed his version of ozone standards and strengthened the EPA's commitment to cooperate with states through complex processes and the fulfilment of new standards within a given timeframe.
"Under the government of the previous EPA administration, the EPA did not often meet the deadlines and waited for it to be sued by activist groups and others, agreeing to the settlement and further setting of the plans," said Pruitt, who filed more than a dozen lawsuits against the EPA in his previous position.
"We do not believe in regulation through litigation and we take the deadline seriously.
We never joke about our status and authority that emerges from it."
However, the EPA statement states that Pruitt can, at some point, use the "permapacy of the delay and all other legally available authorities" to ensure that regulations "based on sound policies and the most affordable information."
Republicans in Congress are pushing for a more extensive transcript of the ozone rules.
The White House budget approved last month seeks to postpone the implementation of the 2015 rules for at least eight years.
The measure has still not passed the Senate.
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who headed the coalition of states that sued the EPA this week, said the group did not intend to allow legal pressure.
"The turnaround in the views of the EPA - following our lawsuit - is an important victory for the health and safety of those 6.7 million New Yorkers and more than 115 million Americans who are directly affected by air pollution," Schneiderman added.
New York was joined by California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, and Washington, D.C.
Ground-earth ozone is produced when normal harmful substances emitted by cars, power plants, oil refineries, chemical power plants and other sources react in the atmosphere with sun intensity.
The resulting smog can cause serious breathing problems in sensitive people and thousands of early deaths each year.
Public health advocates and environmentalists acknowledge Pruitt's sudden change with grate.
"It is worrying what pressure the pressure needs to be exerted to change the minds of those responsible and protect the air we breathe," said Lori Ann Burden of the Center for Biological Diversity.
"We must continue to wrestle with the Trump administration's ideological campaign, which seeks to help polluters and special interests."
He doused the man with acid, yet he is not dangerous, according to the court.
You never know what might happen to you.
One minute you're at home with your family and you're laughing, the other one suddenly changes your whole life from the ground up.
And the worst part is, there's nothing you can do about it.
A similar fate befell Andreas Christopher from the UK, whose face was filtered with an acid by an unknown assailant who was eventually acquitted.
The information was reported by the Reuters website.
In December 2014, someone at the Christopherros' door knocked on the door.
Andreas got up to go open.
He thought there was probably a courier at the door who was supposed to deliver the Christmas gifts for the family that day.
Instead, he was in for a cruel surprise.
The man he had never seen in his life poured acid on him immediately after opening without warning, saying, "That's for you, my friend."
The pain was indescribable.
My clothes fell apart on me like nothing and I felt only an incredible pain on my skin," said Andreas.
The family rushed him to the hospital, but his loved ones learned the terrible news - he had no chance of surviving, according to the doctors.
Weeks from the incident, doctors were constantly worried that their patient would succumb to an infection that threatened to break into his wounds.
His injury was very serious.
Ninety percent of the face was hit, which doctors were trying to put together with skin from other parts of the patient's body.
A big complication for Christopheris was the loss of eyelids.
It's probably the most demented thing I've ever had.
"You can't hide from an unexpected light, you can't close your eyes," he said, describing his torment.
Today, Christopheros has had twelve surgeries under his breath that are far from the last.
Injury that suffers from acid victims can require hundreds of surgical procedures and years of treatment, according to plastic surgeons.
Even after a difficult and long-term treatment, the victims of the tissue have scar tissue for the rest of their lives.
"Sometimes people don't recover and fight for the whole life against deformity and disfigurement," said Professor Peter Dziewulski, a spokesman for the British Association of Plastic and Aesthetic Surgeons.
The attacker was wrong.
As for the attack, Christopheros is sure the unidentified man must have mistaken him for someone.
The perpetrator believed he was retaliating against a man who sexually abused his close person.
Police investigated the case properly and eventually tracked down the attacker.
The man was originally sentenced to at least eight years in prison.
However, later, to the astonishment of Christopheros's family, the verdict changed fundamentally.
"Three judges eventually concluded that the punishment should be annulled as the man is not considered a threat to the public," Christopheros said.
Over the past few years, the number of amorphous agents has increased considerably.
The country's Interior Ministry has commented on the issue as planning to provide new guidance to prosecutors on the classification of corrosives.
These should be classified as dangerous weapons.
But the victims of such attacks are not about to be surrendered.
They are calling for the UK government to push for more severe and longer prison sentences for people who attack their surroundings with acid or other corrosive substances.
They also call for tougher controls on sales of dangerous substances, which are often commonly available in different shops, as they are various cleaning products.
In the largest city of the United Arab Emirates, Dubai, the famous skyscraper The Torch, which is one of the largest residential buildings in the world, was on fire at night.
According to the Dubai Civil Defense, the residents of the 80-story building were evacuated in time and no one was injured.
According to a Dubai police spokesman, a fire broke out on the ninth floor and spread up.
According to several residents of the house, however, it was the opposite.
"It started on the 67th floor, that's what they told us," said one of the tenants.
Also, according to another tenant cited by Reuters, the fire broke out at the highest levels and spread down with falling hot debris.
We were asleep.
We woke up the alarm, people were screaming.
"We ran down the stairs, it took us about ten minutes from the 50th floor," the tenant, George, described the events.
Another witness to CNN estimated that about 40 apartments were engulfed in flames.
On the ground, a fire destroyed at least two cars when burning parts of the building hit them.
After about two hours, according to the civil defense, the fire was brought under control.
The cause of its creation is not yet known.
According to witnesses, the power went out in the surrounding buildings.
A large fire damaged Dubai's skyscraper The Torch also destroyed over a hundred apartments in February 2015.
There are about 680 apartments in the entire building.
No one was hurt at the time either, as the residents were evacuated in time.
The Torch skyscraper was built in 2011 and then became the world's tallest residential building with its 352 metres.
He was set for a record the following year by another Dubai skyscraper.
The bodybuilder had an astonishing 14 doping substances in his system.
He didn't win anyway.
According to the Corriere della Serra, the 23-year-old Ippolito's sample found a variety of illicit remedies - from steroids to diuretics to Parkinson's disease drugs or anorexia.
Paradoxically, even this wild mix did not help him to the title, finishing fourth.
The bodybuilder now faces a four-year suspension and prosecution.
The record was 11.
Last year, Italian rugby player Davide Vasta tested positive for 11 doping substances, which was a record amount of athletes caught up to that point.
The third-tier player, he said, began taking steroids the year before, when he fell into bodybuilding.
Lucka Vondráčková in the Czech Republic.
She was passionately embracing her ex-lover!
It is hardly likely that Lucka Vondráčková set foot in the Czech Republic, she is in one round.
And it also attracts attention wherever it comes.
The last time her ex-lover, Michal Dlouhý, with whom she had lived for three years, fell into her arms.
The actor was 12 years older then and already longing for his family.
Lucia was only 19 years old at the time, and she certainly had no desire to hang up on her career.
So they walked apart, but remained friends to this day.
Which they also proved at the TV Prima press conference, where they met after a long time.
By coincidence, the two of them matched into a blue color.
At first they ignored each other, but then they got close, and Lucie laughed at Michael's jokes, to her stomach.
After that, they embraced and posed willingly for the photographers.
But their meeting was no accident, as the couple will play together in the new Prima series Captain Exner.
The Islamists were given life sentences in the UK for preparing the assassination.
A British court on Thursday sent four members of the Islamist cell to prison for life, calling themselves the Three Musketeers and planning a terrorist attack against the police and the army, according to the prosecutor's office.
The four men, two of whom attended a training camp in Pakistan and had previously been convicted of similar acts, were arrested last August.
Authorities thought at the time that he was going to attack immediately.
In the car of one of the men, security agents found a partially finished pipe bomb, knives with inscriptions that mean "unbelievers" in Arabic, and a mock-up of a gun.
It happened when an MI5 secret service agent placed a listening device in the car.
"Recent assassinations have shown the horror the defendants may have caused if they were not stopped," said prosecutor Sue Hemming.
Three convicts, aged 28, 25 and 33, can apply for release after 20 years.
The fourth convict, who is 38, can do so after 15 years behind bars.
During the trial in London, the men claimed to be innocent and that the guns found in the car were placed there by an MI5 agent.
The court also heard it, but then rejected the defendants' claims.
Thursday was the hottest day of the year.
Hodonín measured 38.3 °C.
Tuesday's 37.3-degree Celsius temperature record remained at the top for only two days.
With 38.3 degrees Celsius, which were recorded in Strážnice na Hodonínsko, it was surpassed by Thursday, which thus became the hottest day so far this year.
This was confirmed by the staff of the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute.
Compared to Tuesday, however, there were not many temperature records on Thursday.
On Tuesday, records were broken or set to 35 of the 145 weather stations measuring over 30 years.
On Thursday, only nine long-term long-term measuring stations recorded record temperatures.
For example, in Strážnice, Thursday's temperature was the same as the previous record from 2013.
In Lednice, Břeclav, Thursday's 37.4 degrees surpassed the original maximum by four-tenths of a degree, and in Pohořelice in Brno the current 37.1 degrees, the current 37.1 degrees exceeded the record by three-tenths.
Both records, as with Strážnice, came from 2013.
It was ten degrees lower in the west.
High temperatures on Thursday appeared mainly in the south and east of Moravia.
After Strážnice was the hottest in Dyjákovice in Znojmo and Brod nad Dyjí on Břeclavsk, where the mercury climbed to 37.8 degrees, but did not break the record.
By contrast, for example, in western and northwestern Bohemia, Thursday's highest temperatures so far were only around 22 degrees Celsius on Thursday.
"The heaters didn't start growing there until later in the afternoon," the meteorologists said.
The current heat in the Czech Republic will gradually subside, according to the ČHMÚ, and on Sunday there could be significant rains.
In most places of Moravia, however, the high temperatures will still remain on Friday and in southeast Moravia on Saturday.
China lacks tourists.
Beijing is losing billions because of its visa policy.
China has sought to exercise its influence for decades without the use of force means.
He spends $10 billion a year to support language schools and build universities abroad, pushes his entertainment industry to foreign markets, and tries to attract Western tourists.
But Beijing is not succeeding.
The country's state media are talking about a plan to make tourism the driving force of economic transformation and modernization.
But the number of arrivals rose by just 3.8 percent last year, and about 80 percent of tourists to China came from Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan.
This is due, among other things, to the fact that, despite all its global aspirations, the Chinese does not welcome foreigners with open arms, evaluates the situation in the world's most populous country in the world's most populous country, Christopher Balding, in an article for Bloomberg.
An example of which speaks volumes is Chinese visa policy.
Only 13 countries have visa-free travel with China, the citizens of the others have to take out their visa in advance.
At the Chinese authorities in the US, the crowds are therefore comparable to the Chinese New Year celebrations.
A visa costs $140, but if you don't want to wait for long hours in line for it, you have to pay $100 or more for the additional service.
Such restrictions are building significant economic barriers.
A study by the Journal of Economics and Finance showed that the need for a visa reduces the number of visitors to the country by 70 percent.
In 2015, only two million Americans visited mainland China, while Hong Kong, which accounts for less than three percent of China's gross domestic product and less than one percent of all residents, was visited by 1.8 million Americans.
China often deepens the problem itself by using tourism to pursue its political objectives, such as disputes with Taiwan and South Korea.
In the spring, when China cut back on transport to South Korea as part of a spat over the South Korean anti-missile system, the South Koreans repaid it and avoided China.
In May, the number of visits fell by 42 percent year-on-year, while Japan was up 85 percent.
All of this affects macroeconomic stability.
According to a recently published report by the US Federal Reserve, as a result of foreign travel from the Chinese, as a result of foreign travel, the Fed could leave China with about $190 billion annually, while China receives about $35 billion annually as part of its currency's sales to incoming tourists.
According to official figures on the balance of payments, China had a deficit of $217 billion in tourism last year, equivalent to 44 percent of China's entire surplus in the goods trade.
So the small number of tourists is a very painful blow to the country, which scrupulously prevents capital from fleeing.
However, the above factors are only one manifestation of more general restraint towards foreigners.
In many parts of China, virtually no one has heard of immigrants.
As recently as 2013, there were fewer than a million foreigners living across China.
More are among them in the United States and some of the individual cities.
Even Japan, which is not exactly the intersection of immigration, has double that.
Meanwhile, many scientific papers show that immigrants typically revive economic growth, entrepreneurship, and innovation.
In China, however, you will barely find them.
Addressing these problems will be politically challenging, but the move to be offered is to simplify the visa apparatus.
Other Asian nations, in particular India and Vietnam, have recently made a major effort to simplify and discount visa procedures.
If China wants more foreign tourists and their hard currencies, it should be easier for them to get there.
At the Pilsen Zoo, they reproduced the deadly poisonous reptiles.
The Plzeňská Království poison can be enjoyed by the cubs of three rare, deadly poisonous reptiles.
In the exhibition, visitors will see only all nine newly born Turkish vipers.
This species is in northern Anatolia, even at an altitude of 2,000 metres.
"It also grows in metre lengths," said zoo spokesman Martin Vobruba.
The cubs of the other two species, the leaphones and the red cobra, will be gaining strength in the garden's breeding grounds.
We can't tell when people will see them yet.
"We would not like to lose them," said nurse Miroslav Dohnal, noting that it could take a year or two.
Eight Australian deathstrones have been born, the offspring of a breeding couple native to the population around Sydney.
"The individual that visitors can see in the exhibit belongs to the lethal-shape from around Perth," Vobruba said, noting that in human care, a 6-8 week winter at 13 degrees Celsius is required for the lethal.
The 100% success was accompanied by a clutch of a Polish-lying red cobra.
The couple at the Pilsen Zoo was lined up from four eggs by a total of four chicks.
"The incabitation took 65 days," Vobruba said.
This species in nature is sprayed with poison on its victim, up to a distance of up to four metres.
He's aiming for the eyes, he can cause a permanent blindness.
The cubs of all three species feed on the zoo by mouse shave.
Within 40 days in the garden they are still expecting to hatch the cubs from the clumsy table of black, the eggs are stored in the incubator.
According to an unverified rewrite of a telephone conversation, Trump is putting pressure on Mexico to pay for the border wall
The Washington Post reported a transcript of President Trump's phone calls to leaders of Mexico and Australia.
In a January 27 telephone interview with Mexican President Enrique Peña, Trump urged him to stop publicly proclaiming that he would not pay for the proposed wall.
The US president reproached him for publicly condemning the construction of the wall, supposedly saying, "You can't speak like that in the press."
As part of his campaign, Trump promised to build a wall along the southern border and proclaim that Mexico would pay for it.
A transcript of his first call to Australian Prime Minister, Malcolm Turnbull, has also leaked to the public, revealing a tense exchange of views.
President Trump told Turnbull that the US surveillance agreement for refugees bound for Australia was "ridiculous" and "stupid" and insisted that if he agreed to such an agreement - which came under President Obama - it would look like a "drugged" after he proposed a ban on refugees entering the US.
Trump ended the call after he explained to Turnbull that "this is my most unpleasant call of the day."
Tusk testified again at the prosecution for Smolensk.
"He has nothing to fear," said Tusk's father's dead president's brother, the chairman of the governing Law and Justice PiS party, Jaroslaw Kaczynski.
"I have nothing to fear, Kaczyński will not intimidate me," Tusk replied, accusing the country's current leadership of trying to use the judiciary against political rivals.
As he left the prosecution's headquarters, a crowd awaited Tusk, according to TVN TVN, chanted by Donald Tusk! and wished the politician One Hundred Year!.
Tusk thanked for his support and assured that he had a clear conscience: "I have nothing to fear and Kaczyński will not intimidate me."
He says he does not blame the prosecutors, but he has no doubt that the judiciary should serve the current Polish rulers as a tool against rivals, opposition or people they dislike, and I fear that I belong to this group.
He was interviewed for the second time.
The ex-Prime Minister was questioned at the prosecution for the second time, this time the interrogation involved misconduct in the autopsies of the victims of the Sickle disaster.
Additionally, it was discovered to be a substitution of bodies in coffins.
The families were forbidden to open coffins, and there had to be some reasons.
And the reason was that they feared the scandal because it would strain Polish-Russian relations.
"Maintaining good relations at all costs, despite such a terrible event, was to serve to Donald Tusk becoming someone very important in the EU," Kaczyński claimed on the Catholic television network Trwam.
He added that a possible conflict with Russia would have thwarted Tusk's chance of winning the most important seat in the union, of which Poland has absolutely nothing.
At the same time, Kaczyński said he had warned German Chancellor Angela Merkel that things could be different with Donald Tusk, but she did not take note of it.
Tusk underwent an eight-hour interrogation at the prosecution as early as April 19.
Even then, he did not testify as a suspect, only as a witness.
Nevertheless, many saw his subpoenaes for questioning as part of the Polish government's apparent effort by the Polish government and PiS chief Kaczyński to discredit Tusk as a political rival by linking to various scandals.
The prosecution is subordinate to the Minister of Justice in Poland, who performs the role of the Attorney General.
The summons for questioning came soon after Tusk's election as head of the European Council, whom Kaczyński struggled but tried in vain to prevent, including during a visit to Merkel in Warsaw.
At the EU summit, only Polish Prime Minister Beata Szydlo protested alone against the extension of Tusk's mandate.
In this case, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán also let Warsaw down.
Both Burma and Senegal.
Where can the Czechs vote for them?
In the autumn parliamentary elections, registered voters will be able to vote newly to vote on the composition of the House from Burma, Senegal or Luxembourg.
In these and several other countries, the Czech Republic has opened its embassy offices since the last parliamentary elections held in 2013.
This follows from a decree regulating the delivery of ballots abroad.
The State Department has prepared an update to it, and is currently under comment.
Four years ago, 10,000 Czech citizens voted for MPs abroad.
"Since the last amendment to the decree in 2013, there have been some changes that need to be taken into account in these lists," the ministry justifies its procedure.
"New embassination offices were created in some countries, some of the authorities were closed, or there was a change in the level of representation," the document reads.
The decree contains two annexes, the first of which lists the embassies on which the paper ballots are supplied.
This group of authorities includes the representation of the Czech Republic in neighbouring countries, namely Germany, Poland, Austria and Slovakia.
More than a hundred Czech offices will receive a ballot paper in the press version.
It is their list of decrees that changes.
Four years ago, Czechs could vote, for example, at the Czech Embassy in Libya or Zimbabwe.
Today, both embassies are closed.
The Czech Republic has also abolished its representation in Bamako, Malaysia, and Japan's Kyoto.
There will also be no vote at the Consulate General in Donetsk.
The Czech Republic was closed in 2014 because of the war in eastern Ukraine.
They are now on the list of embassies in Nairobi, Kenya, the Dakar capital of the Senegalese capital and the Zambian Lusac.
In Asia, since the last parliamentary elections, the Czech Republic has expanded its representation to include the Consulate General in Irbil, Iraq, and Chengdu, the capital of China's Sichuan Province.
Voting ballots will also be available for registered voters at the Czech embassies in Burma and Cambodia.
Czechs abroad have had the opportunity to choose from members at the polling stations at embassies or consulates four times so far.
In the run-up to each election, the state election commission will be designated by the draw by the county, whose candidates are voted on abroad.
The first time was in 2002, when the decision was made between the South Moravian candidates.
At the next two elections, the Czechs voted abroad among the South Bohemian candidates.
In 2013, the Central Bohemian Region was selected as well as this year.
The number of Czechs voting abroad is steadily increasing.
At the premiere 15 years ago, some 3,800 people came to vote, around 67,700 in 2006, 8222 four years later.
The early House elections four years ago were attended by 10,571 voters at the embassies.
Moore's Ford bridge massacre: activists commemorate racist lynching
The 1948 Ford Mercury passed by the onlookers of Monroe, Georgia, and bumped toward the Moore's Ford Bridge.
But before the four-car with the black-skinned four passengers and the white driver could reach the bridge, a group of white men with guns blocked his way.
The leader of the group - a middle-aged man in a striped suit - drew a long drag on a cigarette and looked at the windshield of the car.
Inside, the passengers trembled with fear.
"We want this n--and Roger!" the man yelled.
"Take it!"
The silence is interrupted by the roar of a young black man being pulled from the passenger seat.
Fortunately, this scene is merely a reconstruction of the events that took place on the 22nd. July.
But when one of the men throws a noose over the "Roger's" neck, the audience sighs with excitement.
Since 2005, a group of activists have regularly returned to the Moore's Ford Bridge, reconstructing the fateful night of 1946, when two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murra Dorsey - were killed by Kukluxklan members.
No one has ever been tried for the murders.
"It's a wonder that in all these years, not a single person has been arrested - even though we still see them in our community; even though we know their identities," said Tyrone Brooks, who helps organize the reconstruction of the event.
"It's a stain on our history and the burden in our souls."
Brooks is a 71-year-old former congressman of the state of Georgia and a lifelong civil rights campaigner.
In his eyes, the reconstruction of the event presents a dramatic challenge to take place. Every year, Monroe reminds the community of the city that justice has not been served.
"We demand for the prosecution and the closure of the case, we want peace of mind and reconciliation, but justice above all," said Brooks.
"Until then, the process of recovery and reconciliation cannot be initiated."
The medical examiner is covering 27. July 1946 one of the bodies of the victims of the lynching victims at Moore's Ford.
According to FBI files that obtained NBC News, the lynching was to be attended by up to 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding districts.
However, no one has yet been prosecuted.
Despite the fact that the suspects remain free for decades, the citizens' rights advocates argue that both the reasons for the lynching - the policy and the sex - were known to all residents of the city.
In April 1946, under a Supreme Court ruling, the black-skinned residents of the Georgia state of black won the right for the first time to participate in the elections that were scheduled for the summer.
And it was during the summer election that the black farmer, according to the FBI, was to be stabbed by the owner of the white-skinned landowner, Barnett Hester, allegedly because of his wife.
In the city, according to Brooks, it was said that Hester had been communitill with Malcom's wife, Dorothy, and brought her to a different state.
According to the FBI, he passed 25. July 1946 then-starred white landowner Loy Harrison for Malcoma bail of $600.
He was escorted to the prison by Dorothy and Cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
On their return from the prison, just before entering the Moore's Ford Bridge, a group of suspects blocked their way.
"As it turns out, the murders were planned and orchestrated by Harrison," the FBI deduced.
"It is also clear that there was a collusion between the State and local law enforcement officers, who not only participated in the lynching but also got rid of the evidence and withheld the identity of the witnesses."
Brooks made a more succinct statement on the matter.
"It was a massacre because of the right to vote," he said.
"The murders had a clear subtext for all the local black people: 'this is how you will catch if you register and go vote.'"
The annual reconstruction of the event at the Moore's Ford Bridge has been organized by Cassandra Greene for nearly a decade.
Her performance is figurative, engaging and apt. It shows the deep-rooted racism that many would like to find extinct in modern America.
Watching this reconstruction is not easy and even more difficult to avert to look away, but Greene says it makes sense.
"No one wants to talk about lynching, because in doing so we have to face the uncomfortable feelings that are hidden in all of us," Greene said.
"But there can be no relationship between us unless you hear what I've been through."
The main rehearsals for this year's renovation began in June, and on the first day, approximately 30 actors - a dozen white men, the rest of blackmen - flocked to the room where Greene introduced them to a very carefully planned show.
Wade Marbaugh performs the position of an assistant director.
He played the leader of Kukluxklan for many years, but in his words the role is exhausting.
"I feel bad about it because it goes against who I am," Marbaugh said.
"I think it's very important to be reminded of this part of history on a regular basis, because we never want to go back to that time."
Actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, who play the role of Roger Malcom, or Barnett Hester, rehearse their roles.
The show begins with a scuffle - Malcom argues with Hester and blames him for sleeping with his wife.
"Get off my property n-e!"
Rascona is not available.
There's a scuffle.
At that moment, everyone (at least every black-skinned actor) explodes in a laugh.
Greene laughs the most.
"What happened?" asks Rascon.
He's confused.
Was I too rude?
"No," Greene says cheerfully.
"I just don't think the white people said 'n--r' that in tone.'
"Exactly," one of the black-skinned actors blurts.
"You must put more emphasis on R."
The energy in the room is suddenly better; the animosity is replaced by a sense of rapprochement.
Everyone wants the show to be authentic. Just to be worth enough of the four victims of the massacre.
The actors repeat the scene.
Rascona this time emphasizes the correct utness of the word on N.
Now no one's laughing.
The show ends violently and quickly.
The roar, the shots... and the silence.
A woman dressed in black stands over the bodies of the actors, singing Billie Holiday's mournful song "Strange Fruit."
With every word, there's sadness in the room.
In the background of all this, a dozen onlookers are sweeping sweat and tears from their eyes.
The audience has virtually the same number of blacks and whites.
One pair arrived all the way from New York's Ithaca, many onlookers.
Each one tolerates the local damp climate for nearly eight hours, and Brooks leads them to the graves of Malcolm and Dorsey in the crowd.
Until now, the murders could have been viewed with hindsight, but now, standing in the same place where the lynching took place, the atmosphere is haunting.
With the last words of the song, Greene challenges the crowd of onlookers to inspect the bodies.
The children kneel to the victims' heads, watch the fake blood and the motionless bodies, whispering in their ears.
"They're not dead," the little boy says.
A few minutes pass and Greene thanks the audience. It's over.
The actors clean the rope and shake their tears.
Bradshaw hugs Marbaugh, the man in the suit, who played the Kukluxklan leader.
Nick Rascona embraces his two fellow-grears and cries out in their arms; in the end, emotions come at him.
"It's all right," one of the women says.
"We know you're in averse to the part.
But you had a reason for that."
Later that same day, the audience meets with the actors for dinner.
At one table, the young white couple are passionate about a show with a black couple they met today.
Denise Duplinski was barely finding the words to express her feeling about tonight's performance.
"It's difficult to listen to those ugly words and look at those hideous deeds... that are done by people who look like you and do it because they look like you," she said of the reconstruction.
"It makes me want to realize that lynching is still a topical topic," she added, "it's just called police skirmishes."
Across the room, Tyrone Brooks sits in the courtroom. He saves dinner while talking about civil rights.
In his own words, he had already begun planning the show for the next year.
"The reconstruction of these events is inspiring, as it describes the fear we had to endure - but it is also a moment to think about," he said.
"If we don't learn from this, who knows . . . it could happen again.
People who do not know and study the history of their country are doomed to repeat it."
I love the instructions for use.
A friend of mine says he only reads the instructions for use.
I disagree, on the contrary.
It is one of the modern forms of art, often pure surrealism.
I remember with nostalgia of a time long gone by, where the instructions for using anything were more of a rare phenomenon.
For example, my first gramophone contained only one piece of paper, with hieroglyphs showing the involvement of some components, all of which were some secret brands.
When something inside went wrong years later, I offered the deed to a shaman who was not afraid to unscrew the back of the back.
With a grin, he told me what the paper with the labyrinth of sorcery was appropriate for.
Yes, it was a used tool for the chronic depletion of toilet paper.
He grazed a split wire and allowed me to listen to expensive vinyl tortillas again.
The new age brought new instructions.
Even a relatively simple, juicer of the fruit, where the overrancended grep, simply took hold, required about ten pictures.
Particularly hilarious was a sketch with a description of how to plunge one part into another.
The set was two-piece and a different procedure was simply not possible.
Grabbing it in reverse was taking considerable effort to make with the need to break off certain plastic components.
My contempt for the instructions ended with my Seat Leon self-propelled.
The year of production 2003 still had such a book with a guide to minor repairs, which included, among other things, the replacement of the bulb of the blinker.
It was easy.
Three steps in total and the work was to be done.
Unfortunately, the author of the instructions failed to state that while the light bulb on the right could only be replaced in three steps.
1. take out the cover.
2. unscrewed the cracked bulb and screw the new one.
3. dry the cover.
The filament on the left had a problem in the form of the placement of the battery cover.
At first I thought that by inserting the right upper limb into the bowels of the car I was finding a spring, a screw that would easily push the cover away and then follow the 1-3-saving author of the service book.
Mistake of the catwalk.
The cover had no place, no space for Cinderella's slender hand, let alone the obese Silesian.
I have lost half an hour of my life, and without any success.
The condition was heightened by my wife's entry into the garage, summoned by the roar and the words he hears from my mouth quite exceptionally.
"What are you doing here?" she asked innocently.
My answer lasted about 90 seconds, however, if I miss the vulgar terms, there were only two published words left.
Changing the bulb.
"And what's taking you so long?" she said, taking the line that may be her last in the long-running union.
I slowly explained to her the problem, with the main emphasis on the process of the torturous of the author of the tutorial, where the blessing of the hot iron on the hand that wrote the instructions, then I will beat her to no longer, was merely an introduction to the wide range of Witch Hammer's instructions, including his commissioning burning on the top above the Losin Castle.
"How about we dismantle the box?" the woman said of the battery being removed.
In sheer desperation, this happened, and then the 1-3 step was as easy and quick as the right side.
I thought nothing could surprise me.
This was until the day I got a call from a colleague who was just coming out of the collapse after checking for two female civil servants of the State Drug Enforcement Administration.
I know him as a balanced colleague who has experienced both the possible and the impossible in the field, and who can also tell wild stories in an unheated voice.
"Imagine getting a ticket for not having the hand-wash instructions posted," he told me in a weak voice.
Gradually, I drew the whole problem out of him, which was that over the sink in the toilet of patients he did not have a picture guide to how to wash his hands.
His argument of the commissioner that adults generally know how to wash their hands, and that there was no need for pictograms to cope with the habitual activity of decent people, did not have a healing effect and cost him a lot of money.
"It's not easy," she told him.
He understood that the simple rinsing of the soapy palm-flying with water was a primitive act at the level of the Cromanon, that a modern man, Homo sapiens sapiens, performed this ceremony in ten steps.
So it is necessary to say that it is necessary to release water from the tap.
The whole process has a total of eleven points, but at the end it is a joyous realization that one has washed one's hands exactly as the SÚKL hosudar orders him to do.
Finally, I must point out that I was inspired and I am preparing a detailed plan for the work in the toilet.
On the issue of defecation, the procedure is uniform, there will be no problem, for urination, given certain differences between the two sexes, it will be necessary to post instructions two.
The problem remains the pictograms, for creating the perfect course of action also means an accurate sketches of all anatomical details, which could arouse some outrage at the prudent toilet visitor, despite finally being able to learn that he has mopped the hole in a completely erroneous process throughout his life.
Pearson to lay off another 3,000 employees and cuts dividends in an effort to revive trade
British training group Pearson said on Friday that it would lay off an additional 3,000 employees and cut the provisional dividend by 72 percent in response to the next restructuring program to change the business model.
Another wave of redundancies, which, according to the statement of Executive Director John Fallon, will take place at the end of 2018 and the beginning of 2019, is followed by the company's previous decision to lay off 4,000 employees as part of the previous restructuring.
Pearson announced a cost-cutting plan of an additional £300 million ($394 million) in May as part of a third cost-cutting program in an effort to resurrect declining trade as a result of the rapid development of digital education.
The company, which last month agreed to sell its stake in Penguin Random House to Bertelsmann, said the outlook for this year remained unchanged after announcing a 1% increase in basic sales in the first half of the year to £2.05 billion.
Attack on Kabul convoy: NATO soldiers killed in suicide blast
A suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in Afghanistan's capital, Kabul. One NATO soldier died in the attack and several others were wounded, officials said.
Five soldiers and an interpreter were injured, NATO's comments were made.
According to unofficial reports, three civilians also died in the attack in the city district of Qarabagh.
A bomb attack hit Afghanistan this month - more than 30 people were killed in an explosion at a Herátsk mosque on Tuesday.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi Embassy in Kabul.
NATO said in its comments that Tuesday's explosion took place after a patrol, along with members of the Afghan army, was attacked by a "local person with a homemade explosive device."
The statement also states that all the wounded soldiers are out of danger to life and are located in a U.S. military hospital at the Bagram Air Force Base.
According to the rapporteur, the growing power of the Taliban and the group known as the Islamic State (IS) in the Qarabagh region is a major source of concern for NATO allied forces in nearby Bagram.
According to the United Nations, at least 1662 civilians died in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, of which 20% of the victims died in the capital.
At the end of July, a car bomb killed at least 30 people in Kabul's Shia district.
The attack was claimed by the Taliban.
On May 31, a major explosion killed more than 150 people in the city centre. This is the deadliest militant attack in the country since US troops overthrew the Taliban government in 2001.
The violence is undermining the already dubious situation in Afghanistan, and US President Donald Trump is considering increasing the number of US troops to assist military troops and police officers in the country.
According to the rapporteurs, the suicide attacks to which the enchours in recent weeks were rocked by the public's confidence in the government, its regulations, and especially in the reputation of President Asraphus Ghanin.
In response to the lawsuit, EPA reconsidered its decision to delay smoking rules
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency revoked its decision to postpone the Obama administration's law, which ordered states to cut emissions, just a day after 15 states sued the agency.
In the nightfall on Wednesday, the EPA announced its decision to refer to the "Frazan Standards of 2015" with the words of the Agency's commitment to cooperate with the states.
"We believe in dialogue with our state-ownership partners and hear their views," EPA Director Scott Pruitt said in a statement.
In June, Pruitt announced EPA's efforts to delay ozone standards - which measure real air pollution in specific areas of the country and, based on measurements, determine the limits to be met by October 2018.
A group of fifteen of the majority of Democratic states, along with Washington, D.C., filed the suit on Tuesday on the grounds that the EPA's actions were illegal.
President Donald Trump's administration seeks to avoid many environmental regulations proposed by former President Barack Obama - in Trump's words, in an attempt to kick economic growth.
But the new government's efforts have launched countermeasures from Democrats and conservative groups that fear the impact of emissions on public health.
The EPA states on its website that the breathing of ozone-containing air "may reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms" such as asthma.
Singer Ladislav Drummer got hit and blood flowed!
You may have already registered this, a relatively new singer with us, in June of this year, when this hitherto unknown singer held a monstrous event for Czech standards, hosting such leading personalities as master Karel Gott, Lucie Bílá, Simona Krainová and many others, and the event was not directed by anyone other than Leoš Mareš.
The purpose was simple, to be shown to the public and present their music video for the song Sara, whose baptism was performed by the just-listed personalities.
Little does anyone know, however, that the actual filming of the video clip, which took place in Russia, was not without its problems and the singer himself, Ladislav Bubnár, had to be treated.
It was his first major set with the stars of the Russian national ballet, and it was not without any real embarrassment.
The song Sara is very emotional and is based on the unfortunate love of two lovers.
For the drama of the scene, in the music video, the singer's rival was to hint at a slap punch.
At one point, however, he hit him so hard and directly on the nose that the young singer had to be treated by doctors.
"It was a blow, I didn't expect it, my nose was immediately bleeding," Ladislav commented on the situation.
Colleagues and producers told the situation on set that it was an accident and Ladislav did not have time to react in time.
Fortunately, the injury was not serious enough to affect the sequel in the next shoot.
We now bring you the young artist's music video, you can also record the scene with the punch.
The failed version of the blood, however, was not used.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko spoke at the meeting about the possibilities of the mutual duel
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, two boxers who could stage the most exciting lightweight boxing boxing match, met for the first time at a meeting on Tuesday.
Each of them was in a separate room in the ESPN offices in Los Angeles until Garcia - the undefeated lightweight champion World Boxing Council - went down to the hall where he welcomed Lomacenko, the World Boxing Organization, the featherweight champion.
After Garcia's victory on the unanimous decision against former four-time world champion Adrien Broner in Saturday's Showtime game, the two boxers were on the list of the top five lightweight boxers.
Garcia cocked his right-hand one and said, "How's it going, champ?
Good luck."
Lomachenko defends his title at 7:00v on Saturday against Miguel Marriaga at ESPN.
Boxers are posing for photographers, and manager Lomacenka Egis Klimas adds that a potential boxer fight would be a "perfect test."
"I'm a former featherweight champion," Garcia adds.
"Because of the match with Broner (67 kg), I had to gain weight, but I'm not that big.
At my 63kg, I'm small.
I'd like to return to the lightweight category.
Lomachenko has to gain weight back on to get to the lightweight... then we can meet.
That's what the fans want.
Why not deliver it to them."
Lomachenko agrees.
"Box would be good for this fight."
Klimas made a request for a payment for viewing - which is part of his strategy. Lomachenko should make his lightweight debut at the end of this year and next year face the Garcia (37-0, 30 knockouts), who also expressed interest in the match against the winner of the Jorge Linares vs. Luke Campbell, who will compete for the lightweight title at the Forum Arena on 23 September.
"The match should be done in the style of the cost of the persee payment, that is what the fans demand," said Garcia, who later commented that it was open to the possibility of broadcasting the match via a television station that comes with the best offer.
"We're the main attraction.
No one else draws such attention.
We'll wait for the right opportunity ..."
Garcia said he recognized Lomacenko as an "amazing boxer" and could take part in his Saturday night's match.
But Lomachenko didn't give Garcia a compliment to be lulled when he said that the three-dollar champion of the Riverside division looked "very slowed down . . . sorry, Mike, but you're asking for a knockout."
Garcia said his goal was to show strength and then boxing.
Both boxers said they felt the rising tension ahead of the mutual duel.
"You won't forget this fight.
No other game is attracting as much attention to itself.
And I will put it in the fire with great pleasure,' said Garcia.
Lomachenko said, "I've been waiting for the best boxers, and this is Mikey."
It's going to be a great game."
The young couple disappeared without a trace 12 years ago.
Their car was found at the bottom of the Volga.
A pair of young Russians Ilya Zhirnov and Kira Cherkasova had been reported missing since December 2005.
There was an extensive search for them, but without success.
And the police finally closed the investigation for lack of evidence.
The families of the lost couple lived in the uncertainty of not knowing what had happened to the couple.
After 12 years, the sad ending of the story came.
The wreck of their car was found by a lay diver at the bottom of the Volga River in the town of Cheboksary in Čuvašsko.
It was only through the documents left in the car that the officers were able to identify the couple.
The papers survived the decade underwater, without which it would take the police to find out the identities of the found.
The couple was last seen when Zhirnov borrowed a car from his father to be able to pick up his girlfriend from work.
The diver who discovered the car, meanwhile, remains anonymous.
He reported his discovery to the Cheboksar police, who dragged the car to the beach the following day.
Investigators believe the young couple's death was an accident caused by a frosty road leading up the river.
However, the investigation continues, with further details to be released after it is completed.
Latest test results for setting the age limit of asylum applications in Sweden
The latest test results from asylum seekers in Sweden who were subjected to the new age-imagining method show that over 80 per cent of people were over the age of 18, but not everyone believes in their accuracy.
Sweden's Forensic Medical Agency (RÃ¤tttsmedicinalverket) began conducting the new tests at the beginning of this year.
The aim of the method is to make a more precise assessment of candidates in the evaluation of asylum applications. The measure was taken after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket) was criticised for failing to determine the right age of some of the refugees who lied about their age.
To date, the Swedish Migration Agency has forwarded 6880 cases to investigate, and the Forensic Medical Agency has now published the results of a total of 2481 tests, conducted from mid-March to 31. July 2017.
80 per cent (2002) were judged to be over the age of 18, while in a further 25 cases the Forensic Medical Agency considered that the interviewee was "perhaps over the age of 18.
In another 423 cases, it was decided that the interviewee was "perhaps under the age of 18.
Tests shall be taken only if the age of the interviewee is questionable.
According to Johan GÃ¶ransson of the Forensic Medical Agency, the results correspond with the previous month.
"Compared to last month, the statistics are kept in the rut and the numbers are very similar," he told The Local.
The higher number of candidates, whose age has been estimated to be over the age of 18, does not necessarily mean that asylum seekers are lying about their age.
In May, the Agency published the results of 581 tests and said that in 442 cases it was found that "the person in question is 18 years or older."
Svenska Dagbladet's newspaper investigated 581 published cases and found that in 243 cases, the polled said it would be 18 years this year.
Criticism was also given to the medical method of determining the age, which includes X-ray of wisdom teeth and MRI a scan of the knee joints, which are then assessed by dentists and X-rays.
One of the skeptics is Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute, who, among other things, deals with assessing people's biological maturity to determine the age at which he or she passed puberty.
"I had a reason to think about this issue, and I don't think these types of age-appropriate measurements are correct.
Judging for the biological age is, in a sense, very uncertain.
If we cannot determine the age with precision, we should not pretend otherwise," Metro told the newspaper.
The forensics Agency's GÃ¶jame Medical Agency's GÃ¶jame to defend the decision by saying: "In general, the risk of incorrect assessment of the child as an adult is small.
The highest risk is the fact that the person interviewed is just under the age of 18, which in this case corresponds to 10 per cent of all those surveyed.’
Trump threatened the president of Mexico on the phone.
In a phone call in a January call to Mexican President Enrique Pee Pete Niet, US President Donald Trump threatened not to meet him if he publicly said that his country would not pay to build a wall between the US and Mexico.
Trump said in the interview that the funding would be arranged somehow, although he admitted that he would have to be secured from other sources.
Trump spoke similarly openly with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull.
This is according to the transcripts of interviews published by The Washington Post on Thursday.
Trump made the construction of a wall on the southern border for Mexican money with one of the main promises in his election campaign last year.
In his first interview with the Mexican president shortly after taking office, Trump chastised Nieto undiplomatically for criticizing his plan to build the wall.
He portrayed the southern neighbor as a growing political problem and pressured the Mexican president not to publicly say that his government would never pay for the wall.
"You can't tell the press this," Trump said repeatedly in an interview on January 27, threatening to cut off contacts with the Mexican president if he continued to make defiant statements.
Funding is said to be devised somehow, and in the end it will be all right.
"But if you say that Mexico won't pay for the wall, then I don't want to see you gentlemen anymore because that's unacceptable to me," he said, according to the US daily Trump.
He described the wall as the least important thing we're talking about, but perhaps the most important thing politically.
The executive order to build the wall was issued by Trump shortly after the takeover of power.
Mexico rejects the construction and financing of the 3200-kilometer wall, which has also escalated relations between the two countries.
In late March, Trump said the project would be paid for by the United States for the time being.
Trump eventually met his Mexican counterpart for the first time at the G20 summit in Hamburg in July.
The Washington Post also reported on Trump's telephone interview with Australian Prime Minister Turnbell on January 28.
The White House official called the conversation ridiculous.
He was prompted to conclude by an exchange of views on the agreement that Australia would grant asylum to Central American refugees in exchange for the United States of recruiting people from internment facilities in the Pacific Island nations.
Trump initially considered the deal to be stupid, but later agreed to it.
"You can certainly say that this is not the deal you have created, but you will have to stick to it," Turnbull told Trump.
In some passages, a phone conversation with Turnbull was almost jovial, for example, when Trump praised as a good idea of Australia's refusal to accept refugees arriving in boats.
"You're worse than me," Trump joked.
Suddenly, however, the tone of the conversation escalated.
"I hate receiving these people," Trump observed.
I assure you, they're bad.
That's why they're in jail.
"They won't be great people who will go to work for the local dairymen," he said.
He also noted in the interview that the fugitive could become an assassin from Boston in five years.
Trump conducted telephone conversations with a number of world statesmen at the end of January, about a week after arriving at the White House, often several times in a day.
He eventually called the Rockble's call the least pleasant one all day.
Before he ended it, he highlighted the fact that he had previously had a pleasant conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Outside the crowd, the Rana Killer was executed.
Her father was also watching.
The execution took place in a square in the capital of Yemen, Sana'a.
Muhammad al-Maghrabi chose as his sacrifice the little Ran Almatari who lived in his neighborhood.
Al Maghrabi kidnapped the girl, took her to his father's house, where he raped her and strangled her with his bare hands.
He then raped her body, which he dumped near the mosque.
The violent death of a little girl has hit an entire country facing the threat of civil war.
Yahya Almatari stood in the front row of the 1,000-strong crowd that had come together to witness the execution.
Muhammad al Maghrabi was convicted under Sharia law.
The victim's father told the media of his feelings after the execution.
I feel reborn.
I'm relieved.
It's the new day of my life.
Other family members were also present, shouting with the crowd the slogan "Low justice."
The rapist was brought to the square by a police van from which he waslé.
The policemen placed it on his stomach, tied up.
One of the members turned his weapon against him and opened fire at point-blank range.
The crowd in attendance celebrated every blow that had been fired.
Mr Almatari told the MailOnline website that justice was done in accordance with the country's legal system.
"Justice, Allah and Sharia law have won," he added.
I stood in the Liberation Square in Sanza, waiting to be executed by my daughter's killer.
Then my family and I went to the morgue.
We took Rana's tiny little body and buried him in a nearby cemetery.
I and my wife, Jamileh, are grateful that justice has been done.
Police feared that the crowd gathered in the square would become crumbling in hateful madness, grabbing and lynching the killer.
The execution was ordered by a court under the administration of the Shiite Houthis.
Originally, however, Maghrabi was sentenced to 100 lashes immediately after his arrest, but his actions aroused such outrage that the judge decided to send the death penalty.
Al Maghrabi was arrested two days after the girl's disappearance. June.
Ran's family knew him well.
When police searched the basement of his home, they found evidence that the man had planned his actions.
Mr. Almatari described him as a monster.
What could have been his motive?
Even an animal would be more merciful to Rana.
"Our family has no enemies, and the injuries that carried Rana's body were terrible," he told the media.
"Rana disappeared in the afternoon, we reported it to the police that day, we told the newspaper and all our TV stations, the posters with her photo were hanging everywhere," he continued.
They all believe the police received a tip from the killer's parents, who suspected their son of the horrific crime.
The girl's mother, Yamileh, had to be hospitalized after learning that her daughter's body had been found.
Rapphana used to play out with the other kids from the neighborhood.
After 10-15 minutes, I came out to see where he was.
We looked everywhere, but Rana was gone.
We walked around our block, our friends took cars and drove around the neighborhood, but we searched in vain.
The people of Yemen were disgusted with the crime and began to gather outside the police station where al Maghrabi was held and demanded immediate punishment.
A deputy of the Ministry of Justice read the crowd present a recording of the investigation to reassure them.
The accused did not seem to show remorse for his actions.
Just before his sentence, the officers read him the verdict, but the convict only glanced at his executioner.
The entire event was filmed for national television, but there were many recordings made by the crowd on the internet.
West Virginia Governor announces change of political party
On Thursday evening, the Democratic Governor of West Virginia, Jim Justice, announced at President Trump's rally that he was moving to another party.
"Whether you like it or not, the Democrats have turned their backs on me," the governor of Justice said.
"I announce to you today after a long prayer and a second thought... today, as a resident of Western Virginia, I tell you that I cannot continue to support you as Democratic Governor."
A crowd of onlookers exploded in joy.
"I'll subscribe to Republicans tomorrow," Justice added.
"As a coach, I can tell you it's time to jump into another game."
Trump had previously promised people an important announcement at a rally in West Virginia.
Trump won in West Virginia with 42 points and Justice did not support Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.
The Justice, who according to Forbes magazine is the only billionaire in the country, was elected in 2016.
Forbes adds that the Justice inherited a large fortune from his father and is the owner of several coal mines.
The value of his assets is estimated at $1.59 billion.
Meanwhile, on Thursday night, the Republican National Committee issued a statement saying: "The redevelopment of the Governor Justice is yet another blow to the Democratic Party that puts obstacles in our way instead of contributing to the uplift of our country."
"For a Democratic party that has only 15 governors and controls the fewest legislative bodies in history, the announcement by the governor Justice is the last straw for an already wretched, leaderless party that seeks in vain to find positive and unifying news," R&N chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said in a statement to CBS News.
Sebastian Coe praises Russia's 'sincere' apology for doping scandal
Former outstanding athlete Sebastian Coe praised Russia on Thursday for his sincere apology for the doping scandal, but reiterated that it has not yet come as a time to return Russia to the sporting world.
On the occasion of the I.A. Congress, Dmitry Shylakhtin, the head of Russian athletics, said on the occasion of the IAAF Congress - which took place on the eve of the World Championships in Athletics - that the expulsion of his country from the world of sport was right and that he was determined to fight doping.
He apologized to "all the athletes who lost their gold and silver medals in this way."
Despite his comments, members of the IAAF Congress voted in favour of maintaining the ban, which came into force in November 2015 after a report by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) revealed that Russia supported doping of its athletes.
"I think we witnessed a very frank response and presentation today," IAAF President Sebastian Coe told reporters.
"All the members of the council and congress were pleasantly surprised that Russia admitted its mistake and was working with all its might to correct and restore the proper function of the entire federation."
Coe said he was also "loaty" that Russia had adopted the criteria for its reintroduction.
"I think today has gone very well and we have moved to the next stage, but the congress supports the Emergency Staff Recommendation to maintain the punishment that was thrown on Russia," added Coe.
"We must do our best to stabilise the situation in the coming months.
Our aim has always been to separate honest athletes from the dishonest," he said.
At the World Championships in Athletics, which starts on Friday in London, 19 Russian athletes who have complied with the IAAF's strict rules will compete under the neutral flag.
IAAF's chief of staff, Rune Andersen, said on Monday that Russia still had to meet several criteria before it was allowed back.
Drug-taking tests are still unsatisfactory and the out-of-burns coaches continue to do their business, he told reporters in London after the IAAF's presentation.
The state contract CzechTrade was awarded to the František Savov company, whose state is prosecuting.
The public contract of the state pro-export agency CzechTrade was awarded to the publishing house Mladá fronta František Savov.
Officials awarded him one hundred percent of the points in all qualitative criteria.
They did not mind that the Czech state was prosecuting Savov for tax fraud and asking for his extradition to the Czech Republic.
The pro-export agency of the Ministry of Industry and Trade CzechTrade announced a public contract in April for the four-year provision of editorial content for the BusinessInfo portal.
The contract, worth a total of CZK 30.8 million, was awarded to the publishing house Mladá fronta of entrepreneur František Savov.
He was accused by the Czech police in 2014 of tax evasion and being prosecuted while on the run.
Savov fled to the UK and the Czech Republic is asking for his extradition.
The case was brought to the attention of Aktuálně.cz.
According to the original criteria, the award of the contract was to be decided by the CzechTrade 60 percent of the prize offered and the remaining 40 beauty contest, i.e. the quality of the project.
While it was Savov's company that was greatly helped by the latter criterion.
According to information from Dotyk.cz, she received one hundred points in all partial quality criteria.
This is what moved her in the end to another candidate, the Vltava Labe Media VLM publishing house, which offered a better price.
While the Young Front operated with an amount of CZK 404,900 per month, the VLM offered CZK 324,350.
Unlike the Young Front, however, it received a below-average rating from the assessors in all the qualitative criteria, a total of 62 points.
The tender was also attended by consultancy firm BDO Advisory and the digital agency R-Media, which, like Aktuálně.cz, falls under the publisher Economia.
VLM issued several objections to the tender result, saying that its evaluation considered the no-those unfair and insufficiently reasoned.
Following their rejection, it decided to challenge the competition with the Office for the Protection of Competition to the Office of the Competition.
He believes that CzechTrade proceeded in violation of the law.
"The promoter is convinced that the contracting authority has reached a decision on the selection of the contractor of the public contract on the basis of a purely subjective evaluation, clearly the favoured participant Mladá fronta, a.s., to the detriment of the promoter and other suppliers," reads the application for initiating the procedure filed at the OHS this week, which was published by Aktuálně.
According to the CEO and Chairman of the Board of Directors of the VLM, Michal Klíma, the scoring of the selection committee appears to be an implausible and 100% evaluation of the Young Front project for all of its members as extremely suspicious.
"Each independent observer must consider such a miraculous success of one of the competitors to be unlikely and suspicious," Klíma told Aktuálně.
CzechTrade has not yet commented on the situation.
The CzechTrade news agency does not fundamentally comment on public contracts before they are concluded.
All information about the contract you mentioned is published in accordance with the Act in the Profil of the Contractor and in the Public Procurement Bulletin.
"A complete written report will be published after the contract is closed, but we cannot comment on its progress during the duration of the contract," the agency's media representative, Štěpán Dlouhý, told Dotyk.cz.
Mladá fronta responded by saying that it considers it extremely problematic that the publisher Economia hit the competition in a competition where it has its own business interests with an article in Aktuálně.cz.
However, this was stated in that article.
The tender may have been helped by the fact that she has provided the BusinessInfo portal with editorial services in the previous four years.
The contract was first tendered in 2013, when the Ministry of Industry and Trade was led by Martim Kuba ODS.
František Savov is blamed by the police for tax evasion in connection with the excessive VAT deductions of his companies, which caused the Czech state to damage up to 770 million crowns.
The Czech Republic has been asking the UK for its extradition since 2014.
According to Savov, the head of the ANO movement, Andrej Babiš, whose influence falls to the Mafra publishing house, is behind his criminalization.
A London court last year rejected Savov's appeal against the extradition, but the businessman appealed.
"From our point of view, the case has not moved anywhere since last year, we have not received any notification from the UK in the matter of the legal force of the judgment to this day," Štěpánka Zenklová, spokesperson for the Prague City Prosecutor's Office, told Aktuálně.cz.
In addition to owning Mladá fronta, Savov was in the Cyprus-based company Harvestor Limited, which was controlled by the Samson brewery in České Budějovice, and the Cypriot company Maraflex, which is profiled as an investment fund, buying at-risk assets.
He should also control the bankrupt company Heavy Machinery Services, formerly Legios, which owes over three billion crowns.
In the past, Savov was also associated with the takeover of property from the former Socialist Youth League.
The biker sped off the sidewalks and the park, ending up in somersaults.
The biker attracted attention by reckless driving around the streets, sidewalks and park paths in Úšovice.
When the patrol began to pursue him, he decided to outrun her in the direction of the Stand.
"Officers pursued the man with increased caution with caution through the city when he failed to drive on one of the secondary routes to Mariánské Lázně and drove the motorcycle into the field where he crashed," police spokesman Daniel Dvořák said.
In the end, a rescue helicopter had to arrive to the accident and transported the injured biker to the Pilsen hospital.
Eventually, officers discovered that the biker did not own a driver's license, the motorcycle registration plates had been stolen, his serial number polished and the actual production label removed.
It's possible the machine was stolen.
The origin of the motorcycle is subject to further investigation.
"The breathalyzer test was excluded at the scene of the driver's alcohol, but a test was found to have a positive result for the substance methamphetamine," the police spokesman added.
How football's financial rules will affect Neymar's move to Paris
Rules restricting the funding of European football clubs will in no way undermine Neymar's record-breaking transfer from Barcelona, Spain, to Paris-Saint Germain, France.
Any penalty for Paris Saint-Germain will be implemented by the EUFA, which oversees European football teams and has the authority to ban teams from participating in the prestigious Champions League.
Financial Fair Play (FFP) rules , which were introduced by UEFA in 2011 stipend that PSG will have to demonstrate that Neymar's transfer was not financed without major losses.
Barcelona paid a sum of EUR 222 million alone to buy Neymar out of his contract and Neymar will claim a salary of several tens of millions of dollars a year.
There are several financial conditions following for Neymar's transfer to France.
With the PSG team being funded by a wealthy Qatari family that made its fortune in selling energy, it can afford to bring Neymar into an already star football family.
Clubs can spend huge sums to buy players, but on the other hand have to prove legal sources of income, allowing them to cover the overheads of the football-related business.
The FFP was introduced by Michel Platini, after being appointed to the post of director of UEFA in 2007.
The former French player believed that the clubs that took debt in pursuit of new reinforcements would ultimately cheat and risk bankruptcy if the banks or the owners refused to secure them.
In 2011, the FFP redirected its attention from club debts to monitoring their losses.
This change meant that the business model used by Roman Abramovich with Chelsea in 2003 - buying a club with potential and spending exortious sums on players y to build a global brand - was suddenly not so advantageous.
Under the current three-year trial period, which will end in 2018, clubs may report a loss of up to EUR 30 million.
And despite Platini's due exit from his post in 2015, his successor, Aleksander Čeferin, is committed to advocating a ban on excessive spending.
"FFP rules are still in place and we are determined to strengthen them in the future," Andrea Traverso, who oversees compliance with FFP rules, told the Associated Press last week.
Although PSG has paid the amount for the redemption of Neymar in a one-off payment, it can spread the amount for the purposes of the accounts over the entire duration of the contract.
Neymar has signed a five-year contract, so the transfer can be broken down to €44.4 million each year for five years.
The first wave of the FFP's highest sanctions was hit by PSG in 2014, along with Manchester City, which is owned by the Abu Dhabi group.
PSG took a fine of EUR 60 million ($82 million) - which was later reduced to EUR 20 million - and a order to reduce the Champions League team to 21 players in the 2014-2015 season, instead of 25 players.
UEFA is wary of teams that can try to circumvent financial regulators by increasing their income through companies associated with club owners.
Thus, even if the Qatari company sponsors PSG, once the funding exceeds the value of the standard market rate, UEFA has the right to prohibit the statement of the amount.
A similar measure was taken by UEFA in 2014 after deciding that the funding provided by the Qatar Tourism Authority to the PSG team was too high.
Some of the Neymar's income in PSG could be paid for by the 2022 FIFA World Cup Organising Commission in Qatar, according to some reports.
However, PSG and the leaders of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar have denied the fat that Neymat should become a fame-fighting ambassador and that such a maneuver would be easily exposed by UEFY officials.
Previous sanctions imposed on PSG mean that UEFA will closely monitor any attempt to circumvent the rules,
According to the insider-initiated UEFA on Tuesday, no investigation has been initiated in the matter of Neymar's transfer to PSG.
The source of the report wished to remain anonymous as it is not entitled to comment on the situation with PSG, The Associated Press reported.
The latest published accounts show that PSG closed 2015-2016 with a net profit of EUR 10 million and a turnover of EUR 542.4 million.
The accounts for the current financial year have not yet been made public.
PSG expects the arrival of Neymar to be a huge opportunity for sponsors, merchandising and jersey sales.
The club promises to increase its turnover by up to 30 percent from the signing of the contract.
The Spanish league leaders, clearly alarmed by the departure of one of the biggest stars, sought to thwart Neymar's departure, arguing that PSG would break the FFP rules.
"This is a clear case of 'financial doping' of both the club and the state's,' said the president of the Liga, Javier Teba, for the Spanish newspaper AS, referring to the ownership of the PSG club by the Qatari syndicate.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, whose club is owned by the American sports magnate, shares La Liga's position on the club's funding.
"This is a consequence of ownership that has changed the football world from the ground up in the last 15 years," Wenger said on Thursday.
"Once the state becomes the owner of the club, anything is possible.
Compliance with the rules on financial fair play is very difficult as the state may have different interests in the participation of such players in its club."
Spartan midfielder Rosicky: The changes are painful, but we have to believe.
Sixteen thousand applauding fans on the feet.
Tomas Rosicky is going to the set.
The same sketch as in Sunday's match against Bohemians.
The Spartans midfielder stirred up the game against Crvené Zvezda, inventing several goals, but his teammates did not head to the black.
The Leten team, pumped up with new multimillion-dollar reinforcements, thus finish after the opening double-header in the European Cup.
Was it hard to do anything else with the match after Belgrade's goal?
After the goal was scored four, which was difficult for us.
We wanted to at least not lose, to boost our confidence to get away from getting bounced back to the next few games.
We had some chances.
We have to work together as a team and move up our game.
Why didn't Sparta get into the match for so long?
The game is terribly worked.
The combination of the opponent was much better than ours.
We didn't get to anything, we shot at half-time maybe one time.
Of course, that's awfully low when you have to win by two or three goals.
The second half was much better, we managed to play with them in the final third.
But you have to push your opponent into positions like this more often.
Is the problem a large number of changes to the lineup?
Of course, it's one of the pains when a new team is being formed.
We only played three competitive matches and the line-up is constantly changing.
It's about the coach finding the ideal eleven to sit down.
Is it a boost to you that you've played a part of two games in a row?
They're still just parts of the match.
I don't know how my condition will evolve and when I could finally play from the beginning.
Are you still optimistic about the changes that have taken place in Sparta?
We have to be, there's no other way.
It's the same as a wound.
If you don't believe, you can't come back.
Sparta made a decision somehow, we have to be optimistic, otherwise the situation will be even worse.
The fans came back in large numbers, but they were leaving in embarrassment.
What can you say to them?
There was an amazing visit again, as well as with Bohemia.
I am terribly sorry that we cannot please them with a better performance.
To do something to come next.
We can thank them for coming.
I don't remember such visits when I played here 15 years ago.
Can a season without cups at least be an advantage for the league?
In the meantime, we're fighting ourselves, we're playing, so it's not that much of an advantage for us.
The entrepreneur is to serve ten years for an extreme tax evasion.
The Constitutional Court rejected the complaint of businessman Jiří Toman, who is to serve ten years in prison for cutting taxes to a significant extent.
The damage estimated amounts to CZK 645 million.
Toman claimed in the complaint that the judiciary had violated his fundamental rights, the factual findings of the courts in Zlín and Olomouc were said to be incomplete.
Constitutional judges, however, called the complaint unfounded, the Czech News Agency found from the court's database.
The CPS is not another court of appeal.
"It cannot, as fourth instance, assess as a fourth instance the factual or legal errors allegedly committed by the ordinary courts if they do not constitute a breach of constitutionally protected rights and freedoms," the order reads.
Toman was tried as a fugitive.
The verdict has been final since November 2015, when it was upheld by the High Court in Olomouc.
At the time, Toman was in extradition custody in Argentina, where the resolution said he was also in the presidents.
The sentence imposed is at the upper limit of the statutory rate, which according to the verdict corresponds to the damage suffered.
The High Court has described the case as an extreme tax evasion that has a macroeconomic impact on the state budget.
The man served as Chairman of the Board of Directors of World Servis from 2005 to 2008.
The total leak of CZK 645 million was incurred for the period from January to July 2008 alone, according to the expert, the total leak exceeded the billion.
However, for procedural reasons, it was no longer possible to try Toman for the entire amount.
According to the indictment, World Service did not include all invoices in its tax returns.
Instead of monthly VAT and excise duties of at least tens of millions of crowns, taxes were paid in just hundreds of thousands.
World Service and some of the companies with which the company traded relate to businessman Radomír Vybíral, who was fined 13 years in prison by the judiciary for VAT machinations in fuel deals.
His complaint was also rejected by the Constitutional Court some time ago.
The series "Forcoming to Failure" and "Comrade Detective" play a nostalgic chord
This iteration of the story is nostalgic for both the characters from the famous 1980s; and for the filthy '90s (when the geniuses David Wain and Michael Showalter introduced the comedy sketch "The State" on MTV); and, of course, for the modern age, namely 2001, rather than stars like Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd scattered to bigger projects.
As a cultural artifact, it is a light parody and, at the same time, the embodiment of our modern Facebook era of permanent memories.
From the franchise's point of view, however, it looks like someone is running out of breath.
The "First Day of Camp" worked surprisingly well - not just because of the absurd humour (an example, the story of the creation of a talking can of vegetables voiced by H. Jon Benjamin).
The authors moved away from the main funny punchline - middle-aged actors playing horny children - and could not make fun of previous events.
The sequel to "Ten Years Later" in which adults play adults do not push as much on the emotional level, and the satire is sporadic in places, including a parody of the '90s thrillers as "The Hand on the Cradle."
At one point, the character finds a pile of junk Apple Powerbook, a roller skating and "a lot of other things from 1991."
Many of the main storylines are repeated.
The good-hearted Coop (Mr. Showalter), now a writer, has still not translated into his love of Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) is still a virgin.
Not to mention the insane plot of the plot that involves Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter), which is being spurted by George H. W. Bush (very well-casted Michael Ian Black).
As always, many incidental stories are the best part of the franchise.
Particularly entertaining is to watch the perpetually young Rudd with long hair, aka the character of Matt Dillon from the film Youth, whose once-spectable Andy's once-spectable character is now behind the old pepper.
The Franchise could be started by moments of chance madness, such as the returning "Seven Up" series, until he reaches what I assume will be a logical denouement: "Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later," when in the last scene the whole group embarks on the premiere of "Liséta to Fall to Resend."
Meanwhile, Amazon's "Comrade Detective" appeals to a different type of nostalgia: Cold War revivalism of "Such Normal Americans," "Atomic Blonde: No Pity" and even the series "GLOW" in which the icons of the East and Western Wrestling Scenes clash.
The comedy by the creators of Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanak, directed by Rhys Thomas, is intended to feature a television production: a drama about two Bucharest police officers from Romania of the 1980s who fight for truth and atheism in the manner of Marxism-Leninism.
The roles - the tenacious Gregor and the idealistic Iosfola - are starring Florin Piersic Jr. and Cornelius The Street, which were dubbed into the English language of the Channing Tatum (performing producer of the series) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
It's a wonderful idea.
Unfortunately, that's not much more.
With some of the jokes, you laugh (like policemen watching chess on TV - a parody of American football).
The series was lent its voice to many well-known actors - among them Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny.
But "Comrade Detective" is too focused on the clumber propaganda drama - which includes a Reagan-mask killer - and that's what it looks like.
Six long episodes are too long-winded, and comedy moments aren't enough.
With a shorter track, the propaganda satire in "Comrade Detective" could work, such as in the scene where Gregor and Iosef repeatedly visit the US Embassy, in whose hall two fat men gulp hamburgers stacked in a large pile.
A clear message for an imaginary communist audience is the fact that Western culture can turn everything into food and orgies.
The Romanian creators were not mistaken: we do so with our own culture, as well as with theirs.
Russian athletes did not see the IAAF ban lifting the launch ban.
At a congress in London, the IAAF International Athletics Federation confirmed the extension of the international launch ban for Russian competitors due to a state-sponsored doping programme.
The vote in the venue of the world championship, which will start on Friday, went very unequivocally, as expected.
There were 166 delegates in favour of extending the ban, with only 21 votes against.
The main reason for the rejection is mainly the fact that Russia is failing to meet all the requirements for the introduction of the anti-doping system, as stated before the congressional by the head of the IAAAF Special Investigative Group, Rune Andersen.
His group recommended that the ban should continue to take place.
Some of the older doping cases remain unsolved, a number of suspected athletes have not yet been interviewed, and coaches with a damaged reputation are still working in the country.
The Russian anti-doping agency RUSADA, which does not meet the standards of the World Anti-Doping Agency, is still fully operational.
Nevertheless, RUSADA can already carry out testing under the supervision of foreign experts and the British Anti-Doping Agency.
"Even though progress has been made, there is still a lot of work to be done," said IAAF President Sebastian Coe.
The Russian Athletics Federation was suspended in November 2015, with Russian athletes losing, among other things, to the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro last year.
Despite the ban on the upcoming World Championships, 19 Russians will participate, having previously demonstrated that they have been tested outside of the Russian anti-doping system for a long time.
But they will not be able to start in the national colours at the Championships and will not play the Russian anthem in the event of victory.
Bank of England to keep interest rate at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce that the interest rate will remain unchanged, followed by lacklustre economic growth and a weakening inflation that has choked speculation about a sharp rise.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain "in the backside" in the context of maintaining the interest rate - despite the placement of family budgets.
Political figures in the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the Bank of England voted six to two to maintain the interest rate at 0.25%. The voting results for the interest rate increase supported the lacklustre economic growth, backed by a weak increase.
In its annual inflation report, the Bank forecasted growth to 1.7% in 2017 and 1.6% in 2018, and warned that family budget cuts would continue. The Bank expects inflation to rise to 3% in the autumn.
At the same time, the Bank indicated that growth should be increased over the next few years as a result of inflation caused by Brexit, and also said that rents from movability should rise more in financial markets than expected.
Committee members also voted to withdraw part of the mammoth package, which was tasked with boosting the economy, and which was put into practice a year ago in response to Brexit.
As a result of the above, the Freshfinter Plan, which will offer cheap subsidies to banks, should start to apply from next February, although the Bank of England said it would now offer £15 billion less than the planned £115 billion.
Just before the decision, the Bank said: "The MMC predicts that gross domestic product (GDP) will stagnate in the short term, along with pressure on real household incomes and a burden on consumption."
On the rate, the Bank said it would be necessary to "treat monetary policy belts" to soothe inflation, and this is "at a higher rate" than expected by the markets.
Markets are currently forecasting a first increase in the third quarter of next year and a further increase in 2020.
However, the Bank stressed that any increase would be "free" and "limited."
The Bank's growth forecast for this year and next year has been down compared to 1.9% and 1.7% predicted in May.
The projected growth in 2018 at a value of 1.8% remained unchanged.
Following the disclosure of estimates, the pound fell against the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell by 0.5% to $1.31 and to €1.11.
The decision to maintain the status quo came after the disappointing increase buried hopes for further growth - GDP stopped at 0.3% in the second quarter, compared to 0.2% from the previous three months.
The increase is likely to remain at 0.3% in the third quarter, although the Bank's approval rating is expected to increase slightly towards the end of the year.
The latest report on inflation is a slight comfort to households hit by rising inflation and a lousy pay rise. The bank said the situation would get worse before the increase.
The report further states that the monetary policy "cannot prevent" revenue from revenue reduction in the coming years, but wages are expected to rise "significantly" towards the end of the three-year forecast.
Economics should also rise because of its great interest in British goods thanks to the weak pound, which will offset a lower percentage of consumer spending.
This decision came a year after rates were cut to 0.025% last August in response to the shocking vote on the EU's shocking referendum, causing the pound to fall.
The Bank estimates that the full unification of prices and the economy will take at least four years.
Prior to the bank's decision on the latest rates, many demanded a rise in rates, along with rising inflation, which put increasing pressure on households. Three policymakers demanded an increase to 0.5% in June.
Inflation fell back to 2.6% last month from June's 2.9%, even though the Bank said it had expected such a change and inflation was expected to rise again over the next month.
The Bank stated that the overrun of the relative to 2% of the target was "quite" due to the weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: "Given the recent crash of swap rates, it looks like the competition in the mortgage market will only rise as soon as creditors start competing for orders to look at a good outlook towards the end of the year.
The market looks particularly good for those who end up with existing contracts and re-camprizes - there are no-fee options on offer, as are the low rates they are gaining in popularity."
NHS prescribes controversial HIV drug to 10,000 patients
Patients will gain access from September to 'transformative' treatment to HIV prevention based on a Supreme Court's decision to fund the NHS drug.
The English National Health Service (NSH) reported that the pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) pill, which is used before sex and reduces the risk of infection in high-risk patients by up to 86 percent, will be offered via the health service to approximately 10,000 patients in the three-year trial period.
The NSH agreed to finance the probationary period after the appeals court supported the Supreme Court's decision last year to say that the NHS had the funds to pay for PrEP despite the statement that the medicine should be funded by the local authorities.
The decision, announced on Thursday, was taken by the NHS of England from the mouths of Director-General Simon Stevens as a 'significant intervention', while the National Aids Trust (NAT) described the decision as a 'decisive moment'.
The Sexual Health Clinic in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to start receiving patients. Other clinics will join in October and by April 2018 there will be a full implementation across England.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is an HIV drug given before sex to reduce the risk of HIV.
Tests have shown that PrEP significantly reduces the risk of HIV transmission between patients at risk.
The application of PrEP before sex means that there are a sufficient number of specific drugs in the patient's body to prevent the infection.
These medicines can be taken every day or at least two hours before sex.
Patients tested include homosexual or bisexual men, transgender people and people with HIV-positive partners who are successfully untreated.
The clinics will identify eligible participants who sign up to agree to participate in the testing, including men, women, transgender people and individuals with a partner whose HIV status is not yet controlled by appropriate treatment.
People living and registered with the GP in the UK can also sign up at their local sexual health clinic to apply for potential participation in the testing.
The program will cost the taxpayer £10 million and the NHS of England signed a contract this week to distribute medicines following the international public contract.
The test period is proposed to gather clinical evidence and assess the full potential of PrEP, its targeting, use and implementation on a large scale.
Simon Stevens added: 'This important intervention should be replenished and fully energized and fully widespread and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.
It's another milestone in a more than 30-year quest to stop one of the greatest challenges to human health.'
Deborah Gold, Executive Director of NAT (National Aids Trust) said: 'We are witnessing a decisive moment in the fight against HIV.
If PrEP is administered correctly and at risk for patients, it will offer the possibility of transforming the English HIV epidemic.
From September, the NSH will offer patients at high risk of HIV infection a new powerful tool that is individually controlled and not subject to the need to cajole a partner, leading to an improvement in the quality of many lives.
We accept this statement with pleasure.'
Ian Green, managing director of Terrence Higgins Trust said: 'The number one priority must be the rapid deployment of tests across the country; we must ensure that it is available to each patient.
We now have a test drug at our disposal, PrEP, and we are on track to protect more than 10,000 people at risk of being infected with HIV.'
Shadow Health Minister Sharon Hodgson said: 'The start of the PrEP test period is a welcome and long-awaited change after months of delays and delays by the government.
Evidence suggests how transformative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and endanglement of this life-threatening infection.
The ensuing tests will take us one step closer to a full understanding of PrEP's benefits.
It is now important that we launch the tests as soon as possible throughout the country to protect those who are exposed to HIV, bringing to an end to the spread of HIV in society together.'
A life of a high leg: mezzanine and a smart design turned this little apartment into a starlawed court into a spacious home
Joanne Leigh, a former real estate passionate banker, swapped a large house in Knightsbridge for an apartment on Earls Cour in 2014.
It is on the first floor of the Queen Anne's smart terrace - and is a graphic example of the modern design that makes the most of the available space.
"I lived with my ex-husband in a much larger house in the Knightsbridge district," Joanne said.
"I was looking for something of a more reasonable price.
I came across this apartment in the Earls Court and it had the same ceiling height.
I fell in love with him at once, and I nodded to him that same day.'
Since then, the 1,000-square-metre apartment has undergone a complete renovation.
One-room apartment with a complicated layout - to get into the bedroom, you had to go through the kitchen - Joanne wanted to add a storage space and mezzanine to use the high ceiling.
"I've been hiring high ceilings, big windows, and a lot of light.
Those were my demands," she said.
To that end, it employed Erfan Azadi from the design and design studio Duck & Shed, based in Notting Hill, and used the nearly four-metre ceiling to create a home that was not just a project but also a place to live.
The ceiling was not so high that two gaps would fit above each other - the challenge for the architects was to create an intermediate stage to walk upright on.
Erfan had to engage his creative thinking.
"The steel structure is quite complicated," he explained.
"We had to organize both spaces so we could walk upright.
It was not only about building a simple platform, but also bending the steel structure to be at the right height above and below the ceiling."
This arrangement allowed Erfan to design two full-fledged rooms on himself - while adding to the drama.
On the mezzanine, he looks down on the gorgeous living room of the old copper window frames in the Retrouvius design.
Mirror furniture in gold, silver lines and retro chandelier by Serge Mouille creates a unique style.
The use of mirrors plays an important role in the drama, space and lighting.
The short corridor is fitted with mirrors on both sides and looks so longer.
The mirror bar in the kitchen looks like a window in the next room.
At the front door there are storage rooms equipped with mirrors to store cutlery and glasses.
The advantage of the living room, which gives the whole apartment the impression of significantly more space, is the possibility to separate it from the kitchen if it is not used.
The folding kitchens are nothing new.
What is unique about this solution, however, is the folding door.
"We had to sort out the technical side," Erfan says of the reinforced veneered door.
"The children are provided with counter-seriousness to be pushed back very easily."
Thanks to the clever use of the space and storage space, Joanne gained an additional 16 square metres, a second room and a better overall layout of the apartment.
"When it comes down to it, what you're selling is a living area - or awards of your property," Erfan said.
"A real estate agent basically counts the price of the apartment when he enters the apartment, he estimates its price on the basis of the living area."
In this case, the living area was increased while maintaining the quality of the materials that lend the space a luxurious look.
"The material is very important because you touch it and create an emotional bond with your home," Erfan added.
"You don't have to focus on electricity in the walls.
Yes, they are important, but they will not get your hearts.'
As it turned out, quality design and an increase in the living space can turn an ordinary apartment into an exceptional work.
And like Joanne, you can eventually decide to stay.
The United States is disconnecting.
The cultural and political divide between the blue and red states is deepening.
California has announced a travel ban on its citizens to Tennessee and seven other states.
The state of Tennessee returned the favor and declared a retaliatory ban on its citizens' travel to California.
Of course, this is not a ban in the full sense, US citizens can travel freely in all 50 states.
The point is that California has forbidden to spend state money on the travel of its citizens to eight other states, namely Alabama, South Dakota, Kansas, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, Tennessee and Texas.
Who will stop the madness?
California is strongly for LGBT, and considers any sign of LGBT lifestyle disapproval to be discrimination.
However, Tennessee has adopted the Conscience Reinforcement Act, according to which a psychotherapist who has a moral problem with the therapy of patients from the LGBT community is under no obligation to provide it, but has a duty to provide these patients with another therapist who does not have such a problem.
Texas and other nations have passed laws under which religious charities that have been given to their mothers for adoption are not required to provide these children to same-sex couples for adoption.
Because of these conscience ado-proven laws, California banned funding for its citizens' travel to eight states from its funds.
In practice, this means that California professors must not have travel to scientific symposia in Texas, for example, reimbursed from their universities, because they are co-funded by the state of California.
Similarly, school sports teams cannot travel to tournaments or competitions to, for example, Tennessee with the financial support of their respective schools.
They must receive either federal grants for travel, but it is absurd for the federal government to finance the travel of citizens from the state of A to B state, or to private sponsorship.
The state of Tennessee ran out of patience, and its parliament passed a law with a resolution that it also dislikes California's high-ranking policies of high taxes, high state spending, high deficits, and tolerance for illegal immigrants, but still not imposing a travel embargo on California because of it.
He's in retaliation for the California travel embargo on Tennessee.
And the same will happen against any state of the Union that would impose a similar travel ban on a different state for any reason.
At the same time, he called on the parliaments of all states to stop this madness.
That's the facts, now the comment.
The situation is toxic.
First, all of this is constitutional, nothing is unconstitutional.
States have the right to adopt conscience-owner laws, as well as to decide what their money will go to and what they are not allowed to.
Second, what's wrong with a conscience advocacy?
If the butcher has a religious problem selling pork, why can't he only offer beef, lamb, poultry and fish?
Why, under penalty of punishment, force him to sell pork when there are enough butchers offering pork?
In the state of Colorado, one baker faces an anti-discrimination lawsuit and a heavy fine for refusing to bake a cake for a gay wedding.
But he also refuses to bake Halloween cakes or containing alcohol.
Why not punish him and leave him alone and not order the cake in the hundreds of bakers?
Third, the beauty of the federal system is that the constitutional rights of all the citizens of the federation are guaranteed, but individual states can adjust internal, domestic politics in indices that are not federal, i.e. according to the preferences of their populations.
Then there are diversity, diversity, diversity.
California can be California, and Texas may be Texas.
But California wants California to be California and Texas, and seven other states to be California, too!
Fourth, members of the LGBT community once rightly sought to tolerate their lifestyle.
Today, many members of this community follow the rule of live and let live, which should be governed by all reasonable people, but some activists seek not tolerance for themselves and others, but for extreme intolerance towards others.
According to them, no one must ever show moral, religious or philosophical disapproval of the LGBT lifestyle again, and is to be criminalized if they do so.
The mentality of these activists is totalitarian.
They're modern-day enemies of freedom.
Fifth, I don't know the situation in American history, when states made such tricks about political issues, except for the case alone.
Even in the days of the civil rights struggle for blacks, where the North and the West were on the side of integration and the South on the Segregation side, the states did not impose sanctions on each other.
The only case was the 1950s, the political case was slavery, and the North-South War was about to take place.
Of course, there will be no such thing now, but the situation is still toxic.
The cultural and political divide between the blue-democratic states and the red Republican states is deepening, and the US is mentally disconnecting internally.
Unauthorized agitation.
A critic of Putin was fined.
Russian opposition politician Alexei Navalny has been fined 300,000 rubles for violating the campaign rules ahead of next year.
The court fined him for urging people to participate in the unauthorised demonstrations.
Navalny has organised two major anti-government street protests in the last two months and announced that he wants to run for the post of head of state in March next year.
The Kremlin's incumbent, Vladimir Putin, has not yet announced his candidacy, but he is widely expected to do so and win again.
Navalny said the police came to his house this morning and took him to court.
He fined him for calling on people to demonstrate through videos posted on the online YouTube portal.
The fine is three hundred thousand.
"We will pull them off the judge's salary later," the Kremlin critic joked in a Twitter post.
The Russian Electoral Commission recently concluded that Navalny could not participate in the presidential election because he had previously been convicted of embezzlement.
But Navalny, who is considered a fighter against corruption, considers the relevant judgment to be politically motivated.
Fines of 300,000 rubles, or 25,000 roubles, were also imposed by the court on Thursday on Thursday on the two members of Navalny's pre-election team, Leonid Volkov and Nikolai Ljaskin.
Navalny entered Russian politics as an anti-corruption blogger and gradually became the dominant figure on the fragmented opposition scene.
The authorities are trying to prevent Navalny from the campaign.
In February, he was sentenced to a five-year suspended sentence for robbing the forestry business of Kirovles.
In May, the verdict was upheld by the Court of Appeal.
The verdict is thus final, which prevents Navalny from running under Russian law.
Brothers fight over $500 million for empire
Two brothers are now, more than four decades after the founding of the empire, by their Italian family, over one of the most expensive Victorian properties worth more than $500 million.
Former Carlton Football Club and developer Colin De Lutis reside in the Toorak estate, only three rooms from his younger brother Paul, who has driven a dispute over joint property and business fortunes to the supreme court.
Paul wanted to leave the family business as early as 2014, but a fierce dispute is constantly being scourged before the Supreme Court.
He and his mother, Anna, owns a total of 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars. The first store was purchased by the family in 1973 at Smith Street in Collingwood.
At this point, the family founded the Westco Jeans company, which grew into a chain with 160 brick-and-mortar stores.
In 1999, the family sold the entire company for $85 million.
Other properties were purchased for the money, and the De Lutis family's portfolio now includes offices, construction land in Brunswick and Sorrento, apartments on the Gold Coast and Mt Buller and shopping centers in the suburbs.
Paul owns about one-third of the company's assets, while his father, Colin, who, in Paul's words, is a "significant driver of the De Lutis family" owns less than two-thirds of his assets.
The court's writings state that Colin owns $316 million worth of real estate, while Paul manages $176 million worth of real estate.
For Paul, it was the division of property and funds that became a problem.
"Colina's suggestion came out in his eyes a lot in his favor," Paul wrote in an affidavit at the court in 2015.
Last Friday, after several unsuccessful attempts at conciliation, the first meeting of the Supreme Court took place.
The brothers are now also competing to see who will control the existing business - from which he claims to have Paula cut off.
Colin contradicts the fact that this is not true and accuses Paul of misdirectioning some real estate.
In a previous affidavit, Colin said he believed in a successful resolution of the conflict.
"My Italian origin dictates that family is the most important thing of all," he wrote.
The cost of court appearance is up. Hundreds of affidavits, e-mails and reports from companies, including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, are in the wake of attorneys, including Allan Myers, QC and the defenders of both parties.
Mrs. De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who ran dairy bars and delicacies from the 1950s and bought a shop in Brunswick in the 1970s.
With the money obtained by building the property, they bought a property in Collingwood, where Colin opened the first family jeans business.
Colin said that when he founded Westco "in his senior year of college, Paul was still a little, about 10-year-old boy."
Anna De Lutis said that he and Luigi, who died in 2012, had hoped that the transfer of property to the sons would take place in a good way.
"Luigi often used to say that he never wanted his sons to end up in court," she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis family group. Colin said that Mark was compensated for $10 million and Luke $26 million in his departure.
As Paul put it, both Luke and Mark "did not be satisfied with the terms of their financial compensation."
Colin has been holding back ever since, despite the fact that he is a former member of the board of AFL, as Eddie McGuire, a well-known TV personality and best friend, Colin, said in his 2015 autobiography.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul de Lutis and their lawyers on Friday.
Colin replied only through a text message in which he stated that, given the fact that the dispute was settled in court, "I have nothing to add."
"It is very sad that my brother Paul has decided to settle the matter in court," he wrote.
In mid-2016, in a statement in court, Colin said he had tried to adapt to his brother's demands.
"Our father would be very unhappy to see our current situation," he said, adding that he was "still hoping for a successful solution."
On Friday, all hopes were in the offing.
"Our disputes will resolve the court hearing shortly," Colin wrote.
The heat in the Czech Republic.
Teachers shower children.
Public transport drivers are getting water and summer clothes.
At the Na Chodovci nursery school in Prague 4, where about 35 children now attend, they only go out in the morning.
The nursery is renovated and the planted trees do not yet provide a large shade.
There's no swimming pool, but the teachers shower the kids in the fog area.
In the afternoon, the children stay in the classrooms where the blinds are lowered and the drapes are drawn.
The air is being cooled by the air purifier because they don't have air conditioning.
It is also challenging for female teachers and cooks.
"The temperature, which is in the interior and exterior, exceeds the hygienic limits for nursery schools, so we should not actually have an open operation during this period," said the director of the nursery, Miloslava Makovičková.
There is a glass corridor in the kindergarten, where it says the temperature is around 40 degrees.
We air out in the morning after 6:00, the windows close, and we have the blinds on the south sides to protect ourselves.
"But it doesn't do much good," she added.
They have better conditions in the forest nursery Na Hráže v Hostivice, where children spend most of their time outdoors.
We have trees in the property, so we're below them.
"We have a beautiful walnut tree, there's a table under it, and that's where we do things," said the kindergarten director, Barbora Kompanová.
The teachers try to go to the woods with the children, where it is more cool.
Children's caps are wet and have various games with water on the agenda.
"We have a hand-held pressure spray that's used for flower spraying, and we use it to shower children," Kompanová said.
The director of the kindergarten in Novoborská Street in Prosek, Prague, Jitka Vilimovská, also said that the teachers try to keep the children in the shade and sprinkle them with water.
"We have a fairly mature garden, so they're under the trees," she said.
He goes out in the morning and then after the 3 p.m.
Every child must have a headgear.
The teachers also remind children to drink.
They can choose, for example, a little sweetened tea or diluted juice, and have a tap with water in the garden.
They also have a vegetable salad to eat every day and always have fresh fruit and vegetables to eat, which is sometimes brought to them by their parents.
"Maybe today one mother brought about a ten-kilo melon for children here," Makovičková added.
Drivers get water or a summer uniform.
The Prague transport company DPP provides them with water, ionic drinks or summer uniforms on hot days.
The cabs of both tram and bus drivers are in most cases air-conditioned, DPP spokesperson Aneta Řehková said.
In addition to cabins, some trams are also air conditioned in the passenger compartment.
Tram tracks have not yet been seriously damaged by high temperatures.
Minile damage occurred in a loop in Hostivař.
At the current high temperatures, we take particular care to ensure that drivers have sufficient drinks at their disposal.
"Cleer-ridden drinking water is available in all loops, rotation points and carriage houses," said Řehková.
In the depot and in some of the alternating places, the employees have so-called sodobars, which produce cooled soda.
Drivers also receive soluble protective ion drinks.
"They can also use the summer uniform, which increases the comfort of drivers in their daily shifts," the spokesperson added.
The hot and dry weather of the past few days has resulted in an increased number of fires.
On Tuesday, firefighters in the whole of the Czech Republic disposed of 108, twice the long-term daily average.
On Tuesday, during the day, when temperatures in the Czech Republic climbed over 35 degrees Celsius, firefighters were mainly busy fighting the fire.
"Fires predominate in the natural environment and also those associated with harvest works," firefighter spokesperson Nicole Zaoralová said.
The relief for the firefighters was not brought even by an evening change in the weather, when the heat in a number of places was replaced by storms and torrential rainfall.
In connection with the storms, firefighters were riding out on 236 interventions.
It was mainly about removing fallen trees and branches.
"They intervened most in the Central Bohemian Region," Zaoralová continues.
But the help of firefighters was also needed in Stvolínky na Českolipsku, where 60 people were evacuated to safety from the children's camp due to the storm.
Tropical temperatures have also given work to Prague rescuers.
On Tuesday and Wednesday, ambulances were riding out on a dozen cases of carbon monoxide poisoning from the bar.
People should therefore have their water heats checked, the rescuers warn.
Carbon monoxide is a colourless, odourless gas released in imperfect combustion.
Symptoms of poisoning include nausea, vomiting, headache and feeling faint.
If poisoning is suspected, you need to leave the infested room.
Trump's new chief of staff plans to curb the president's media diet
Before him, many had tried, and always failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly actually can.
If so, he'll be the first.
Politico reported that the new chief of staff at the White House planned to limit President Trump's information flow - including coverage of the TV news - in the hope of keeping Trump afloat.
Here is a piece of the report by reporter Josh Dawsey:
"When the new White House chief of staff, John F. Kelly met with staff on his first day of office, outlining the key problem of Trump's White House, which he intends to correct: incorrect information that comes to the president's hands.
Kelly told the staff that he had to personally approve all the information - whether on paper or a beer's say - because the president could make a better decision based on the right information."
In fact, Kelly's diagnosis makes sense, but many of his predecessors have cut their teeth at checking up on Trump and his media presentation.
Trump's relationship with the media dates back several decades - and now, sitting in the White House, his habit of watching TV news is even stronger.
"If Trump was upset with honest stories as a candidate, it was fitting to show him that a lot of other media were talking about him in a positive light, which was easier to convince," said Politico's Sam Nunberg, a former campaign adviser, to Politico in February.
Tara Palmeri of Politico wrote at the time that "the key to keeping Trump's tweets in check - at least in the words of the six former campaign organizers - is to ensure that Trump regularly follows the media that sing praise him."
All right.
But the idea that Trump's tendency to post his views on Twitter has ever been "under-control" is ridiculous.
Perhaps these campaign organizers know something that others have no idea about - that Trump's tweets would be more outrageous if they weren't checked.
The tweets that Trump never sent out are very unlikely to be known.
If his employees managed to keep him in check at least several times, then their efforts were not for nothing.
But no one has yet been able to regularly prevent Trump from raising controversial issues.
Part of the problem is that in the White House, which consists of rival factions, people regularly try to strengthen their agenda by subtracting Trump's materials - but may not be reliable - that support their view of the world.
In May, the Politico portal, which covered the issue, published a report on the slope of advisers' guidance on the submission of questionable information to the head of state.
This is an example of such information from the pen of reporter Shane Goldmacher:
"Turkey and former Trump officials argue that the president often reacts very angrily to negative media reports, especially reports of leaks, and he seeks to find their origins.
This situation occurred at the end of February when someone slipped the president a copy of an article from GotNews.com - a website of the provocateur Charles C. Johnson - who accused Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh of being a 'source of many leaks' from the White House.
Regardless of the fact that Johnson was banished forever from Twitter for harassment; or that he did not substantiate his claim with any evidence; or that he had already published false accusations in the past and later recalled them.
Trump read the article and started asking about Walsh."
Goldmacher added that then-chief of staff Reince Priebus and White House secretary Rob Porter "tried to implement the system to manage and dossiance of information that President Trump receives."
Would that work?
Kelly is now, three months later, trying to push through the same strategy.
He may turn out to be a more efficient manager than Priebus, but Trump's impulsiveness doesn't just fade, and his helpers are still competing for power.
These immutable factors will certainly make Kelly's mission worse.
Tourists negotiate a ditch and return to the 'Millionaire's Quarter'
The few most affounding homeowners in West Midland, England, are once again taking on a run-in with determined tourists who are negotiating with the local authorities to re-granchise the field for their seats.
Tourists parked 20 caravans in a field near the thriving street in the town of Solihull, which is nicknamed the 'millionaire district'.
Marching horses, children and an army of caravans, the tourists return after being banished in May. They were not afraid of the ditch, which was dug at the scene under the authorities' orders to prevent their invasion.
The Tactical Group found gaps in defence and penetrated the field of caravans with the unprotected gap that served the journey.
Frequest residents of the district attacked the city's board of directors of Solihull, saying that 'not capable of solving the problem'.
One of the residents who wished to remain anonymous said, 'They'd found the place on Monday night after they'd been moved to Bentley Heath Street, where they threw rocks at other people.
The Board of Directors should be ashamed of its inability to solve the problem.
All the tourists had been moved to a different place, and now they've returned.
More arrived last night, and there's probably more to reach today.'
She added that 'Birmingham's board of directors knew how to deal with this problem. He uses court orders to protect the parks.
I live on Streetsbrook and I don't intend to continue paying my taxes until the board of trustees has settled with the tourists.'
Another of the anonymous residents said, 'It's ridiculous. We were just the last one watching the last of the departing tourists, and now they're back.
And this time there are even more of them, and this time they brought the horses with them.'
The press spokesperson for the city's board of directorship, Solihull, said: 'We are aware of the unauthorised stay on the property near Streetsbrook Road and, in cooperation with the local police, are taking the necessary legal steps to resolve the problem to a successful solution to the problem.
To gather as much evidence as possible, it is essential for as many local residents as possible to report any unsociable or unlawful conduct by the police at number 101.
This will give us the general picture we will deliver in court.'
The MEP's husband was hit by a car in Brussels.
He was brought in by a government special.
A government special brought the injured Róbert Zhitňanský to Bratislava on Wednesday after noon.
Two ambulances were waiting at the airport and he was under the constant control of Slovak doctors on board the plane.
The long-planned flight went off without complications.
Róbert Žitňanský, according to TV JOJ, had a serious accident in Brussels in early summer.
He said he was hit by a car and has been in serious condition ever since.
After being transported to his homeland, he was transported to a specialist workplace at one of Bratislava's hospitals.
The economic analyst is the husband of the NOVA Slovak MEP Jana Žitňanská.
She would not comment on the incident.
The couple have three children together.
Italians clamp down on NGO rescue ships with immigrants on board
Italy has announced that it will prevent the arrival of the NGO rescue ship arriving at the coast of Italy with immigrants from the Mediterranean if the NGO does not sign the new rules regulating their operations.
"If the NGO does not sign the new rules of conduct, it will be difficult for us to imagine that they could continue their operations," Interior Minister Marco Minniti said in an interview with Turin daily La Stampa.
Minniti's warning came a day after Italian authorities were seized by the German rescue organization's Jugend Rettet on suspicion of human trafficking, which greatly eases illegal immigration.
The rescue organisation, which is in its first year, declined to comment on the matter on the grounds of allegations by Italian state prosecutor Ambrogia Cartosiose.
"For us, the number one priority is and always will be to save lives. We are therefore very sorry that we cannot currently operate in the rescue zones," the organization said in a social media statement.
"We can only comment on any current accusation after gathering all the information and assessing the situation."
Italian authorities have been following the Jugend Rettet Iuventa ship since October.
Her crew is suspected of transporting immigrants on the boat, handed over directly by traffickers to them directly, repeatedly.
At least one meeting occurred, according to the applicant's file, it was only 1.3 miles from the coast of Libya. The course of the meeting was published by the Italian media.
The ship's crew is suspected of breaking the law and circumventing the Italian Coast Guard, which oversees the rescue operations in the area - of humanitarian enthusiasm, rather than anything else.
The Code of Conduct provides for the presence of an Italian police officer on board ships such as Iuventa to monitor activities.
Only three of the nine non-governmental non-profit organisations involved in the rescue operations have so far agreed to adhere to the Code: Save The Children, Malta's MOAS and the Spanish Pro-Activa Open Arms.
The latter organisation said on Thursday that the new rules were not necessary but acceptable as they were not of any "substantial change or obstacle" as regards the rescue operations.
The adoption of the new code of conduct was also rejected, for example, by Doctors Without Borders (MSF), which is the Nobel Prize winner.
Minniti, meanwhile, has been quoted as saying that the sharp drop in immigrants in recent weeks, who are disembarking in Italy as part of rescue operations, suggests that efforts to boost patrols off the coast of Libya and cooperate with local mayors are bearing fruit.
"In recent days, we are beginning to see the light at the end of the tunnel," the minister said.
He also revealed plans for further negotiations to be held this month with the mayors of Libya on the topic of economic development initiative, as well as with representatives of Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving these countries in the hope of reaching Europe.
Shameless Mesarošová: Silicone and cellulitis crawled from the jumpsuit!
The hot summer days are all the tock for it, to take on the most necessary to cover up the most intimate parts.
Only Dominika Mesarošová does it the other way around.
The afternoon meeting at the Prague Zoo, where the actors, presenters, singers and all those with dealing with TV Prima were swarming, she was swarming her little footwear in a mini-trap.
And all it took was a few common moves, and the model showed everyone her silicones, but also her bottom.
Overal had cut between her half-watch how many times, and it was so high that she had to keep adjusting it.
She certainly had no shortage of the attention of the gentlemen and the photographers present.
Michelle Carter convicted of sending text messages urging Conrad Roy to commit suicide
The woman from Massachusets was sentenced to imprisonment for a height of two years for inciting her friend to commit suicide via text messages and phone calls.
Michelle Carter, 20, will serve 15 months on a two-year sentence for bars and then spend five years on parole.
Carter was convicted in June of the involuntary killing of Conrad Roy, who took his own life at 13. July 2014.
Roy's father testified in court on Thursday, "The whole family is devastated.
My son was my best friend."
Carter was left free until a decision was made.
She faced up to 20 years in prison, but her lawyers argued that she and Roy had suffered from mental illness.
Dressed in red pants and a cream blouse, Carter stood in place at the verdict with tears in her eyes, clasped-eyed hands and eyes aimed at the ground.
"Imony's actions have killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor told the judge.
"She ended his life to relieve herself.
She could not accept her own responsibility," she said.
"She didn't feel any remorse."
Carter's attorney, however, said these were "unfortunate circumstances that he deeply regrets about."
Judge Lawrence Moniz added that "her age or maturity or even mental illness do not have a significant impact on its actions."
The applicant read out the statement by Roy's mother, Lynn Roy, "It will not pass a day or so that I do not mourn the loss of my son.
I want him to be proud of me - I take care of his sisters, and together we will endure the immense pain we will carry with us forever," the statement said.
Roy's sister, Camdyn Roy, testified that she was "fading" to her knowledge that she would never attend her brother's wedding and never be his children's aunt.
"The loss of the man I've seen since I was born is the pain I'll carry with me for life," she said.
The state of Massachusetts does not have a valid law that penalizes the person who facilitates the suicide of another person. The case therefore sets a legal precedent.
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found in the car seat in a car that was poisoned with carbon dioxide in 2014.
The case drew the attention of the entire nation after the release of Carter's text messages that instigated the suicide.
"You hang out of a building or stab yourself, I don't care," the text messages Carter had just sent two weeks before his death, when Roy was on a family vacation.
A few minutes before she was a suicide, she wrote to him, "You have to do it, Conrade," and "you just get the generator on and you'll be single and happy."
Judge Moniz said that Carter longed for attention through Roy's death and ordered any comment in the press to be refrained.
The case raised many questions.
One of the people who sided with Carter was Amanda Knox, who was convicted of the murder of her British roommate in Italy in 2007. Two years ago, she was acquitted of the charges.
Miss Knox (30) published a statement in the Los Angeles Times: "Michelle Carter deserves to be sympathy and help, not prison."
Audi to modify up to 850,000 diesel vehicles in response to sharp response
Just a day before the Audi announcement, BMW, the carmaker said it would offer its customers a software update in more than 350,000 vehicles.
The BMW president said the company believed that "there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions" in response to European cities - including Munich, which is the headquarters of BMW - that are considering banning or restricting diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it would modify three million Mercedes cars across Europe to reduce diesel emissions.
None of the companies called this decision a withdrawal.
European car manufacturers have largely promoted the use of diesel atomobilis in Europe and the United States to comply with the carbon dioxide emissions regulation.
However, nitrogen oxide emitted by diesel engines is considered a carcinogen and can cause asthma.
At the same time, the cost of automakers to install the equipment is being neutralised by the gas emitted by diesel engines, making it more expensive for cars to become competitive.
While German carmakers are facing close searches, Chancellor Angela Merkel is facing accusations of spoiling powerful car companies and ignoring their problems.
The companies are trying to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen, which, in an attempt to meet emission limits, installed software in its cars that reduced the amount of emissions issued during testing, but was deactivated by the software under normal conditions.
Several senior Volkswagen officials have been indicted in the United States, and others are being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, a former head of the thermal imaging at the Aud Audi's engine development department would be arrested in Germany.
Former manager Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio is of Italian nationality and is therefore not covered by the extradition, so he may face a trial in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi joined the German police's criminal investigation into the Volkswagen car of the car, after authorities were accused by Audi of installing a system to circumvent Europe's emissions limits - and thus expanded the charges that Audi faces in the US.
Audi's inclusion in the investigation may have a detrimental impact on Volkswagen: luxury carmaker is a disparaging share of Volkswagen's profits.
The plane made an emergency landing on the beach.
The man and the little girl were killed.
The accident took place on the beach of Praia de São in the Costa da Caparica area, some 30 kilometres south of Lisbon.
One of the witnesses told the television channel SIC Noticias that the plane had been flying just over people sunbathing on the beach before landing.
Some people from the beach reportedly ran from the danger to the sea.
Unfortunately, two people failed to escape the machine.
According to local media, a 50-year-old man and an eight-year-old girl were killed on the beach.
"The plane hit them and they were dead at the scene," said local police chief Pedro Coelho Dias.
Their nationality is not yet known.
There were two people on board the plane, both of whom escaped the accident alive and the officers took them away for questioning.
D11 or how not to build a highway.
And are the highways in the Czech Republic even complete?
I'll give you a riddle.
It's unfinished, even though it started to be built in 1978.
Even if it's unfinished, it's constantly being repaired.
And it must not be built any further, even if it has a building permit.
What is it?
Yes, the D11 motorway in Hradec.
Construction of another of its sections was newly stopped for at least a few months by the Children of the Earth movement.
We EastEnders get the highway in pieces like a salami cut.
The wheelbarrow will be cut, and then we'll see when and if we'll get any more.
We don't want anything miraculously.
We just want to reduce the journey time and we want to get trucks going to Poland or from Poland from villages and towns.
The endless currents of trucks go directly through the towns of Jaroměř or Náchod, which is not a sensible way to go around.
But the last leg of our dream highway was put into operation in 2008, an astonishing nine years ago.
Not a knock since.
That is why, recently, when the remaining four kilometers of unfinished section to Hradec Králové started to be built and on other sections to Jaroměř, the archaeological survey began, with the construction of construction starting at the end of this year, you could hear the loud banging of junkters in eastern Bohemia.
No one believed it anymore.
Last week it was revealed that it would not be built this year.
And maybe not even next year.
The Children of the Earth-Club movement for sustainable transport from Brno has filed for decomposition.
Earth's children are repeating their D1 tactics.
They contested the building permit decision in its entirety.
In the appeal, they request a review of all binding opinions of all the institutions concerned already issued.
For example, the Municipality of Hradec, the Ministry of the Environment, but also the Ministry of Defence or the Rail Authority.
So far, we are descending from the D11 near the village with the eloquent name of the Burike.
So we get down, we just drive down the highway and suddenly we're standing on a side road, preferring to subsequently get into the column.
The worst part is that you see such stories all over the country.
Scary, constantly clogged road to Benešov, the D1 or D8 motorway.
Everyone has their Funeral.
What do the Children of the Earth demand?
What is the nature of the problems of road construction in the Czech Republic?
And why is the motorway network virtually in the incomplete system?

Lavender of Provence threatens climate change
The Lavender has become a Provence symbol in the area of south-east France, but are now at risk from climate change.
Lavender is dwindling as a result of dry climates and harmful insects, causing a consternation to the faces of researchers and farmers seeking a solution.
Eric Chaisse, an expert at the agriculture research institute CRIEPPAM in Provence said: "Pivation of lavender cultivation in Provence is at risk because in the last few years this plant has been exposed to climate change brought with it by less precipitation in spring and autumn.
This affects the lifetime of the lavender.
It is also the fault of the gypsies and grasshoppers carrying the micro-bacteria that thrive in the dry climate."
There's a lot at stake.
Lavender attracts tourists, and the oil they are made of them is an important component of perfume and cosmetics.
Eric Chaisse said, "Instead of long and beautiful flowers, smaller, undeveloped, and often weak plants grow.
The amount of oil derived from these lavenderings is, of course, less.’
A possible solution may be to distribute water more efficiently and slow the evaporation of water from the soil, but also to spray the lavender with a protective mixture of clay and water and the breeding of more types of dry weather resistant.
Journalist's murder highlights mounting threats in Mexico
Riodo's staff regularly gathers every Wednesday to discuss news of the riots taking place in the Sinaloa region involving organized criminals, corrupt officials and relentless drug wars.
Today, however, under the onslaught of recent events, it is mainly due to its own safety.
They learn that it is important for them to change their habits.
Two deserving journalists talk about what would be safer: to take their children with them to an office that was attacked with a grenade in 2009 or left at home.
Security experts wrote three simple words on the blackboard: opponents, neutral, and allies.
They ask journalists to give names to each word - no evidence is needed, just use imagination and a pre-critz.
Choosing them from is something - drug traffickers, politicians, businessmen and journalists are suspected of taking money from the government or the drug cartels - a catalogue of criminals whose job it is to cover up criminal conduct.
The violence continues to cease and the bodies pile up in a pile across the country; the number of journalists among them is constantly growing: according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, at least 25 have been from the rise of President Enrique Pena Nieto to power in December 2012; 589 journalists are under federal protection after attacks and threats; and in all seven states have been killed this year.
Among them, the co-founder of the Riodioce periodical, the editor and inspiration for colleagues, Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is living in Mexico and working as a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his many books on the violence associated with the drug trade.
Its loss is noticeable, although its presence is all-pervasive - a large photograph of Valdez with the words "Justice" on which the middle finger shows hangs in the front of the building; two journalists - Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez - are aged over 30 years, wearing a T-shirt with a photograph of Valdez on their face, glasses on their nose and Panama cap.
The meeting takes place less than two months after his death; journalists speak of mutual traumas, nightmares, insomnia and paranoia.
Despite the fact that a special federal prosecutor's office was set up in 2010 to address the cases of journalists, it has so far sued two suspects, according to the Committee's comments to journalists.
Most of the thousands of murders that occur every year are associated with drug trafficking and organised crime. The journalists' killer is thus very rarely coming to court.
Journalists from Riodoce insist that they report on the violence that is happening in the Sinaloa; even though they are destroyed by grief and the said territory is now very treacherous.
Without information about the killers and the prospect of justice, the safety meeting is irrelevant, says Ibarra.
"It's foolish to waste time on such meetings," he adds.
"If we don't get more information, no one can be trusted."
On the morning of 15 May, Valdez left the headquarters of Riodozo in Culiacan, the capital of Sinaloy.
He managed to drive several blocks when his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men who pulled him out of the car and killed him with 12 rounds, apparently because of the title of the article - which can be translated as the Twelfth River.
The shooters then boarded his car and crashed him not far from the scene.
Valdez died at the age of 50.
He left behind a wife and two adult children.
In Culiacan, the rumors seem to spread fast.
In Valdez's case, however, it is a suspicious silence.
Since the arrest of Guzmán and his January extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the country's bloodiest battlefields as the competing faction tries to fill in an empty space.
Every day several people are killed in the streets of Sinaloi, and the cemetery is filled with embroidered two-storey mausoleums for drug kings, many of which are larger than the houses.
Forget for a moment that the word "ruce" thinks that one drug cartel is controlled by a coastal state with precious ports and important routes through which drugs travel to the United States.
The upstart to this, as well as the fact that Valdez was intimately acquainted with the risks of his job, with Ismail Bojorquez (60), co-founder and director of Riodoce, still resurrecting from not protecting his friend.
He believes two misconduct contributed to his death.
The first was the February edition of the interview with Damaso Lopez, the leader of one of the rival drug cartels that fought the war with Joaquín Guzmán's sons.
The conciliation could anger the sons; the male suspects had bought up all the copies of the newspaper the moment they landed on the shelves.
The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave the country for his own safety after the confiscation of other newspapers in which the same story was printed.
Valdez has become a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his death is seen as an important milestone in the fight of Mexican criminals against journalists.
He had managed to survive so long, and all his friends and colleagues believed that this would never change.
He was practically a veteran in the Noroest periodical when he decided to sell his $50 shares in 2003 and start with five Riodoce colleagues.
In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to run journalism and not mention the drug trade," said Bojorquez.
Riodo gained a good reputation in time for brave and truthful news coverage; the newspaper began to thrive.
Journalists liked to go into searching for troubled topics and posting texts without censorship - the reader was fascinated to read stories that no one else dared to publish.
Eight years after its founding, Riodoce won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot for reporting on Latin America.
That same year, Valdez won the International Freedom of the Press of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists for his brave reporting on the Mexican drug trade.
Valdez openly admitted that he was afraid.
"I was worried about my life," he said in the upaugene.
Drug trafficking in Sinaloae is a "condemnine of life," Valdez said in an interview with Rompeviento TV in October last year.
"You have to take on the role of journalist - or play the stupid.
I don't want to be asked, 'What were you doing in the face of death . . . why didn't you say what was going on?''
Riodo employees miss the Valdez. The man was known for his joking and his indiscriminate language. He was a good friend who liked to give advice and hugs - a teacher who knew how to survive.
Everyone relied on his daily routine.
He always wore his hat.
He would often go to the El Guayabo Bar across from the offices and sit at the same table.
Now they ask: was this routine caused by his death?
His death also raised questions about his own assumptions - how to do his job as best he could and stay alive?
"They don't like getting involved with their wives, their kids, clean shops, the secret landings."
"These things were forbidden," Bojorquez said.
As a result, there is a high level of self-censorship and self-preservation.
You must trust your instincts.
If you feel something's wrong here, your hands are gone.
The trouble is, Riodoce editor Andres Villarreal said that "sniff is a sense that can be fooled . . . and then the Javier thing happened."
The old rules, he says, as it did, according to others, no longer apply in Sinaloae - as in the states of Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero, and other states that are home to a toxic mix of lucrative smuggling trails, weak governments, and corrupt politicians.
The landscape is constantly changing.
No mobile phones are allowed in the room where Riodo employees meet; a few days ago, spyware was discovered, which was purchased by the governments to monitor Mexican journalists and activists.
Outside the building, two police officers find relief in the shadow of a nearby tree in the shadow of the 40-degree heat.
They were chosen by the state to protect the Riodoky offices, located in a four-storey building in the townhouses of Culiacan.
Journalists are making fun of whether these police officers are one of those 50 percent of the law's protectors who, according to the government, are corrupt.
It has been months since journalists have made their last trip to the mountainous areas that are essentially controlled by drug cartels.
This week's three main stories are on the agenda.
The first is the murder of the brother of former boxer Julio César Chávez in Sinaloe.
They are also positive for suspicious government spending in the home city of the governor of the state.
There were also several abductions recently in one of Culacán's most luxurious restaurants, a mere block from the prosecutor's office.
Officially, no one reported the identity of the abducted people or the circumstances of the kidnapping, so journalists were wary when they were about to write about what every city dweller knew: that the restaurant was a popular destination for drug traffickers and politicians.
One journalist read from public records that the restaurant was registered under a name that is associated with a politician who is a member of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) controlling all levels of the political scene for almost the entire century.
Several PRI governors have recently been charged with corruption in high-level positions.
Villarreal asked journalists to write about earlier incidents that took place at the restaurant, including an incident in which one of Joaquín's "El Chapo" Guzmarán's sons were leaked to an army intervention unit.
A month ago, readers would have read about the subject in Valdez's section, which was the best source of information about the abductions.
"Walhere would have solved the case," said Villarreal (46), who is nicknamed "El Flaco" for his slim figure.
"Now all the informants have turned their backs on us."
Valdez's office was transformed into a warehouse for signs and labels to protest protest the killing of journalists. The employees certainly did not expect them to become press-represented activists.
Journalist Miriam Ramirez grabbed several signs and set out to demonstrate in front of the Attorney's office the following morning for another journalist.
Salvador Adame disappeared just three days after Valdez's murder in the western part of the state of Michoacán.
Only the charred body was discovered. Authorities say it's an Adamea based on DNA analysis.
The activity of journalists is escalating across the country. Many of them organize protests and scribble on the sidewalks and buildings "SOS printing."
The director of the newspaper Bojorquez is the day on a visit to Washington, where he seeks to gain international support and obtain justice for Valdez's death.
In a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa, which took place the day after the murder of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities of stalking journalists and their murders for proclaiming the truth.
In the meantime, she asked to be transferred to another department for fear that her anger could threaten her impartiality.
Valdez has repeatedly said that Mexican journalists are "beaten" by organised crime, corrupt officials and indifferent public.
In his latest book, "Narco-journalism," he wrote that journalists were dying not only at the hands of the drug cartels, but also on the order of politicians and the security forces who collaborate with organized crime.
The media supervisory group Articulo 19 has charged police and public officials with more than half of all attacks on journalists.
"You're going to die in Mexico because they want to shut you up," Ramirez added.
The murders are obviously working.
No one will forget the death of the blogger Maria Elizabeth Macías, who took place six years ago at the northern boundaries of the Tamaulipas.
Her body was found with a note allegedly signed by the Zetas Cartel: "This is how I ended up for my reports."
Next to the severed head was a keyboard and headphones.
Some branches have decided to shut down, such as the newspaper El Norte, based at the northern borders of the state of Chihuahua, in response to the March murder of the March report by the rapporteur, Miroslava Breach.
The others are still going on, just as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after the killing of their director in 2004.
In 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez addressed the public drug cartels with an introductory article entitled "What do you want from us"?
Some journalists have fled their homes or even across the border.
It's a difficult decision.
Finding a job in exile is difficult, as is getting rid of the feeling of being haunted all the time.
And journalists are persecuted and killed, such as in the case of Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered in 2015 along with four women in an apartment in Mexico City, three months after fleeing Veracruze.
For those who choose to stay and not give up their work, every day poses a big risk.
Ibarra, who wanted to be a poet someday, admits that writing about drugs scares him.
"Mexico is heading to hell, that's why I became a journalist," he said.
It's Friday's midnight, and Riodo staff is sitting on the sidewalk in front of the office - the latest edition sent to the printer - drinking beer when the phone suddenly starts ringing.
They learn that 19 people have died in a shootout between gang members and police officers near the beach resort in the town of Mazatlán.
The war is escalating, just as many of the messages left by the syndicate members in the area promised.
Journalists are posting this news from a mobile phone on the Riodo website.
Not a day goes by and the opening headline is changing again.
The sounds of police sirens point to another shootout.
Bojorquez casts a glance at the police patrol to see if they were paying attention.
If they're scared, they don't show it.
Under the huge portrait of the fallen co-founder of their periodical - whose middle finger is an eloquent slogan for the whole of Sinaloe - all Riodo staff follow his steps.
"How could we possibly think about leaving," Bojorquez said, "when an intern, on the same day that Javier was killed, an intern, asked me to take to the streets?"
Dinosaurs used camouflage to avoid enemies
At first glance, it looks like a statue, however frightening.
The researchers have now uncovered the conclusions of the first discovery of an amazing rhino-sized creature whose perfectly preserved remains - which the experts called 'Mon the Lisa of the Dinosaurs' - were found by a Canadian miner.
The remains were preserved to such a high degree that experts were able to determine the reddish-brown color of his scaly skin and said that the dinosaur had a 'problem past'.
The article in the journal Current Biology stated that it is the 'most presaintreated armored dinosaur found and one of the best dinosaur species in the world' ever.'
The ailhea is a new kind of Nododosauridae. Dinosaur lived during the Cryan period, about 110 to 112 million years ago.
His perfectly preserved condition literally shocked the researchers who described him with the words 'reconceiving.
An armored whitewadrinki, according to National Geographic, is still the best preserved fossil of its kind.
Shawn Funk, who was diagnosed with the fossil on March 21, 2011, drill at the Suncor Millenium mine near Alberta, Canada.
He came across what appeared to be a foreign object and decided to explore it more closely.
The fossil was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
The researchers spent the next six years working to uncover the animal from a huge chunk of land weighing 1100 kg.
After the work, the dinosaur is ready to be revealed.
'Just squint your eyes a little and you'll believe he's asleep,' said the work manager, Caleb Brown, and the Royal Tyrrell Museum's naturalist, where the animal is on display.
'It will certainly go down in history as one of the most beautiful and most-preserved dinosaur species - the Mona Lisa of the Dinosaurs.'
Studying his skin, the researchers found that this herbivore - despite being covered with armor and resembling a walking tank - was very likely to face a serious threat from carnivorous dinosaurs.
The heavily armored dinosaur used red and white camouflage to protect against predators and used a cloaking system used by many animals today.
Experts say it allowed him to better blend in with his surroundings and avoid his enemies. The cloaking system suggests that it was a popular meal of larger dinosaurs.
Reports of the 110 million-year-old dinosaur of the Nodosauridae family first appeared in newspapers in May. It is currently available for viewing at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
The researchers named him Borealopelta markmitchelli after the museum's technician, Mark Mitchell, who, along with the team, spent more than 7,000 hours carefully uncovering the fossil.
Thanks to the amazingly preserved state of the fossil, dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the patterns and shape of scales and armor all over the body.
They revealed the cloaking method commonly used by today's animals in defence - the upper part of the animal was darker than its lower part.
Although this camouflage effect is common in nature, the researchers' findings are surprising, as Borealopelta's size far exceeds today's animals using the same technique.
It is therefore possible that the dinosaur was so many predators that evolution preferred to camouflage to confrontation in survival.
Many contemporary animals with camouflage - such as deer, zebra and or armadillo - are much smaller and also more vulnerable as prey, suggesting that nosodaurus had to literally fight for his outdated.
'The brewing of the vast and heavily armored dinosaur illustrates the dangers posed by the predators in the Cradle period,' said Brown.
A chemical analysis of the organic ingredients contained in the scales also revealed that the dinosaur skin was probably red-brown in colour.
Researchers continue to study the animal, searching for further knowledge of its life, including preserved stomach contents, to track down its last meal.
He believes the dinosaur fell into the river after his death and was carried into the sea, where it sank to the bottom.
The Alberta region was the same climate at the time as in today's Florida, and the rivers and oceans stretched far inland than they are today.
'This nodosaurus is truly remarkable in that it is completely covered in perfectly preserved scaly skin while being preserved in three dimensions and so we can see its original size,' said Brown.
'For these reasons, the animal looks virtually the same as it did at the time of the Cretaceous.
You don't have to use your imagination to rebuild it; just squint your eyes a little and it seems like he's just sleeping.'
In the Cretaceous period, the Earth was strolled by giant theropods, carnivorous dinosaurs who were on two legs.
Though the king of all the dinosaurs - the Tyrannosaurus rex - lived several million years after Borealopelta, this armored dinosaur might have been a favorite prey for his equally gruesome ancestors.
These include the Acrocanthosaurus, the 11.5-metre-long monster weighing over 6 tons.
Researchers whose latest findings were published in the journal Current Biology believe that Borealopelt's body was washed into the sea after it was mummified in the mud.
Shawn Funk is behind the discovery, which revealed the fossil on March 21, 2011, while drilling at the Suncor Millenium Mine near Alberta, Canada.
According to the museum, it is the best preserved armored dinosaur in the world, including leather and armor, which is also complete from the nose to the hip.
The animal was 5 metres in diameter and weighed up to 1,300 kg.
From his shoulders protruded two 50 cm spines.
Researchers believe this herbivore has been cruising the territory of today's Canada until it ended up in the river that washed it into the sea.
His underwater tomb kept the body in perfect condition.
Fossil remains of this species are also preserved to the extent that the armored plates around the skull still cover skin remnants.
As Michael Greshko wrote the rehearsal for National Geographic, 'the founding of such a surviving individual can be compared to winning the lottery.
The longer I watch him, the shocking the find seems to me.
Fossil remains of this species are also preserved to the extent that the armored plates around the skull still cover skin remnants.
At his side lies his right forepeed with fingers pointing up.
I can easily count the scales on his foot.'
How did an activist learnt the answer to the question: 'Whose Streets?'
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell shivered all over her body.
The day after she arrived in New York, a native of St. Louis sat down on the bed at the Airbnb room and went through the Facebook posts on her phone.
She came across the contribution of a high school student.
"Police just shot an 18-year-old man whose body is still lying in the street," he said.
She marveled that no one else had written to her of this post, so she closed Facebook and opened up Twitter.
User @ThePharoah kept her wall posts.
A rapper from St. Louis posted on Twitter his posts about the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old who was shot by a white-skinned police officer in the city of Ferguson, Missouri.
He posted a photograph of Brown's body lying limply in the street from which he had not been taken away after four hours.
"That's crazy," Ferrell thought.
But death was nothing new to her and her community.
She put her phone down to return to it on the evening of following tweets about people gathering on Canfield Drive.
She watched photographs of police armbands and yelling people. One of the men claimed to be the victim's father, holding a sign that said, "The Ferguson Police killed my unarmed son"!
She watched the live news - one of the officers standing in front of a group of protesters holding a leash and a barking dog at the other end.
In another video, another policeman, she put it, was holding a gun with which he pointed at the crowd, shouting, "I'm going to kill you all . . . animals."
"It's not normal," Ferrell told herself.
"This isn't the kind of murder we've gotten used to and can be called normal.
I could feel the creeps all over my body.
"I was angry and crying."
She booked a return flight immediately and travelled home the next day.
After landing at 11 p.m., she picked up her six-year-old daughter from her father and decided to go to Ferguson in the morning.
The story of what happened to the Ferrell and the city of Ferguson over the next three years describes the new documentary "Whose Streets?" to be released in theaters on August 11.
It is a story of survival and protest, love and resistance, strength and resilience told from the point of view of the people living in the community who take to the streets and demand answers.
On her way to Ferguson, Ferrell took a dialogue with her daughter - wearing a floral jersey and the same floral headband - on a topic they had discussed many times before - "about the experience with the black people."
"Do you remember how I taught you how black people had to fight for what they believed in?" he recalls of the interview.
"We're going to Ferguson right now because the police killed an 18-year-old and that's not the right thing to do."
"It didn't come to any consideration that I wouldn't take it with me," Ferrell later said.
"Today's events are the climax . . . that have occurred in the past.
She must have known and seen it with her own eyes and grow up in it.
She needed to develop not only in activism and organizing, but she also had to know the difference between the different layers of experience with blacks, and what we need to do to free ourselves.
Even though I am able to provide conditions in which she will not experience racism firsthand, she is no different from any other black child-woman.
I sense that if I had protected her from this experience, I would only have harmed her."
After arriving in Ferguson, the first stop on the South Florissant Road road across from the police department, which became the base of activists who were awaiting the words of Officer Darren Wilson about his possible involvement in the incident.
Here, Ferrell and her daughter met a local businessman who was preparing meals for the others.
Together they prepared food for the bags and helped deliver it to the Protestants.
In Ferrell's eyes, a new type of activism began to emigrate.
"My activism was turned upside down after August 9th," Ferrell said, adding that while attending college, the University of Missouri-St. Louis was president of the Minority Student Nurses Assn. association and sought to introduce health care and food in black communities.
"I had no experience with the organization.
It was only natural."
A few weeks later, during the evening demonstration, Ferrell met the documentary's later co-christ, Sabaah Folayan.
Folayan said he and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted to "document" the ongoing events.
But Ferrell thought, "Are you working on a documentary or trying to find a story to be used?"
This kind of skepticism infiltrated the community through many people, often whites, who wanted to make money from the pain and decisiveness.
As Folayan explained in an interview, she would not give: "We have heard that the voices of the people who are born and raised in Ferguson are very often neglected, and we wanted to change that."
Folayan has already established a collaboration with co-director Damon Davis, who is a respected local artist who deals with the subject of prisoners on death row.
She also participated in the project with Ferrell, and along with six other locals, who were watched by the "Whose Streets" team in the years following the assassination of Brown.
"No one speaks for us in this documentary, but it's our statement," Davis said.
"That was important to me - how these people were represented - because I would be represented in the same way.'
While the aim of the documentary was not to focus on Ferrell's experiences - in an attempt to depute that the movement is not about a savior leader, but a community-savings approach," Folayan said - it turned out that she was the most open to taking part in filming.
The documentary "Whose Streets?" describes a very personal aspect of Ferrell's life, such as how she fell in love with her wife.
"I felt naked," Ferrell said with a smile on her face at the thought of the first moment when she saw the final version of the documentary.
"But I understand that in order to do this job and humanise the blacks, I have to open up."
In addition, Ferrell's story highlights the role of the eccentric black woman in the broad side of the Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the movement's three founders - who created the social media campaign under #BlackLivesMatter in response to the killing of teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012 - call themselves the weirdoers.
"Fresh eccentric women in leadership positions are ultimately behind the movement's preservation," Ferrell said, "because we're constantly fighting on multiple fronts.
Black eccentric women must endure the weight of these events."
Folayan agrees with this statement, adding that "the movement is actually supported by black women and a large number of eccentric black women."
He insists, however, that "this is not a mere affirmative matter" and Ferrell is not the main heroine of the documentary for her opinions.
"That is what she was the driving force and the source of energy," she said.
"that she, of all alone, was not a coincidence in the front lines, because life at these intersections in the skin of a black eccentric woman is dangerous.
You can feel that energy rush in front of the screen."
Meanwhile, back in Ferguson, the TV station cameras have cleared out their positions, but the heavy racial ties between the community and the police remain.
Ferrell is serving two and a half years probation for blocking the highway in demonstrations.
The socially political atmosphere in the area, which she calls home, described as "The Hell-fill."
Yet she continues to make her effort to which she has pledged since she took to the streets of Ferguson three years ago.
"It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It is our duty to win.
We must love and support each other.
All we have to lose is our chains.'
Fields were on fire on Cologne.
Dozens of firefighters went to the scene, and a helicopter helped.
Nearby Český Brod in Cologne, between the municipalities of Bylany and Liblice, there was a field with an area of about 15 hectares from 14:00.
The fire stopped spreading at about 15:15, with firefighters issuing a third fire alarm out of four possible.
According to fire department spokesman Ladislav Holomčík, the fire was also helped to extinguish the fire from the air by a helicopter.
At 18:00 firefighters managed to extinguish the fire, the fire caused damage for CZK 700,000.
Dozens of professional and volunteer firefighters battled the flames at the scene.
The fire was caused by a technical fault in the engine compartment of the combine harvester.
The fire was also assisted by a helicopter, which carried out a total of six drops of water.
"We handed over the site of the intervention to the owner, until 8:00 tomorrow, he will be guarded by a volunteer fire brigade," Holomčík said today.
A Becoming Resemblance: Artist creates portraits using Chelsea Manning's DNA
In the centre of one of the rooms of New York's Fridman Gallery, several faces are placed in the face of different skin shades - white, black and dark - suspended from the ceiling on the wires. Each of them was the spitting image of the previous one.
All 30 portraits were made by artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from the oral excursions and hair sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent her samples from Fort Leavenworth Prison, where the former analyst is serving a 35-year sentence for illegally releasing secret cabalgrams to WikiLeaks.
The new exhibition, launched on August 2, is entitled A Becoming Resemblance.
It is the result of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, which combines its experience with technology, computer science, and Manning - a transgender woman and a pioneering dissident whose sentence was reduced by Obama three days before his departure from the US president.
An algorithmic analysis of Manning's DNA and using 30 portraits to illustrate what a man with this genotype would look like, was created by Dewey-Hagborg, a razor-shaped, if not intellectual, commentary on the pliopacity of DNA - as well as the many ways in which DNA can be interpreted - and the inherent determinism of these interpretations, as well as identities.
Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward Manning, had spoken from her youth about considering herself a woman. She was convicted in 2013 on the basis of 20 indictments, including violating six espionage laws, computer fraud and theft.
All her photographs were detained by prison staff. Only one in-white, lower-quality black-and-white photograph of Manning, visibly concerned, sits in the driver's seat in the platinum blonde wig that she is now associated with in the driver's seat.
In 2015, the positive reactions to the 2012 Dewey-Hagborg project were still in for the resurfusions of Stranger Visions.
As part of this project, Dewey-Hagborg used various forensic items - such as cigarette butts and chewing gum - to create an image of the possible forms of these people.
And it was at this time that she received an e-mail from Paper Magazine.
"They were in for an interview with Chelsea Manning in prison and they wanted to complete the article with a portrait," Dewey-Hagborg explained on the occasion of the opening of the new exhibition.
However, no visits nor photography were allowed, so they contacted Chelsea to ask if they would be interested in the DNA portrait.
The artist and her imprisoned muse made friends within two years through correspondence.
They even created a comic book called Suppressed Images, illustrated by Shoili Kanung, which presented a vision of what would happen if Chelsea were pardoned and could attend the exhibition in person.
Indeed, a few days after the release of the comic, President Obama asked for Manning's release, a welcome change after several intolerable years in the Kansas military prison.
Indeed, it is interesting that the exhibition takes place at a time when Donald Trump is waging war with people who are seeking to publish government information and transgender soldiers while trying to find new ways to stimulate resentment with his tweets in the areas he should support.
In response to a question about this particular timing, Dewey-Hagborg said that "everything is happening for a reason."
Under the statement of the artist on one of the walls of the gallery, Manning calls with her huge signature (the letter "i" in the surname is heart-written) after the end of the "samoocial factionalism, which is based on gender, race, sexuality and culture."
On the opposite side are the sequences of her mitochondrial DNA - the centipede of the letters C, G and A recorded by the pencil.
By classing 200 letters (or nucleotides, according to the artist's sophisticated scientific vocabulary), Dewey-Hagborg wanted to illustrate how surprisingly similar, at least in terms of biological, we are all to ourselves.
"I hope people will take it away from this, that our genome doesn't matter who we are, and that the genetic data is subjective and everyone can interpret it their own way," Dewey-Hagborg said. She is also seen in her 2007 work Spurious Memories on the subject of the video.
"DNA tells many different stories, this is 30 of them."
The last example of the exhibition, located in a separate room, is the only page from the aforementioned graphic novel.
It depicts Manning emerging in the manner of King Kong from the United States Disiplinary Barracks with a megaphone in her hand.
"As soon as they stop you from speaking, they will win," it reads.
"Never be forgotten to silence yourself."
"It's a direct transcript from one of the letters," the Philadelphia artist said.
"I think about it, I get goose bumps."
Manning has not yet personally visited the exhibition - which was foretold in a comic - but when she does, she will be greeted in the middle of the room with her masks, her own genomic effigies, lined up as a crowd of Protestants.
Which was also the purpose of the exhibition, including a nearly 160 cm tall statue of Maning, on which her genetic haplogroups are recorded in pencil.
"They were placed on the walls in the past, but this time I wanted the feeling of the crowd to be made to glow," Dewey-Hagborg said of the portraits.
"I wanted to give the impression of a mass movement that takes on the form of Chelsea and liberates it."
University of West West and University of Oxford University sought for murder
These days, a nationwide manhunt is underway for a professor at Northwestern University and staff at the University of Oxford who are being prosecuted for the suspected murder of a man who was found stabbed to death in a luxury Chicago apartment, police said.
On Monday, a warrant was issued for the murder of the first degree for a man named Wyndham Lathe (42) and Andrew Warren (56) for their alleged complicity in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, reports the Cook County forensic file.
The document says that Cornell-Duranleau (26) died from several stab wounds.
Chicago police said the body of the deceased was found on November 27. July.
Officers were warned about this by phone. Upon arrival at the Grand Plaza Apartments, the victim was found in one of the apartments with several lacerations.
Cornell-Duranleau was pronounced dead at the scene and detectives are investigating the case as a homicide. Meanwhile, police are searching for the two suspects, authorities said.
Lathem has worked as an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at the University of Northwest since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, the vice president of the University of Public Relations, said in his e-mail statement that Lathem is now on administrative leave and has been banned from entering the university's school premises.
"The full matter is now being investigated by the relevant authorities and the Northwest University is cooperating fully with them," Cubbage said.
Warren is an executive financial administrator at the University of Oxford.
University and Somerville College spokesman said in a statement sent by email: "We have been contacted by the British police and we are ready to assist the US police as well."
The statement also states that Warren's colleagues were shocked by the fact and wish he had come forward to the police.
Anthony Guglielmi, the public relations manager of the Chicago Police Department said he urged the suspects to surrender to the relevant authorities.
"The police have information about their whereabouts, and the effort to track down the suspects is escalating," Guglielmi said.
Guglielmi added that local, regional and national authorities are assisting the police in the search for the suspects.
According to Guglielmi, police received a call from the Grand Plaza manager, who was alerted to the events that were to take place in apartment No. 1008.
Police described the whole scene as very violent.
Guglielmi said it was unclear if the incident occurred on the 27th. July.
He added that Lathem and Warren had been caught up in security cameras.
"We believe Professor Latham knew his victim," said Guglielmi.
The Grand Plaza management issued a statement to all residents: "The police are now working to compile a time-trial and profile of the victim and investigate various themes, including domestic violence."
"We will complete the WADA plan soon" - Deputy Prime Minister of Russia Mutko
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said it would not be long before the rest of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) criteria and the re-conciliation of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) would be implemented.
"At the moment, part of the criteria for the new plan has already been completed and RUSADA has already acquired the right to be timed and tested in cooperation with the British Anti-Doping Agency (UKAD).
With this fact, the WADA Plan has been updated," Mutko said on Thursday.
The Vice-President commented on the second part of the WADA Plan to comply with the Code - which describes the criteria for the renewal of RUSADA - which was recently published on the organisation's website.
According to Mutko, the code contains nothing that Russia should be concerned about.
"Everything has been announced and everything will be implemented as well.
The results will be available to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future," he added.
However, one of the criteria mentioned calls for a public announcement of the results of the WADA investigation under investigation by Richard McLaren to allegedly sponsor Russian athletes' doping by the government.
On this topic, Mutko said: 'We are conducting an investigation, as our anti-doping system has clearly failed.
All measures were taken.
However, there were no state programmes in our country and we cannot therefore confess to something that never existed."
Mutko's words were confirmed by Vitaly Smirnov, director of the Russian Independent Public Anti-Doping Commission.
In an interview with Russia's RSport, Smirnov admitted the problems of Russian anti-doping officials, but added: "On many occasions, we said that the report contains controversial attitudes and regulations.
No one plans to accept the report completely without reservation," Smirnov concluded.
WADA suspected RUSADU of leaking doping controls in Russia in November 2015 immediately before the doping scandal.
Nevertheless, the organization allowed the planning and unification of testing under the supervision of international experts and the British Anti-Doping Agency (UKAD) in June this year.
Following a visit to the organization's Moscow headquarters in July, WADA CEO Olivier Niggli said that RUSADA was "on the right track" to restore validity.
The police have charged three people, one is a juvenile.
Police have charged three men with the establishment of Wednesday's fire at a rare wooden church in Třinec-Gutech, Frýdecko-Místeck.
One of the accused is a juvenile, all three are of Czech nationality.
The offence of general endangerment is punishable by up to 15 years in prison.
The journalists were told today by the Moravian-Silesian Police Director Tomáš Kužel.
It was a deliberate crime, he said.
"This is a very recent matter and the police are currently working on the motive of the matter," Cone said.
He said the police would discuss the possible take of the accused into custody.
Further information, according to the director, cannot be disclosed.
"I can't say any more yet, because the criminal police and investigation staff and the prosecutor who is overseeing the matter are actually working on the matter," Kužel said.
The wooden church of the Body of God in Guts dates from the 16th century.
It was a valuable monument with many original furnishings and paintings from the first half of the 16th century.
The material damage will run into tens of millions of crowns, according to preliminary estimates, but the historical loss is incalculable.
Soon after the fire, the church was considered for the restoration.
The insurance should cover most of the costs, the Ministry of Culture and the city are ready to share the additional costs, a public fundraiser is also being prepared and a contribution by the owner of the monument, i.e. the local parishes, is expected.
A similar wooden wooden church of St. Catherine from the 16th century in Ostrava-Hrabová was also destroyed by a fire 15 years ago.
It was caused by an electrical installation fault at the time.
In its place, an exact copy was made.
The state counts on the citizens in defending the state.
They will support their training.
With financial support for the associations usable in defending the state, voluntary shooting training, or with a team of training trainers, the substantive intention of the Act on the Preparedness of Citizens to Defence of the State counts.
The Ministry of Defence, which has been tasked with its elaboration by the government, promises to increase the physical fitness of Czechs as well as their abilities, which the state could then use in crisis situations.
This follows on from a proposal prepared by the Ministry.
If the law were adopted in the future, the state would spend hundreds of millions of crowns to support the conscription.
The basic aim of the proposal, according to its authors, is to create an effective system to help increase the readiness of the Czech Republic's residents to defend the state, outside of the executive conscription and on the basis of volunteering.
For example, the state would support amateurs, amateur associations, shooters or cynologists with a financial or material, and would make it possible to increase the capabilities of their members.
In return, he would get data on people who are willing to come to the country's aid in times of crisis if needed, and their skills or material equipment.
There could also be accredited instructors to assist the associations and other candidates in training or training.
It is also expected to organize sit-downs with war veterans or people who have acted heroically.
One possible option assumes that a new office would be created to be in charge of the administration and the coordination of the project.
The authors of the proposal stress that people's participation should be voluntary and the state would only use their capabilities after the state of emergency is declared.
"The whole concept must respect the gradual blurring of previously obvious boundaries between different types of threats," the project reads, referring to the dangers of so-called hybrid threats.
Ministry officials noted that it was therefore necessary to focus on supporting the widest possible set of capabilities, not just the military ones.
"The basic aim of the intention is to create a very broad base that will allow every citizen to respond in a qualified way to situations threatening the sovereignty of the state or the lives, health and property of persons, to protect themselves, or to contribute to the protection of others, and by wrongly behave not to make it difficult for the tasks of the armed forces of the Czech Republic," the intention states.
Adoption of the law would bring substantial financial claims.
According to the ministry, their amount will depend on the option chosen.
For example, the Office foresees financial support for projects to prepare citizens for the defence of the state up to CZK 100 million.
If an administrative and coordination centre were set up, its operation could cost around CZK 60 million per year.
More money would go to pay or to build an information system.
The proposal also foresees that the remit of the regional military headquarters would have to be expanded, employing an additional 42 soldiers.
Ministry officials have previously said that the law should also help resolve the opposition of some Czech politicians to implement the European Union directive on the possession of weapons.
Its adoption would allow the shooters who will be part of the system to retain some of the weapons that the directive forbids.
Startups to help your company not become the next Uber
Amy Errette wanted to measure the satisfaction of her e-commerce startup's employees, but she couldn't find the appropriate survey.
The answers were often inaccurate, unhelpful, or even deceptive.
And while promising the anonymity of the survey, some employees expressed their distrust of the process.
"I was looking for consistency and objectivity," said Errett, owner of e-commerce of the San Francisco-based e-commerce company, a San Francisco-based 75 people.
So she asked for help from the outside.
New startups in the human resources industry are constantly appearing on the market to help companies with employee satisfaction surveys.
By creating and licensing the software with the specific purpose of measuring employee obligations, startups allow companies to conduct quick voting, target specific teams and demographic groups, further offer complete employee anonymity and a hotline for complaint, and in some cases also allow informants to bypass their superiors and contact directors directly.
"There are tools on the market like Strava and Fitbit that track your health, but where is Fitbit for your company?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and CEO of the startup Glint based in Reedwood City.
Errette said that thanks to Glint, she gained more awareness in three years of what her employees thought and feel.
In addition to quick surveys and specific team voting, Glint offers a company's temperature map and a cursory overview of the groups with the highest number of complaints, as well as an overview of low-level managers - allowing the user to work on the correction.
Companies are beginning to realize that it is necessary to take care of the culture of the working environment - in case they become the next Uber - which is in the throes of scandals after a former employee posted a post on his blog describing the company's environment and harassment of employees who dare to speak openly.
For startups like Glint, the demand for corporate culture surveys is a lucrative business opportunity.
According to the website Let's Talk Payments, which deals with technical and financial progress, the value of the global control, regulation and compisation sector can exceed $118.8 billion by 2020.
Startup Convercent from Denver, Colorado, which helps companies to prevent and detect inappropriate behavior, saw a small increase in interest and activity at the start of the year, just before Uber scandals.
Nearly 600 Convercent's clients include Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
He also recently adopted Uber under his wing.
Like Glint, Convercent allows companies to send customizable "lightning" surveys, collect confidential information in real time, and display temperature maps of problem areas.
It also offers an anonymous text hotline that allows employees to report inappropriate behaviour.
If the Director-General is involved in the problem, the complaints are sent directly to the board of directors.
"The Court of Public Opinion has empowered regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, Convercent's founder and CEO.
If a company is convicted of treating its employees or unethical behaviour - and does not take action if regulators do not take action - it may face costly consequences as a result of customer boycott, staff exhaustion or court proceedings, Quinlan added.
The Ruby Tuesday restaurant network, which employs over 25,000 people across 500 locations, has been using the Convercent for more than a year to raise employees' awareness of corporate principles and procedures, and to provide an easy way to contact corporate management.
Previously, if an employee wanted to report any problem, he had to trace a phone number or an e-mail to the company's management, to formally file a complaint and hope for a successful resolution.
It was often a deterrent and unpleasant experience, said James Vitrano, General Representative for Ruby Tuesday, according to whom there was no previously reliable way of monitoring staff complaints.
Now, as the company uses Convercent, a quick detachment is ensured and a solution to problems that have never previously reached the managers sitting in the offices, miles away from the actual handling of complaints - for example, discrimination, harassment or unfair treatment.
"It's coming to a holistic, overall view of the experience of the employees," said Vitrano, who runs the Ruby Tuesday group overseeing risk management.
"At the same time, we protect shareholders from litigation by employees."
Companies stopped taking on the aerium, values, and participation of employees in a lightweight in 2002 after the accounting firm, Arthur Andersen, collapsed after Enron's collapse over the abuse of the ethical rights of employees, Quinlan said.
But it was only when the social media "shone the whole thing that the social media" became aware that they could not simply hide their skeletons in the closet in the online world.
"Before people started using technology to track the ethics, they were relying on the faith," Quinlan added.
Both Glint and Convercent offer their software in the form of a service for which the company pays regular fees.
It is a business model and an opportunity that is being approved by the courageous capital investors that have supported both startups.
The Convercent raised $10 million in total as part of its February campaign from companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, eventually taking in $47 million in capital.
Glint raised $10 million from Bessemer Venture Partners in November and raised $60 million throughout the campaign.
These investments are hardly surprising given the mutual nature of companies, culture and venture capital.
The growing number of research clearly confirms that today's employees expect more from their workplace than ever before.
And in competitive markets, such as this. Silicon Valley, the main advantage is not high salaries and interesting projects.
Employees want to see that they are being accepted and appreciated and that they devote their time to a company that seeks a positive mission.
"If people are happy in their work, they perceive that their voice is heard, and that their work is rewarding, they are striving for the success of society," said Nina McQueen, vice president of global benefits and employee benefits at LinkedIn, which uses both Convercent and Glint.
Investors make money if companies thrive and companies thrive if their employees are happy.
And when an analytical tool emerges on the market to ensure the engagement and commitment of employees to the company, it is no wonder that there will be plenty of investors to support this effort.
According to work culture experts, it is important to have data on employee satisfaction.
But the data itself is pointless if the company does not take the necessary steps.
The fact is that once a company requests feedback from its employees, there may be major changes.
And unless the change comes quickly - at worst at all - it can cause disappointment and disinterest from the staff.
"Once you ask for 4,000 opinions, you have to be prepared for 4,000 conversations," said Russell Raath, director of consulting at Kotter International, which has witnessed many companies that relied too heavily on the data itself.
"Because once you don't get things done, the staff start asking themselves, 'Did they even hear me?
Are they interested in me?
And if not, then why should I care?""
Madison Reed, which now regularly conducts a survey of employees every month, is able to solve the problem by one day thanks to Glint, Errettová said.
After gathering feedback from employees who were frustrated by slow decision-making and the quality of communication, Erret was able to re-organize several teams within the company and start training for communication to a successful solution to the problem.
Ruby Tuesday is gaining a very important view of its employees and hopes to achieve high employment in the industry, which is known for frequent layoffs in the long term.
"If you are not seeking to create a transparent working environment, the staff will not believe you," Vitrano added.
"And as soon as you start losing employees, you lose customers.
And with the outflow of customers, the whole company goes bust."
Thursday became the hottest day.
Thursday, with 38.3 degrees recorded in Strážnice na Hodonínsko, is the hottest day of the year so far in the Czech Republic.
It surpassed Tuesday, which was originally the warmest day of the year with 37.3 degrees.
This was reported by the staff of the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute.
Compared to Tuesday on Thursday, however, there were not many temperature records.
The heat hit Moravia in the first place, with mostly cloudy in Bohemia.
On Tuesday, records were broken or set to a level at 35 of the 145 weather stations measuring over 30 years.
On Thursday, only nine long-term long-term stations recorded a record.
For example, in Strážnice today's temperature was the same as the previous record from 2013.
In Lednice, Břeclav today's 37.4 degrees, it surpassed the original maximum by four-tenths of a degree, and in Pohořelice in Brno the current 37.1 degrees, it exceeded the record by three-tenths.
Both records, as with Strážnice, came from 2013.
High temperatures appeared today mainly in the south and east of Moravia.
After Strážnice was the hottest in Dyjákovice in Znojmo and Brod nad Dyjí on Břeclavsk, where the mercury climbed to 37.8 degrees, but did not break the record.
By contrast, for example, in western and northwestern Bohemia, today's highest temperatures so far were only around 22 degrees Celsius today.
"Temperatures didn't start growing there until later in the afternoon," the meteorologists said.
The current heat in the Czech Republic will gradually subside according to the ČHMÚ and more significant rains could also come on Sunday.
In most places of Moravia, however, the high temperatures will remain on Friday and in southeast Moravia on Saturday.
We've had such a mischief here.
Billionaires are not satisfied with the same vote in the election as every single person of the adult in the country.
They want to make direct decisions, and because not everyone is as brazen as Andrej Babiš, who wants to own the state, they buy political parties.
Penta owner Marek Dospiva, along with other fellow under-loateners Martin Burda and Antonín Frych, is sponsoring Robejšk's Realists.
The second life of the Civic Democratic Alliance is funded by the owner of the insurance company and real estate entrepreneur, Pavel Sehnal, who is also chairman of his party.
Convicted corruptor and Czech gambling king Ivo Valenta acquired the Private Members' Party.
The political movement Agrofert, as the Andrej Babiš project inadvertently named by Kroměříž Mayor Jaroslav Němec, is a chapter in itself.
His billionaire was also recently caught by the Mayors.
It is Dalibor Dědek, owner of the company for the safety device Jablotron.
In his own words, he enters politics to do good.
Entrée in the mayor's jersey, however, didn't go very well for the Grandpa.
"I've never dreamed of small goals," he said at a press conference.
This means that my goal is for the Yes movement to get the Mayors' Movement to get 20 percent in the election.
Some people smiled a little.
The Oldtimer's slip, however, is rather significant.
Billionaire Dalibor Dědek is a man of firm views.
While he intends to compete for the votes in the Mayors' jersey, he continues to support Andrej Babiš.
The old man supported Babiš in the last parliamentary elections.
"Babiš is not a seasoned orator and does not rule the pleasing rhetoric of political snakes," he wrote of him before the 2013 election.
But he certainly does not go into politics because he would like to personally improve.
For me, Babiš will remain a hero.
He's willing to step out of his world, which is in control, and do something for all of us.
Shortly after the Mayors presented him as a new addition, he confessed his admiration for Babiš again.
And he said he wanted the Mayors to learn to present a possible collaboration with Babiš.
Some may appreciate that the Old Man does not change his views and stands by his or her own, no matter what jersey he is wearing.
Others may speculate whether Babiš is sending someone to the Mayors to build his B-creative.
Others may ask whether the head of Jablotron, for example, has disjointed with the head of Agrofert in a shop and is not looking for another way to resist his business rival.
The first of Dědek's public appearances, however, was not only revolving around Babiš.
The grandfather promised to send ten million crowns to the Mayor for the campaign.
And if they need more money, they say, he'll send more.
A few years ago, it would have been hard for anyone to question such a statement.
Indeed, the judicially recognized crook Zdeněk Bakala threw millions at all parties before the 2010 election.
The political division of the security agency Víta Bárta, TOP 09 and the Civic Democrats together came to nearly thirty million.
But today is a different time.
The law prohibits anyone from giving a political party more than three million.
When the Old Man is entering politics, he could at least have studied the rules of the game.
Perhaps he would not have to question why politics has such a bad reputation with us.
The Old Man crowned his first days in politics with a proposal for a tax credit for families with studied children.
People with a college education come to about fifty thousand a month.
Those with the base at less than twenty.
A man with 50 grand is rich by his standards.
The one with the 20 poor.
In the Old Persian's vision of society, the poor pay their taxes honestly, and the rich enjoy the benefits of the functioning of the welfare state, which they are not very involved in running.
The rich, in short, need to be helped to avoid squandering the misery with the need.
Mayors can congratulate each other on their new acquisition, and Babiš rub his hands.
The rest of us, thanks to the Grandpa, can confirm that billionaires are not good people.
The question then remains as to who to vote for.
For me, those who know the rules of the game and want to follow them.
Those who do not have their party members or citizens and citizens of the state for their employees and the country for their property.
Finally, those who want to have a good life in a rich country for all people, not just some.
Trump's paradise was not wanted.
The villa complex had to be reduced by 234 million.
Sometimes selling a property is not easy.
And he's often not helped by 11 bedrooms, a gorgeous sea view, or the fact that the property is being sold by US President Donald Trump.
When selling the Le Chateau des Palmiers's villa complex, the price went down a whopping £8 million.
This was reported by the website Mirror.co.uk.
The brochure says of the property: "Happy, Donald J. Trump."
Escape to the site like no other.
But even the real estate company's association with the US president did not defend the extreme price tag.
Donald Trump had to cut the price of his Caribbean mansion by an astonishing £8 million.
The original price of the property was £21.5 million, the final price dropped to £13 million.
Even after the discount, the villa complex therefore costs about 76 average flats in the centre of Prague.
And it's no wonder.
The breathtaking 5 acres of its caribtha island, Saint Martin, features 12 full-length bathrooms, 11 bedrooms, many canteens, gym and other rooms.
It consists of several buildings.
The property also includes a swimming pool and a tennis court.
Dozens of palm trees are planted on the property.
The terrace offers a wonderful view of the sea.
According to real estate experts, the price was reflected in the fact that the association with the president was not sufficient to attract potential buyers.
Now the property is closer to the normal property prices on the island.
Trump bought the property in 2013.
Speculation says he paid around £15 million.
The property was to be purchased for the purposes of the lease.
Le Chateau des Palmiers was the most expensive property on the island of Saint Martin.
With the new award, however, it ranks second.
The property in the neighbourhood was valued at £13.5m.
The NCAA decided to end two training sessions a day. For the Bruins, long days
The 11th morning is approaching, and UCLA's UCLA's American football players are crowding the sidelines of the new school playground.
Some of them take off their jerseys and reveal their sweaty backs, an unmistakable emblem of the first day of training camp.
For most of the team members of this few minutes of doing nothing, the leisure is supplanting the lunch break.
Players enrolled in the summer semester will retire to the rooms after a three-hour training session to study for the final exams before returning to the Wasserman Football Center for the meeting that takes place on the upcoming morning at 6:30.
"The next three days will be a big one for these guys," said Bruins coach Jim Mora, just before Monday swung off on Tuesday.
By eliminating two practice sessions in one day, the NCAA wants to lighten the players - paradoxically, the training days are even longer - at least until Friday, when the final exams are over.
That's why the first three UCLA trainings are scheduled for 7:15 p.m. to be squeezed into the already crowded diaries of many students.
For the first time in the six seasons Mora spent Coach in Westwood, the Bruins' training camp starts a week earlier than last year, and practice sessions are limited for the summer semester. The decision to limit the number of training sessions from two to one a day also has an impact on this.
A total of eighteen practice sessions are scheduled for August 20, with formal preparations for the first game against the Texas A&M team to be held in September.
Mora has been quoted as saying that he supported the NCAA's decision, even though it added another item to the players' already charged diary.
"Three or four days, the players are under a lot of stress and it's very exhausting for them," Mora said.
"But no one has given up, everyone is trying. They're great.
I think Saturday, when we have more time, things will calm down."
The UCLA will be closed after the training camp is over, which will not be easy to see the clear lines of the surrounding land from the adjacent car park and the luxurious Luskin Center, which was occupied by the players after the protection net behind the goal pole.
The Bruins players should occupy the hotel starting this week, but Mora acknowledges that when the rooms are emptied during the season, there could be a problem.
"The land will be guarded by the security service," Mora added.
"Safe is taken care of, but it's possible that someone can rent a room and record our training sessions.
Such material is well traded.
Fortunately, the hotel will be guarded by security, as will parking lot. 8.
We will use our resources to the maximum.
I believe everything will turn out well.
It's all planned."
Facebook plans to check more thorough facts to limit the number of fake news
Facebook will send more potentially fake articles to inspect third parties and view findings under the original posts in an effort to combat the so-called "fake news," the largest social network said on Thursday.
The company writes in a statement on its website that it will start using up-to-date machine learning to detect possible hoaxes, which it will send to third parties for authentication and potentially display the survey results below the original posts.
Facebook has been described as one of the main sources of fake news, and many believe that these unconfirmed reports influenced last year's election for the president of the United States.
There is a political debate about the matter in Europe. French voters are inundated with an avalanche of false news about the presidential election in May, and Germany plans to impose a fine on the social media network in advance of the September elections if it does not swiftly remove angry contributions.
Facebook said in a further statement issued in Germany on Thursday that it was planning to launch testing a new feature of the fake news check feature in the US, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
"In addition to displaying messages authenticated by third-party, people are asking for more content to be better informed and to make the right choice to decide what to share," Sara Su, Facebook's product news executive, said on her blog.
It added that Facebook was continuing to test the "related articles" feature and is also working on other changes to reduce the number of fake news.
Graphic Novel: a Story of A Castle in England
The small castle of Scotney Castle recently starred in the music music video of Squeeze, and Margaret Thatcher also found her refuge during the 1970s and 1980s.
But Scotney witnessed 700 years of stormy history from his cozy spot by the Bewl River in Kent, Britain, in Kent, Britain, that inspired the curly-haired Jamie Rhodes of York County - known for his fondness for historical documents - to create a graphic novel.
"The view of the writing of a man who is 300 years after death fascinates me," says Rhodes, with a straight face.
"When I hold the letter in my hands, I feel a personal connection."
The graphic novel A Castle in England documents the lives of families who lived at Scotney Castle from the Middle Ages to the Eduardo period. Each story is illustrated by a different British artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
But it is not Rhodes's first book inspired by the archives: he is also the author of the Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories (2014), a collection inspired by the British Library - a project that was very emotional for him.
"I was intrigued by a thumbprint on a letter written by a double agent in the '70s who worked for the Jacobites,' he said.
"That's his thumbprint!
And the letters always smell like smoke, because in those times you had to light a candle to read.
If I sniff the letter now, 300 years later, it's like I'm back in time.
How I love the archives!"
For someone who is so fascinated by the old papers, support from the National Trust and Arts Council England and the possibility of staying almost four months in the castle is almost like a dream. ["To tell you the truth, I've extended my stay a little.")
Rhodes spent his time exploring the Victorian "new" castle, browsing archives and studying many treasures and curiosities, such as the head of the hyena on the wall and bottles that had been dumped for centuries in the ditch.
He walked around the property and explored the ruins of the old castle, talking to gamekeepers, gardeners, and occasionally with the artists who worked on the illustrations for his book.
At night, he "drinked whiskey and wrote."
Scotney's intimate history is relatively largely unknown, as the National Trust did not acquire access to the documents until 2006 after the death of the last heir, Elizabeth Hussey.
When Rhodes arrived at the post ten years later, the staff was only beginning to infiltrate the archives Rhodes described in words as when "the Arabists of many centuries throw up their hands with their hands, saying, 'Take it to the attic'."
The diaries, letters from the time of the British Empire, the maps depicting the fortunes: "You may think the land dispute is boring," Rhodes said, "but I've come across a case where two families tussled over a birch.
Stop it, people!"
Some of the stories in the book use the castle as a stepping stone and plunging deeper into English history, including a story called The Labourer, which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the English uprising of 1381.
"I found a record of the 1380 castle rebellion, which was called the Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex in the book," Rhodes said.
"The English uprising actually started in this area, and I thought rebellion was a good starting point.
Maybe they're connected after all."
Other stories are firmly linked to the history of the castle - for example, The Priest, which tells the story of a Jesuit priesth hidden by Darrell's family for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or The Smuggler, about an 18th-century smuggler named Arthur Darrell, who supposedly staged his own funeral when he filled the coffin with stones (which was not discovered until a few years later after the coffin was uncovered).
Rhodes' favourite family is Darrell's: "I was intrigued by the male generation - the men of the time were always in debt and spent money on things they could not afford.
Different generations of the Darrell family dealt with this by marrying the rich or old mistresses - I imagine they were handsome gentlemen who liked to be headgoned to the heirs.'
With the end of his stay at the castle, Rhodes is searching for more adventures.
He recently returned from a two-week gig in the Finnish wilderness, where he was sucking in for his next book on the Elämänmäki, a former sanatorium from the early 20th century that was consumed by nature.
But it is a special place for Scotney.
"I was sad when I left," he said.
"I was like, 'Now to get the hell back to real life.'"
Washington changes green card award conditions
The media published President Donald Trump's words about a new US immigration plan that will also make the green card change.
The number of legal immigrants is thus expected to fall by 50,000 year-on-year as a result of stricter rules on the granting of temporary work visas and family visas restrictions.
The new rules are proposed by Republicans and the president.
The bill will soon be submitted to Congress.
"This law will reduce poverty, raise wages, and save billions of dollars for taxpayers. We will achieve this by changing the rules for issuing green cards to the residents of other countries.
The law will limit the number of immigrants and replace the current scheme.
The new application process will be prioritized by English-speaking applicants who are funded and will demonstrate capabilities that will benefit our country," Trump, quoted by the media.
Sexual robots are on the rise - we should be on the lookout
Just when it looked like 2017 couldn't be more bizarre, a report about the technological development of sexual robots will appear online.
Yes.
Sex robots are really popular at the moment.
The Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) recently issued a statement on the development of sexual robots in the next five to 10 years.
In the words of a former professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at Sheffield University and the co-founder of the FüR, Noel Sharkey, the rise of sexual robots must be seen seriously.
Customers can choose the color of the eyes, the shape of the nipples and the appearance of the robot's nails.
"People are making fun of them, but sales are growing and we must be prepared to see them more and more often," Sharkey said on the occasion of the release of the report.
Modern sex aids are transformed from inflatable Mr to robotic women with silicone skin, which is pleasantly warm to the touch - of course, the artificial intelligence that mimics a person's behavior.
The user can "adjust" the robot in their own image - from the color of the eyes and nipple shape to the appearance and colour of the nails.
What is very disturbing, however, is the fact that many robots have their own "personality" that would also shame the Stepford missus.
Modern inflatable virgins have evolved into robotic women with silicone skin.
The owner of the RealBotix robot can set up different character traits to his surrogate woman, among them shyness.
And then there is True Companion's sexual robotic wife Roxxxy Gold, which is supplied with pre-programmed personalities, including "frigid Farrah," which is characterized by the shy nature and "wild Wendy" with a "adventative" nature.
"The passenger of Roxxxxy Gold is set up to suit your personality to the maximum extent possible," reads the True Companion website.
So she likes what you like and vice versa.
It's even moody, just like the people.
She may be tired, talkative or "in the mood."
The rise of sexual robots is alarming for several reasons - not one of which is not a substitution for actual interpersonal relationships. Wrong are rather inferior female character traits and forcible innuendo - e.g. frigid (read defiant) Farrah.
True Companion likens the Roxxxxy to a vibrator for men on its website.
"If a woman can have a vibrator, why can't a man have a Roxxxxy?" the page reads.
But sex robots are not just a fetish or a sex aid.
Their emergence and almost perfect sophistication point to something darker and deeply rooted in our culture - a push back from ideal or sexual equality towards a desire for captivating sex with an optional surcharge.
Most men, of course, do not buy a robotic woman, and while the FRR talks about their growing popularity, sex robots still remain on the fringes of interest from the general public.
However, this marginal interest may become a mirror set by the current modern age.
And most people are not weird or violent until they have a free market excuse to do so.
It is no coincidence that these sophisticated sex robots appear at a time when women all over the world are making their rights and the White House is sitting in a president who is often very derogatory to the woman's address.
The most horrific aspect of The Story of the Handmaid is not what we see - the bodies hanged and the hollowed-out eyes, rather the realities of these visions.
The book's masterpiece's The Handmaid's Tale is a step in the right direction, but at the moment it seems to be a small step.
Sex robots should be as similar as possible to actual women (although with the standards of a porn actress).
Their creators construct them to be pleasant to the touch and act at first glance as a real woman.
But when it comes to their "personality," the robot cannot replace the real woman.
They can't break up with their partner or just leave.
They have no job or history. Nothing that would inspire their independence or undermine their devotion to its master.
In other words, they're pleasant slaves.
Speaking of the 21st century: maids.
NBA star on the green arm.
Curry is fighting for a cut in California.
Star basketball player Stephen Curry, despite a botched first-timer, was not lost in his first start of professional golfers.
The two-time NBA Most Valuable Player Award winner played the lower Web.com Tour in the tournament at the Melens Bargain Tour's tournament, the Web.com Tour, in the California-Arooper, for the 74 round, and will be vying for the cut.
The Golden State quarterback, who won his second NBA NBA title with the Warriors this season, started very nervously, and his first tee shot ended up in a beverage bracket parked at the fairway.
Even then, he was not as accurate between the holes as he was under the basketball basket, yet he left a dozen professionals behind in his line with a four-shot record over par.
"It wasn't the ideal way to start, to have to call the referee right after the first tee, but then it fits a bit," Curry said, noting that he was struck by a huge stage fright.
It was very nervous to hit the first shot in the tournament, but it was all I had hoped for.
"If you'd told me I'd play 74 in the first round, I'd take it immediately," he added.
If Curry manages to fight his way through the cut, which is likely to be set by two shots under par, he will become the first representative of another sport to do it on the Web.com Tour.
"I want to play better next time and now that I've got rid of my stage fright, hopefully it will work," said the enthusiastic golfer, who has played in celebrity tournaments as well as mixed competitions for amateurs and professionals in the past.
In Hayward, he is starting for the first time in a tournament that falls under the PGA.
He received a sponsor's exemption to participate in the Ellie Mae Classic and retained his amateur status.
The Web.com Tour is one of the categories below the elite PGA Tour.
Trump's big victory?
Against this, Mitt Romney is the embodiment of common sense
The Trump era's unmarried feature is political divisions that divide American voters and, on a micro-alcogate, break entire families.
Over the Christmas and Thanksgiving period, the American newspapers were swarming with advice on how to deal with the relatives who voted for Trump.
We're supposed to be just waiting for them to give us their nerve.
Less attention, however, is paid to Trump's ability to cement the family.
I'm talking about it because my cousin came to New York this week - a poet and a fan of the left who lives in Chicago and who has paid for a Republican fool in our family for a long time.
She reminded me of the fact that the togetherness in the face of a common enemy could have a powerful effect.
Now, with Trump at the White House, the whole family is suddenly - including all the Republican siblings she's been blathering about politics with for years - on the same page.
It's a good thing at the family table at dinner; but I'm struck by the fact that it poses a significant risk in the broader context.
Trump is strengthening the left, but the negative effect of his presidency is the power to push us all to the right.
If we are talking about "normalization" and Trump, we refer to the terrifying possibility that his shacksmiths may one day lose their attractiveness.
But there is an even more horrific long-term scenario in which Trump "normalizes" right-wing Republicans who, contrary to his standards, will suddenly emboddle in what can be called rational.
In these today, with nostalgia in my heart, I remember Mitt Romney and his version of the crazy dealings - a dog on the roof of a car, a 14% income tax (at least we had an awareness of his tax return) - both of which look like very mild offenses compared to Trump.
After Trump's departure, it is enough for the subsequent Republican candidate to be at least normal, which will be an immense improvement.
We used my cousin's visits and took the kids to Central Park for the biggest carousel run by the New York Parks Department - you won't find a better use for your $3, unless you need caffeine.
The horses are stunning, the centre roller is covered with fiberglass - clowns and animals are filmed and stare at their own shoulders in horror - a completely grim view and tinkling music is, oddly, reminiscent of public transport.
Many clichés get tired soon: the view from the high-rise buildings, the panorama is peeked, instead of breathing on you with an atmosphere, and the reality of the city does not get your ideas.
Thirty-five years later, I still didn't get over the fact that Swiss Cottage is not really Swiss cheese - not counting the Ye Olde Swiss Cottage theme pub - but a London Underground Station.
Nevertheless, the carousel in Central Park provokes a remarkably magical experience, to the extent that two two-year-olds are having a great time, as well as two mature women.
If I could judge the carousel, he deserved the maximum of points. Fortunately, no one is asking.
This week, I had a similar experience at the store when I was asked to review my "experience" on a scale from one to five when I paid with a credit card.
It's the same in the café on the corner of my street, except I can throw a 15% tip on the ration for something I buy behind the counter.
Not only does it slow down the otherwise quick sale, but the waitress is thus forced to rub in the favor of shoppers when it is not needed.
The woman at the store was a smile apologetlaus when I reluctantly rated my five-star credit card issue.
Oscar Pistorius was taken from prison to hospital for chest pain
This is the second time Pistorius has had to be taken to the hospital.
Last year, he was treated for cuts to the wrists he had sustained himself after falling in a cell, according to the prison.
Pistorius was convicted of murder following an appeal against the original murder sentence.
He killed his girlfriend Steenkamp with several gunshot wounds through the toilet cupboard door in his home in Pretoria in the early hours of the morning hours of Valentine's Day 2013.
Pistorius claimed to have mistaken her for a thief.
Prosecutors announced their intention to re-appoint, this time against Pistorius' six-year sentence, which they say is too lenient.
The National Prosecuting Authority has said it will appeal to South Africa's Supreme Court and the trial will take place later this year.
If successful, Pistorius faces an extension of the sentence of up to 15 years.
In South Africa, the death penalty does not apply.
For the first time in history, a baby was born captive to a bred panda who had coil in the wilderness.
This is a huge success for the panda rescue program.
The centre is trying to expand the gene pool of pandas in captivity.
A worker at the center, Zhang Zhong, told the New China news agency that there was a high risk of breeding by the breeding of the pandas.
In fact, there were only 471 pandas in captivity at the end of last year.
In the wild, only two thousand survive.
The effort to have captured pandas with the wild ones mate is thus the first step towards the breeding of panda to help protect this species.
The 15-year-old Cchao was released into the nature reserve at the start of the Panda's mating period on 11 March.
Thanks to the tracking device on the neck, scientists could observe her every move.
She met her chosen one by Cao-cchao 12 days later.
The sexual intercourse with the male's panda lasted a minute and a half and landed successfully.
This, too, can be considered a minor miracle, because the male panda are not considered the most successful lovers of the animal kingdom.
Males are fairly miscalculating the time when the female is ready, plus they are often confused and have no idea what to do.
The cub was born healthy and, even as Chao-chao had an extra appetite during her pregnancy, weighed 216 grams after the birth.
The average weight of a newborn panda is 70 grams lower.
For illegal camping in Greece, two Bulgarians detained
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced the detention of two Bulgarian tourists on the territory of Greece for illegal camping, the comments were quoted as bTV.
A group of tourists, including two Bulgarians, was detained by the Sithonian police in the early hours of August 1.
All were released on the same day, but the investigation is ongoing.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs told bTV that Bulgarian tourists were later released.
The Greek authorities have tightened the rules on free camping and are imposing strict fines on anyone caught at a place where camping is not allowed.
Checks will take place all season.
The ministry said the court could impose a fine.
Spilková is in 50th place after the first round of the British Open.
Golfer Klára Spilková ranks in a share of 50th place after the first round of the British Open major.
The playground at the Kingsbarns, Scotland, bypassed with a one-stroke score under par, making three birdies and two bogeys.
The 22-year-old Czech player is thus hope to make the cut for the first time at the famous major.
Entering the $3.25 million bid competition, American star Michelle Wie, who won the first round in a 64-shot field record, eight under par, came out the best.
Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands are pulling millions of toxic eggs from the market.
The Netherlands itself has already temporarily closed 180 poultry farms due to the incident.
The Dutch Food Safety Safety Authority, according to Reuters, the Dutch authority reported that it is investigating 20 percent of all Dutch poultry farms, which it said means that 80 percent of the eggs on the market are safe.
The Authority stressed that the risk was only a limited number of egg types recognised as identified by specific figures.
According to the German authorities, the amount of the toxic substance in the eggs is small and does not pose a danger to adults, but it is a potential threat to children.
Czech JIS spokesman Petr Majer said that eggs and chicken eggs from the Netherlands and Belgium, where the authorities have also approached the closure of breeds, have not been imported to the Czech Republic in recent times.
However, veterinarians will take random samples of eggs and chicken meat originating in Belgium, the Netherlands, France, Italy, Germany and Poland, the markets of which the insecticide problem marks have appeared.
The eggs from Belgium were on the Czech market for the last time in April and eggs from the Netherlands last time in May, according to the veterinary administration.
Chicken from Belgium last appeared in the Czech Republic in June.
In the Czech Republic, however, there is a certain amount of chicken meat from the Netherlands.
Fipronil is a substance that is usually part of flea products, everything and ticks.
However, it must not be given to animals whose meat is consumed by humans.
The World Health Organization, the WHO, considers the preparation to be slightly toxic.
His high doses lead to a feeling of nausea and dizziness.
Riga is beautiful, I will miss him, says goalkeeper Sedláček and is looking for an engagement.
I'd like to catch for ten more years.
"Maybe I'll go back there one day," said 27-year-old Sedláček, who could start the season in the Zlín jersey.
It depends on whether he gets an engagement until the start of the new year.
What were the four years you spent in Latvia?
If I had to rate it like I was at school, three.
The first year I didn't catch much, I had an experienced goalkeeper in front of me.
I was studying.
The second year I started catching.
Before the third season, I thought they'd give me more space.
But they brought in a new goalkeeper, with whom I took a rotation again.
I assumed last year that I would catch all the time.
But we only got maybe five points during the opening ten games, so the coaches started shooting it.
At the end, my colleague was catching more.
But that's how it's done.
They wanted to play it for next season.
How was life in Riga?
Beautiful.
It's a small Prague.
Beautiful, European, historic city.
I'll miss him.
I found a girlfriend there.
We're together for the third year, we'll be getting married next year.
So I brought something.
How demanding is the KHL for the goalie?
The first ten teams are really good quality.
Then there are the teams like us or the Slav, who have to change their playing style against them.
Skilting is on the other side, so you have to replace it with something.
That means playing backwards, fighting more.
I didn't see the problem in the width of the field.
The difference is that the Russians want to play to the empty.
They shoot a little, and even though they have a half-empty goal in front of them, they prefer to record.
There are more shots in the Czech Republic.
Didn't you have a problem with travelling and moving over seven time zones?
If you don't have a family, it's not a problem.
He can get some sleep in peace.
The program is usually made to play, say, four matches out there and then you have two days off.
How do the Latvians feel about their club in the KHL?
As a national team.
All of Latvia watches hockey, along with basketball it is a national sport.
They're all cheering.
Even when things weren't going well, a lot of people came.
Did Dinamo's KHL's tenure help to Latvia almost advance to the quarterfinals at this year's World Cup?
The KHL has been playing since 2008 and Dinamo has been there since the beginning.
And from the same time, their World Cup results began to go up.
At the 2014 Sochi Olympics, they fell to Canada in the quarterfinals of just 1:2.
That was an unreal result for them.
Thanks to the KHL, they got to a higher level.
More and more Latvian players are heading to the Czech Extraliga.
Roberts Bukarts came through in Zlín and is Ralfs Freibergs before signing the contract.
Why does it make them come here?
They're not B's players, they're really good quality.
The teams here are looking for cheaper and younger players from abroad, the Latvians are one of them.
It's a natural direction.
The KHL starts in three weeks.
Why are you still without an engagement?
I knew at the beginning of February that I would not continue in Riga.
That's how we started looking for something.
On the table was Sparta.
But because they didn't have a goalkeeper's budget, we didn't make a deal.
Then it was a classic.
We talked to different teams, but they decided on someone else in the final.
So I'm training at home in Zlín and I'll wait for something to come up.
Aren't you nervous about it?
That was when I left here four years ago and didn't know what was going to happen.
The current situation is not the best, on the other hand I am at home after some time.
I caught something in the KHL, so I'm taking it the other way.
The only question is when and where I'm going to sign.
How real is the option of getting the new year up in Zlín?
Anything can happen.
We'll see what happens in a month, where what emerges.
Now I can only wait to see what the agent says.
Do you prefer a competition?
The past season was not enough to be able to choose.
So I'm waiting for the phone.
The government's fling at Let continues.
In January this year, in an article with the care of a proper housekeeper? I also wrote about the camp at Lety u Orlík.
The essence of the problem remains the same, so I dare to recall the core passages of the article.
The camp at Lety has been talked about for many years.
For readers who don't know exactly what's going on, it's probably best if they look at the official site of the cultural monument Pietà Place Lety, for example.
There, in the introduction to the historical overview, they learn that the camp was standing two kilometres east of the village of Lety, that from 8. 8. 1940 served as a labour camp, from 1. 1. 1942 was a collection camp and from 2. 8. In 1942, he became a Gypsy camp.
The next text describes the course of life in the camp, including inhumane conditions, until March 1943, when the first Leafmad prisoners were assigned to the Auschwitz transport.
4. 5. 1943 the largest transport to the extermination camp was transported by 370 people.
There were 420 in total.
A very sad history of the immense hardships of human beings, which were caused by human beings and perverted ideology.
There is no dispute that it is necessary to constantly commemorate these events.
Nor is there any dispute that the commemoration should take place at the memorial in the place of the experience of these people's suffering.
The problem is elsewhere.
Under socialism, the camp was somehow forgotten a bit, and in the 1970s a pig farm was built near and on part of the former camp.
The history of the camp was accidentally discovered in 1992 by the American Paul Polansky, and a memorial was unveiled at Lety in 1995.
In the mid-1990s, the government promised to buy and demolish the pig farm, but it has not yet done so.
In 1998 the memorial was declared a cultural monument and since 2009 its administration has been under the Lidice Memorial.
In July 2013, the UN Human Rights Committee called on the Czech Republic to close the pig farm.
So much very briefly the facts of the postwar fate of the camp.
It was not until last autumn that the government approved the purchase of the pig farm and decided to draw up an expert opinion on the pricing.
According to the Minister of Agriculture, the government then buys the pig farm.
According to Culture Minister Herman, "there are some numbers, but I'd probably be wasting the intentions if I went public with them."
We'll see what the expert opinion brings.
According to some unofficial estimates, there may be hundreds of millions, while others say the price can reach a billion.
Either way, it's by no means a cheap proposition.
And yet only a few hundred metres from the former camp stands a memorial in whose modifications the state invested almost ten million crowns in 2010.
Even if the entire transaction were funded by the UN Human Rights Committee, which is unlikely to be the case, I think it would be a waste of money anyway.
Doesn't the government have other priorities?
The memorial, a dignified reverent place, stands with the will of history in the virtually immediate vicinity of the tragedy, and anyone who wants to can bow to the memory of the suffering and the murdered.
I see no reason to change this!
Leave it to the way it is, and keep the reverent place with the utmost care.
The entrusted property, i.e. the taxpayer's money, should be handled by the responsible person, in this case the government of the Czech Republic, with the care of a proper householder.
At least with the one, like in your own company!
Of course, the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Deputy Prime Minister is not the whole government.
But even so, from the point of view of the above, I see the slogan of the leader of the ANO movement only as an empty pre-election proclamation.
I went to see the site in May this year.
Very decent driveway, landscaped parking, replicas of wooden camp barracks.
In one exhibit, in the other integrated toilet with running water.
A small natural amphitheatre with seating and a view of its own reverent site, which is made of stones placed on a gentle slope.
Lots of flowers and wreaths.
All attributes appropriate to the meaning of this place, as should befamly.
Archaeological research is currently underway at the site of the original camp.
It would be prudent to consider whether it would be possible, for example. a section of the uncovered foundations to be preserved and at least visually accessible in an appropriate way.
In this direction, Culture Minister Daniel Herman could strain his efforts.
In the event that he succeeds in the government to get the purchase of a pig farm with state money, it will be just another unfortunate step in his already problematic tenure as Minister of Culture.
Red meat, dairy and chocolate may relieve symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
For your digestive system, red meat and dairy products can be a nightmare.
But a new study suggests the opposite: a diet rich in animal protein and dairy products could help relieve the symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease.
The non-healthy disease, which affects up to 1.3 million people in the US and 300,000 patients in the UK, causes abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
Patients are usually reminded not to use meat and dairy products to relieve symptoms. However, University researchers found that the essential tryptophan's essential amino acid in the protein helps to create immune cells that promote bowel resistance.
Head of study dr. Marco Colonna explained that the immune cells protect the intestines and ensure the degradation of harmful microbes from food.
The number of inflammatory cells is balanced by the number of cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissue.
Once the scales tilts to the side of the inflammation, inflammatory bowel disease can occur.
As part of the research, researchers found the presence of immune cells supporting the body's tolerance in the stomach of mice with a particular bacterium.
This bacterium requires the presence of tryptophan to form cells - one of the building blocks of the proteins.
To this, Professor Colonna said, "We have found a link between a type of bacterium - the Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the intestinal microbiome and the development of cells that promote the tolerance of the body.
The more tryptophan the mice had in their diet, the more these immune cells had."
At the same time, he suggested that if the same thing turned out to be true for humans, then a combination of L. reuterium and tryptophan-rich bacteria would help develop a more tolerant and less inflammatory bowel environment.
Postgraduate researcher dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barraganwas, in the study of a certain type of body tolerance of immune cells, discovered that one group of test mice had these cells, while the other group of the same mouse-behaving separately disguise the cells were missing.
It was derived from the fact that one group of mice has a different gut microbiome - a community of bacteria, viruses and fungi that normally dwells in the gastrointestinal tract.
The mice was tested by the DNA-mounted method and researchers found six types of bacteria in mice with immune cells that were missing from the second group of mice.
Mwes, which were bred in a sterile environment and lacked the gut microbiome - so they did not develop this type of immune cells - was administered by L. reuteri - and created immune cells.
To understand how bacteria affects the immune system, researchers grew L reuterium in the liquid and then transferred a small amount of fluid - without bacteria - to undeveloped immune cells that were stored in isolation.
The immune cells have evolved into tolerant cells.
After the active ingredient was removed from the liquid, it was revealed to be a by-product of tryptophan metabolism known as indolyl-3-octic acid.
When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the mouse diet, the amount of these cells increased by 50 percent. At the same time, after the splits of tryptophan, the number of cells dropped by half.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that humans have the same tolerant cells as mice, and most of us store L. reuteri in their gastrointestinal tract.
It is not known if the tryptophan by-products from L. reuteri bacteria cause cell development in humans in the same way as in mice, but transcripts in the tryptophan-related genes were found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan added: "Each of us should probably seek to develop these cells because they control the inflammatory intrusion of the intestines' inner surface.
Potentially high level of tryptophan in the presence of L. reuteri can increase the cell population."
Jose Mourinho considers signing a contract with Nemanj Matić and his transfer to Manchester United as a 'genius'
Manchester United have recruited a "genus" in the form of Nemanja Matić to their team - or so Jose Mourinho thinks after the midfielder made his debut in Wednesday's match against Sampdoria.
Matic, who signed a £40m contract, was released in his first match with a 2-1 win at Dublin - the last pre-season match before the UEFA Super Cup, where United will meet with Real Madrid on Tuesday - and impressed in his role as midfielder alongside Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira.
However, as he did not take part in the team's pre-season Asian tour, Matic was in form and played only 45 minutes, which Mourinho said needed to be worked on before the start of the Premier League season.
'He needs time, but he's experienced, intelligent and he's brilliant thinking - he's thinking football,' Mourinho said.
"We'll help him get fit as soon as possible."
Like Matic, his new teammates Victor Lindelöf and Romelu Lukaku also played their first game at Aviva Stadium and Mourinho is slowly starting to shape his 11th for the next season.
The independent source announced this week that Mourinho still wants to sign with three other players, but insists that the club has done a "fantastic job" and brought three of the four most important players to the team.
"I thank the club for helping me recruit three of the four players," he added.
"Four out of four would please me more, but I'll admit they did their best for me."
A life challenge to the king of chicken cutlets, Ládi Hruška.
He wants a lesson from Pohlreich!
The multifaceted picture began to take shape thanks to a new show on TV Prima's Zdenek Academy.
Pear immediately sniffed the chance.
"Dear Zdenek, I would like to sign up for your cooking academy because I think I can learn a lot from you," he said in a social media video.
And since the two of them have been tiptoeing for several years, Lad forgot to irritate him this time either.
"In return, I can teach you Znojmo from Diet Chicken Chicken, American Cucumber or invite you to the water and show you why the fried cheese is popular," Hruška said.
He is really serious about his participation in Pohlreich's new show.
It's time to move up a level and learn from the master.
"The question is, what the boss said to him," he told Lightning.
Pohlreich did not comment, however, because he was shooting new episodes of his next show, Yes, Boss!.
Only Prima responded to Hruška's participation in the culinary academy, saying he took the matter as his personal activity, which goes beyond television.
The big blow was struck by Hruška Pohlreich in December 2004 with his first cookbook.
Within a few days, it had sold over 300,000 units!
The new show, presented by Prima at a press conference for the autumn broadcasting scheme yesterday, is a genuine cooking school.
Pohlreich selects his pupils from the audience and introduces them to twelve cooking techniques in twelve episodes.
In the latest episode of his show Now, the boss cooks in November 2014, Zdeněk had his T-shirt ironed on the back of his T-shirt.
If he had my face there, I'd be laughing a lot.
"I just smile at the pear - the pear is a healthy fruit and has a lot of vitamins," Lada responded.
Lada's culinary arts, he thinks.
"Guoting, according to Ládi Hruška, is not an option even at home, because I don't go home in a gastropunk," the boss is clear.
I respect Zdeněk Pohlreich very much, even making chicken on honey according to him.
But his recipes will not appear on my show," Hruška said.
He's an asshole!
He's no cook to me, he's a TV clown.
"A gastronomical illiterate or asshole," Pohlreich said of Hruška in a lecture.
"I'm not 20 to be able to wave them off, but I don't deal with them that way anymore," Hruška said in the account of the insults.
The British inventor uses a microchip in his hand to unlock the car and the house with a wave
The British inventor became the first person in the country with a microchip injected into his body. With a simple wave of his hand, he can unlock the door to the house and the office and even start the car.
Thinge, 33, Steven Northam, has had the tiny chip implanted between his inch and forefinger, and is currently offering the same service through his company BioTeq to companies and individuals who want to make their lives easier using technology.
The implantation procedure and the follow-up of the treatments are supervised by dr. Geoff Watson, an aestatoicist at Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester.
The technology works on the same principle as microchips implanted to dogs and cats, and the entire procedure takes 30 seconds.
Northam's company also offers a microchip-compatible locks service. The price of one chateau is 300.
The married one-child father had the technology integrated into his home and his BMW Z4 car, which he starts with a simple wave of his hand.
White House's prop for taxpayers to cost the taxpayer $1,000
The White House's decision to arrive at South Lawn to mark last month's visit to South Lawn's senior production industry celebrations came to $24,000, according to Navy records published by TIME.
The green white helicopter Sikorsky VH-3D, also called Marine One in the presence of the president on board, was the pinnacle of the 17th program. July at the White House, which was a parade of American design programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and several senior White House officials surveyed a parade of products from all 50 states.
The helicopter from Connecticut was displayed next to a yacht from Maine, a fire truck from Wisconsin and a forked lift truck from the Mississippi.
The White House military officer issued the fragmentary order, or FRAGO, and requested the presence of the helicopter less than 36 hours before the helicopter landed at South Lawn as part of an "extraordinary" event, Marine Helicopter Squadadron One (HMX-1) - the unit responsible for managing the helicopter, said.
"I wanted to make sure you had a fame about such an important event," the HMX-1 commander wrote in an e-mail to his superior, the Navy's Air Force Commander's office the day before the event began.
The report suggested that the helicopter would arrive at South Lawn 17. July at approximately 7 a.m. to mark the parade, which is scheduled to start at 15:00 and will remain in place until the full vacancy, which was scheduled to be vacated between 18:00 and 21:00.
The e-mail also said that if there was a delay in departing from the White House, a replacement crew would be sent for a return flight due to the working time regulations.
The original crew remained in place that evening along with the helicopter, along with a unit of security personnel.
The records - obtained by the weekly TIME - showed if the other crew was eventually sent.
The Hatch Act prevents civil servants from using government property for political purposes.
The records indicate that the HMX-1 is investigating a possible breach of this Regulation.
"We were wondering if it was a violation of the Hatch Act and we were assured that everything was in order," the commander wrote.
"It sounds like you've been blocked," the deputy commander wrote.
This "Made in America" show was designated by the White House as an official event, and the Hatch Act would not have covered it.
But even official events have political subtexts.
In his participation in the events, the president advocated a health reform that passed through the Senate, talking about trying to rein in the government's regulations.
The use of air transport vehicles such as Marine One or Air Force One for political purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
Presidents use them when they travel.
However, their presence purely for presentation reasons is unusual.
Trump ordered control in February after the presidential plane was in the background at his first rally in the Melbourne campaign campaign in Florida. His Twitter account is overwhelmed with complaints about the use of the presidential plane to his predecessor.
"The White House is pleased with the 'Made in America' parade, which has introduced products from all 50 states made by Americans from American materials," said press secretary's deputy press secretary, Lindsay Walters.
HMX-1 helicopter crews often practice landing in the Washington area and South Lawn, rehearsing any arrivals with the President of the United States to the White House with maximum precision.
While Trump attended the G-20 summit in Germany in early July, HMX-1 conducted a 58 training landing at the White House.
The flight to the Made in America parade was part of the staff's current training session, the state official said.
The helicopter's unit on the same day flew in the "non-presidential support missions" for the next eleven hours.
The White House said that no more props were paid for by taxpayers' money.
A Sikorsky spokesman said the company was not involved in the negotiations to issue the helicopter at South Lawn.
HMX-1 does not keep records of the presidential flight budget and the exact cost of the parade is difficult to determine, according to the navy.
According to the Ministry of Defence, the hourly price for the fiscal year 2017, the reimbursement of DoD's expenditure for VH-3D is $24,380 per flight hour.
The unit's records indicate a time of 30 minutes from the Marine Corps Air Facility Quantico base in and out of Virginia.
The White House argues that the helicopter's actual operating costs are well below that amount.
"Placing taxpayer costs based on estimates for reimbursements is very misleading," Walters said.
"These estimates shall include staff, maintenance and many other hidden costs covered by the annual cost."
According to a 2015 RAND study, reimbursements for expenditure DoD do not include staff cost, but include the cost of fuel, maintenance and contract costs.
The White House press secretary at the time, Sean Spicer, advocated the use of the helicopter for the purpose of the parade.
"The Idea parade this week is to present products made in the US," Spicer said.
"I am aware that the company Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud of the fact that they contribute to our nation's defense, and that they provide work to hundreds, if not thousands, of people.
I think, like most Americans, that we are proud of the helicopter and other military installations that countless American citizens are involved in making.
This fact is to be recalled.’
It is unclear if Trump, while making his rounds at South Lawn, was also seen at the helicopter. The only thing to say is that he sat behind the wheel of one of the fire trucks.
Back at the White House, Trump approached Sikorsky and joked with the media about his own product fleet.
"I know Sikorsky very well," the President said, "I own three of them."
The young woman was stranded in a swamp at Mácha Lake, and police waded to her.
The girl set off to the beach around 2 a.m. on Sunday.
Instead of bathing, however, she remained trapped in the wetlands.
When she decided to use her cell phone to ask the police officer for help, she had the last 12 percent of the battery.
"That's why the officers soon lost contact with her," police spokesperson Ivana Baláková said.
Several police patrols had rushed to the scene, which she had approximately described, but finding the young woman was not at all easy.
"Some of the officers had to wade through reed wetlands hundreds of meters before smelling solid ground again underfoot," Baláková said.
And so, she was reported missing.
The officers were oriented to the direction her cries of the call for help.
"To avoid at least losing this connection, they agreed with her to count out loud," the spokesperson said.
Officers did not find the woman until quarter to five in the swamp in the Borný locality.
She was on the brink of physical and psychological strength and showed signs of hypothermia.
So the called ambulance took her to a Česká Lípa hospital.
The connection of the Old Man with STAN?
The in-demand bride becomes a saleable girl.
That's a bit of ironic.
With his web project, the posteameslusny.cz as if the billionaire was essentially telling voters that STAN was suffering from a deficit for decent people.
He also confirmed that a politically disparate bunch of rather lesser-known mayors and independents did not actually have a national agenda for the House election.
Her election candidate will simply become a decent man after her interview with the Old Man, whatever his political opinion.
Once, even Vít Bárta started out like this, and it didn't work out very nicely.
With his hunt for decent people and personalities, who will eventually replace some mayors on the ballot, which even Gazdík admitted, and the Grandpa is also cancelling the popular argument of the head of STAN that the biggest value of the movement is just politically tested and experienced mayors, traditionally the most popular politicians and surveys.
They will now calmly succeed in hastily collected unknown personalities.
The total breakup with the Peoples, after which STAN changed the logo and the slogan, was also explained by Gazdík by the fact that the movement does not want to lose its identity on the candidates' candidates.
But if STAN was suspected of identity by few at the time, after the arrival of the Grandfather, even a mere game of identity ends.
Not only Gazdík has long been outspoken against ANO Andrej Babiš, but at the first joint press conference, Dědek, who publicly praises Babiš, said as follows: "My goal is for the ANO movement, the Mayors to win twenty percent in the upcoming elections."
Let's hope he's not mistaken the movement.
The old man is a successful entrepreneur, and the billionaire is certainly no accident.
He often talks about politics much like Babiš, but unlike him, he does not build his own political brand.
STAN has been more like a reality show than a real political party for some time, and Grandpa's helping hand seems to be making the in-demand bride even more into a shop-to-end girl.
For a while STAN went with TOP 09, then with the Peoples and now for a change it is looking for decent people.
Let's hope someone gets in touch.
Police dogs trained in Most with helicopter flights
Dogs specialized in searching for explosives and search dogs were rehearsing helicopter flights at the Lake Most today.
The police dog must not be fearful and be afraid of flying, said the head of the police cynologists of the Ústí Region, Petr Tomášek.
The training of a police dog takes about two years.
At Most, both the adult trained dogs and those who were just undergoing training were training.
In addition to standard training, in which they were to detect live samples of explosives around the lake and look for a lost figurehead, all 12 animals had to board a helicopter and fly over the lake.
The main purpose of the exercise is to test the dogs in the helicopter.
So that immediately after the helicopter touch down, the dog can go to work so he doesn't have a problem with the helicopter's journey.
"The helicopter is delivered, the dog goes and immediately searches," said Tommy.
The dog, which is restless or is unable to start working immediately on the journey by helicopter, is removed from training.
"Most of the time, they are then kept by the dog handlers in the garden, for example," Tommy said.
Police have 76 dogs with various specializations in the Ústí nad Labem Region.
German shepherds predominate, but there are also more Belgian shepherds.
The dog handler takes care of it from the puppy.
"He is raising it himself, preparing it for the service the dog will do for us," Tommy said.
The animal undergoes repeated veterinary examinations that may reveal any medical handicaps.
If the dog is healthy and obnobtled, he takes his first exams at 20 months.
"He gets into the sharp intervention around two and a half to three years," Tommy added.
The length of service in the police depends on the state of health of the dog.
It is usually served within eight to ten years.
They then mostly live with their dog handlers.
Trailer for season 3 of Narcos: Pablo Escobar is out of the game and Cali Cartel becomes the centerpiece of the Netflix hit series
Despite the end of the second season of Narcos, when the killer of Pablo Escobar is unveiled, Netflix's series is far from over.
Confirmation from the streaming service has already been made for the third and fourth seasons - the former has already seen the first trailer and an outlay of other negative characters.
In his third season, the DEA is centered on the world's richest drug cartel: Cali Cartel.
Under the leadership of the four influential godparents, they operate "as a Fortune 500 ranking company," with the only difference being that they are stepping up violent acts and bribing multiple government officials.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is the cartel leader, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) plays the brains of surgery, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) is in charge of the merger with Mexico, and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) controls New York.
Pedro Pascal returns in the new trailer as Javier Peña, the character recruiting the American and Colombian law enforcement enforcers in the fight against drugs.
Other actors include Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishé and Arturo Castro.
Narcos' third season will make its debut on September 1.
According to the UN, Afghan democracy relies on women in politics
Elections can only be credible if all members of society, including women, take part in them, the UN representative in Afghanistan said on Wednesday.
Nicholas Haysom, the leading official of the UN Auxiliary Mission, said hundreds of women are taking part in local council elections, three women are competing for vice-presidency, and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women.
"The role of women cannot be ignored," he said in his statement on Wednesday.
Elections can only be fully representative and credible if women take part, as well as all the relevant processes involved in the elections.
Local and presidential elections in Afghanistan are held on 5 April.
The Taliban have made several threats against the electoral process, which is moving international combat activities to the second ground.
In this year's elections, for the first time ever, one democratically elected government is handing over its power peacefully to the following government.
Haysom said that the strong role of women would strengthen Afghanistan's democracy.
The Afghan Independent Electoral Commission said they made up 1.2 million women out of a total of 3.6 million registered voters.
The unique brewery is re-brewing beer.
A good beer for the re-coup brewery.
The enthusiasm and honesty of the new owners was brought back to life a few years ago by a brewery in Lobč u Mšeno.
The brewery, first mentioned in 1586, has a Renaissance core and was rebuilt into a steam-roroyal operation in the nineteenth century.
It was followed by years of heyday, when the brewery was famous for its dark beers.
Unfortunately, production was halted during World War II and the brewery was nationalized in 1984.
Since then, the buildings have served the state estate.
The work of destruction was completed by the owners of the brewery after 1989.
The abandoned area was devastated and dismantled into building materials.
In 2007, however, a new hope dawned in the form of new owners, architects Jana and Pavel Prouzov.
They began to repair the buildings with the utmost respect for the spirit of the construction and every detail.
They have been careful about and are studying archive materials, trying to preserve the original materials and building elements.
The brewery takes the same form as it did in the nineteenth century, when its golden era was launched.
Their work was awarded by the brewery's declaration as a cultural monument to the Ministry of Culture, and the building became part of the European Trails of Industrial Heritage.
In 2015, they also solemnly restored the tradition of brewing beer.
To taste a great lobeč beer in the picturesque landscape of Kokořínsko, visit the drawer in the brewery area.
In brewing beer, they use Kokořínská water springing from a protected landscape area, malt from the lobbicle fields and the žatecký hops.
In the saloon you will taste the traditional light lager, as well as dark beers and specials.
And don't miss the brewery tour, it takes place on Saturdays and Sundays at noon and at half-past one.
The largest artillery fortress of Czechoslovakia?
One of the largest strongholds of its type on a global scale?
Such a unique building was to be the Stachelberg fortress between Trutnov and Žacléř, at the top of the terrain ridge above the village of Babí.
It was originally intended to consist of up to twelve bunkers connected to the vast underground.
Here was to be headquarters, barracks, ammunition depots, materials, power plant, engine room and hospital.
However, the construction was terminated by the Munich Agreement.
In less than a year, he managed to build a single massive reinforced-concrete bunker and underground spaces were broken.
Thanks to the enthusiasts of the Stachelberg Society, who began to reconstruct the unique structure in the early 1990s, you can also come to see it.
The underground is now 75 percent accessible!
The area includes, in addition to the T-S 73 infantry cabin with an exhibition and underground and an armed object of light fortification, as well as two built-up infantry chims, trenches and an educational trail of the Opevený Trutnovsko.
Refreshments, a cosy gazebo and breathtaking views of the countryside guaranteed!
This unique and beautiful Czech building has made the list alongside such monuments as the Great Wall of China, Traian's Harbour at Rome or the Assyrian Palace in Ninive and Nimrud.
The Chotěšov monastery originally from the early thirteenth century, which today consists mainly of a massive four-winged convent building above the beautiful garden.
Unfortunately, the list he made his footing is for unique structures that are in danger of extinction.
But the enthusiasts don't want to give up, and they organize a lot of events to support the monastery.
One of them is the next year of the evening for the monastery of Chotěšov this Saturday, the fifth of August, where they will perform, among other things. Vladimír Mišík, Ivan Hlas, you will see fencing performances and look at the places of beautiful large buildings, which are usually inaccessible.
Mostly, though, you'll enjoy the atmosphere of this great place.
You want to look the Neanderthals in the face?
The Welcome Exhibition at the Neanderthals in the Anthropos Hall of the Moravian Land Museum in Brno attracts an unusual excursion to the deepest prehistoric prehistoric time to the Stone Age, the world of our predecessors.
You will find out how the Neanderthals were able to cope with all sorts of extreme climatic conditions in the perfect way, mainly with alternating ice ages and interglacials.
Despite their simple material culture, the predators of their time were extremely successful predators.
You will also learn what they looked like, what their anatomy, their technological skills and their hunting skills were, but also their aesthetic sensibilities.
That you wouldn't have said it to the Neanderthals?
Let yourself be convinced in Brno.
The fourteenth festival KELT & WORLD MUSIC takes place on Saturday the fifth at Veveří Castle.
In addition to great music, you will see the building of the Celtic village, try out the Celtic way of life, including crafts, children's and adult games, divination, magic or ritual painting on the body.
There will be no misses La Quadrilla with Irish and Scottish dances, drum jamming, a bagpipe game and an amazing fire surprise performed by Carpe Noctem.
What does Moravskoslezsko taste like?
The seventh edition of the well-known gastro-festival How to the Moravian-Silesia is held on Saturday, August 5, 2017 in the area of the Karlova Studánka mountain spa.
The chef Miroslav Kalina will cook, you will taste culinary specialities and regional foods, enjoy musical and dance performances, a rich programme for children such as creative workshops, a theatre, a bouncy castle, a smir's competitive path and, of course, a number of competitions.
Get to know the plant with one click.
Students with herbarian creation and ordinary plant lovers will be helped by the new free application Pl@ntNet.
When they're interested in what plant they've just come across on a walk, this app will advise them.
All they'll have to do is photograph the plant, and the app recognizes what kind it is.
The new app, which is available for both iOS and Android, was presented on Tuesday by representatives of the CEE's Centre for Ethical and Environmental Education in the Roostern of Bratislava as part of the Secret Life of the City project.
The project was also involved in pupils from 50 Czech and Slovak schools, who photographed and added plants from their surroundings with the app's apps with the teachers.
The newly created French app is free to download on the Secret Life of the City website.
The main goal of the French programmers was for as many people as possible to contribute to the app with their images, thereby increasing the number of plants that the application can recognize.
"Already children who can hold a tablet or mobile phone in their hand can go to the forest," said this project's coordinator, Ivana Poláčková.

GMB concerns about investment in McVitie's factory in Glasgow
The union is demanding assurances from the managers of the biscuit maker McVitie's about the long-term production commitment at the Glasgow factory.
The Scottish GMB trade union said the company was silent for the time being about any investment in the Tollcross plant.
The factory employs more than 500 employees who produce, among other products, the Hobnob and Rich Tea biscuits.
The owner of McVitie's, Pladis, said it had invested more than £5 million in the area in the previous few years.
It added that the employees and trade union representatives would be "between the first informed" in the event of changes to the operation of the factory.
In a letter to the builder, the GMB, Scottish unions expressed their concern that McVitie's would "not get its promises to fund and upgrade production lines."
GMB's main organizer Drew Duffy added: "The fact that we have not received a clear response from the site supervisor about the needs of the company and the future investment plan in Tollcross is very worrying for our members.
Generations of many families worked here, and employees come mostly from the local community and the Glasgow area, where working at the local factory is a critical pillar of decent employment in the area of high unemployment and social separations.
From a point of view of work, salaries, and utility - and despite the outlook for Brexit, rising cost of living, and falling slow production - the eastern part of Glasgow needs a desperately prosperous producer like McVitie's."
A spokesperson for Pladis said: "The Tollcross manager received a letter from GMB only yesterday and the company will issue a statement as soon as possible, as we appreciate the continuing commitment to the employees and representatives of the unions.
A regular meeting with GMB staff and representatives in Tollcross took place two months ago and many problems were openly discussed at this meeting.
We were talking to employees that, as in all companies operating in extremely competitive and insecure economic conditions, we assess our operations on a regular basis, which is true for all our operations, so that we can continue to successfully compete with others.
To this she added: "In recent years, we have invested £5 million in the Tollcross area, particularly in production lines and streamlining operations.
We greatly appreciate the heritage of Tollcross and the localities and, in the event of any changes in the operation of the factory, the employees and representatives of the unions will be informed without delay."
Did PSG warn Barcelona to move Neymar three years ago?
La Liga may regret his interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain will not allow Neymar to his side in his bid for her side after she put down £189m, the amount needed to buy Neymar out of the contract, but did this French team warn Barcelona of their record-breaking raid three years ago?
This sensational transfer has stirred up the waters of the summer transfers. The Ligue 1 Club is prepared to surpass more than twice the previous record amount for Paul Pogba's transfer to Manchester United, which paid £800m for him last year.
After confirming and completing the transfer, Neymar will become the world's most expensive player and, at the same time, the highest-paid professional athlete in the world - after tax, he will receive over £500,000 a week from the PSG team.
Barcelona is outraged in the way Neymar has emerged from his contract, despite the fact that a confidential source has confirmed that the club has always tried to accommodate Neymar in everything since his arrival from Santos in 2013.
But was the football world alerted to this fact to the PSG president three years ago?
When Manchester City expressed their interest in Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi warned all the club interested in taking over one of PSG's best players.
"I'm not worried because as soon as someone tries to get one of our players, then we will certainly reach out to one of their players," Al-Khelaifi said.
"We respect all the clubs.
But if they're trying to get one of our players, they'll face the consequences."
Barcelona seems to have crossed the imaginary line when they expressed interest in PSG midfielder Marco Verratti in the summer.
PSG made it clear that under no circumstances would they authorise the Italian representative to leave. It is therefore possible that Barcelona is now swallowing a bitter pill for their bold behaviour with the departure of Neymar.
Who will explain the sanctions?
Does political punishment have broadly understood rules?
Donald Trump has agreed to anti-Russian sanctions.
The day before, the US had imposed sanctions on Venezuelan President Maduro.
And a day earlier, Trump wrote that China was not doing anything about the North Korean threat and that this would not go on.
It, too, is the idea of sanctions like straw from shoes.
Those things can't be lumped together.
Maduro's Venezuela really set off on the road to dictatorship, even totalitarianism.
China is not just behaving as the US president would like.
Russia is a chapter in itself.
But if someone wanted to summarise all of this in such a way that even a common voter, an American, European or another, understood what the system of rules was about, the policy of sanctions was based on, it would be an almost impossible task.
In sanctions against Russia, President Trump merely lands with what President Obama has already set up, only giving it an implementing stamp.
So why such a stir?
Last year, Europe was terrified that if Trump won the US election, he would hug Putin and call off the sanctions.
Terrible image.
But in practice, it is the other way around.
With Trump, sanctions are not loosening, but they are tightening.
But Europe is even more terrified.
German Minister Zypries says the Trump sanctions violate international law.
That's just the sanctions approved by the UN Security Council?
But then there are no kosher or anti-Russian EU sanctions.
For its part, European Commission chief Juncker complains that Trump's sanctions threaten the EU's energy security.
Like sanctions are to be used just weak enough to endanger anyone?
The common voter is fumbling.
He had heard for three years that the fate of the anti-Russian sanctions depended only on the implementation of the Minsk ceasefire agreements in Ukraine.
Now he learns that this is about the EU's energy security.
The voter is also fumbling more broadly.
There are sanctions for Russia for putting itself too much where it shouldn't be.
China is being scolded for being assembled in little.
Venezuela's president is being punished for building a dictatorship within the borders of his country.
All those punishments or just considerations have their rationality.
But does anyone see it as a system, an order or a rule?
Andrej Babiš: I am not considering working with Okamura.
Andrej Babiš has married, is cruising the republic with his visionary book and is finalizing the election program.
In addition to the Pardubice Region, it has already completed all the candidates.
According to his words, he did not interfere significantly with them.
He even agreed to have the Moravian-Silesian Governor and shadow education minister, YES Ivo Vondrák.
"But if he succeeds, he will have to choose whether he wants to be an MP or a governor," Babiš confirmed his earlier opinion.
You have been annoyed by many of the incumbents and national politicians with their thesis that directly elected mayors and mayors should run municipalities and cities themselves, only with managers.
Are you serious?
It wasn't like that.
I am a supporter of direct democracy, we elect the President directly, and I believe that we should also vote for mayors and mayors.
In my book I don't talk about the dismantling of the incumbents, they might as well be there.
The question is how many there will be.
When presenting your book What I dream about when I happen to be asleep, I heard with my own ears that you were talking about the abolition of councils.
I don't remember.
I was talking about a direct election and a reduction in the number of incumbents.
New York, with a population of nine million, has five districts and 51 incumbents.
Prague, with 1.2 million citizens, has 1171 representatives.
And the Mayor is blamed for not building enough and not preparing major projects, but she has no competence for it.
The same is true of a government run by only two people in our history, Klaus and Zeman.
Which is not to say they did it well.
But the current prime minister is not running anything, he is just hosting the debate.
It can't work that way.
Is that why you want to push through the majority system?
It would be ideal, but it's hard to get through.
In the program, we only have a change to a one-round Senate election.
We have also proposed a rolling mandate for ministers and an amendment to the House Rules to avoid unnecessary exhibitions by Members who are to work mainly in committees and committees, not to show off at House meetings.
It is certainly not true that I want to destroy the parliamentary system.
But that's exactly what your opponents fear.
That as a dictator you will run the government, control the House with 101 Members, abolish the counties and the Senate, and take over the country through the grateful mayors and the mayors.
It's definitely not like that.
There's nothing wrong with debating the number of Members.
French President Macron has announced a reduction in the legislature by a third, yet there are 57,000 French to one legislator, while in our country it comes to 17,000 Czechs.
But no one accuses Macron of endangering democracy.
Even if someone in the Czech Republic wins the election by a majority, we have mechanisms to prevent them from making any dramatic changes.
But the consorts are great for those who have a parliamentary majority, just look at Poland or Hungary.
There is no such threat in the case of the Yes movement.
We just need a team to work for the people in the government, not for their parties or resorts.
I do not understand, for example, why we have not been able to agree that only the salaries of teachers, staff in culture and social services will be increased.
Why did they overrule me and add 21 per cent to the GIBS members, who are already taking 60,000?
Would you step on that as Prime Minister?
The Prime Minister is to intervene when ministers behave uneconomically, confuse the government with the travel agency, and with the state's money they would like to do business like Marian Jurečka, who wanted to buy forests in Romania and land in Africa.
Ministers in the government are not to argue, the contradictions are to be said outside of it.
The cabinet has to go to the cabinet with finished material, there is no room for coalition rifts, strengths and business, that's where it's to be decided.
How do you want to have a cohesive team when ministers are mainly party-based?
There is a constitutional law over the parties.
When it came to the breaking of bread, Sobotka said the coalition agreement did not apply and set Babiš out of the government.
Any prime minister can do that.
But if he is a personality and has control skills, he does not need such empty gestures.
It measures everyone the same and requires a perfect performance from everyone.
Do you know who you would propose as Chancellor of the Exchequer?
I don't think about it at all, we probably won't even be in that government, no one wants to work with us, although I don't know what terrible I did.
So much skepticism is misplaced.
The mayors have acquired the entrepreneur Dědek, who would like to cooperate with you, with the Peoples' wing may win the wing of the sympathetic Jiří Čunk.
I don't think so.
The ČSSD is led by Lubomír Zaorálek, who does not rule out a coalition with ANO, and Václav Klaus Jr., who will also not oppose it, will succeed in the ODS.
I'd leave it to the voters.
Deputy Prime Minister and Vice-President of ANO Richard Brabec said you have many common points with Tomio Okamura's SPD, for example in the field of economics.
So the Ocamuras come to that as a coalition partner?
Mr. Brabec says he didn't say that.
Mr. Okamura has his political history, he ran as a puppet for Vít Bárta for the VV, then he got money from the Dawn for his company, there was some coup.
He is, of course, a prominent figure.
But a bit brownish.
If I take his program, he has a wide involvement of people in the management of society, direct democracy, you can agree with that.
I'm not asking you that at all.
I wonder if a man who has xenophobic views is speaking to you at gallows demonstrations and wants to leave the EU?
We are not considering working with Mr Okamura's party, I cannot imagine it.
It is obvious that he went into politics to profit from it.
What about the Communists' tacit support for your minority government?
I can't even imagine that, but the voters will decide.
It's going to be about negotiating the winner with the second in line, but God knows who's going to be the winner and who's the two.
Of course, it is important that they are able to agree on the coalition government's agenda.
Let's go back to your efforts to run the state as a business.
But the government just has to follow, Prime Minister Sobotka let everything be banished, never decided.
Coalition matters such as CEB or EGAP did not work.
After all, Sobotka is his puppet, and I think that was also the reason he fired me.
As soon as he did this, CEZ took control of the Czech government.
After all, it is unbelievable that the Prime Minister brought a resolution written by the management of ČEZ, which he instructs the Minister of Finance to vote at the general meeting of CEZ.
If you become prime minister, change the staffing situation on the supervisory board and replace the top management of CEZ?
Jesus, if I'm Prime Minister, we'll see.
I'm not yet.
There are whispers that CEZ has already sent signals in your direction.
He would like to trade good cooperation with the ČSSD for an even better one with YES.
So maybe after the election, everything will go on again.
I don't know about it.
I have no lobbyist Pokorný or Růžička, I am a separate unit and I do not deal with this at all.
Answer directly.
If you head a government, will you seek to replace the management of ČEZ, Czech Television or the General Health Insurance Company, i.e. the institutions you criticise?
I would like CEZ to be a transparent company.
So far, he's done what he wanted for years, thanks to commissions for traditional political parties.
All you have to do is find Mr Schwarzenberg's statements.
Although the state has a majority in CEZ, it was never run, it was only there in numbers, which is wrong.
For me, it's a trivial matter.
ČEZ is to take Dukovany, appreciate them, put them in a subsidiary, arrange financing, do a supply competition or get a co-investor, and build a new nuclear block.
The concept that the state is to finance and build new nuclear blocks is absurd.
And Czech Television?
Some of her shows are conducting a permanent purpose campaign against me, but I don't have a and I don't have any competence to fire someone.
But control it.
I don't want to control anyone.
I'm just saying that citizens pay fees of around 7.2 billion a year for public radio and television, but they don't really know how these institutions run.
How come they don't know?
After all, the House approves a report on their management, which has a direct influence on the positions of the CEO of ČT and ČRo.
Look at the way the reports are discussed, the super power pact of Sobotka Kalousek, which has always worked.
This is true of both the current parliamentary commission for leaks from the investigation files and at the lex Babiš.
And Sobotka was so stupid that he let Kalousek push him to fire me out of the government, which passed the TOP 09 percentages, but the ČSSD took them off.
They are afraid of breaking up their corrupt system, so they are talking about threatening democracy by Babiš.
No one is immune.
What do you say to the articles describing how the first vice-chairman of ANO, Jaroslav Faltýnek, is building a position of power by installing his son in the supervisory board of Tepláren Brno and arranging the related lawyer Květoslav Hlín with city and state-owned companies such as the Prague Transport Company or Czech Railways?
We have a lasting dispute in that.
I don't like it, and I reproached him for a few times.
The Falcons argue that the lawyer in question works at substantially lower rates and is reliable.
I wouldn't do that.
As Treasury Secretary, I had no one.
We, unlike the socans, have never had a corruption scandal, no Pelta, Kratochvilova, Brezina.
If there was any sign of patronage, we immediately fired such a man.
In this respect, I am uncompromising.
If something like this happens, get rid of anyone, it doesn't matter who it is.
