The Civil Rights Movements issue a travel warning to Missouri
The National Association for the Advulance of Colourful People (NAACP) has released a warning to colored people travelling to Missouri on the basis of the state's discriminatory principles and racist attacks.
"The NAACP's travel recommendation for the state of Missouri, with effect from 28 August 2017, calls on African-American passengers, visitors and residents of the Missouri to pay increased attention to travel across the state as a result of a series of disputed racially motivated incidents currently taking place across the state," the association's statement reads.
The NAACP said it had taken this step on the basis of the current Missouri State Laws, which make it difficult to defend racially motivated acts in court, as well as as the conduct of law enforcement authorities, which disproportionately target minorities.
"There are violations of civil rights.
People are only stopped by police officers because of the color of their skin, they are attacked or killed," NAACP president for Missouri Rod Chapel told the Kansas City Star.
"We'll be stocking up the biggest number of complaints yet."
This is the first warning of its kind issued by the organization for the state of the US.
Among the incidents cited by the organization were racially motivated abuse directed at black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, a man of black from Tennessee.
Sanders died in contentious circumstances earlier this year after he received gas while traveling across the state and was taken into custody by police without charge of committing the crime.
The travel recommendation also draws attention to a recent statement by the Attorney General's Office of the State of Missouri, which states that black women's-skirt drivers have a 75% higher chance of being stopped by the police.
"The purpose of the travel recommendation is to alert people and warn their families, friends and co-workers about what might happen in Missouri," Chapel said.
"People must be prepared - they should bring with them money to pay the bail, or alert their relatives that they are going to travel by the state."
According to the FBI's current reporting of hate crime numbers, there were a hundred cases of hateful behavior in Missouri in 2015, putting the state in 16th place among all states.
The travel warning is also in response to the new Missouri law, which makes it difficult for companies to be sued for discrimination in the provision of accommodation or employment.
The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued a travel recommendation for Texas and Arizona after states passed an immigration law allowing state officials to detain people on the basis of a violation of this law, which the ACLU says is intended to improve racial profiling.
Travel recommendations are usually issued by the Foreign Office for Foreign Country, but recently advocacy groups have resorted to these measures in response to specific laws and trends within the US.
The model was killed by the chef.
Her family doesn't have peace after 12 years!
The murdered one is model Sally Anne Bowman.
A girl originally from Croydon was murdered in 2005 by chef Mark Dixie in the restaurant she worked in, who inflicted stab wounds.
The victim and the killer were to have sex and smoke marijuana, then killed her.
The killer then sat in a nearby cafe and watched the careful forensics of the crime scene's examination.
Dixie, a former chef, was sentenced to a 34-year prison sentence in 2008 for the murder and rape of model Sally.
He admitted only assaulting a juvenile in court, and the lawyer claimed that his client had found the girl dead lying in the street.
After three years, the police convicted him.
Dixie claimed that Sally and her ex-boyfriend, Lewis Sprotson, were arguing on the fateful night.
The killer said, "He was really angry and the girl started screaming after his attack."
"She even attracted the attention of the taxi driver," he said falsely.
The girl, according to his testimony, should have defended herself as much as she could, but to no avail.
Lewis was supposed to stab her in the street.
Dixie's version was proven to be a lie and accused him.
After the confession, Dixie spoke of his horny and appetite for the girl.
When he dressed her after sex, he felt satisfied and had to smoke marijuana.
Before the incident with Sally, he was with his ex-girlfriend, drinking alcohol and taking cocaine, Dexie himself told the police.
He said he felt adrenaline.
Sally started yelling for help, so he attacked her from behind and put his hand over her mouth," Linda added.
And after twelve years, the family faces further attacks from vandals destroying her grave.
It's been damaged four times in the last six months.
There are such cruel people at the time of freedom who are digging up these graves.
"So our daughter is no longer there," the late girl's mother, Linda, told the Mirror about the disappearance of the ashes urn.
Linda was waiting for the attackers, but they always had to attack when she left the cemetery.
Designer vibrators cost tens of thousands.
"Czechs are not prudish or conservative," says Martin Ráž, who runs the Intimity boutique in Prague.
In it you will find design and luxurious erotic devices.
Including those by Czech designer Anna Marešová.
It started quietly, about 12 years ago.
Martin Ráž and his friends went cycling around Moravia.
One of them brought not only a bicycle, but also a box full of unremitting-looking vibrators.
"Mordials and dolphins and dolphins, and it was all green and yellow and just completely different," he tells me over lunch.
His friend and one companion decided to work with a German manufacturer of designer erotic devices Fun Factory, which intrigued Martin, so he offered to help out with marketing.
When the companion left to pursue another profession, he replaced him.
Today, he runs a throng Intimity on Prague's Benedictská Street, where he sells erotic aids in the way that luxury handbags or shoes are usually offered.
And why would they not?
It is also a designer items.
Wait, wait, you're talking about this at lunch, you're saying?
Come on, don't be such puritans!
It was the Berlin-based Fun Factory store, designed by acclaimed designer Karim Rashid, that served as inspiration for the Intimity boutique.
It was opened in 2010 and it was a very different concept of erotic commerce than everyone here is used to.
No covered windows, all made in a beautiful, subtle style, products displayed more as in a perfumery.
Martin and his business partner Zdeněk Šebelka began to consider how to accommodate the Prague store, where he should be and how he should be.
The name of Intimacy appealed to both.
"It's related to intimacy, and it's gentle, you might say, tender," he says.
This was followed by the purchase of an internet domain and a search for a suitable space, which went in parallel with the various interior visualizations.
In the end, the option that sprawled the shop in the pleasure garden and the bedroom, dominated by the bed, prevailed.
It was prepared for us by Dagmar Štěpánová from the FormaFatal studio.
We found the space in 2013.
At first, he didn't seem ideal because he's not on the main street, but it's back to the name Intimacy.
It's intimate.
It's in the aisle next to the main one, so no one is eyeing the customers," says Martin Ráž.
We wanted to be first.
We wanted to do a store that would be different, with designer nice goods, in an environment where women who are predominantly our customers feel good.
And not to be ashamed of entering such a deal in the first place.
When I entered the Intimity boutique half an hour ago, the streets were empty.
Plus, I didn't even feel like I'd go to the erotic device store.
Right at the door, I was surprised by the pure elegance of the interior I know from fashion boutiques.
Even if there is only a female attendant in the store, the fact that women don't shy away from asking for help doesn't mean the man's foot doesn't come in.
For the most part, gentlemen come here to shop for their girlfriends.
"Men usually can't guess the right size and choose to be bigger," Martin smiles at the frequent mistake.
These are the preconceptions, the established clichés that women need some big aids, and it's not true.
So a man in good faith chooses, for example, an unnecessarily large vibrator.
Likewise, men choose mostly black lingerie, whereas the woman usually gravitates toward pink.
The absolute bestseller is currently a product aptly called Satisfyer.
It must be clear from the look on my face that I don't know which one is beating, because Martin immediately explains how it works.
It's kind of a covardator-free stimulator.
I have an adolescent need to chuckle in admiration at the serious tone with which I am given the interpretation.
It's like there's no excavation.
And it doesn't really boast.
It is at a good price and has the perfect user reference.
We didn't think he'd be so well received.
It's some sort of revolutionary novelty.
The first revolution was caused by a vibrator in the shape of a sepian.
He took care that women became more interested in the design of such products.
The second was a vibrator for the We-Vibe pairing.
He completely broke the taboos that may persist with some men, and that he sees competition in erotic aids.
"Something different options are made," he continues.
With one engine, with two engines, with remote control.
That's a favorite category.
When a love conjunction, a woman can have a control officer in her hand and determine the intensity of vibrations.
On the contrary, a certain flop is the category of storing vibrators.
At least for us.
Czech women, it seems, prefer multi-purpose aids and buy classic vibrators, even though they may only use it externally.
At the same time, in Western Europe, especially with younger customers, it is very popular.
What about the men?
It is difficult to say whether a similar concept would work exclusively for men.
It would have to be a little different.
The question is what to offer men," Martin muses.
"We have aids for them, too, but to a limited extent." The most sold is mainly a masturbator, in this case from the manufacturer Tenga.
It does not look like an anatomical imitation of the vagina, but "more like a shower gel or as an egg or a futuristic object.
They focus a lot on functionality and experiences in use.
In Japan, things are very different.
It's astonishing in me.
I thought the Japanese women were very fond of erotic aids, I object.
"That's the Internet reality," it's explained.
The mundane is completely different.
Here in Europe, the erotic devices are more associated with being used by women.
They are perfectly normal for men in Japan, and they are taboo for women." Just out of curiosity - what the Japanese brand Tenga, which is represented in the Intimity boutique, sells worldwide, still accounts for about half of what is sold only in Japan.
In our waters
Czechs and Czechs are not prudent.
On the contrary, we are a fairly accommodating nation.
Certainly unlike countries such as Catholic Poland or Italy.
A typical store client is between the ages of 35 and 50, and "she's already had some experience with both sex life and some aids.
She'll come for something nice, of better quality to complete her partner's life, or for herself." Martin Ráž and his business partner Zdeněk Šebelka take care of it in a way that they are convinced by each product if it is perfectly functional.
We also don't want to go into bondage- and latex-type specialities, because we don't have the space for that, and it doesn't really come here.
Such things could discourage the ones we're trying to target.
Which are people who have always been shy about going to the sex shop because they were afraid something like this would look out at them.
A lot of the products on the shelves are really appealing.
It is also due to the selection of renowned renowned brands.
Some of them have even won design awards, including the Red Dot Design Award.
The first ever awards were the aforementioned seahorse "and this triggered a change in the whole industry.
It began to be abandoned from inexpensive materials and, on the contrary, to work with the wholesome, other designs, different colours, began to be produced...
The nice thing is that the Czech is behind the design of some, the popular designer Anna Marešová.
I have to say that I was quite pleasantly surprised by how many people buy those design items Whoop.de.doo from Anna Marešová, even though they are relatively more expensive.
There are customers who come straight for Venus balls by Anna Marešová.
She has done a really huge piece of work by presenting exactly what we are trying to present to us - that erotic aids can be done differently, nicely, with a story.
Anna's story began as a school job.
Now it is a finished product, which is also produced in our country.
I wanted to control the production process and I also wanted to know from what materials and how Whoop.de.doo products are made.
Because it's not a big-scale production, but a small series, it's certainly more expensive than the big series.
I may be going up a bit of a stream, but it seems important to me to maintain the development in the Czech Republic.
It could well be that in a few years we will no longer be able to produce anything," Anna, who agrees with Martin, later describes the situation to me in that our company is becoming more and more open.
It is not a negative or negative attitude that is met.
At most, people are said to be embarrassed.
"But they, too, start to smile." Currently, Anna Marešová has a vibrator on offer, for which you can have a personal message, and this year she also plans her own lubricant.
The year ahead should be added to the vibrating eggs and other novelties.
Borders of healthy sex
I'm interested in where the line of what's okay lies.
Is there anything that Martin Ráž doesn't sell anymore?
It's so hard to define.
What comes to one person normal, another may seem completely abnormal, so we are more likely to define ourselves by the range of branded manufacturers.
None of them are embarking on any extremes.
Before we say goodbye, I have one last question: What was the craziest demand they received?
Just in the week came an e-mail in which a lady was asking for a masturbation aid for her friend with a penny-length penny long house.
So we had to write that we didn't have that one, unfortunately.
There's a question of whether we were made fun of," Martin says, with a suspicious look.
That, too, happens from time to time...
A blow for Karel Gott.
After two Alzheimer's cancers!
His friend Karel Štědrý is battling a serious illness.
Karel Gott's best friend is battling a disease that steals all people's memories.
"Yes, it's unfortunately true," the singer himself confirmed to the sad information.
I know about my illness and so far, due to the circumstances, I am quite managing it.
"I take the medications to slow down the accompanying phenomena of the disease," he added, thanking his loved ones for their support.
The entire extended family rallied to make it easier for Karl to make his life easier.
Eva's wife tries to be at home as much as she goes, her dad's home on the White Mountain is also commuting to the house on White Mountain by the daughters from his first marriage, and the son Karel is cared for by Karlas.
Generally, he battled cancer twice, and passed on his experience to Nightingale to support him in his demanding treatment.
He's done with sixty chemo treatments.
He was able to return to his work and on the tennis court and the ski slopes.
"I have a dramatlogist foretold that I will be here by the time I was 90," Karel told Blesk.
He's a fighter.
He's still eager to sing.
"I keep repeating the words of the songs so I don't forget them," Karl admitted.
The same disease is now being fought at the institute by the actress Květa Fialová.
Do you have a patient with Alzheimer's in the family?
Look at how to treat him.
The Chilean parliament has lifted the abortion ban, the law will be considered by the CPS.
Chile still has an absolute ban on abortion, so it must not be carried out for health reasons.
"I am sorry that legislators have filed a complaint with the Constitutional Court and that now ten people will decide what we have been arguing about in parliament for more than two years," complained Socialist Senator Isabel Allende.
The Constitutional Court in Chile has ten members and should receive a new president at the end of August, who is close to the opposition, according to AFP.
The Act abolishing the absolute ban on abortions, initiated by current President Michelle Bachelet, was passed by the Senate 19. July.
The right-wing opposition then announced that it would challenge the law in court because it believed it violated the unborn child's right to life.
Members postponed the vote on the bill last month until it was being analyzed by a joint parliamentary commission.
On Wednesday, the motion was approved by the Senate.
Under the new legislative amendment, abortion should stop being punishable in three cases: if a woman's life is at risk, if the fetus is no chance of survival, or if the pregnancy originated from rape.
Similar exceptions had existed in Chile since 1931, according to the Spanish newspaper El País, before women were granted the right to vote there in 1949.
The absolute ban on abortions in 1989 was imposed by right-wing dictator Augusto Pinochet, just months before he left the presidency.
Chile is one of the few countries in the world where there is an absolute ban on abortions.
The others are Nicaragua, the Dominican Republic, Salvador, Haiti, Malta and Honduras.
In El Salvador, for example, about 20 women are now behind bars serving up to 30-year prison terms for abortion.
In many cases, according to human rights defenders, it was a spontaneous abortion, which the court called a murder.
Is there anything else sacred?
The target of Trump's White House is now the Statue of Liberty
The non-family sign of regime change is the criticism of the sculptures.
The Americans could tell about it as well as everyone else's - see the carefully staged overthrow of the statue of Saddam Hussein in Bajada's Firdos Square in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the Trump regime's key supporters, surely knew what was about to happen when, in a heated debate with a heated debate with a CNN reporter, Jim Acosta, on the president's proposals to drastically restrict legal immigrants, he set off with a symbolic axe on the Statue of Liberty.
It is fitting that Miller did not attack the statue as such.
For that, he would be lynched by a crowd of cruise ship owners and imitators of the Statue of Liberty.
However, he attacked its significance, specifically the fact that in 1903 a plaque with the famous poem Emmy Lazarus was placed on the pedestal, and only 17 years after the completion of the monument.
Miller rebuked Acosta by saying, "I don't want to go down in history here, but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that casts light on the world.
The poem that was placed on the pedestal retrospectively, and to which you refer, is not part of it."
Miller is really right, but as he put it, this is not about history.
These are, above all, the startling words of Emma Lazarus, which resonate today - inviting them not only immigrants, but the poorest of the poorest: "Let it come to me who's down, who's the poor, who can barely breathe freely, who's a miserable worm in the middle of the full cities."
And it is in modern times that we can better watch these "intest worms" on our screens.
Miller didn't try to criticize poetry - he wanted to make it clear that these people were not welcome in the US.
This conflict about the meaning of the statue is part of a comprehensive political and cultural war: it is essentially a conflict about the importance of America.
Emma Lazarus, like her friends, who, after her death, had sought to set a plaque with a poem on the foot of the statue, well knew that she was embarking on a high political game.
The statue was meant to express the merger of the French and American Republican governments by representing the classic theme, the female embodiment of freedom.
Emma Lazarus has altered this meaning: in her poem, the female figure is not abstract, but she has her own voice.
He also has a very different name: the mother of the exiled.
The combination of the poem with the idea of a woman is a brilliant feminist move and a devastating attack on American nativism.
And in the same way that Emma Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, the right-wingers have long sought to reverse that meaning.
The well-known commentator Rush Limbaugh - Jana the Baptist on Trump's rise to power - argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty did not actually invite anyone to the country, but represents an early neo-constructivism, bringing the American flame to the backward world: "The Statue of Liberty is striding forward.
He carries the torch of freedom from the United States and offers it to the rest of the world.
The march is not to illuminate the journey to the United States."
Surprisingly, Limbaugh is alluding to an important point.
The meaning of the sculpture depends on the point of view.
Emma Lazarus describes the statue from the point of view of an exhausted and damned passenger who often arrives after a long and terrifying ocean cruise in the hope of a new land in his heart.
This is literally a view of the world through the eyes of people who seek refuge and a chance at a better life.
From this perspective, the statue expresses hope and listens to their needs.
And that, of course, is a perspective that both Miller and Trump certainly won't recognize.
Their torch is not to illuminate the path, but to inflame the hatred that is their only source of power.
World Championships in Athletics 2017: Neil Black sings praise on Scottish members of the British team
Eilidh Doyle recalls when the British team had only two Scottish members
United Kingdom Athletics Federation director Neil Black said that the strong squad of 16 Scots in the World Cup team would be a "huge benefit for the team."
For the World Championships in London 2017, which starts on Friday, a record number of Scottish athletes have been selected.
Black believes that "something special is happening" in Scotland and British athletics could learn a lot from Scots.
"We are trying to understand and adapt to it - we will work on it," Black said.
"I've spoken to the people of the Scottish Sports Institute, and they think it has to do with what they've done.
Scottish athletics officials think it has to do with what they've done.
British athletics: it has to do with what they've done.
People on the streets think so, too.
Whatever it is, it's absolutely amazing."
Several Scottish athletes will be vying for medals, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will compete with Sir Mo Farah in the 5000m race, while Eilidh Doyle was voted captain of the team.
"The Eilidh is modest.
Her opening speech was amazing," Black said.
"Several athletes, whether Scots or athletes of other nationalities, came out of the room with a sense of great pride and motivation.
The passion and undisguised feelings Eilidh was unrepeatable with.'
The silver medalist at the Commonwealth, who will compete in the 400m hurdles at her fifth World Championships, said it was "unbelievable" that there are 16 Scottish athletes in the British team.
The previous record from 1983 and 2015 is seven.
The midfielder, Muirová set five British and two European records in the last year alone.
He will take part in the 1500m and 5000 m running at the World Championships.
Another of the great Scots is Chris O'Hare, who will run the 1,500m track. This season he has won the British team races and the Annual Games.
Doyle recalls her first championship, in which Lee McConnell was the only other Scottish member of the team.
The team captain led the team to be "very proud" of the fact that not only a large number of her colleagues made it to the team, but in many cases will also be attacking the final and the medals.
"The extraordinary thing about the team captain is that I was elected by the other members of the team. It was a great honour for me, but the knowledge that I was elected by the team members is all gratifying," she added.
"I'm obviously very proud of all the Scots who made it to the team.
It shows where we've moved up to.
They are athletes who will be thinking of the front spots on the stage.
And my opening statement?
Yes, I think she did well.
I merely drew attention to the fact that we can be proud of this year's Championship because it is being held on home soil.
It is important to take advantage of the support of the home fans and rejoice in the fact that we are back at the Olympic stadium.
I've been given a second chance to race and enjoy the incredible atmosphere."
Blocking critics on Facebook: Don't apply for public office unless you bear voter criticism
Our father knew about his criticism.
The Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't take the paper long to start criticizing him for anything, from domestic politics to his political views.
Yes, this criticism did not leave him cold.
But he didn't try to silence the critics.
Because in 1783 Washington said, "Freedom of speech can be taken away from us - and we shall be led as sheep to slaughter."
This brings me to Maryland is Governor Larry Hogano, forcing him to act like Washington to act like Washington.
Hogana's employees blocked and deleted the posts of at least 450 people, who freely displayed their views on his official Facebook page.
This week, he was sued by the American Civil Liberties Union for these acts.
The governor's staff dismissed the suit as ground-evident, and there were many views on the online "who cares."
"It's just Facebook," said many users.
Still, it matters.
Especially the moment it's about people like Hogan.
In an absolutely democratic state, he is a hugely popular Republican governor.
He boasts the second highest favor in all 50 governors.
Hogan is not irascible.
As you can see, it guides its state with certainty of its own and strictly adheres to the principles.
It has also proved to be skilful in the use of Facebook as the main means of association with its constituents - the publication of the first photo with a bald head after undergoing chemotherapy is no exception.
Blocking the people who visit the governor's side - which is a public forum, labeled official and managed by his employees paid for with taxpayers' money - is pointless and ultimately dangerous.
In an interview with the Washington Post, Hogan's spokeswoman, Amelia Chasse, defended the governor, saying that the blocking of the comments had taken place from a position to host the posts.
But using the image of Internet trolls, spammers or angry people is too easy.
The Washington Post interviewed several real people who had their posts deleted.
And that is exactly what they are - the real people who speak to their elected leaders; the teacher, the entrepreneur and the pastor, the trolls.
As everyone said, their comments were polite and considerate, not blasphemous.
In his commentary, the pastor quoted the Bible, appealing to Hogan's Catholic faith.
Bowie Lakshmi Sarma Ramani's lawyer, Md. asked about hate crimes, but her comment was not hateful.
"I commented frantically that I was disappointed by his inadequate response to hate crimes and other current reports," she wrote in the Washington Post's commentary section.
"I do not like the idea that once a certain number of people have commented on the same subject, they are labeled by some by some people to promote so-called collective efforts, instead of being recognised as a larger group of interested citizens."
What the governor's staff called "focused spam interest" would probably be called a "obhaotage."
The modern Facebook era allows us to easily manage our posts by blocking critics or deleting negative comments.
It is far more convenient than in the past, when the same procedure would require staff to be taken to the streets, to collect and burn all the copies with criticism or arrest or silence the Protestants.
And that is exactly what is happening, only in digital form.
Hogan is not the last public official to be criticized for defaming Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is facing legal action from Twitter users who have been denied access to his account.
One of the first major regulations was born in Virginia last week.
Speaker Loudoun County Board of Supervisors violated, according to District Judge James C. Cacherise's first amendment in Alexandria, where she prevented one of the voters' access to her Facebook page.
Governor Matt Bevin (R) from Kentucky also received a visit from the ACLU for its use of Facebook and Twitter.
This should not be so difficult.
In the days of Washington, the low cost of shipping had virtually the same impact as the Internet.
Between 1776 and 1800 the number of daily newspapers was quadrupled, and his position as leader was questioned by many anonymous writers.
And even in those days, Washington had to deal with anonymous Tricoles.
People who, under pseudonymous, such as "Juricola", "Valerius", "Belisarius" and "Portius," wrote letters to the newspapers and questioned Washington's decisions.
According to historical documents gathered by the people of the online project Papers of George Washington Project, petitions were hoarding in his office to criticize his position against the Treaty of Amity, Commerce, and Navigation deal with Britain.
He did not silence them.
Freedom of expression, disapproval and intimidation lies at the very foundations of our nation.
And the real leader must accept it.
Czechs quickly used free roaming, consuming more data abroad than at home.
Abroad, Czechs consume more of their tariff than at home.
They are most likely to travel in Austria, but the consumption of data in the summer season is dominated by Croatia.
On holiday, they have more time to browse on the web, under the parasol they usually don't have the option to connect to Wi-Fi.
Beach, bathing and smart phone in hand.
This is the typical Czech holiday in Croatia after customers can use the services of local operators at domestic prices.
This is clear from the recent statistics of O2.
Thanks to the new roaming rules, most Czech travellers abroad have more data available as a flat-rate than at home.
It is therefore no surprise that in Croatia, where a minimum of our people travel over the winter, data consumption has risen 50-fold this summer season.
Italy came second in the ranking of the data consumed.
The Czechs are sailed for the most minutes from Germany, where many go on business even during the summer.
According to data from the Association of Czech Travel Charters, Croatia is visited by 800,000 Czechs every year, making it our most popular holiday destination.
However, people here swapped the book for sharing experiences using a mobile phone.
Record was this year's 7. July.
"Tens of a million photographs would fit into the transferred data," said Silvia Cieslaor, director of the O2 mobile segment.
Although Croatia leads in the volume of data, the highest number of Czech users is in neighbouring countries.
Austria is in first place, followed by Germany and Slovakia.
Croatia is fourth and Italy sixth.
We go to Austria for hiking and an active holiday, for which we do not have so much time to browse the internet.
"According to Austria, the Czechs are heading to the Adriatic," Cieslarová explained.
While data has seen high year-on-year growth in roaming charges loosening, growth is much lower for telephony.
The number of minutes hailed in roaming has doubled compared to last year.
By a huge margin, Germany dominates the other countries.
"Corporating calls are more likely to be used by corporate customers on business trips," Cieslar added.
Ronan Rafferty hopes for home atmosphere at Renaissance Club
Former golf number one Ronan Rafferty will hope for a relaxing atmosphere at the Renaissance Club in the Scottish West Lothian, which hosts the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open, over the next three days.
Ronan Rafferty, who hails from Northern Ireland, lost to Paul Eales to Paul Eales at the nearby golf course Archerfield Links on his way to the final. This year, he will perform the role of ambassador of the tournament by the club's founder and CEO, Jerry Sarvadi.
"I watched the Renaissance Club grow up slowly before my eyes and this year's tournament will show the world its beauty," Rafferty said.
"Players will be able to enjoy the first-class quality of the pitch.
Jerry did a great job.
He is the ardent advocate of this game and is proud of his achievements.
This year's tournament is in the right hands."
Englishman Eales will defend the championship for the first time, despite winning both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour during his 32-year career.
"I feel good about it," the Southport golfer said.
"I didn't have a chance to defend my victory at the Extremadura Open because a year after my victory, the tournament was canceled.
Returning to this part of the country is magical.
It's a beautiful place to play golf.
I remember last year when for me and my wife, Sharon, the win was a really big deal.
It was a beautiful time I won't forget."
Gary Orr returns to his home ground, joining the European Senior Tour after turning 50 from the region this year.
This event will be his first appearance since Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
'I'd always like to play on home soil,' Orr said of Helensburgh.
"You want to do well and you feel a lot of pressure.
I really like to play again and I think I'm doing well.
I'm happy with the result so far."
The trio of players will also be joined on the pitch by former Masters winner Ian Woosnam and senior tournament winners Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are among the six Scottish players on the pitch; the others are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
Admission to the tournament is free. The parking fee is £5 for a car with one passenger and £10 for a car with two or more passengers.
All profits will be donated to Prostate Cancer UK.
Poverty and death in the Indonesian land of gold
When Bardina Degei cooks dinner, she doesn't use the stove.
In fact, he rarely uses a pelvis.
In her wooden hut, located in the capital of Paniai Enarotali in the province of Papua of Indonesia, a woman usually simply throws a sweet potato - in local "nota" language - directly into the fire.
After half an hour, he removes the potato and enjoys it with unwashed hands.
Bardina sits on the muddy ground - the cottage is not equipped with furniture - where he also performs his daily work, such as washing laundry in cloudy water from a nearby swamp.
A bucket in a roofless room replaces the toilet.
As the youngest of her husband's four wives, she was not assigned any field to cultivation.
Polygamy is common here.
Working until the late hours of the night poses a danger: most of the village's men are unemployed and often drink alcohol. In addition, the village houses the soldiers.
"No one dares to wade around the village after 5pm," Bardina says.
It is a rare glimpse of everyday life in the highlands of Papua, the former Dutch colony, which was declared part of Indonesia in 1969 after a controversial referendum, when only 1026 elders were forced to vote by a public hand upheaval in front of the occupying army.
The current movement protesting against the Dutch rules quickly turned its anger to the Jakarta government, which controlled the entire region, with the exception of foreign journalists or civil rights guards.
In 2003, the provinces were officially divided into Papua and West Papua - the independent Papua New Guinea occupied the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is such a distant and ravaged city, which takes place after a 90-minute flight from the capital of the province of Jayapura to Nabire, and then a five-hour gicorn-covering gistling.
Mass transport at this point is not working.
The city of 19,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences, roofs of wool sheet metal in shades of grey and rusty.
Few Indonesians, let alone journalists, and virtually no foreigners, looked at the place.
Prior to the arrival of Christians, the locals worshipped a god named Ug Tame.
And that's not all.
"We weren't used to wearing these dresses," says Bardina, pointing to her colorful, hand-knitted turban, dark T-shirt and a shining skirt.
"We used to only wear leaves."
Papua is Indonesia's poorest province - 28% of the population lives below the poverty line, and the local infant mortality and literacy are one of the worst in Asia.
But it is also an Indonesian land of gold.
The world's largest and most profitable gold mine, Grasberg, owned by Phoemirox, Freeport McMoran, is only 60 miles from Paniai - a rocky province of about the size of New Jersey, home to about 153,000.
In 2015 alone, Freeport here mined $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper.
In addition, Papua supports logging worth an estimated $78 billion.
Nevertheless, these riches are a source of suffering and a guarantee of oppression by the powerful Indonesian army for Papuans.
An investigation conducted by the New York Times in 2005 shows that Freeport paid local military officials and troops about $20 million between 1998 and 2004, including $150,000 for an officer.
Papuans calling for self-government threaten this golden goose and are therefore severely suppressed.
According to human rights activists, more than 500,000 Papuans have been killed since 1969, and thousands more have been raped, tormented, and imprisoned by the Indonesian army.
Mass murders in the tribal area of Papua during the 1970s amounted to genocide, as the Asian Human Rights Commission said.
Last year alone, Indonesian police arrested more than 3900 peaceful Protestants in the region.
We Will Lose Everything, a 2016 report by the Archdiocese of Brisbanez. The 2016 Drawer, describes the atrocities that took place last year, such as extrajudoduced executions, torture - according to another report, is particularly popular with electrocution - and the brutal suppression of peaceful protesters.
"It is difficult to calculate the number of victims because incidents occur weekly," said Andreas Harsono, an Indonesian research fellow at Human Rights Watch.
The situation was aggravated by the fact that Papuan sources attract colonists to Indonesia.
Of the provincial's 3.5 million inhabitants, 83% subscribe to Christianity, but demography changes with an influx of Muslim immigrants from the Indonesian islands - Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
The Java canteens sell fried chicken and gado, or a mixture of vegetables with peanut sauce.
Local people are fighting to survive.
"Imigrants started selling chicken and vegetables at traditional markets at lower prices than the local Papuans," explains 24-year-old Abeth You, who was born to Paniai and moved to work in the capital of Jayapura province.
"The original inhabitants of Papua - mama-mama (women) - have thus lost their jobs."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, who is dubbed Jokowi, promised to address inequality and rights violations as part of his 2014 presidential campaign.
The former carpenter secured and secured his trip to the presidential palace in the Presidential Palace in the Yarta 27 of Papua's 29 districts, including Paniai.
But in Papua, very little has changed, and the locals feel betrayed.
"Our heart was broken because in 2014 we voted for Jokpwi with the hope of hearing our call for justice," You said.
The fact is that just two months after the inauguration of Jakowi in October, Paniai had a great shock.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children sang Christmas songs by a campfire in the town of Enarotali when two Indonesian soldiers on motorbikes emerged from the gloom of the night.
Two of the surprised children told them they should turn on the lights.
One of the soldiers was addressed to the criticism and tone she was addressed to and later returned with four other soldiers, local vicar Yavedt Tebai said.
Two of the soldiers in the drunken state pursued a group of children and beat them with the butt of their weapons, the victims and witnesses of the event said.
One of the soldiers then fired at a group of children.
One of the children, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was beaten so hard that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, someone set fire to the nearby electoral commission building, and the following day, things escalated.
About 1,000 young Papuan men and women gathered on the football pitch in front of the local police station and army headquarters, demanding justice.
They came with the ceremonial hunting bows and performed the waita dance - in which it is run in a circle and the singing of the birds is imitated - the Papuan tribe of Mee Pago.
Several Protestants began throwing rocks at the buildings.
With escalating tension, the soldiers were ordered to the radio: "If the crowd tries to resist at least three times, you have a warrant to shoot," the official document, the TIME weekly, was said in an official document the contents of which was never published in local media.
Yeremias Kayame (56), the head of the Enarotali district, recognized the danger of imminent and urged residents to break up to their homes.
But no one was heeded of his words.
"When I turned around, someone shot me in the left wrist," he told TIME on the porch of his brightly painted wooden house.
Kayame does not yet know who the shooter was, but he said the bullet belonged to one of the soldiers present.
"There were a lot of people all around and there were a lot of shots fired," he added.
One of the locals, Alfius Youw, was hit three times, according to his cousin, who witnessed the shooting.
"I ran to the body to make sure it was really him," Yohanes, who, like many Indonesians, used only one name, said to TIME.
"I saw that he was dead . . . I kissed him."
Papuan Police Inspector General Yotje Mende told the newspaper that his officers were merely "ensuring" a station under attack.
"We must defend ourselves when people threaten us with death," Papa Police Press Secretary, Commissioner Pudjo Sulistiyo, said in 2015.
"It's a matter of life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five protesters were killed and many escaped injuries.
News of the murders was overtaken by the J.C. media the following day.
Three weeks later, Jokowi gave a heated speech in Jayapura and expressed his understanding for the families of the victims and vowed to deal with the violence in Papua.
"I demand an immediate solution to this problem so that it can never be repeated," he said.
National Security Minister Wiranto announced in October 2016 that he would introduce an out-of-court mechanism to resolve the violent acts that have taken place in the past.
Almost immediately, however, there were excuses.
"Most of the violent acts were long overdue.
Some of them occurred in the 1990s and some at the beginning of the 21st century.
What I'm saying is that we're determined to punish these acts of violence, but it's not going to be an easy task," he said.
In an interview from 5. However, for the weekly TIME, held in Jakarta, Wiranto claimed that he did not plan to introduce any measures in Papua.
Instead, he said that "all the cases will be referred to the court."
Wiranto, whom the UN has accused of "criminals against humanity" on the basis of more than one thousand deaths during the independent elections of 1999 in East Timor - said that 11 human rights violations in Papua have so far been settled, including the incident in Paniai.
The families of the victims of the shooting in Paniai welcomed his claims with disbelief.
"I've been asked four times in the last three years, but I've never done anything yet," Yohanes said.
"I'm tired."
As he says, a few years later, he still lives in fear.
"I'm afraid," as he claims.
"I'm afraid the army will arrest me or be shot."
His brother, Yacobus, confirmed the view of many residents of Paniai who are afraid to speak out about the incident.
In his words, he was beaten by members of the army after helping to bury four of the victims.
"After the body burial, the army started looking for me," he said.
And the shooting is not yet stopping.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police fired on villagers in neighboring Deiyai.
The scuffle in which one person died and another 17 were injured occurred between villagers and a construction company manager, who refused to provide assistance in transporting the man unconscious to the hospital.
Ravianus Douw (24), who drowned while fishing in a nearby river, died on his way to the hospital.
Angry villagers protested in front of the company building.
According to police, the villagers threw rocks at the members and were warned about the response.
However, local residents claim that the mobile brigade (Indonesian paramilitaristic police) opened fire in the crowd, killing one person.
"There was panic, we were afraid of retribution," 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lives near the hospital, told TIME and witnessed the arrival of the injured.
"I didn't leave the house two days."
The Deiyaisan Parliament demanded the punishment of the police officers involved and the withdrawal of the mobile brigade from the area.
The Paniai has always been a thorn in the side of the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development only exacerbates the separation of the indigenous people of the Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal tribes, who live in the central highlands.
Many of them have joined the Freedom Liberation Movement of Papuai (OPM) - an army of rebels that protects the rights of the Papuans by attacking and abducting Indonesian police officers.
Some of the OPM leaders come from Paniai. He is among the most Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
As a result of the attacks, the military has arrested and arbitrarily detained thousands of Paniai residents in recent years, all on the pretext of "acquiring national sovereignty."
Some of them will never be seen again.
Paniai is known among the people of Papuai as a "tragic and forgotten place."
Oil pets poverty in the fire.
The few rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for the locals.
And the bread is unattainable anyway.
The inhabitants here grow their food: mainly sweet potatoes, fruit and leafy vegetables.
Women work in the fields; each of them cultivates four or five fields of sweet potatoes.
Most of the harvest is intended for the needs of the family, the rest sold on the local market.
Ten of the sweet potatoes cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Since Nabire Airport opened more air routes and new immigrants began pouring into the country, economic inequality between native-born Papuans and immigrants has been increasing.
So many jobs are usually occupied by more educated and wealthier immigrants.
Papuans rarely have the necessary capital and education to go into business.
"Young people are moving out of the villages because of a lack of job and money," said John Gobai, chairman of the tribal council of Paniai.
Thanks to the isolation, Papua province is hidden from the world.
This is also helped by strict rules for foreign journalists.
At the beginning of this year, two French journalists - Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp - were expelled from the papui for "lack of cooperation with the authorities" all this despite the fact that they were given such a rare filing permit.
In his election campaign, Phelim Kine, deputy director of the Asia branch of Human Rights Watch, promised to abolish the strict rules for journalists and achieve transparency and development. However, this never happened.
"Frontier journalists who work in the rebellious easternmost areas of Papua and West Papua are at great risk: non-recognition of visas and blacklisting," he said in a statement.
The lack of news from the offshore members of the offshore means that the international pressure on Indonesia's in Papua is largely limited.
In March, six Pacific nations - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - urged the UN Human Rights Council to investigate "distortry and widespread violent acts" in Papua, including the shooting in Pania.
These countries have also supported OPM in the past.
Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesman Arrmanatha Nasir corrupted the allegations when he told journalists in Jakarta that: "A democratic system is still in place in Indonesia and the media is free, making it difficult to disguise evidence of human rights violations."
Local people are calling for the participation of foreign governments.
When the official delegation from the Netherlands, headed by the Human Rights Envoy, Kees Van Baar, visited Jayapurau on 4 May, local people cheered, according to a source who also attended the meeting but wanted to remain anonymous, the slogan "we want to be free."
There are more elections scheduled for 2019 in Indonesia, but the Coffins say they will not vote for Jokowi.
"Jokowi is a man with good intentions but is surrounded by people associated with the shooting in Pania," said Gobau, the tribal council chairman.
He wants Jokowi to know that the people of Paniai - in addition to living in constant fear of a robbery army - are rolling in poverty, miserable education, and the health system.
Gobai argues that the people of Paniai, like the other Papuans, regard their vote as a "lust" to be repaid by the Jokowi.
"They don't want money, they demand justice," he added.
Despite the threats and intimidation of the family of the victims of the Panya shooting, the last symbolic act of defiance continues: they bury the bodies of the victims on the property opposite the police and army stations.
Knowing that justice will never be done for enough, at least he will not allow the persons responsible to forget their crimes.
"A member of our family was killed," Yacobus said, his head down.
"What can we do?"
The French navy intercepted a huge cocaine shipment to Australia.
The French navy intercepted a yacht in the Pacific carrying 1.46 tonnes of cocaine worth about $256 million.
The shipment was headed for Australia.
The intervention arrested the crew of the ship, apparently made up of people from Lithuania and Latvia.
The yacht, named Afalina, sailed from South America, and was dragged to the port of Nouméa, the capital of the New Caledonia Territory of the Pacific, after being detained.
The Australian Intelligence Agency said it would seek, in cooperation with its international partners, to determine exactly where and where the drugs were directed from and to uncover the "Lithuanian syndicate."
"We are grateful to the French authorities for the measures that have stopped a large number of drugs bound for Australia," said its Executive Director, Col Blanch.
The drugs were destroyed in Noumée this week.
Australia is an attractive target for their smugglers because of high street drug prices.
The country is also facing the problem of growing numbers of people suffering from drug addiction.
The current crackdown is not the first in recent times.
Last month, three men were charged with transporting large quantities of drugs from the United States to Australia, which they attempted to smuggle across the Pacific Ocean in a small plane.
Seniors don't feel thirsty, drinking has to be remembered.
The problem may be in homes for the elderly, the solution, according to the doctor at the Geriatric Clinic of the General University Hospital in Prague, Pavla Mádlová, could be an infusion of saline, which is injected with a thin needle under the skin.
But these are only applied in medical facilities for the time being.
The older you get, the more water in your body drops.
"Moreover, they lose their thirst, so the elderly generally take in less fluids and dehydrate very quickly," said Madi.
Two grand should be drunk for sure.
"But getting so many fluids into the old person is a big problem," she added.
In homes for the elderly, she says, no doctor often does.
In hospitals, they routinely deal with dehydration with infusions.
"I think that it should be gradually introduced there, too, to allow them to receive subcutaneous infusions," she said.
In a day, she says, up to two pint bottles of saline can be delivered to old people.
Fluid deficiency can cause malaise, headache and reduced performance.
Dehydration will prove to be a complete loss of self-sufficiency.
"One day, the old man will say he can't get out of bed, he talks in puzzlement," she added.
In the event of neglect, it can result in a stroke.
Blood thickens and clogs the blood vessel in the brain, and there is also a risk of kidney failure.
Lying patients should not be covered with a blanket, a maximum of cotton sheets.
The problem may also be one-off diapers.
"It is more nursing, but the ideal would be to uncover the patient from time to time and let the skin air out," the doctor said.
In Dubai, the skyscraper was on fire for the second time
In Dubai on Friday, one of the world's largest residential carscavers went on fire. Firefighters had to evacuate all residents of the 337-meter-high and 79-storey buildings.
This is the second fire in this high-rise building in the last two years, which bears the fitting name The Torch (Murron).
All the residents of the building were evacuated and there were no injuries. The cause of the fire is unknown.
"We were asleep and the alarm woke us up. We heard the screams.
It took us ten minutes to run down from the 50th floor," Geroge, one of the residents of the skyscraper, told Reuters.
Dubai's civil defenses said firefighters managed to get the fire under control around 4 a.m. (at GMT), after which they continued to cool the building.
Government officials added that they provide alternative accommodation for the people affected.
The incident could once again spark debate over the safety of the materials used to lent high-rise buildings around the world.
The results of an investigation launched by the Torch skyscraper management after a fire in 2015 showed that the lining and external panels used for decoration or isolation were the most damaged.
British police said the system of isolation and panelling of London's Grenfell Tower could have contributed to the rapid spread of the fire in a fire in the June fire that killed nearly 80 people.
The survey results showed that more than one in five passengers to the US are making banned items on board the aircraft
A survey of passengers showed that more than twenty percent consciously or unconsciously made banned items through the U.S. government-run Transportation Security Administration checkpoint. At least six per cent of passengers boarded planes with a knife or other sharp object.
Less than one percent of passengers say they belatedly found out they were traveling with a firearm, ammunition or an explosive.
The results of a survey conducted by the airline Stratos Jet Charters Inc. - to which more than 1,000 interviewers replied - showed that younger passengers were more likely to be violated.
Of the respondents who admitted that they had attempted to knowingly travel with a subject banned by TSA, 19.7 per cent of passengers were with several thousand hours of flight compared to less than 15 percent of Generation X members.
The most common items that leaked TSA's attention include food and alcohol.
More than three percent of respondents knowingly made a sharp object through security, while 2.2 percent of the women surveyed and 3.7 percent of the men surveyed also admitted that they had deliberately brought banned drugs on board the plane.
The company said it had conducted research among travellers around the world to find out how many of them randomly made unauthorised items through airport security and how much had done so on purpose.
Not surprisingly, most people who have transferred unauthorised objects - whether consciously or unconsciously - travel by plane very often.
As the company pointed out, the TSAs are somewhat complicated and confusing.
People often don't know what fluids and how much they can deliver on the plane.
It is therefore no surprise that TSA confiscated the most just-forbidden liquids.
For a time, people thought that TSA would handle books in the same way as smuggled goods.
Fluid transport is permitted within domestic flights, not international flights.
EPA chief Scott Pruitt on postponement of planned emissions reduction directives for the Obama administration
After the Environment Agency was sued by fifteen states, its chief, Scott Pruitt, dismissed his earlier decision to delay implementing the former Obama administration's plan to reduce carbon dioxide emissions.
Pruitt introduced changes to his plan. It responds more briskly than previous governments to the needs of the state's environmental regulators.
However, he did not mention a legal appeal against his previous position at the Federal Court of Appeal.
This concerns the last deadline, which was set at 1. October, when states should start complying with the 2015 regulations to reduce the amount of ground-level ozone.
Pruitt announced in June that he would postpone the agreement for one year and order a more detailed study of the plan to avoid "interventions with local decisions or impending economic growth."
Pruitt, who held the position of state attorney general Oklahoma before being installed as head of the EPA by President Donald Trump, has served for a long time as a reliable opponent of stricter environmental regulations.
Since settling in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly moved or delayed the regulations proposed by the chemical and fossil industries.
The sudden turnaround on Wednesday is the biggest legal failure for Pruitt's regulatory agenda.
Last month, a federal appeals court in Washington ruled that the EPA executor had overstepped his authority in an attempt to delay the inclusion of the Obama administration's plan, which required the oil and gas companies to reduce methane spills.
In a statement issued on Wednesday evening, Pruitt proposed his version of ozone standards and strengthened the EPA's commitment to cooperate with states through comprehensive processes and the fulfilment of new standards within a given timeframe.
"Under the government of the previous EPA administration, the EPA did not often meet the deadlines and waited for it to be sued by activist groups and others, agreeing to the settlement and further setting of the plans," said Pruitt, who filed more than a dozen lawsuits against the EPA in his previous position.
"We do not believe in regulation through litigation and we take the deadline seriously.
We never joke about our statute and authority that comes from it."
However, the EPA statement states that Pruitt can use at some point the "obtaining of the delay and all other legally available authorities" to ensure that regulations "based on sound policies and the most affordable information."
Republicans in congress are pushing for a more comprehensive overtuse of ozone rules.
The White House budget approved last month seeks to postpone the implementation of the 2015 rules for at least eight years.
The measure has still not passed the Senate.
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who headed a coalition of states that sued the EPA this week, said the group did not intend to allow legal pressure.
"The turnaround in the views of the EPA - following our lawsuit - is an important victory for the health and safety of the 6.7 million New Yorkers and the more than 115 million Americans directly affected by air pollution," Schneiderm added.
New York was joined by California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, and Washington, D.C.
Ground-ground ozone is produced when normal harmful substances emitted by cars, power plants, oil refineries, chemical power plants and other sources react in the atmosphere with sunlight.
The resulting smog can cause serious respiratory problems in sensitive people and thousands of premature deaths each year.
Public health advocates and environmentalists acknowledge Pruitt's sudden change with gratitude.
"It is worrying what kind of pressure the pressure needs to be exerted to change the minds of those responsible and protect the air we breathe," said Lori Ann Burden of the Center for Biological Diversity.
"We must continue to wrestle with the ideological campaign of the Trump administration, which seeks to facilitate polluters and special interests."
He doused the man with acid, yet according to the court he is not dangerous.
You never know what might happen to you.
One minute you're at home with your family and you're laughing, the next you suddenly change your whole life from the ground up.
And the worst part is, there's nothing you can do about it.
A similar fate befell Andreas Christopheros of the UK, whose face was filtered with acid by an unknown assailant who was eventually acquitted.
The information was reported by the Reuters website.
In December 2014, someone at the Christophers' door knocked on the door.
Andreas got up to go open.
He thought there was probably a courier at the door to deliver Christmas gifts for the family that day.
Instead, he was in for a cruel surprise.
The man he had never seen in his life doused him with acid without warning, saying, "That's for you, my friend."
The pain was indescribable.
The clothes fell apart on me like nothing and I felt only an unreal pain on my skin," Andreas said.
His family rushed him to the hospital, but his loved ones learned the terrible news - he had no chance of surviving, according to the doctors.
A few weeks after the incident, doctors were constantly worried that their patient would succumb to an infection that threatened to penetrate his wounds.
His injury was very serious.
Ninety percent of the face was hit, which doctors tried to put together with the skin of other parts of the patient's body.
A big complication for Christopher was the loss of the eyelids.
It's probably the most heofed thing I've ever had.
"You can't hide from an unexpected light, you can't close your eyes," he said, describing his torment.
Today, Christopheros has had twelve surgeries that are far from the last.
Injury that suffers from acid victims can require hundreds of surgical procedures and years of treatment, according to plastic surgeons.
Even after a difficult and long-term treatment, the victims of the tissue have scar tissue for the rest of their lives.
"Sometimes people don't recover and fight for the rest of their lives against deformity and disfigurement," said Professor Peter Dziewulski, a spokesman for the British Association of Plastic and Aesthetic Surgeons.
The attacker was wrong.
As for the attack, Christopheros is sure the unidentified man must have mistaken him for one another.
The perpetrator believed he was retaliating against a man who sexually abused his close person.
Police duly investigated the case and eventually tracked down the assailant.
The man was originally sentenced to at least eight years in prison.
However, later, the verdict, to the astonishment of the Christopheros family, fundamentally changed.
"Three judges eventually concluded that the punishment should be annulled as the man is not considered a threat to the public," Christopheros said.
Over the past few years, the number of amorphous substances has increased considerably.
The country's Interior Ministry has commented on the issue as planning to provide new guidelines to prosecutors on the classification of corrosives.
These should be classified as dangerous weapons.
But the victims of such attacks are not about to be surrendered.
They are demanding that the UK government push for stricter and longer prison sentences for people who attack their surroundings with acid or other corrosive substances.
They also require tightening controls on sales of dangerous substances, which are often commonly available in different shops, as they are different cleaning products.
In the largest city of the United Arab Emirates, Dubai, the famous skyscraper The Torch, which is one of the largest residential buildings in the world, was on fire at night.
According to the Dubai Civil Defense, the residents of the 80-story building were evacuated in time and no one was injured.
According to a Dubai police spokesman, a fire broke out on the ninth floor and spread up.
According to several residents of the house, however, it was the opposite.
"It started on the 67th floor, that's what they told us," said one of the tenants.
Also, according to another tenant cited by Reuters, the fire broke out on the highest levels and spread down with falling hot debris.
We were asleep.
We woke up the alarm, people were screaming.
"We ran down the stairs, it took us about ten minutes from the 50th floor," the tenant, George, described the events.
Another witness to CNN estimated that about 40 apartments engulfed the flames.
On the ground, a fire destroyed at least two cars when burning parts of the building hit them.
After about two hours, according to a statement from the civil defence, the fire was brought under control.
The cause of its origin is not yet known.
According to witnesses, the power went out in the surrounding buildings.
A large fire damaged Dubai's skyscraper The Torch also in February 2015, destroying over a hundred apartments.
There are about 680 apartments in the entire building.
No one was hurt at the time either, as the residents were evacuated in time.
The Torch skyscraper was built in 2011 and then became the world's tallest residential building with its 352 metres.
He was set for a record the following year by another Dubai skyscraper.
The bodybuilder had an astonishing 14 doping substances in his system.
He didn't win anyway.
According to the Corriere della Serra, a sample of 23-year-old Ippolito involved a varied collection of illicit remedies - from steroids to diuretics to Parkinson's disease or anorexia drugs.
Ironically, even this wild mix did not help him to the title, finishing fourth.
The bodybuilder now faces a four-year suspension and prosecution.
The record was 11.
Last year, Italian rugby rugby player Davide Vasta tested positive for 11 doping substances, a record amount until then for the athletes caught.
The third-tier player, he said, had started taking steroids the year before, when he failed in bodybuilding.
Lucka Vondráčková in the Czech Republic.
She was passionate about her ex-husband!
No sooner did Lucka Vondráčková set foot in the Czech Republic, she is in one round.
And it also attracts attention wherever it comes.
The last time her former lover, Michal Dlouhý, with whom she had lived for three years, fell into her arms.
The actor was 12 years older then and already longed for a family.
Lucie was only 19 years old at the time and she certainly had no desire to hang up on her career.
So they walked apart, but remained friends to this day.
Which they also proved at the TV Prima press conference, where they met after a long time.
By coincidence, the two of them matched into blue.
At first they ignored each other, but then they got close, and Lucie laughed at Michael's jokes, to her stomach.
Then they embrace each other and posed willingly for the photographers.
Their meeting, however, was no accident, as the lovers' couple in the new series Prima, Captain Exner, will play together.
The Islamists were given life sentences in the UK for plotting to assassinate.
A British court on Thursday sent four members of the Islamist cell to prison for life, calling itself the Three Musketeers and planning a terrorist attack against the police and the army, according to the prosecution.
The four men, two of whom attended a training camp in Pakistan and had previously been convicted of similar acts, were arrested last August.
Authorities at the time thought he was about to attack immediately.
In the car of one of the men, security agents found a partially finished pipe bomb, knives with inscriptions that mean "unbelievers" in Arabic, and a mock-up of a pistol.
It happened when an MI5 Secret Service agent placed the listening device in the car.
"Recent assassinations have shown the horror of the defendants if they were not stopped," said prosecutor's representative Sue Hemming.
Three convictions, aged 28, 25 and 33, can apply for release after 20 years.
The fourth convict, who is 38, can do so after just 15 years behind bars.
During the trial in London, the men claimed to be innocent and that the guns found in the car were placed there by an agent MI5.
The court also heard from him, but then rejected the defendants' claims.
Thursday was the hottest day of the year.
Hodonín measured 38.3 °C.
Tuesday's 37.3-degree Celsius temperature record remained on the verge for only two days.
With 38.3 degrees Celsius recorded in Strážnice na Hodonínsko, it was surpassed by Thursday, which thus became the hottest day so far this year.
This was confirmed by the staff of the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute.
Compared to Tuesday, however, there were not many temperature records on Thursday.
On Tuesday, records were broken or set to 35 out of 145 weather stations measuring over 30 years.
On Thursday, only nine long-term long-term measuring stations recorded record temperatures.
For example, in Strážnice, Thursday's temperature was the same as the previous record from 2013.
In Lednice, Břeclav, Thursday's 37.4 degrees surpassed the original maximum by four-tenths of a degree, and in Pohořelice in Brno the current 37.1 degrees, the current 37.1 degrees exceeded the record by three-tenths.
Both records, as with Strážnice, came from 2013.
It was ten degrees lower in the west.
High temperatures appeared mainly in the south and east of Moravia on Thursday.
After Strážnice was the hottest in Dyjákovice in Znojmo and Brod nad Dyjí on Břeclavsk, where the mercury climbed to 37.8 degrees, but did not break the record.
By contrast, for example, in western and northwestern Bohemia, Thursday's highest temperatures so far were only around 22 degrees Celsius on Thursday.
"Temperatures didn't start growing there until later in the afternoon," the meteorologists said.
The current heat in the Czech Republic will gradually subside according to the ČHMÚ and more significant rains could also come on Sunday.
In most places of Moravia, however, the high temperatures will remain on Friday and in southeast Moravia on Saturday.
China lacks tourists.
Beijing is losing billions because of its visa policy.
China has been trying to exercise its influence for decades without the use of force means.
He spends $10 billion a year to support language schools and build universities abroad, push its entertainment industry to foreign markets, and tries to attract Western tourists.
But Beijing is failing.
The country's state media are talking about a plan to make tourism the driving force of economic change and modernization.
However, the number of arrivals grew by only 3.8 percent last year and about 80 percent of tourists to China came from Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan.
This is due, among other things, to the fact that, despite all its global aspirations, China does not welcome foreigners with open arms, the situation in the world's most populous country is assessed by the University of Economics professor Christopher Balding in an article for Bloomberg.
An example that speaks volumes is Chinese visa policy.
Only 13 countries have visa-free travel with China, the citizens of the others must take out their visa in advance.
At the US Chinese authorities, crowds are therefore comparable to the Chinese New Year celebrations.
A visa costs $140, but if you don't want to wait for it for long hours in line, you have to pay $100 or more for the additional service.
Such restrictions create significant economic barriers.
A study by the Journal of Economics and Finance showed that the need for a visa reduces the country's number of visitors by 70 percent.
In 2015, only two million Americans visited mainland China, while Hong Kong, which accounts for less than three percent of China's gross domestic product and less than one percent of the population, was visited by 1.8 million Americans.
China often deepens the problem itself by using tourism to pursue its political goals, such as disputes with Taiwan and South Korea.
In the spring, when China cut back on transport to South Korea as part of a spat over a South Korean anti-missile system, the South Koreans repaid it and avoided China.
In May, the number of visits fell by 42 percent year-on-year, while Japan was up 85 percent.
All of this affects macroeconomic stability.
According to a recently published report by the US Federal Reserve, as a result of Chinese foreign travel, the Fed could leave China with as much as $190 billion, while China receives about $35 billion annually as part of the sale of the currency to incoming tourists.
According to official numbers on the balance of payments, China had a deficit of $217 billion in tourism last year, equivalent to 44 percent of China's entire surplus in the trade of goods.
So the small number of tourists are inflicting a very painful blow to the country scrupters of capital.
However, the above factors are only one manifestation of more general restraint towards foreigners.
In many parts of China, virtually no one has heard of immigrants.
As recently as 2013, there were fewer than a million foreigners living across China.
More are among them in the United States and some of the individual cities.
Even Japan, which is not exactly a crossroads of immigration, has double that.
Meanwhile, many scientific papers show that immigrants tend to revive economic growth, entrepreneurship, and innovation.
In China, however, you can hardly find them.
Addressing these problems will be politically challenging, but the move to be offered is to simplify the visa apparatus.
Other Asian nations, in particular India and Vietnam, have recently made a major effort to simplify and discount visa procedures.
If China wants more foreign tourists and their hard currencies, it should be easier for them to get there.
At the Pilsen Zoo, they multiplied the deadly poisonous reptiles.
The Plzeňská Kingdom of the Journey can enjoy the cubs of three rare, deadly poisonous reptiles.
In the exhibition, visitors will see only nine recent newborn Turkish vipers.
This species is in northern Anatolia, even at an altitude of 2,000 metres.
"It also grows in a metre length," said zoo spokesman Martin Vobruba.
The chicks of the other two species, the leaphones and the red cobras, will be gaining strength in the garden's breeding grounds.
We can't tell when people will see them yet.
"We would not like to lose them," said nurse Miroslav Dohnal, noting that it could take a year or two.
The Australian's deathstronates of the vipers were born eight, the offspring of a breeding pair native to the population around Sydney.
"The individual that visitors can see in the exhibit belongs to the lethal-shares from the vicinity of Perth," Vobruba said, noting that in human care, a 6-8 week wintering is required for the death certificate at 13 degrees Celsius.
The 100% success was accompanied by a clutch of the African spitting cobra red.
The couple at the Pilsen Zoo were made up of four eggs by a total of four chicks.
"The incoubation took 65 days," Vobruba said.
This species in nature is sprayed with poison on its victim, up to four metres away.
He's aiming for the eyes, it can cause a permanent blindness.
The chicks of all three species feed on mouse shave at the zoo.
Within 40 days in the garden they are still expecting to hatch the cubs from the table of mamba black, the eggs are stored in the incubator.
According to an unverified rewrite of a telephone conversation, Trump is putting pressure on Mexico to pay for the border wall
The US-based Washington Post has released a transcript of President Trump's phone calls to leaders of Mexico and Australia.
In a January 27 telephone interview with Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto, Trump urged him to stop publicly proclaiming that he would not pay for the construction of the proposed wall.
The US president reproached him for publicly condemning the construction of the wall, supposedly saying, "You can't speak like that in the press."
As part of his campaign, Trump promised to build a wall along the southern borders and proclaim that Mexico would pay for it.
A transcript of his first call to the Australian prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, has also leaked to the public, revealing a tense exchange of views.
President Trump told Turnbull that the US surveillance agreement for refugees bound for Australia was "ridiculous" and "dumb" insisting that if he agreed to such an agreement - which came under President Obama - it would look as if he proposed to ban refugees from the US.
Trump ended the call after he explained to Turnbull that "this is my most unpleasant call of the day."
Tusk testified again to the prosecution for Smolensk.
"He has nothing to fear," the dead president's brother, the chairman of the governing Law and Justice PiS party, Jaroslaw Kaczynski, said in Tusk's address.
"I have nothing to fear, Kaczyński will not intimidate me," Tusk replied, accusing the country's current leadership of trying to use the judiciary against political rivals.
As he left the prosecution's headquarters, a crowd awaited Tusk, according to TVN 24, chanting Donald Tusk! and wishing the politician Hundred Year!.
Tusk thanked for his support and assured that his conscience was clear: "I have nothing to fear and Kaczyński will not intimidate me."
He says he does not blame the prosecutors, but he has no doubt that the judiciary is to serve the current Polish rulers as a tool against rivals, opposition or people they dislike, and I fear that I belong to this group.
He was interviewed for the second time.
The ex-Prime Minister was questioned at the prosecutor's office for the second time, this time the interrogation involved misconduct in the autopsy of the victims of the Unleague disaster.
Additionally, it was discovered to be a substitution of bodies in coffins.
The families were forbidden to open coffins, and there had to be some reasons.
And the reason was that they were afraid of the scandal because it would strain Polish-Russian relations.
"The maintenance of good relations at all costs, despite such a terrible event, was intended to serve to make Donald Tusk a very important person in the EU," Kaczyński claimed on the Catholic television network Trwam.
He added that a possible conflict with Russia would have thwarted Tusk's chance of winning the most important seat in the union, from which Poland has absolutely nothing.
At the same time, Kaczyński said he had warned German Chancellor Angela Merkel that things could be dealt with differently with Donald Tusk, but she did not take note of it.
Tusk underwent an eight-hour interrogation at the prosecution as early as April 19.
Even then, he did not testify as a suspect, only as a witness.
Nevertheless, many saw his subpoenaes for questioning as part of the Polish government's apparent effort by the Polish government and PiS chief Kaczyński to discredit Tusk as a political rival by linking to various scandals.
The prosecution is subordinate to the Minister of Justice in Poland, who performs the role of the Attorney General.
The summons for questioning came soon after the election of Tusk as head of the European Council, whom Kaczyński struggled but tried in vain to prevent, including during Merkel's visit to Warsaw.
At the EU summit, only Polish Prime Minister Beata Szydlo protested alone against the extension of Tusk's mandate.
In this case, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán also let Warsaw down.
Both Burma and Senegal.
Where can Czechs vote for?
In the autumn parliamentary elections, registered voters will be able to vote newly on the composition of the House from Burma, Senegal or Luxembourg.
In these and several other countries, the Czech Republic has opened its embassenger offices since the last parliamentary elections held in 2013.
This follows from a decree regulating the delivery of ballots abroad.
The State Department has prepared an update to it, it is currently under comment.
Four years ago, 10,000 Czech citizens voted for MPs abroad.
"Since the last amendment to the decree in 2013, there have been some changes that need to be taken into account in these lists," the ministry justifies its procedure.
"New embassage authorities have been created in some countries, some of the authorities have been closed, or the level of representation has been changed," the document reads.
The decree contains two annexes, the first of which lists the embassies on which the paper ballots are supplied.
This group of authorities includes representation of the Czech Republic in neighbouring countries, namely Germany, Poland, Austria and Slovakia.
More than a hundred Czech authorities will receive a ballot paper in the press version.
It is their list of the decree that changes.
Four years ago, Czechs could vote for example at the Czech Embassy in Libya or Zimbabwe.
Today, both embassies are closed.
The Czech Republic has also abolished its representation in Bamako, Malaysia, and Japan's Kyoto.
There will also be no voting at the Consulate General in Donetsk.
The Czech Republic was closed in 2014 because of the war in eastern Ukraine.
Newly on the list of embassies in Nairobi, Kenya, the Senegalese capital of Dakar and the Zbami Lusace in Znojmo.
In Asia, since the last parliamentary elections, the Czech Republic has expanded its representation to include the Consulate General in Irbil, Iraq, and Chengdu, the capital of China's Sichuan Province.
The ballot berths will also be available for registered voters at the Czech embassies in Burma and Cambodia.
Czechs abroad have had the opportunity to choose from MPs at polling stations at embassies or consulates four times so far.
In the run-up to each election, the state election commission will be awarded by the draw for the county, whose female candidates are to be voted on abroad.
The first time was in 2002, when decisions were made between South Moravian candidates.
At the following two elections, Czechs voted abroad among South Bohemian candidates.
In 2013, the Central Bohemian Region was selected as well as this year.
The number of Czechs voting abroad is increasing steadily.
Some 3,800 people came to vote at the premiere 15 years ago, around 67,600 in 2006, 8222 four years later.
The early House elections four years ago were attended by 10,571 voters at the embassies.
Moore's Ford Bridge Massacre: Activists Remind Reminded of Rude Lyzneting
The 1948 Ford Mercury passed by the onlookers of Monroe, Georgia, and bumped toward the Moore's Ford Bridge.
But before a four-length black-skinned car and a white driver could reach the bridge, a group of white men with guns blocked his way.
The group's leader - a middle-aged man in a striped suit - drew a long drag on a cigarette and looked at the windscreen of the car.
Inside, the passengers trembled with fear.
"We want the n-and Roger!" the man yelled.
"Take it for me!"
The silence is interrupted by the roar of a young black man who is pulled from the passenger seat.
Fortunately, this scene is merely a reconstruction of the events that took place on the 22nd. July.
But when one of the men throws a noose over the "Roger" neck, the audience sighs with excitement.
Since 2005, a group of activists have regularly returned to the Moore's Ford Bridge, reconstructing the fateful night of 1946, when two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murra Dorsey - were killed by Kukluxklan members.
No murders have ever been tried.
"It's a wonder that not a single person has been arrested in all these years - even though we still see them in our community; even though we know their identity," said Tyrone Brooks, who is helping to organize the reconstruction of the event.
"It's a stain on our history and the burden in our souls."
Brooks is a 71-year-old former congressman of Georgia and a lifelong civil rights campaigner.
In his eyes, the reconstruction of the event presents a dramatic challenge to the event. Every year, Monroe reminds the community of the city that justice has not been done.
"We demand the prosecution and the conclusion of the case, we want peace of mind and reconciliation, but justice first," said Brooks.
"Until then, the process of recovery and reconciliation cannot be initiated."
The medical examiner is covering 27. July 1946 one of the bodies of the victims of the lynching victims at Moore's Ford.
According to the FBI's files, which received NBC News' coverage, up to 50 men from Monroe and surrounding counties were to attend the lynching.
However, no one has yet been prosecuted.
Despite the fact that the suspects remain at large for decades, civil rights advocates argue that both the reasons for the lynching - the politic and sex - were known to all residents of the city.
In April 1946, under a Supreme Court ruling, the black-skinned people of the state of Georgia were given the right to participate in the elections that were scheduled for the summer.
And it was during the summer election, according to the FBI, that black-skinned farmer Roger Malcom was supposed to stab the owner of the white-skinned land owner, Barnett Hester, allegedly because of his wife - during the scuffle.
In the city, according to Brooks, it was said that Hester had been communiticked with Malcom's wife, Dorothy, and brought her to a different state.
According to the FBI, he composed 25. July 1946 of the then prominent owner of the white-skinned land, Loy Harrison, for Malcoma, bailing at $600.
He was accompanied to the prison by Dorothy and cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
On their return from the prison, just before the entrance to the Moore's Ford Bridge, a group of suspects blocked their way.
"As it turns out, the murders were planned and orchestrated by Harrison," the FBI concluded.
"It is also clear that there was a collusion between the State and local law enforcement officers, who not only participated in the lynching but also got rid of the evidence and withheld the identity of the witnesses."
Brooks made a more succinct statement on the matter.
"It was a massacre because of the right to vote," he said.
"The murders had a clear subtext for all the local black people: 'this is how you will catch yourself if you register and vote.'"
The annual reconstruction of the event at the Moore's Ford Bridge is organized by Cassandra Greene for almost a decade.
Her performance is figurative, engaging and apt. It shows the deep-rooted racism that many would like to find extinct in modern America.
Watching this reconstruction is not easy and even more difficult to avert to look away, but Greene says it makes sense.
"No one wants to talk about lynching, because in doing so we have to face the uncomfortable feelings that are hidden in all of us," Greene said.
"But there can be no relationship between us unless you hear what I've been through."
The main rehearsals for this year's renovation began in June, and on the first day, approximately 30 actors - a dozen white men, the rest of blackmen - flocked to the room where Greene introduced them to a very carefully planned show.
Wade Marbaugh is a assistant director.
He played the leader of Kukuluxklan for many years, but in his words the role is exhausting.
"I have a bad feeling about it because it goes against who I am," Marbaugh said.
"I think it is very important to regularly commemorate this part of history, because we never want to go back to that time."
Actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, who play the role of Roger Malcom, or Barnett Hester, are rehearsing their roles.
The show begins with a scuffle - Malcom argues with Hester and blames him for sleeping with his wife.
"Get off my property n-e!"
Rascona is not allowed.
There's a scuffle.
At that moment, everyone (at least every black-skinned actor) explodes in a laugh.
Greene laughs the most.
"What happened?" asks Rascon.
He's confused.
Was I too rude?
"No," Greene says cheerfully.
"I just don't think the white people were saying 'n--r' in that tone.'
"Exactly," one of the actors blurts out.
"You must put more emphasis on R."
The energy in the room is suddenly better; hostility replaces the feeling of rapprochement.
Everyone wants the show to be authentic. Just to make sure that enough of the four victims of the massacre are made.
The actors repeat the scene.
Rascona emphasizes the correct utenance of the word on N this time.
Now no one's laughing.
The show ends violently and quickly.
The roar, the shots... and the silence.
A woman dressed in black stands over the bodies of the actors, singing Billie Holiday's mournful song, "Strange Fruit."
With every word, there's sadness in the room.
Against the backdrop of it all, a dozen onlookers are wiping sweat and tears from their eyes.
The audience has virtually the same number of blacks and whites.
One pair arrived from New York's Ithaca, many onlookers from nearby.
Each one tolerates the local damp climate for nearly eight hours, and Brooks leads them to the graves of Malcolm and Dorsey in the crowd.
Until now, the murders could have been viewed with hindsight, but now, standing in the same place where the lynching took place, the atmosphere is haunting.
With the last words of the song, Greene challenges the crowd of onlookers to inspect the bodies.
Children kneel at the victims' heads, watch the fake blood and the motionless bodies, whispering to each other in their ears.
"They're not dead," the little boy says.
A few minutes pass and Greene will thank the audience. It's over.
The actors clean the rope and shake off their tears.
Bradshaw embraces Marbaugh, the man in the suit, who played the Kukluxklan leader.
Nick Rascona embraces his two friends-actor and cries in their arms; in the end, emotions weigh on him.
"It's all right," one of the women whispers.
"We know you're in averse to the role.
But you had a reason."
Later that day, the audience meets with the actors for dinner.
At one table, a young white couple are talking with interest of a show with a black couple they met today.
Denise Duplinski was barely finding the words to express her feeling about tonight's performance.
"It's difficult to listen to those ugly words and look at those hideous deeds ... that are being done by people who look like you and do it because they look like you," she said of the reconstruction.
"It makes me realize that lynching is still a topical topic," she added, "only called police skirmishes."
On the other side of the room, Tyrone Brooks sits in the courtroom. He saves dinner while talking about civil rights.
According to his own words, he had already begun planning a show for the next year.
"The re-construction of these events is inspiring as it describes the fear we had to experience - but it is also a moment to reflect," he said.
"If we don't learn from it, who knows . . . it could happen again.
People who do not know and study the history of their country are doomed to repeat it."
I love the instructions for use.
A friend of mine says he only reads the instructions for use.
I disagree, on the contrary.
It is one of the modern forms of art, often pure surrealism.
I am nostalgic to remember the times long gone by, where the instructions for using anything were rather a rare phenomenon.
For example, my first record player contained only one piece of paper with hieroglyphs showing the involvement of some components, all of which were secret plates.
Years later, when something inside me went wrong, I offered the deed to a shaman who wasn't afraid to unscrew the back of the back.
With a grin, he advised me on what the paper with the labyrinth of the lines was appropriate for.
Yes, it was a used tool for chronic depletion of toilet paper.
He had playfully found a disconnected wire and allowed me to listen to my expensive vinyl tortillas again.
The new era brought new instructions.
Even a relatively simple fruit juicher, where he simply clung to the cross-current, required about ten pictures.
A particularly hilarious sketch was a description of how to tune in one piece to another.
The set was two-piece, and a different procedure was simply not possible.
Giving it the other way required considerable effort to break off certain plastic components.
My contempt for the instructions ended with my Seat Leon self-harm.
The year of production 2003 still had such a book with the instructions for minor repairs, which included, among other things, replacing the light bulb.
It was easy.
Three steps in total and the work was to be done.
Unfortunately, the author of the manual failed to state that while the bulb on the right could really be replaced in only three steps.
1. take out the cover.
2. unscrewed the cracked bulb and screw the new one.
3. dry the cover.
The frog on the left had a problem in the form of the placement of the battery cover.
At first I thought that by inserting the right upper limb into the bowels of the car, I was going to find a spring, a screw that would easily push the cover away and then follow the 1-3-saving author of the service book.
Mistake of the catwalk.
The cover had no place, no space for the slender hand of Cinderella, let alone the obese Silesian.
I've lost half an hour of my life, without any success.
The condition was exacerbated by my wife's entrance to the garage, summoned by a roar and words that he hears from my mouth quite exceptionally.
"What are you doing here?" she asked innocently.
My answer lasted about 90 seconds, however, if I skip the vulgar terms, there were only two published words left.
I'm changing the bulb.
"And what's taking you so long?" she said, taking the line that may be her last in the long-lasting volume.
I slowly explained to her the problem, with the main emphasis on the process of the torturous of the author of the tutorial, where the blessing of the hot iron on the hand that wrote the instructions, then I will beat her to no longer, was merely an introduction to the wide range of Witch Hammer's instructions, including his commissioning burning on the top above the Losin Castle.
"How about taking out the box?" the woman said of the battery.
In sheer desperation, this happened, and then the 1-3 step was as easy and quick as the right side.
I thought nothing could surprise me.
And that's until the day I got a call from a colleague who was just coming out of the collapse after checking for two female civil servants of the State Drug Enforcement Administration.
I know him as a balanced colleague who has experienced both the possible and impossible in the field, and who can also tell wild stories in an unpreticed voice.
"Imagine getting a ticket for not having the hand-wrong-wash instructions posted," he told me in a weak voice.
Gradually, I drew out the whole problem, which was that over the sink in the toilet of patients, there was no picture guide to how to wash his hands.
His argument of the commissioner that adults can usually wash their hands, and that there is no need for pictograms to handle the accustomed activities of decent people, did not have a healed effect and cost him a lot of money.
"It's not just that," she told him.
He understood that the simple rinse of the soapy palm-flying palm with water was a primitive act on the Cromanon level, that a modern man, Homo sapiens sapiens, performed this ritual in ten steps.
So it is necessary to say that it is necessary to release water from the tap.
The whole process has a total of eleven points, but at the end it is a joyous realization that one has washed one's hands exactly as the SÚKL jehovar is ordered to do.
Finally, I must point out that I was inspired and preparing a detailed plan for the work in the toilet.
On the issue of defaulgence, the procedure is uniform, there will be no problem, for urination, given certain differences between the two sexes, it will be necessary to put up the instructions for two.
The pictograms remain a problem, for creating the perfect procedure also means an accurate sketching of all anatomical details, which could arouse some outrage at the prudish toilet visitor, despite finally being able to learn that he had been mopping the opening in a completely flawed manner throughout his life.
Pearson to lay off another 3,000 employees and cuts dividend in an effort to revive trade
British training group Pearson said on Friday that it would lay off an additional 3,000 employees and cut the provisional dividend by 72 percent in response to another restructuring program to change the business model.
Another wave of redundancies, which, according to Executive Director John Fallon, will take place at the end of 2018 and early 2019, is followed by the company's previous decision to lay off 4,000 employees as part of the previous restructuring.
Pearson announced a cost-reduction plan of an additional £300 million ($394 million) in May as part of a third cost-cutting program in an effort to resurrect declining trade as a result of the rapid development of digital education.
The company, which last month agreed to auction its stake in Penguin Random House to Bertelsmann, said the outlook for this year remained unchanged after announcing a 1% increase in basic sales in the first half of the year to £2.05 billion.
Attack on Kabul convoy: NATO soldiers killed in suicide blast
A suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in the capital of Afghanistan, Kabul. A NATO soldier died in the attack and several others were wounded, officials said.
Five soldiers and an interpreter were injured, NATO's comments are mentioned.
According to unofficial reports, three civilians also died in the attack in the city district of Qarabagh.
A bomb attack hit Afghanistan this month - more than 30 people were killed in an explosion at a Herátsk mosque on Tuesday.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi Embassy in Kabul.
NATO said in its comments that Tuesday's explosion occurred after a patrol, along with members of the Afghan army, was attacked by a "local person with a homemade explosive device."
The statement also states that all injured soldiers are out of danger to life and are in a U.S. military hospital at the Brum Air Base.
According to the rapporteur's comments, the growing power of the Taliban and the group known as the Islamic State (IS) in the Qarabagh region is a major source of concern for NATO allied forces in nearby Bagram.
According to the United Nations, at least 1662 civilians died in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, of which 20% of the victims died in the capital.
At the end of July, a car bomb killed at least 30 people in the Shia Kabul district.
The attack was claimed by the Taliban.
On May 31, a large explosion killed more than 150 people in the city centre. This is the deadliest militant attack in the country since US troops overthrew the Taliban government in 2001.
The violence is undermining the already dubious situation in Afghanistan, and US President Donald Trump is considering increasing the number of US troops to assist military forces and police officers in the country.
According to the rapporteurs, the suicide attacks that have been shaken by the public's confidence in the government, its regulations, and especially in the reputation of President Asraphus Ghanin, in recent weeks.
In response to the lawsuit, the EPA revised its decision to delay the smoking rules
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency revoked its decision to postpone the Obama administration's law, which mandated states to cut emissions, just a day after the agency was sued by 15 states.
The EPA announced its decision to refer to the "First Standards 2015" on Wednesday night, saying it was presenting the Agency's commitment to cooperate with the states.
"We believe in the dialogue with our state-owned partners and hear their views," EPA Director Scott Pruitt said in a statement.
In June, Pruitt announced the EPA's efforts to delay ozone standards - which measure real air pollution in specific areas of the country and, based on the measurements, determine the limits to be met by October 2018.
A group of fifteen of most of the Democratic states, along with Washington, D.C., filed the suit on Tuesday on the grounds that the EPA's actions were illegal.
President Donald Trump's administration seeks to prevent many environmental regulations proposed by former President Barack Obama - in Trump's words, in an attempt to kick economic growth.
But the new government's efforts have launched countermeasures from Democrats and conservative groups that fear the impact of emissions on public health.
The EPA states on its website that the breathing of ozone-containing air "may diminish lung function and increase respiratory symptoms" such as asthma.
Singer Ladislav Bubnár got hit and blood flowed!
You may have already registered this, a relatively new singer with us, in June of this year, when this hitherto unknown singer held a monstrous event for Czech standards, hosting such leading personalities as master Karel Gott, Lucie Bílá, Simona Krainová and many others, and the event was not directed by anyone other than Leoš Mareš.
The purpose was simple to show it to the public and present their music video for the song Sara, whose baptism was performed by the just-listed personalities.
But few people already know that the very recording of the video, which took place in Russia, was not without its problems and the singer Ladislav Bubnár himself had to be treated.
It was his first major shoot with the stars of the Russian national ballet, and it was not without any real embarrassment.
The song Sara is very emotional and is based on the unfortunate love of two lovers.
For the dramatic feature of the scene, in the music video of the singer's rival, he was supposed to hint at a slap-of-war.
At one point, however, he hit him so hard and squarely on the nose that the young singer had to be treated by doctors.
"It was a blow, I didn't expect it, my nose was immediately bleeding," Ladislav commented on the situation.
Colleagues and producers said the situation on the set that it was an accident and Ladislav did not have time to react in time.
Fortunately, the injury was not serious enough to affect the sequel in the next shoot.
We now bring you the young artist's music video, you can also record the punch scene.
The failed blood-covered version, however, was not used.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko spoke at the meeting about the possibilities of the mutual duel
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, two boxers who could stage the most exciting lightweight boxing boxing match, met for the first time at a meeting on Tuesday.
Each of them was in a separate room in the ESPN offices in Los Angeles until Garcia - the undefeated lightweight champion World Boxing Council - went down to the hall where he welcomed Lomacenko, the World Boxing Organization, the featherweight champion.
After Garcia's victory on the unanimous decision against former four-time world champion Adrien Broner in Saturday's Showtime game, the two boxers made it to the list of the top five lightweight boxers.
Coucian cocked his right-hand one and said, "How's it going, Champion?
Good luck."
Lomachenko defends his title at 7:00hus on Saturday against Miguel Marriaga at ESPN.
Boxers pose for photographers, and manager Lomacenka Egis Klimas adds that a potential boxer fight would be a "perfect test."
"I'm a former featherweight champion," Garcia adds.
"I had to gain weight for the match with Broner (67 kg), but I'm not that big.
At my 63kg, I'm small.
I'd like to return to the lightweight category.
The Lomachenko has to gain weight back to get to the light of weight... then we can compete.
That's what the fans want.
Why not keep it from them."
Lomachenko agrees.
"Box would be good for this fight."
Klimas made a request for a payment for viewing - which is part of his strategy. Lomachenko should make his lightweight debut at the end of this year and meet with Garcia (37-0, 30 knockouts) next year, who also expressed interest in the match against the winner of the Jorge Linares vs. Luke Campbell, who will compete on September 23 for the lightweight title at the Forum Arena.
"The match should be the payment style for viewing, that's what the fans want," said Garcia, who later said it was open to the possibility of airing the match through a TV station that comes with the best offer.
"We are the main attraction.
No one else draws such attention.
We'll wait for the right opportunity . . ."
Garcia said he recognized Lomacko as an "amazing boxer" and could take part in his Saturday night's match.
But Lomachenko didn't give Garcia a compliment to be lulled when he said that the three-dollar champion of the Riverside division looked "very slowed down . . . sorry, Mike, but you're asking for a knockout."
Garcia said his goal was to show strength and then boxing.
Both boxers said they felt the rising tension ahead of the mutual duel.
"You won't forget this fight.
No other game is attracting as much attention to itself.
And I will have a great delight to put it on the fire,' said Garcia.
Lomachenko said, "I've been waiting for the best boxers, and this is Mikey."
It's going to be a great game.'
The young couple disappeared without a trace 12 years ago.
Their car was found at the bottom of the Volga.
A pair of young Russians, Ilya Zhirnov and Kira Cherkasova, had been missing since December 2005.
There was an extensive search for them, but without success.
And the police finally closed the investigation for lack of evidence.
The family of the lost couple lived in doubt that they would not know what had happened to the couple.
After 12 years, the sad ending of the story came.
The wreckage of their car was found by a lay diver at the bottom of the Volga River in the town of Cheboksary in Čuvašsko.
It was only thanks to the documents left in the car that the officers were able to identify the couple.
The papers survived underwater for a decade, without which it would take the police to find out the identities of the found much longer.
The couple were last seen when Zhirnov borrowed a car from his father to pick up his girlfriend from work.
Meanwhile, the diver who discovered the car remains anonymous.
He reported his discovery to the Cheboksar police, who hauled the car to the beach the following day.
Investigators believe the young couple's death was an accident caused by the freezing road leading the river.
However, the investigation continues, with further details to be released after it is concluded.
Latest test results for setting the age limit for asylum applications in Sweden
The latest test results for asylum seekers in Sweden, who were subjected to a new method assessing their age, show that over 80 per cent of people were asked as they were over the age of 18, but not everyone believes in their accuracy.
Sweden's Forensic Medical Agency (RÃ¤tttsmedicinalverket) began conducting new tests at the beginning of this year.
The aim of the method is to make a more precise assessment of candidates in the evaluation of asylum applications. The measure was taken after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket) was criticised for failing to determine the right age of some of the refugees who lied about their age.
To date, the Swedish Migration Agency has forwarded to 6880 cases for investigation, and the Forensic Medical Agency has now published the results of a total of 2481 tests, conducted from mid-March to 31. July 2017.
80 per cent (2002) was judged to be over the age of 18, while in a further 25 cases the Forensic Medical Agency concluded that the interviewee was "perhaps over the age of 18.
In another 423 cases, it was decided that the interviewee was "perhaps under the age of 18."
Tests shall be taken only if the age of the interviewee is questionable.
According to Johan GÃ¶ransson of the Forensic Medical Agency, the results correspond with the previous month.
"Compared to last month, the statistics are kept in business as usual and the figures are very similar," he told The Local.
The higher number of female applicants whose age has been estimated to be over the age of 18 does not necessarily mean that asylum seekers are lying about their age.
In May, the Agency published the results of 581 tests and said that in 442 cases it was found that "a person is 18 years or older."
The Svenska Dagbladet newspaper investigated 581 published cases and found that in 243 cases the pollster said he would have 18 years this year.
Criticism was also given to the medical method of ageing, which includes X-ray of wisdom teeth and MRI a scan of the knee joints, which are then assessed by dentists and X-rays.
One of the skeptics is Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute, who, among other things, deals with assessing people's biological maturity to determine the age at which he or sheer underwent puberty.
"I had a reason to think about this issue, and I don't think these types of age-appropriate measurements are correct.
Judging for the biological age is, in a sense, very uncertain.
If we cannot determine age with precision, we should not pretend otherwise," Metro told the newspaper.
The Forensic Medical Agency's GÃ¶s GÃunsson defended the decision by saying: "In general, the risk of incorrect assessment of a child as an adult is small.
The highest risk is that the person questioned is just under the age of 18, which in this case corresponds to 10 per cent of all interviewees.’
Trump threatened the president of Mexico on the phone.
In a January phone call to Mexican President Enrique Pee Pee Niet, US President Donald Trump threatened not to meet him if he publicly says his country will not pay to build a wall between the US and Mexico.
Trump said in the interview that funding would be arranged somehow, though he admitted that it would have to be secured from other sources.
Trump spoke similarly openly with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull.
This follows from the transcripts of interviews published by The Washington Post on Thursday.
Trump made the construction of a wall on the southern border for Mexican money with one of the major promises in his election campaign last year.
In his first interview with the Mexican president shortly after taking office, Trump chastised Nieto undiplomatically for criticizing his plan to build the wall.
He portrayed the southern neighbor as a growing political problem and pressured the Mexican president not to publicly say that his government would never pay for the wall.
"You can't tell the press this," Trump said repeatedly in an interview on January 27, threatening to cut off contacts with the Mexican president if he continued to make defiant statements.
Funding is said to be devised somehow, and in the end it will be all right.
"But if you say that Mexico won't pay for the wall, then I don't want to see you gentlemen anymore because that's unacceptable to me," he said, according to the US daily Trump.
He called the Wall the least important thing we're talking about, but politically, perhaps the most important thing.
The executive order to build the wall was issued by Trump shortly after the takeover.
Mexico rejects the construction and financing of the 3,200-kilometre wall, which has also escalated relations between the two countries.
In late March, Trump said the project would be paid for so far by the United States.
Trump eventually met his Mexican counterpart for the first time at the July G20 summit in Hamburg.
The Washington Post also reported on Trump's telephone interview with Australian Prime Minister Turnbull on January 28.
The White House official called the conversation ridiculous.
He was prompted to conclude by an exchange of views on an agreement that Australia would grant asylum to Central American refugees in exchange for the United States of recruiting people from internment facilities in the Pacific Island nations.
At first, Trump considered the deal to be stupid, but later agreed to it.
"You can certainly say that this is not the deal you have created, but you will have to stick to it," Turnbull told Trump.
In some passages, a phone conversation with Turnbull was almost jovial, for example, when Trump praised the Australian refusal to accept refugees in boats as a good idea.
"You're worse than me," Trump joked.
Suddenly, however, the tone of the conversation escalated.
"I hate receiving these people," Trump observed.
I assure you, they're bad.
That's why they're in prison.
"They will not be great people who will go to work for the local dairymen," he said.
He also noted in the interview that the fugitive could become an assassin from Boston in five years.
Trump conducted telephone conversations with a number of world statesmen at the end of January, about a week after arriving at the White House, often several times in one day.
He eventually called the Questor with Turnbull the least pleasant for the day.
Before he ended it, he stressed that he had previously had a pleasant conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
They executed the Rana killer in front of the crowd.
Her father was also watching.
The execution took place in a square in the capital Yemen, Sana'a.
Muhammad al-Maghrabi chose as his sacrifice the little one Ran Almatari, who lived in his neighborhood.
Al Maghrabi kidnapped the girl, took her to his father's house, where he raped her and strangled her with his bare hands.
He then raped her body, which he then dumped near the mosque.
The violent death of a little girl has struck an entire country facing the threat of civil war.
Yahya Almatari stood in the front row of the 1,000-strong crowd that had come together to witness the execution.
Muhammad al Maghrabi was convicted under Sharia law.
The victim's father told the media of his feelings after the execution.
I feel like I'm reborn.
I'm relieved.
It's the new day of my life.
Other family members were also present, shouting with the crowd the slogan "Low justice."
The rapist was brought to the square by a police van from which he waslé.
The policemen placed it on his stomach, tied up.
One of the members turned his weapon against him and opened fire at point-blank range.
The crowd present celebrated every blow that had been fired.
Mr Al Almatari told the MailOnline website that justice had been done in accordance with the country's legal system.
"Justice, Allah and Sharia law have won," he added.
I stood in the Liberation Square in Sanda, waiting to be executed by my daughter's killer.
Then my family and I went to the morgue.
We took Rana's tiny little body and buried it in a nearby cemetery.
I and my wife, Jamileh, are grateful that justice has been done.
Police feared that the crowd gathered in the square would become madcap for hateful, grabbing and lynching the killer.
The execution was ordered by a court under the administration of the Shiite Houthis.
Originally, however, Maghrabi was sentenced to 100 lashes immediately after his arrest, but his actions aroused such outrage that the judge decided to pay for the death penalty.
Al Maghrabi was arrested two days after the girl's disappearance. June.
Ran's family knew him well.
When police searched the basement of his home, they discovered evidence that the man had planned his actions.
Mr. Almatari described him as a monster.
What could have been his motive?
Even an animal would be more merciful to Rana.
"Our family has no enemies, and the injuries that carried Rana's body were terrible," he told the media.
"Rana disappeared in the afternoon, we reported it to the police that very day, we told the newspaper and all our TV stations, posters with her photo hanging everywhere," he continued.
They all believe the police received a tip from the killer's parents, who suspected their son of the horrific crime.
The girl's mother, Jamileh, had to be hospitalized after learning that her daughter's body had been found.
Rana used to play out with the other kids in the neighborhood.
After 10 to 15 minutes, I went out to see where he was.
We looked everywhere, but Rana was gone.
We walked around our block, our friends took cars and drove around the neighborhood, but we searched in vain.
The people of Yemen were disgusted with the crime and began to gather outside the police station where al Maghrabi was held and demanded immediate punishment.
A representative of the Ministry of Justice read the crowd present a recording of the investigation to reassure them.
The accused did not seem to show remorse for his actions.
Just before his sentence, the officers read him the verdict, but the convict only glanced briefly at his executioner.
The whole event was filmed for national television, but there were many recordings made online by the crowd.
West Virginia Governor announces change of political party
On Thursday evening, the Democratic Governor of West Virginia, Jim Justice, announced at President Trump's rally that he was moving to another party.
"Whether you like it or not, the Democrats have turned their backs on me," the Justice Governor said.
"I'm announcing to you today after a long prayer and thought... today, as a resident of West Virginia, I tell you that I can no longer support you from my position as a Democratic governor."
The crowd of onlookers exploded in joy.
"I'll subscribe to the Republicans tomorrow," Justice added.
"As a coach, I can tell you it's time to jump into another game."
Trump had previously promised people an important announcement at a rally in West Virginia.
Trump won in West Virginia with 42 points and Justice did not support Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.
The justice, who according to Forbes magazine is the only billionaire in the country, was elected in 2016.
Forbes adds that Justice inherited a large fortune from his father and is the owner of several coal mines.
The value of his assets is estimated at $1.59 billion.
Meanwhile, the Republican National Committee issued a statement on Thursday night saying: "The redevelopment of the governor, the Justice is yet another blow to the Democratic party that puts obstacles in our way instead of contributing to the uplift of our country."
"For the Democratic Party, which has only 15 governors and controls the least legislative bodies in history, the Governor Justice's announcement is the last straw for an already miserable, leaderless party that seeks in vain to find positive and unifying news," R&N chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said in a statement to CBS News.
Sebastian Coe praises Russia's "sincere" apology for doping scandal
Former outstanding athlete Sebastian Coe praised Russia on Thursday for his sincere apology for the doping scandal, but reiterated that it has not yet been the right time to return Russia to the sporting world.
On the occasion of the I.A. Congress, Dmitry Shylakhtin, the head of Russian athletics, said on the occasion of the IAAF Congress - which took place on the eve of the World Championships in Athletics - that the expulsion of his country from the world of sport was right and that he was determined to fight doping.
He apologized to "all the athletes who lost their gold and silver medals in this way."
Despite his comments, members of the IAAF Congress voted to maintain the ban that came into force in November 2015 after a World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) report revealed that Russia supported doping of its athletes.
"I think we have witnessed a very frank response and presentation today," IAAF President Sebastian Coe told reporters.
"All the members of the council and congress were pleasantly surprised that Russia admitted its mistake and was working with all its might to correct and restore the proper function of the entire federation."
Coe said he was also "pleased" that Russia had adopted the criteria for its reintroduction.
"I think today has gone very well and we have advanced to the next stage, but Congress supports the Emergency Task Force's recommendation to maintain the punishment that has been thrown on Russia," Coe added.
"We must do our best to stabilise the situation in the coming months.
Our aim has always been to separate honest athletes from the dishonest," he said, ending his speech.
At the World Championships in Athletics, which starts on Friday in London, 19 Russian athletes who have complied with the IAAF's strict rules will compete under the neutral flag.
IAAF's head of the IAAF emergency staff, Rune Andersen, said on Monday that Russia still needs to meet several criteria before it is allowed back.
Drug-taking tests are still unsatisfactory and the excluded coaches continue to do their business, he told reporters in London after the IAAF's presentation.
The CzechTrade state contract was awarded to the company František Savov, whose state is prosecuting.
The public tender of the state pro-export agency CzechTrade was awarded to the publishing house Mladá fronta František Savov.
Officials awarded him a hundred percent of the points in all qualitative criteria.
They did not mind the Czech state prosecuting Savov for tax fraud and asking for his extradition to the Czech Republic.
The pro-export agency of the Ministry of Industry and Trade CzechTrade launched a public contract in April for the four-year provision of editorial content for the BusinessInfo portal.
The contract, worth a total of CZK 30.8 million, was awarded to the publishing house Mladá fronta of entrepreneur František Savov.
He was accused by Czech police in 2014 of tax evasion and is being prosecuted on the run.
Savov fled to the UK and the Czech Republic is requesting his extradition.
The case was brought to the attention of Aktuálně.cz.
According to the original criteria, the award of the contract was to be decided by the 60 percent offered price and the remaining 40 beauty contest, i.e. the quality of the project, according to the original criteria.
It was Savov's company that was helped significantly by the latter criterion.
According to information from Dotyk.cz, she received one hundred points in all partial quality criteria.
This is what the result pushed her in front of another candidate, the Vltava Labe publishing house, the Elzech Media VLM, which offered a better price.
While Mladá fronta operated with an amount of CZK 404,900 per month, VLM offered CZK 324,350.
Unlike the Young Front, however, it received a below-average rating from the assessors in all qualitative criteria, with a total of 62 points.
The tender was also attended by consultant company BDO Advisory and the digital agency R-Media, which, like Aktuálně.cz, falls under the publisher Economia.
VLM issued several objections to the tender result, saying that its evaluation considered the evaluation not to be unfair and insufficiently justified.
After their rejection, it decided to challenge the competition with the Office for the Protection of Competition of the Office of the Office for the Protection of Competition.
He believes that CzechTrade acted in violation of the law.
"The promoter is convinced that the contracting authority has reached a decision on the selection of the contractor of the public contract on the basis of a purely subjective evaluation, the unequivocally the favoured participant Mladá fronta, a.s., to the detriment of the petitioner and other suppliers," reads the application to initiate the procedure filed at the OHS this week, which was published by the news server Aktuálně.
According to the CEO and Chairman of the Board of Directors of the VLM, Michal Klíma, the scoring of the selection committee appears to be an implausible and 100% evaluation of the Young Front project for all of its members as extremely suspicious.
"Any independent observer must consider such a miraculous success of one of the competitors to be improbable and suspicious," Klíma told Aktuálně.
CzechTrade has not yet commented on the situation.
The CzechTrade news agency does not comment on public contracts before they are closed.
All information about the contract you mentioned is published in accordance with the Act in the Profile of the contracting authority and in the Public Procurement Bulletin.
"A complete written report will be published after the contract is terminated, but we cannot comment on its progress during the duration of the contract," the agency's media representative, Štěpán Dlouhý, told Dotyk.cz.
The young front responded by saying that it considers it extremely problematic that the publisher Economia intervened with an article in Aktuálně.cz in a competition where it has its own business interests.
However, this was stated in that article.
The tender may have been helped by the fact that it was the one that provided editorial services to the BusinessInfo portal in the previous four years.
The contract was first tendered in 2013, when the Ministry of Industry and Trade was led by Martim Kuba ODS.
František Savov is blamed by the police for tax evasion in connection with excessive VAT deductions for his companies, which caused the Czech state to damage up to 770 million crowns.
The Czech Republic has been asking the UK for its release since 2014.
According to Savov, the head of the ANO movement, Andrej Babiš, whose influence falls to the publishing house Mafra, is behind his criminalization.
A London court last year rejected Savov's appeal against the extradition, but appealed to the businessman.
"From our point of view, the case has not moved anywhere since last year, we have not received any notification from the UK in the matter of the legal force of the judgment to this day," Štěpánka Zenklová, spokesperson for the Prague City Prosecutor's Office, told Aktuálně.cz.
In addition to owning Mladá fronta, Savov was in the Cyprus-based company Harvestor Limited, which was controlled by the Samson brewery in České Budějovice, and the Cypriot company Maraflex, which is profiled as an investment fund, buying at-risk assets.
He should also control the bankrupt company Heavy Machinery Services, formerly Legios, which owes over three billion crowns.
In the past, Savov was also associated with the escalation of assets from the former Socialist Youth League.
The biker drove along the sidewalks and the park, ending up in somersaults.
The biker attracted attention by reckless driving around the streets, sidewalks and park paths in Úšovice.
When the patrol began to pursue him, he decided to outrun her in the direction of the Station.
"Police officers chased the man with increased caution with caution when he failed to drive on one of the secondary routes behind Mariánské Lázně and drove his motorcycle into the field where he crashed," police spokesman Daniel Dvořák said.
In the end, a rescue helicopter had to arrive at the accident, transporting the injured biker to the Pilsen hospital.
Eventually, officers determined that the biker did not own a driver's license, the registration plates on the motorcycle had been stolen, his serial number had been honed, and the actual production label had been removed.
It's possible the machine was stolen.
The origin of the motorcycle is subject to further investigation.
"The breath test performed by the driver was excluded at the scene of the presence of alcohol, but a positive result was found for the substance methamphetamine by the test," the police spokesperson added.
How football's financial rules will affect Neymar's move to Paris
The rules restricting the funding of European football clubs will not interfere with Neymar's record-breaking transfer from Barcelona, Spain, to Paris-Saint Germain, France.
Any penalty for Paris Saint-Germain will be implemented by the EUFA, which oversees European football teams and has the authority to ban teams from participating in the prestigious Champions League.
The Financial Fair Play (FFP) rules , introduced by UEFA in 2011 stipend that PSG will have to prove that Neymar's transfer was not financed without major losses.
Barcelona paid a sum of EUR 222 million alone to buy Neymar out of his contract and Neymar will claim a salary of several tens of millions of dollars a year.
Several financial terms of the Neymar's transfer to France follow.
With the PSG team being funded by a wealthy Qatari family to make a fortune in energy sales, it can afford to bring Neymar to an already star football family.
Clubs can spend huge sums to buy players, but on the other hand, they have to prove legal sources of income, allowing them to cover the overheads of the football-related business.
The FFP was introduced by Michel Platini after being reinstated as UEFA Director in 2007.
The former French player believed that clubs that are in debt in the hunt for new reinforcements are ultimately chewing and risking bankruptcy if the banks or the owners refuse to secure them.
In 2011, the FFP redirected its attention from club debts to monitoring their losses.
This change meant that the business model used by Roman Abramovich with Chelsea in 2003 - to buy a club with the potential and spend the hefty sums on the y players to build a global brand - was suddenly not so advantageous.
Under the current three-year trial period, which will end in 2018, clubs may show a loss of up to EUR 30 million.
And despite Platini's due out of office in 2015, his successor, Aleksander Cheferin, is committed to defending the ban on over-spending.
"The FFP rules are still in place and we are determined to strengthen them in the future," Andrea Traverso, who oversees compliance with the FFP rules, told the Associated Press last week.
Although PSG paid the amount for the redemption of Neymar in a one-off payment, it can spread the amount for the purposes of the accounts over the entire duration of the contract.
Neymar has signed a five-year contract so that the transfer can be broken down to €44.4 million each year for five years.
The first wave of the FFP's highest sanctions was hit by PSG in 2014, along with Manchester City, which is owned by the Abu Dhabi group.
PSG took a fine of EUR 60 million ($82 million) - which was later reduced to EUR 20 million - and a order to reduce the Champions League team to 21 players in the 2014-2015 season, instead of 25 players.
UEFA is wary of teams that can try to circumvent financial regulators by increasing their income through companies associated with club owners.
Thus, even if the Qatari company sponsors PSG, once the funding exceeds the value of the standard market rate, UEFA has the right to prohibit the bill of sum.
A similar measure was taken by UEFA in 2014 after deciding that the level of funding provided by the PSG Qatar Tourism Authority to the PSG team.
Part of the non-Grea's income in PSG could be reimbursed from the World Cup 2022 World Cup Organising Commission in Qatar, according to some reports.
However, PSG and the leaders of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar have denied the fat that Neymat should become an ambassador for the World Cup in football and that such a maneuver would be easily exposed by UEFY officials.
Previous sanctions imposed on PSG mean that UEFA will closely monitor any attempt to circumvent the rules,
According to the insider-at-ateners on Tuesday, UEFA did not launch any investigation into the transfer of Neymar to the PSG.
The source of the report wished to remain anonymous as it is not entitled to comment on the situation with PSG, The Associated Press reported.
The latest published accounts show that PSG closed 2015-2016 with a net profit of EUR 10 million and a turnover of EUR 542.4 million.
The accounts for the current financial year have not yet been made public.
PSG expects the arrival of Neymar to be a huge opportunity for sponsors, merchandising and jersey sales.
The club expects to increase its turnover by up to 30 percent from the signing of the contract.
Representatives of the Spanish league, clearly alarmed by the departure of one of the biggest stars, sought to thwart Neyarro's departure, arguing that PSG would break the FFP rules.
"This is a clear case of 'financial doping' for both the club and the state,' said the president of the la Liga, Javier Teba, for the Spanish newspaper AS, referring to the ownership of the PSG club by the Qatari syndicate.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, whose club is owned by the American sports tycoon, shares the same La Liga position on the club's funding.
"This is a consequence of ownership that has changed the football world from the ground up in the last 15 years," Wenger said on Thursday.
"As soon as the state becomes the owner of the club, anything is possible.
Compliance with the rules of financial fair fair is very difficult as the state can have different interests in the participation of such players in its club."
Spartans midfielder Rosicky: The changes are painful, but we have to believe.
Sixteen thousand applauding fans on their feet.
Tomáš Rosický is going to the set.
The same sketch as in Sunday's match against Bohemians.
The Spartans midfielder stirred up the game against Cricket, inventing several goals, but his teammates did not aim for the black.
The Letenský team, piled up with new multimillion-dollar reinforcements, thus outsuits after the opening double-header in the European Cup.
Was it hard to do anything else with the game after Belgrade's goal?
After the rebound, four had to be scored, which was difficult for us.
We wanted to at least not lose, to boost our confidence to have something to bounce back from the next few games.
We had some chances.
We have to work together as a team and move up our game.
Why didn't Sparta get into the match for so long?
The game is so worked out.
The combination of the opponent was much better than ours.
We didn't get to anything, we shot at half-time maybe once.
That's an awful lot of it, of course, if you have to win by two or three goals.
The second half was much better, we managed to play with them in the final third.
But you have to push your opponent into positions like this more often.
Is the problem a large number of changes in the line-up?
Of course, it's one of the pains when a new team is formed.
We only played three competitive matches and the line-up is constantly changing.
It's about the coach finding the ideal eleven to sit down.
Is it a boost to you that you've already played two matches in a row?
They're still just parts of the match.
I don't know how my condition will evolve and when I can play from the beginning.
Are you still optimistic about the changes that have taken place in Sparta?
We have to be, or we can't.
It's the same as an injury.
If you don't believe, you can't come back.
Sparta made a decision somehow, we have to be optimistic, otherwise the situation will be even worse.
The fans came back in great numbers, but they were leaving in embarrassment.
What can you say to them?
There was an amazing visit again, as well as with Bohemia.
I'm terribly sorry we can't make them happy with a better performance.
To do something to come next.
We can thank them for coming.
I don't remember such visits when I played here 15 years ago.
Can a season without cups at least be an advantage for the league?
We're still fighting ourselves, we're playing, so it's not that much of an advantage for us.
For an extreme tax evasion, the entrepreneur is to serve ten years.
The Constitutional Court rejected the complaint of businessman Jiří Toman, who is to serve ten years in prison for tax evasion to a significant extent.
The damage estimated amounts to CZK 645 million.
Toman claimed in the complaint that the judiciary had violated his fundamental rights, the factual findings of the courts in Zlín and Olomouc were said to be incomplete.
However, the Constitutional Courts called the complaint unfounded, the Czech News Agency found from the court's database.
The CPS is not another appeals court.
"It cannot, as a fourth instance, assesses as legal errors allegedly committed by the ordinary courts if they do not constitute a breach of constitutionally protected rights and freedoms," the order reads.
Toman was tried as a fugitive.
The verdict has been final since November 2015, when it was upheld by the High Court in Olomouc.
At the time, Toman was in extradition custody in Argentina, where, according to the resolution, he was also in the decision-making process.
The sentence imposed is at the upper limit of the statutory rate, which according to the verdict corresponds to the damage suffered.
The High Court has described the case as an extreme tax evasion that has a macroeconomic impact on the state budget.
The man served as Chairman of the Board of Directors of World Servis from 2005 to 2008.
The amount of the CZK 645 million was incurred for the period from January to July 2008 alone, with the total leak being the expert, according to the expert.
For procedural reasons, however, it was no longer possible to judge Toman for the full amount.
According to the indictment, World Service did not include all invoices in its tax returns.
Instead of monthly VAT and excise duties, it paid at least tens of millions of crowns in taxes in just the hundreds of thousands.
World Service and some of the companies with which the company traded relate to businessman Radomír Vybíral, who was fined 13 years in prison by the judiciary for VAT machinations in fuel deals.
His complaint was also rejected by the Constitutional Court some time ago.
The series "Loner to Failure to Failure" and "Comrade Detective" play a nostalgic chord
This iteration of the story is nostalgic for both the characters from the famous 1980s; and for the filthy '90s (when the geniuses David Wain and Michael Showalter introduced the comedy sketch "The State" on MTV); and, of course, for the modern age, namely 2001, rather than stars like Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd scattered to bigger projects.
As a cultural artifact, it is a light parody and, at the same time, the embodiment of our modern Facebook era of permanent memories.
From the point of view of the franchise, however, it seems that someone is running out of breath.
The series "First Day of Camp" worked surprisingly well - not just because of the absurd humour (an example, the story of the creation of a talking can of vegetable can voiced by H. Jon Benjamin).
The authors have moved away from the main hilarious punchline - middle-aged actors playing horny children - so they couldn't make fun of previous events.
The sequel to "Ten Years Later" in which adults play adults do not push so much to the emotional plane, and satire is sporadic in places, including a parody of the '90s thrillers as "The Colon's Download."
At one point, the character finds Apple Powerbook, a roller skating pairing and "a lot of other things from 1991" in a pile of junk.
Many of the main storylines are repeated.
The good-hearted Coop (Mr. Showalter), now a writer, has still not translated over his love for Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) is still a virgin.
Not to mention the insane plot that involves Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter), which is being encouraged by George H. W. Bush (very well-casted Michael Ian Black).
As always, many side stories are the best part of the franchise.
It is particularly amusing to watch the perpetually young Rudd with long hair, aka the character of Matt Dillon from the film Youth, whose once-spectable Andy character is now behind the old pepper.
The Franchise could be started by moments of chance madness, like the returning "Seven Up" series, until it reaches what I assume will be the logical denouement: "Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Years Later," when in the final scene the whole group embarks on the premiere of "The Summer to Failure to Fever."
Meanwhile, "Comrade Detective" appeals to another type of nostalgia on Amazon: the Cold War revivalism of "Such Normal Americans," "Atomic Blonde: No Pity" and even the series "GLOW" in which icons of the Eastern and Western Wrestling Scene meet.
The comedy by the creators of Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanak, directed by Rhys Thomas, is intended to feature a television production: a drama about two Bucharest policemen from Romania of the 1980s who fight for truth and atheism in the manner of Marxism-Leninism.
The roles - the tenacious Gregor and the idealistic Iosfola - are starring Florin Piersic Jr. and Cornelius The Street, which were dubbed into the English language of the Channing Tatum (performing producer of the series) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
It's a wonderful idea.
Unfortunately, that's not much more than that.
For some jokes, you laugh (like policemen watching chess on TV - a parody of American football).
The series was lent its voice to many well-known actors - among them Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny.
But "Comrade Detective" is too focused on the awkward propaganda drama - which includes a Reagan mask killer - and that's what it looks like.
Six long episodes are too long-winded, and comedy moments aren't enough.
With a shorter track, the propaganda satire in "Comrade Detective" could work, such as in the scene where Gregor and Iosef repeatedly visit the US Embassy, in whose hall two fat men gulp hamburgers stacked in a large pile.
A clear message for the imaginary communist audience is the fact that Western culture can turn everything into food and orgies.
The Romanian creators were not mistaken: we do so with our own culture, as well as with theirs.
Russian athletes were not in the logging ban on the IAAF.
At a congress in London, the IAAF International Athletics Federation confirmed an extension of the international ban on Russian athletes' starts due to a state-sponsored doping program.
Voting at the venue of the world championship, which will start on Friday, turned out very unequivocally, as expected.
There were 166 delegates in favour of extending the ban, with only 21 votes against.
The main reason for the rejection is primarily that Russia is failing to meet all the requirements for the introduction of the anti-doping system, as the head of the IAAAF Special Investigative Group, Rune Andersen, noted before the congress.
His group recommended that the ban should continue to take place.
Some of the older doping cases remain unresolved, with a number of female underdogs not yet interviewed, and coaches with a damaged reputation still work in the country.
The Russian Anti-Doping Agency RUSADA, which does not meet the standards of the World Anti-Doping Agency, is still fully operational.
Nevertheless, RUSADA can already carry out testing under the supervision of foreign experts and the British Anti-Doping Agency.
"Even though there has been progress, there is still a lot of work to be done," said IAAF chairman Sebastian Coe.
The Russian Athletics Federation was suspended in November 2015, with Russian athletes losing, among other things, to the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro last year.
Despite the ban on the upcoming World Championships, 19 Russians will participate in the upcoming World Championships, having previously proved to have been tested outside of the Russian anti-doping system for a long time.
However, they will not be able to start in the national colours in the Championship and will not play in the Russian anthem in the event of victory.
Bank of England to hold interest rate at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce that the interest rate will remain unchanged, followed by unimpressive economic growth and a weakening of inflation, which has choked speculation about a sharp rise.
England Bank has warned that economic growth will remain "under the back" in the context of maintaining the interest rate - despite the squeezing of family budgets.
Political figures in the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the England Bank voted six to two to maintain the interest rate at 0.25%. The vote's results for the interest rate increase supported the lacklustre economic growth, underpinned by a weak rise.
In its annual inflation report, the Bank forecasted growth to 1.7% in 2017 and 1.6% in 2018, and warned that family budget cuts would continue. The Bank expects inflation to rise to 3% in the autumn.
At the same time, the Bank indicated that growth should be increased over the next few years as a result of Brexit-induced inflation and also said that rents from movability should increase in financial markets more than expected.
Members of the committee also voted to withdraw part of the mammoth package to boost the economy, which was put into practice a year ago in response to Brexit.
As a result of the above, the Furing-Fund Plan, which will offer cheap subsidies to banks, should start to apply from next February, although the Bank of England said it would now offer £15 billion less than the planned £115 billion.
Just before the decision, the bank said: "the MMPC predicts that gross domestic product (GDP) will stagnate in the short term, along with pressure on real household incomes and a burden on consumption."
On the rate, the Bank said it would be necessary to "turvy your money policy belt" to calm inflation, and this is "at a higher rate" than expected by the markets.
Markets are currently forecasting their first increase in the third quarter of next year and a further increase in 2020.
However, the Bank stressed that any increase would be "free" and "restricted."
The Bank's growth forecast for this year and the next year has been down compared to 1.9% and 1.7% predicted in May.
The projected growth of 1.8% in 2018 remained unchanged.
Following the disclosure of estimates, the pound fell against the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell by 0.5% to $1.31 and to €1.11.
The decision to maintain the status quo came after a disappointing increase buried hopes for further growth - GDP stopped at 0.3% in the second quarter, compared to 0.2% from the previous three months.
The increase is likely to remain at 0.3% in the third quarter, although the Bank said it would increase slightly towards the end of the year.
The latest report on inflation is a slight comfort in households hit by rising inflation and a lousy pay rise. The Bank said the situation would get worse before the increase.
The report further states that the monetary policy "cannot prevent" revenue cuts in the coming years, but wages are expected to rise "significantly" towards the end of the three-year forecast.
Economics should also rise because of the great interest in British goods due to the weak pound, which will offset a lower percentage of consumer spending.
This decision came a year after rates were cut to 0.025% in late August last year in response to the shocking vote on the EU's shocking referendum, causing the pound to fall.
The Bank estimates that the full unification of prices and the economy will take at least four years.
Prior to the bank's decision on the latest rates, many demanded a rise in rates, along with rising inflation, which was exerting increasing pressure on households. Three policymakers demanded an increase to 0.5% in June.
Inflation fell back to 2.6% last month from 2.9% in June, even though the Bank said it had expected such a change and inflation should rise again over the next month.
The Bank stated that the excess of the relative to 2 % target was "quite" due to the weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: "Given the recent crash of swap rates, it looks like the competition in the mortgage market will only rise as soon as creditors start competing for orders to look at a good outlook towards the end of the year.
The market looks particularly good for those who end up with existing contracts and mortgages - there are no-fee options on offer, as are the low rates that are becoming popular."
NHS prescribes controversial HIV drug to 10,000 patients
Patients will receive access to 'transformative' treatment to HIV prevention from September on the basis of a Supreme Court's decision to fund the NHS drug.
The English National Health Service (NSH) reported that the pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) pill, which is used before sex and reduces the risk of infection in high-risk patients by up to 86 percent, will be offered via the health service to approximately 10,000 patients in the three-year trial period.
The NSH agreed to finance the probationary period after the appeals court supported the Supreme Court's decision last year to say that the NHS had the funds to pay for PrEP despite the statement that the medicine should be funded by the local authorities.
The decision, announced on Thursday, was taken by the NHS of England from the mouths of Director-General Simon Stevens as a 'significant intervention', while the National Aids Trust (NAT) described the decision as a 'decisive moment'.
The Sexual Health Clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to start admitting patients. Other clinics will join in October and by April 2018 there will be a full implementation across England.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is an HIV drug taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV.
Tests showed that PrEP significantly reduces the risk of HIV transmission between patients at risk.
The pre-sex exercise PrEP means that there are a sufficient number of specific drugs in the patient's body to prevent the infection.
These medicines can be taken every day or at least two hours before sex.
Patients tested include homosexual or bisexual men, transgender people and people with HIV-positive partners who are unsuccessful.
Clinics will designate eligible participants who sign up to agree to participate in the testing, including men, women, transgender people and individuals with a partner whose HIV status is not yet controlled by appropriate treatment.
People living and registered with the GP in the UK can also sign up at their local sexual health clinic to apply for potential participation in the testing.
The program will cost the taxpayer £10 million, and the NHS of England signed a contract this week to distribute the drugs following the acquisition of an international public contract.
The test period is proposed to gather clinical evidence and assess the full potential of PrEP, its targeting, use and implementation on a large scale.
Simon Stevens added: 'This important intervention should be replenished and fully occupied by the ever-expanding and increasingly successful attempt to prevent HIV.
It is another milestone in a more than 30-year effort to halt one of the greatest challenges to human health.'
Deborah Gold, Executive Director of NAT (National Aids Trust) said: 'We are witnessing a decisive moment in the fight against HIV.
If PrEP is administered correctly and at risk to patients, it will offer the possibility of transforming the English HIV epidemic.
The NSH will offer patients at high risk of HIV infection with a new powerful tool that is individually controlled and not subject to the need to coax the partner from September, leading to improvements in the quality of many lives.
We accept this statement with pleasure.'
Ian Green, managing director of Terrence Higgins Trust said: 'The number one priority must be the rapid deployment of tests across the country; we must ensure that it is made available to each patient.
We now have a PrEP test drug at our disposal and are well on our way to protecting more than 10,000 people at risk of being infected with HIV.'
Shadow Health Minister Sharon Hodgson said: 'The start of the pre-court trial period of the PrEP is a welcome and long-awaited change after months of delays and delays by the government.
Evidence suggests how transformative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and endangering the transmission of this life-threatening infection.
The subsequent tests will take us one step closer to a full understanding of the benefits of PrEP.
It is now important that we start the tests as soon as possible throughout the country, protecting those who are exposed to HIV and together to put an end to the spread of HIV in society.'
A high life: mezzanine and clever design turned this little apartment into a spacious home
Joanne Leigh, a former real estate passionate banker, traded a large house in Knightsbridge for an apartment on Earls Cour in 2014.
Located on the first floor, the Queen Anne's smart terrace is a graphic illustration of the modern design that makes the most available space available.
"I lived with my ex-husband in a much larger house in the Knightsbridge district," Joanne said.
"I was looking for something of a more reasonable price.
I came across this apartment in Earls Court and it had the same ceiling height.
I fell in love with him right away, and I nodded to him the same day."
Since then, the 1,000-square-metre apartment has undergone a complete renovation.
One-room apartment with a complicated layout - to get into the bedroom, you had to go through the kitchen - Joanne wanted to add a storage space and a mezzanine to use the high ceiling.
"I've been hitting on high ceiling, big windows, and a lot of light.
Those were my demands,' she said.
To this end, it employed Erfan Azadi from the design and design studio Duck & Shed, based in Notting Hill, and used the nearly four-metre ceiling to create a home that was not just a project but also a place to live.
The ceiling was not enough to reach the height of two gaps above each other - the challenge for the architects was to create an intermediate stage to walk upright on.
Erfan had to engage in his creative thinking.
"The steel structure is quite complicated," he explained.
"We had to organize both spaces so we could walk upright.
It was not only about building a simple platform, but at the same time bending the steel structure to correctly above and below the ceiling."
This arrangement allowed Erfan to design two full rooms on himself - while adding to the drama.
On the mezzanine, he looks down on the gorgeous living room of the old copper window frames in the design of Retrouvius.
Mirror furniture in gold, silver lines and retro chandelier by Serge Mouille creates a unique style.
The use of mirrors plays an important role in the drama, space and lighting.
The short corridor is fitted with mirrors on both sides and looks so longer.
The kitchen milling bar looks like a window to the next room.
At the front door there are storage areas equipped with mirrors to store cutlery and glasses.
The advantage of the living room, which gives the whole apartment the impression of significantly more space, is the possibility to separate it from the kitchen if it is not used.
The folding kitchens are nothing new.
What is unique about this solution, however, is a folding door.
"We had to sort out the technical side," Erfan says of the reinforced veneered doors.
"The children are provided with a counter-suit to be shovelled off very easily."
Thanks to its clever use of the space and storage space, Joanne gained an additional 16 square metres, a second room and a better overall layout of the apartment.
"When it comes to it, what you're selling is a living area - or awards of your property," Erfan said.
"A real estate agent basically counts the price when he enters the apartment, he estimates his price on the basis of the living area."
In this case, the living area has been increased while preserving the quality materials that lend the space a luxurious look.
"The material is very important because you touch it and create an emotional bond with home," Erfan added.
"You don't have the power lines in the walls.
Yes, they are important, but they will not win your hearts.'
As it turned out, a high-quality design and increase of the living space can turn an ordinary apartment into an exceptional work.
And like Joanne, you can eventually decide to stay.
The United States is disconnecting.
The cultural and political divide between the blue and red states is deepening.
California has announced a ban on the travel of its citizens to the state of Tennessee and seven other states.
The state of Tennessee returned the return and declared a retaliatory ban on its citizens' travel to California.
Of course, this is not a ban in the full sense of the word, US citizens can travel freely in all 50 states.
The point is that California has forbidden to spend state money on the travel of its citizens to eight other states, namely Alabama, South Dakota, Kansas, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, Tennessee and Texas.
Who will stop the madness?
California strongly opines for the LGBT, and considers any sign of opposition to the LGBT lifestyle to be discrimination.
However, Tennessee has adopted the Conscience Reinforcement Act, according to which a psychotherapist who has a moral problem with the therapy of patients from the LGBT community is under no obligation to provide them with it, but he has a duty to provide these patients with another therapist who does not have a problem.
Texas and other nations have passed laws under which religious charities that have been given to their mothers for adoption by religious charities who have been given to their mothers for adoption are under no obligation to provide these children to same-sex coupes for adoption.
Because of these conscience reservation laws, California banned funding for its citizens' travel to eight states from its funds.
In practice, this means that California professors must not have travel to scientific symposia in Texas, for example, reimbursed from their universities because they are co-financed by the state of California.
Similarly, school sports teams cannot travel to tournaments or competitions to, for example, Tennessee with the financial support of their schools.
They must either receive federal grants for the travel, but it is absurd for the federal government to finance the travel of citizens from the state A to the state of B, or private sponsorship.
The state of Tennessee ran out of patience, and its parliament passed a law with a resolution that it also dislikes California's high-ranking policies of high taxes, high state spending, high deficits, and tolerance for illegal immigrants, but still not imposing a travel embargo on California because of it.
He's in retaliation for the California travel embargo on Tennessee.
And the same will happen to any state of the Union that would impose a similar travel ban on a different state for any reason.
At the same time, he called on the parliaments of all states to stop this madness.
That's the facts, the commentary.
The situation is toxic.
First, all of this is constitutional, nothing is unconstitutional.
States have the right to adopt laws on the conscience's reservation, as well as to decide what their money will go to and what they are not allowed to.
Second, what's wrong with a conscience advocacy?
If the butcher has a religious problem selling pork, why can't he only offer beef, lamb, poultry and fish?
Why, on penalty of punishment, force him to sell pork when there are enough butchers offering pork?
In the state of Colorado, a baker faces an anti-discrimination lawsuit and a heavy fine for refusing to bake a cake for a gay wedding.
But he also refuses to bake Halloween cakes or containing alcohol.
Why not punish him and leave him alone and not order the appropriate cakes from the hundreds of bakers of the others?
Third, the beauty of the federal system is that the constitutional rights of all the citizens of the federation are guaranteed, but individual states can adjust the internal, domestic policy in non-federal powers according to their own, i.e. according to the preferences of their populations.
Then there are the diversity, the diversity, the diversity.
California can be California, and Texas can be Texas.
But California wants California to be California and Texas, and seven other states to be California, too!
Fourth, members of the LGBT community once rightly sought to tolerate their lifestyle.
Today, many members of this community follow the rule of live and let live, which should be governed by all reasonable people, but some activists seek not tolerance for themselves and others, but for extreme intolerance towards others.
According to them, no one must ever show moral, religious, or philosophical disapproval of the LGBT lifestyle, and is to be criminalized if they do so.
The mentality of these activists is totalitarian.
They are modern enemies of freedom.
Fifth, I don't know the situation in American history, when states have made such a joke about political issues, except for the case.
Even in the days of the civil rights struggle for blacks, where the North and the West were on the side of integration and the South on the side of segregation, the states did not impose sanctions on themselves.
The only case was the 1950s, the political caucus was slavery, and the North-South War was about to take place.
Of course, there will be no such thing now, but the situation is still toxic.
The cultural and political divide between the states of the blue Democratic and the red Republican states is deepening, and the US is mentally disconnecting internally.
Unauthorized agitation.
A critic of Putin was fined.
Russian opposition politician Alexei Navalny has been fined 300,000 rubles for violating the campaign rules ahead of next year.
The court fined him for urging people to participate in the unauthorised demonstrations.
Navalny has organised two major anti-government street protests in the last two months and announced that he wants to run for the post of head of state in March next year.
The incumbent Kremlin chief, Vladimir Putin, has not yet announced his candidacy, but he is widely expected to do so and win again.
Navalny said the police came to his house this morning and took him to the court.
He fined him for urging people to demonstrate through videos posted on the online YouTube portal.
The fine is three hundred thousand.
"Later, we'll pull them off the judge's salary," the Kremlin critic joked in a Twitter post.
The Russian Electoral Commission recently concluded that Navalny could not participate in the presidential election because he was previously convicted of embezzlement.
Navalny, who is considered a fighter against corruption, considers the relevant judgment to be politically motivated.
Fines of 300,000 rubles, or 25,000 roubles, were also imposed by the court on Thursday on Thursday by the court onwards on two members of the Navalny pre-election team, Leonid Volkov and Nikolai Ljaskin.
Navalny entered Russian politics as an anti-corruption blogger and gradually became the dominant figure on the fragmented opposition scene.
The authorities are trying to prevent Navalny from the campaign in every way.
In February, he was sentenced to a five-year suspended sentence for robbing the Kirovles forestry business.
In May, the verdict was upheld by the Court of Appeal.
The verdict is thus final, which prevents Navalny from running under Russian law.
Brothers fight for an empire worth over $500 million
The two brothers are now, more than four decades after the founding of the empire, to their Italian family, to a tug-of-war over one of the most expensive Victorian properties worth more than $500 million.
Former Carlton Football Club and developer Colin De Lutis reside in Toorak, only three rooms from his younger brother Paul, who made up for the dispute over the joint property and business fortune to the supreme court.
Paul wanted to leave the family business as early as 2014, but the fierce dispute is constantly being scored off in the supreme court.
He and his mother, Anna, own the brothers own a total of 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars. The first store was purchased by the family in 1973 on Smith Street in Collingwood.
At this point, the family founded the Westco Jeans company, which grew into a chain with 160 stone shops.
In 1999, the family sold the entire company for $85 million.
Other properties were purchased for the money, and the De Lutis family's portfolio now includes offices, construction land in Brunswick and Sorrento, apartments on the Gold Coast and Mt Buller and shopping centers in the suburbs.
Paul owns about one-third of the company's assets, while his father, Colin, who, in Paul's words, is a "significant driving force and dominant figure" of the De Lutis family, owns less than two-thirds of the assets.
The court's writings state that Colin owns $316 million worth of real estate, while Paul manages $176 million worth of real estate.
It was the division of property and funds that became a problem for Paul.
"Colina's proposal has come out in his or her own eyes in his favour," Paul wrote in an affidavit at the 2015 court.
Last Friday, after several unsuccessful attempts at conciliation, the first meeting of the Supreme Court took place.
The brothers are now also competing to see who will control the existing business - from which he claims Colin cut off.
Colin contradicts the fact that this is not true and accuses Paul of misdirection of certain properties.
In a previous affidavit, Colin said he believed in a successful resolution of the conflict.
"My Italian origin dictates that family is the most important thing of all," he wrote.
The cost of court appearance is rising. Hundreds of affidavits, e-mails and reports from companies, including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, are flooding attorneys, including Allan Myers, QC and defense attorneys.
Mrs. De Lutis and her late husband, Luigi, were Italian immigrants who ran dairy bars and delicacies since the 1950s and bought a shop in Brunswick in the 1970s.
With the money raised by building the property, they bought a property in Collingwood, where Colin opened the first family jeans business.
Colin said that when he founded Westco "in his senior year of college, Paul was still a little, about 10-year-old boy."
Anna De Lutis said that he and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped the transfer of property to the sons would take place in a good way.
"Luigi often used to say he never wanted his sons to end up in court," she wrote.
The other two brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis family group. Colin said that Mark was compensated for $10 million and Luke for $26 million in his departure.
As Paul put it, both Luke and Mark "did not be satisfied with the terms of their financial compensation."
Colin has been holding back ever since, despite the fact that he is a former member of the board of AFL, as Eddie McGuire, a well-known TV personality and best friend, Colin, said in his 2015 autobiography.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul de Lutis and their lawyers on Friday.
He replied only to Colin via a text message in which he stated that, given the fact that the case was settled in court, "I have nothing to add."
"It is very sad that my brother Paul has decided to deal with the matter in court," he wrote.
In mid-2016, in a statement in court, Colin said he had tried to adapt to his brother's demands.
"Our father would be very dissatisfied if he saw our current situation," he said, adding that he was "still hoping for a successful solution."
On Friday, all hopes were in the offing.
"Our disputes will be resolved by court hearings soon," Colin wrote.
The heat in the Czech Republic.
Teachers shower children.
Public transport drivers are getting water and summer clothes.
At the Nursery School Na Chodovci in Prague 4, where about 35 children now attend, they only go out in the morning.
The nursery is renovated after reconstruction and the planted trees do not yet provide a large shade.
There's no swimming pool, but the teachers shower kids in the fog.
In the afternoon, the children stay in the classrooms where the blinds are drawn and the drapes are drawn.
The air is being cooled by the air purifier because they don't have air conditioning.
It is also challenging for female teachers and cooks.
"The temperature, which is in the interior and exterior, exceeds the hygienic limits for nursery schools, so we should not actually have an open operation during this period," said the director of the nursery, Miloslava Makovičková.
There is a glass corridor in the kindergarten, where it says the temperature is around 40 degrees.
We air out the morning after 6 a.m., the windows close, and we have the blinds on the south sides to protect ourselves.
"But it doesn't do much good," she added.
They have better conditions in the forest nursery Na Hráže v Hostivice, where children spend most of their time outdoors.
We have mature trees on the property, so we're underneath.
"We have a beautiful walnut tree, there's a table under it, and we do things there," said Barbora Kompanová, the director of the nursery.
The teachers try to go to the woods with their children, where it is more cool.
Kids wet with wet caps and have various games with water on the agenda.
"We have a hand-held pressure spray that's used for flower spraying, and we use it to shower babies," Kompanová said.
The director of a kindergarten in Novoborská Street in Prosek, Prague, Jitka Vilimovská, also said that the teachers try to keep the children in the shade and sprinkle them with water.
"We have a fairly mature garden, so they're under the trees," she said.
He goes out in the morning and then after the 3 p.m.
Every child must have a headdress.
Teachers also remind children that they should drink.
They can choose, for example, a little sweetened tea or a diluted juice and have a water tap in the garden.
They also have a vegetable salad for their meals every day and always have fresh fruit and vegetables for snacks, which is sometimes brought to them by their parents.
"Maybe today a mother brought about a ten-kilo melon for the children here," Makovičková added.
Drivers get water or summer uniforms.
The Prague transport company DPP provides them with water, ion drinks or summer uniforms on hot days.
The cabs of both tram and bus drivers are in most cases air-conditioned, DPP spokesperson Aneta Řehková said.
In addition to cabins, air-conditioned are some trams in the passenger compartment.
Tram tracks have not yet been seriously damaged by high temperatures.
Miner damage occurred in a loop in Hostivař.
At the current high temperatures, we are particularly careful to ensure that drivers have sufficient quantities of drinks at their disposal.
"The smooth drinking water is available in all loops, alternating points and depot houses," said Řehková.
In the depot and at some alternating points, employees have so-called sodobars, which produce cooled soda.
Drivers also receive soluble protective ion drinks.
"They can also use the summer uniform, which increases the comfort of drivers in their daily shifts," the spokesperson added.
The hot and dry weather of the last few days has resulted in an increased number of fires.
On Tuesday, firefighters in the whole of the Czech Republic disposed of 108, twice the long-term daily average.
On Tuesday, during the day, when temperatures in the Czech Republic climbed over 35 degrees Celsius, firefighters were mainly busy fighting the fire.
"Fires in the natural environment predominate and also those associated with the factory works," firefighter spokesperson Nicole Zaoralová said.
The relief was not brought to the firefighters by an evening change in the weather, with heat in a number of places replaced by storms and torrential rainfall.
In connection with the storms, firefighters were riding out to 236 interventions.
It was mainly about removing fallen trees and branches.
"They intervened the most in the Central Bohemian Region," Zaoralová continues.
But the help of firefighters was also needed in Stvolínky na Českolipsku, where they evacuated to safety over the storm 60 people from the children's camp.
Tropical temperatures also gave work to Prague rescuers.
On Tuesday and night on Wednesday, ambulances were riding out to a dozen cases of carbon monoxide poisoning from the caba.
People should therefore have their water heats checked, the rescuers warn.
Carbon monoxide is a colourless, odourless, colourless gas released during imperfect combustion.
Symptoms of poisoning include nausea, vomiting, headache and feeling faint.
In case of suspected poisoning, you need to leave the infested room.
Trump's new chief of staff plans to curb the president's media diet
Before him, many had tried, and always failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly actually can.
If so, he'll be the first.
Politico reported that the new chief of staff at the White House planned to limit President Trump's information flow - including coverage of the TV news - in the hope of keeping Trump afloat.
Here is a piece of the report by reporter Josh Dawsey:
"When the new White House chief of staff, John F. Kelly met with staff on his first day in his new job, outlining a key problem for Trump's White House to correct: incorrect information that comes to the president's hands.
Kelly told the staff that he had to personally approve all the information - whether on paper or a beer's word - because the President could make a better decision based on the right information."
Kelly's diagnosis actually makes sense, but many of his predecessors cut their teeth at checking up on Trump and his media presentation.
Trump's relationship with the media dates back several decades - and now, sitting in the White House, his habit of watching TV news is even stronger.
"If Trump was upset with honorary reports as a candidate, it was fitting to show him that a lot of other media were talking about him in a positive light, which was easier to convince," Sam Nunberg, a former campaign adviser, told Politico in February.
Tara Palmeri of Politico wrote at the time that "the key to keeping Trump's tweets in check - at least in the words of the six former campaign organizers - is to ensure that Trump regularly follows the media that sing praise him."
All right.
But the idea that Trump's tendency to post his views on Twitter has ever been "under-control" is ridiculous.
Perhaps these campaign organizers know something that others have no idea about - that Trump's tweets would be more outrageous if they were not controlled.
The tweets Trump never sent will very likely never be known.
If his employees managed to keep him in check at least several times, then their efforts were not in for nothing.
But no one has yet been able to regularly prevent Trump from raising controversial issues.
Part of the problem is that in the White House, which consists of rival factions, people regularly try to strengthen their agenda by subtracting Trump's materials - but may not be reliable - that support their view of the world.
In May, the Politico portal, which covered the issue, published a report on the tilt of advisers to submit dubious information to the head of state in May.
This is an example of such information from the pen of the reporter Shane Goldmacher:
"Current and former Trump officials say the president often reacts very angrily to negative media reports, especially reports of leaks, and he seeks to find their origins.
This situation occurred at the end of February when someone slipped the president a copy of an article from GotNews.com - the website of provocateur Charles C. Johnson - who accused Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh of being a 'source of many leaks' from the White House.
Regardless, Johnson was banished from Twitter forever for harassment; or that he did not substantiate his claim with any evidence; or that he had already published false accusations in the past and later dismissed them.
Trump read the article and started asking about Walsh."
Goldmacher added that then-chief of staff Reince Priebus and White House secretary Rob Porter "tried to implement the system to manage and dossiance of information that President Trump receives."
Would it work?
Kelly is now, three months later, trying to push for the same strategy.
He may turn out to be a more efficient manager than Priebus, but Trump's impulsiveness doesn't just fade, and his helpers still compete for power.
These immutable factors will certainly make Kelly's mission worse.
Tourists negotiate a ditch and return to the 'Millionaire's Quarter'
The few of the most affluent homeowners in West Midland, England, are once again embarking on a raid with determined tourists who are negotiating with the local authorities to re-granchise the field for their residences.
Tourists parked 20 caravans in a field of flourishing street in the town of Solihull, which is nicknamed the 'millionaire' district.'
Bride horses, children and an army of caravans, the tourists return after being banished in May. They were not afraid of the ditch that had been dug up at the scene under the authorities' orders to prevent their incursion.
The Tifles of the Sacred Grounds found gaps in defence and entered the field of caravans with unprotected gaps that served the journey.
Frequest residents of the district attacked the city's board of directors of Solihull, saying it was 'not capable of solving the problem'.
One of the residents who wished to remain anonymous said, 'They'd made the place up Monday night after they'd been moved to Bentley Heath Street, where they threw rocks at other people.
The Board of Directors should be ashamed of its inability to resolve the problem.
All the tourists had been moved to a different place and now they had returned.
More had arrived last night, and more are likely to arrive today.'
She added that: 'Birmingham's board of directors knew how to deal with this problem. He uses court orders to protect the parks.
I live on Streetsbrook and I don't intend to continue paying taxes until the board of trustees has settled with the tourists.'
Another anonymous resident said: 'It's ridiculous. Just the other day, we were following the last of the departing tourists, and now they're back.
And this time there are even more of them, and this time they brought the horses with them.'
The Solihull City Council press officer said: 'We are aware of the unauthorised stay on the property near Streetsbrobrook Road and, in cooperation with the local police, are taking the necessary legal steps to a successful resolution of the problem.
To gather as much evidence as possible, it is essential that as many locals as possible report any unsociable or unlawful conduct by the police at number 101.
This will give us the overall picture we'll deliver in court.'
The MEP's husband was hit by a car in Brussels.
He was brought in by a government special.
A government special brought the injured Róbert Zhitňanský to Bratislava on Wednesday after noon.
Two ambulances were waiting at the airport and he was under the constant control of Slovak doctors on board the plane.
The long-planned flight was without complications.
Róbert Žitňanský had a serious accident in Brussels earlier in the summer, according to TV JOJ.
He said he was hit by a car and has been in serious condition ever since.
After being transported to his homeland, he was transported to a specialist workplace of one of Bratislava's hospitals.
The economic analyst is the husband of the NOVA Slovak MEP Jana Žitňanská.
She would not comment on the incident.
The couple have three children together.
Italians clamp down on NGO rescue ships with immigrants on board
Italy has announced that it will avoid the arrival of NGO rescue ships arriving at the coast of Italy with immigrants from the Mediterranean if the NGO does not sign the new rules regulating their operations.
"If the NGO does not sign the new rules of conduct, it will be difficult for us to imagine that they could continue their operations," said Interior Minister Marco Minniti in an interview with Turin daily La Stampa.
Minniti's warning came a day after Italian authorities were seized by a German rescue organization named Jugend Rettet on suspicion of human trafficking, which has made it much easier for illegal immigration.
The rescue organisation, which is in its first year, declined to comment on the matter on the grounds of allegations by Italian state prosecutor Ambrogia Cartosiose.
"For us, the number one saving of human lives is and always will be the priority. We are therefore very sorry that we cannot currently operate in the rescue zones," the organization said in a social media statement.
"We can only comment on any of the current charges after gathering all the information and evaluating the situation."
Italian authorities have been tracking the Iuventa Jugend Rettet ship since October.
Her crew is suspected of transporting immigrants on the ship, handed over directly to them by human traffickers, repeatedly.
At least one meeting occurred, according to the applicant's file, only 1.3 yards from the coast of Libya. The conduct of the meeting was published by Italian media.
The crew of the ship is suspected of breaking the law and circumventing the Italian Coast Guard, which oversees the rescue operations in the area - of humanitarian enthusiasm, rather than anything else.
The Code of Conduct provides for the presence of an Italian police officer on board ships such as Iuventa to monitor activities.
Only three of the nine non-governmental non-profit organisations involved in the rescue operations have so far agreed to adhere to the Code: Save The Children, Malta's MOAS and the Spanish Pro-Activa Open Arms.
The latter said on Thursday that the new rules were not necessary but acceptable as they were not a "substantial change or obstacle" with regard to the rescue operations.
The adoption of the new code of conduct was also rejected by Doctors Without Borders (MSF), which is the Nobel Prize winner.
Minniti, meanwhile, has been quoted as saying that the sharp drop in immigrants in recent weeks, who are disembarking in Italy as part of rescue operations, suggests that efforts to strengthen patrols off the coast of Libya and cooperate with local mayors are bearing fruit.
"In recent days, we are beginning to see the light at the end of the tunnel," the minister said.
He also unveiled plans for further negotiations to be held this month with the mayors of Libya on the economic development initiative, as well as with representatives of Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving these countries in the hope of reaching Europe.
Shameny Mesarošová: Silicone and cellulite crawled from the jumpsuit!
The hot summer days are all the tolling to wear only the most necessary to cover up the most intimate parts.
Only Dominika Mesarošová makes it the opposite.
The afternoon meeting at the Prague Zoo, where the actors, presenters, singers and all those with dealing with TV Prima were swarming, she was swarming her little footwear in a mini-trap.
And all it took was a few common moves, and the model showed everyone her silicones, but also her bottom.
The overal had cut between the half a number of times, and it was so high that it had to be adjusted all the time.
The attention of the gentlemen and the photographers present was not so much a shortage of it.
Michelle Carter convicted of sending text messages urging Conrad Roy to commit suicide
The woman from Massachusets was sentenced to prison for a height of two years for inciting her friend to commit suicide by means of text messages and phone calls.
Michelle Carter, 20, will serve 15 months of her two-year sentence behind bars and then spend five years on parole.
Carter was convicted in June for the involuntary killing of Conrad Roy, who took his own life. July 2014.
Roy's father testified in court on Thursday, "The whole family is devastated.
My son was my best friend."
Carter was left free until a decision was made.
She faced up to 20 years in prison, but her lawyers argued that she and Roy had suffered from mental illness.
Dressed in red pants and a cream blouse, Carter stood in place at the verdict with tears in her eyes, clasped-down hands and eyes aimed at the ground.
"Her conduct has been killed by Conrad Roy," the prosecutor told the judge.
"She ended his life to relieve herself.
She could not accept her own responsibility," she said.
"She didn't feel any remorse."
But Carter's attorney said it was "unfortunate circumstances he deeply regretted."
Judge Lawrence Moniz added that "his age or level of maturity or even mental disorder do not have a significant impact on its actions."
The applicant read out a statement by Roy's mother, Lynn Roy, "It will not happen on a single day to avoid squirming the loss of my son.
I want him to be proud of me - I take care of his sisters and together we will endure the immense pain that we will carry with us forever," the statement said.
Roy's sister, Camdyn Roy, testified that she was "followed" by the knowledge that she would never attend her brother's wedding and never be his children's aunt.
"The loss of the person I've seen since I was born is the pain I'll carry with me for life," she said.
The state of Massachusetts does not have a valid law that penalises a person who facilitates the suicide of another. This case therefore sets a legal precedent.
Carter was 17 when Roy was found in the car seat in 2014 poisoned with carbon dioxide.
The case drew the attention of the nation after the release of Carter's text messages that instigated suicide.
"You're hanging out of the building or stabbing, I don't care," read the text messages Carter had sent just two weeks before his death while Roy was on a family vacation.
A few minutes before she was a suicide, she wrote to him, "You have to do it, Conrade," and "you just get the generator and you'll be single and happy."
Judge Moniz said that Carter yearned for attention through Roy's death and ordered her to refrain from making any comments in the press.
The case raised many questions.
One of the people who sided with Carter was Amanda Knox, who was convicted of the murder of her British roommate in Italy in 2007. Two years ago, she was acquitted of the charges.
Miss Knox (30) posted a statement in the Los Angeles Times: "Michelle Carter deserves sympathy and help, not prison."
Audi to adjust up to 850,000 diesel vehicles in response to sharp response
Just a day before the announcement, Audi, the carmaker BMW said it would offer its customers a software update in more than 350,000 vehicles.
The BMW chairman said the company believed that "there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions" in response to European cities - including Munich's headquarters - that are the headquarters of BMW - that are considering banning or restricting diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it would modify three million Mercedes cars across Europe to reduce diesel emissions.
None of the companies called this decision a withdrawal.
European car manufacturers have largely promoted the use of diesel atomobil in Europe and the United States to comply with the carbon dioxide emissions regulations.
However, nitrogen oxide emitted by diesel engines is considered a carcinogen and can cause asthma.
At the same time, the cost of automakers to install the equipment is being neutralised by the gases emitted by diesel engines, making it difficult for cars to become competitive.
While German car manufacturers are facing close searches, Chancellor Angela Merkel is facing accusations of pampering powerful car companies and ignoring their problems.
The companies are trying to avoid the flaws of Volkswagen, which, in an effort to meet emission limits, installed software in its cars that reduced the amount of emissions issued in testing, but was deactivated under normal conditions.
Several senior Volkswagen officials have been charged in the United States, and others are under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, a former head of the thermal imaging at the engine development department in Audi would have been arrested in Germany.
Former Zaccheo manager Giovanni Pamio is of Italian nationality and therefore not covered by extradition, so he may face trial in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi joined a criminal investigation by the German police in the case of Volkswagen, after authorities were accused by the authorities of installing a system to circumvent European emissions limits - and thus extended the charges that Audi faces in the US.
Audi's inclusion in the investigation may have a detrimental impact on Volkswagen: luxury carmaker makes up a disparity share of Volkswagen's profits.
The plane made an emergency landing on the beach.
The man and the little girl were killed.
The accident took place on the beach of Praia de São João in the Costa da Caparica area, some 30 kilometres south of Lisbon.
One of the witnesses told the television channel SIC Noticias that the plane was flying just above the people sunbathing on the beach before landing.
Some people from the beach reportedly ran from danger to the sea.
Unfortunately, two people failed to escape the machine.
A 50-year-old man and an eight-year-old girl were killed on the beach, according to local media.
"The plane hit them and they were dead at the scene," local police chief Pedro Coelho Dias said.
Their nationality is not yet known.
There were two people on board the plane, both of them escaping the accident alive and being taken away by the officers for questioning.
D11 or how not to build a highway.
And are motorways in the Czech Republic even complete?
I'll give you a riddle.
It's unbuilt, even though it started to be built back in 1978.
Even if it's unfinished, it's constantly being repaired.
And it's not allowed to be built any further, even if it's got a building permit.
What is it?
Yes, the D11 motorway in Hradec.
The construction of another section of its section was newly stopped by the Children of the Earth movement for at least a few months.
We EastEnders get the highway in pieces, like when you cut salami.
They'll take on the wheelbarrow, and then we'll see when and if we'll get another one.
We don't want anything miraculously.
We just want to shorten the journey time and we want to get trucks going to Poland or from Poland from villages and towns.
The endless currents of trucks go directly through the towns of Jaroměř or Náchod, which is not a sensible way to go around.
But the last section of our dream highway was put into operation in 2008, an astonishing nine years ago.
Not a cunt since.
Therefore, when the remaining four kilometers of unfinished section to Hradec Králové started to be built recently and on other sections to Jaroměř, an archaeological survey began with the understanding that construction would start at the end of this year, you could hear the loud banging of corks in eastern Bohemia.
No one believed it anymore.
Last week it was revealed that it would not be built this year.
And maybe not even next year.
The Earth-Club Children movement for sustainable transport from Brno has filed a decay.
Earth's children are repeating their D1 tactics.
They contested the decision on the building permit in its entirety.
In the appeal, they request a review of all binding opinions of all the institutions concerned already issued.
For example, the Municipality of Hradec, the Ministry of the Environment, but also the Ministry of Defence or the Railway Authority.
So far, we are descending from the D11 near the village with the eloquent name of the Burike.
So we go down, we just drive down the highway and suddenly we're standing on a side road, preferring to subsequently get into the column.
The worst part is that you see such stories all over the country.
A terrifying, constantly clogged road to Benešov, the D1 or D8 motorway.
Everyone has their Funeral.
What do the Children of the Earth demand?
What is the nature of the problems of road construction in the Czech Republic?
And why is the motorway network virtually in the incomplete system?

Lavender of Provence threatens climate change
The Levandule has become a symbol of Provence in the area of south-east France, but are now at risk from climate change.
Lavender is dwindling as a result of dry climates and harmful insects, causing consternation on the faces of researchers and farmers seeking a solution.
Eric Chaisse, an expert at the agriculture research institute CRIEPPAM in Provence said: "Pivation of lavender cultivation in Provence is at risk because in the last few years this plant has been exposed to climate change brought with it by less precipitation in spring and autumn.
This affects the lifetime of lavender.
It is also the fault of the cicadas and grasshoppers carrying the micro-bacteria that thrive in the dry climate."
There's a lot at stake.
The Lavender attracts the tourists, and the oil they are made of them is an important component of perfume and cosmetics.
Eric Chaisse said, "Instead of long and beautiful flowers, smaller, undeveloped and often weak plants grow.
The quantity of oil derived from these lavenderings is, of course, less."
A possible solution may be to distribute the water more efficiently and slow down the evaporation of water from the soil, but also to spray the lavender with a protective mixture of clay and water and breeding of more dry-resistant types.
Journalist murder highlights mounting threats in Mexico
Riodo's staff regularly meets every Wednesday to discuss the news about the riots taking place in the Sinaloa area involving organised criminals, corrupt officials, and the relentless drug wars.
Today, however, under the strain of recent events, it is mainly due to its own safety.
They learn that it is important for them to change their habits.
Two deserving journalists talk about what would be safer: to take their children with them to an office that was attacked with a grenade in 2009 or left at home.
Safety experts wrote three simple words on the black board: opponents, neutral and allies.
They ask journalists to give names to each word - no evidence is needed, just use imagination and premonition.
Choosing them out of what - drug traffickers, politicians, businessmen and journalists are suspected of taking money from the government or the drug cartels - a catalogue of criminals whose job it is to cover up criminal conduct.
The violence continues to cease and the bodies pile up in a pile across the country; the number of journalists among them is constantly growing: according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, at least 25 have been from the rise of President Enrique Pena Nieto to power in December 2012; 589 journalists are under federal protection after attacks and threats; and in all seven states have been killed this year.
Among them are the co-founder of the Riodioce periodical, editor and inspiration for colleagues, Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is living in Mexico and working as a journalist," wrote Valdez in one of his many books on the violence associated with the drug trade.
Its loss is noticeable, although its presence is all-pervasive - a large photograph of Valdez with the words "Justice" on which the middle finger shows hangs in the front of the building; two journalists - Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez - are aged over 30 years, wearing a T-shirt with a photograph of Valdez on their face, glasses on their nose and Panama cap.
The meeting takes place less than two months after his death; journalists speak of mutual traumas, nightmares, insomnia, and paranoia.
Despite the fact that a special federal prosecutor's office was set up in 2010 to address the cases of journalists, so far, according to the Committee's comments on the protection of journalists, it has so far sued two suspects.
Most of the thousands of murders that occur every year are associated with drug trafficking and organised crime. Journalists' killers are thus very rarely brought to court.
Journalists from Riodoka insist on informing about the violence that is being done in the Sinaloe; even though they are being destroyed by grief and the area is currently very treacherous.
Without information about the killers and the vision of justice, the security meeting is irrelevant, says Ibarra.
"It's foolish to waste time on such appointments," he adds.
"If we don't get more information, no one can be trusted."
On the morning of May 15, Valdez left the headquarters of Riodo in Culiacan, the capital of Sinaloy.
He managed to drive several blocks when his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men who pulled him out of the car and killed him with 12 rounds, apparently because of the title of the article - which can be translated as the Twelfth River.
The shooters then boarded his car and crashed him not far from the scene.
Valdez died at the age of 50.
He left behind a wife and two adult children.
In Culiacan, the rumors seem to spread rapidly.
In the case of Valdez, however, it is a suspicious silence.
Since Guzmán's arrest and his January extradition to the United States last year, Sinaloa has become one of the country's bloodiest battlefields as the competing faction tries to fill an empty seat.
A few people are killed in the streets of Sinaloi every day, and the cemetery is full of embroidered two-storey mausoleums for drug churches, many of which are larger than houses.
Forget for a moment that the word "rucive" means that one drug cartel controls the coastal state with precious ports and important routes that drugs travel to the United States.
The upright, as well as the fact that Valdez was intimately acquainted with the risks of his job, with Ismail Bojorquez (60), co-founder and director Riodoce still horizdom of not protecting his friend.
He believes two misconduct contributed to his death.
The first was the February edition of the interview with Damaso Lopez, the leader of one of the rival drug cartels that fought the war with Joaquín Guzmán's sons.
The conciliation might have billed the sons; the suspect members of the gang had bought up all the copies of the newspaper the moment they landed on the shelves.
The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave the country for his own safety after the confiscation of other newspapers in which the same story was printed.
Valdez has become a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his death is seen as an important milestone in the fight between Mexican criminals and journalists.
He had managed to survive so long, and all his friends and colleagues believed that this would never change.
He was a virtual veteran in the Noroeste periodical when he decided to sell his $50 shares in 2003 and start with five colleagues Riodoce.
In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to run journalism and not mention the drug trade," said Bojorquez.
Riodo had, over time, earned a good reputation for his brave and truthful coverage; the newspapers began to flourish.
Journalists liked to go into the search for troubled topics and published texts without censorship - the reader was fascinated to read stories that no one else dared to publish.
Eight years after its founding, Riodo won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot for reporting on Latin America.
That same year, Valdez won the International Freedom of the Press of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists for his brave reporting on Mexican drug trafficking.
Valdez openly admitted that he was afraid.
"I was taking my life," he said in the award.
Drug trafficking in Sinaloae is a "customs life" in an interview with Rompeviento TV in October last year.
"You have to take the role of journalist - or play the stupid.
I don't want to be asked, 'What were you doing in the face of death . . . why didn't you say what was going on?'.'
Riodo employees miss Valdez. The man was known for his joking and his indiscriminate language. He was a good friend who liked to give advice and hugs - a teacher who knew how to survive.
Everyone relied on his daily routine.
He always wore his hat.
He would often go to the El Guayabo bar across from the offices and sit at the same table.
Now they ask: was this routine responsible for his death?
His death also raised questions about their own assumptions - how to do their job as best as possible and stay alive?
"They don't like getting involved with their wives, children, clean shops, secret landing areas."
"These things were forbidden," said Bojorquez.
As a result, there is a high level of self-censorship and self-preservation.
You have to trust your instincts.
If you feel something's wrong here, hands off.
The trouble, Riodoce editor Andres Villarreal said, "a sense of sense that can be fooled ... and then the Javier thing happened."
The old rules, he said, as they did, according to the others, no longer apply in Sinaloae - as in the states of Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero, and other states that are home to a toxic mix of lucrative smuggling trails, weak governments, and corrupt politicians.
The landscape is constantly changing.
No mobile phones are allowed in the room where Riodo employees meet; a few days ago, spyware was discovered, which was bought by the governments to monitor Mexican journalists and activists.
Outside the building, two police officers find relief in the shadow of a nearby tree in the shade of the 40-degree heat.
They were chosen by the state to protect the Riodoques offices, located in a four-storey building in the Culiacan bourgeois district.
Journalists are making fun of whether these police officers are one of those 50 percent of the law's protectors who, according to the government, are corrupt.
It has been months since journalists have made their last trip to the mountainous areas essentially controlled by the drug cartels.
There are three main stories on this week's schedule.
The first is the murder of the brother of former boxer Julio Caesar Chávez in Sinaloe.
They are also positive for suspicious government spending in the home city of the state governor.
There were also several hijackings recently at one of Culacán's most luxurious restaurants, just a block from the prosecutor's office.
Officially, no one reported the identity of the kidnapped people or the circumstances surrounding the kidnapping, so journalists were wary of writing about what every city dweller knew: that the restaurant was a favorite destination for drug traffickers and politicians.
One journalist read from the public records that the restaurant was registered under a name that is associated with a politician who is a member of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), who is controlling all the levels of the political scene for almost the entire last century.
Several PRI governors have recently been charged with corruption in high-level positions.
Villarreal asked journalists to write about earlier incidents that had taken place at the restaurant, including an incident in which one of Joaquín's sons, "El Chapo" Guzmán, had escaped the army's strike force.
A month ago, readers would have read about the subject in Valdez's section, which was the best source of information about the kidnapping.
"Walherez would have deciphered the case," said Villarreal (46), who is nicknamed "El Flaco" for his slim figure.
"Now all the informants have turned their backs on us."
Valdez's office was transformed into a warehouse for signs and labels to protest protest workers. The staff certainly did not expect them to become activists in the press representation.
Journalist Miriam Ramirez grabbed several signs and set out the next morning to demonstrate in front of the Attorney's office for another journalist.
Salvador Adame disappeared just three days after Valdez's murder in the western part of the state of Michoacán.
Only the charred body was discovered. Authorities say it's an Adamea based on DNA analysis.
The activity of journalists is escalating across the country. Many of them organize protests and scribbled on the sidewalks and buildings "SOS print."
The director of the newspaper Bojorquez is the day on a visit to Washington, where he seeks to gain international support and obtain justice for Valdez's death.
In a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa, the day after the murder of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities of stalking journalists and their murders for proclaiming the truth.
In the meantime, she asked to be transferred to another department for fear that her anger might threaten her impartiality.
Valdez has repeatedly said that Mexican journalists are "bean" organised crime, corrupt officials and indifferent public.
In his latest book, "Narco-journalism," he wrote that journalists were dying not only at the hands of the drug cartels, but also on the order of politicians and security forces who collaborate with organised crime.
The media watchcrowmath group Articulo 19 has charged police officers and public officials with more than half of all attacks on journalists.
"You'll die in Mexico because they want to shut you up," Ramirez added.
The murders are obviously working.
No one will forget the death of the blogger Maria Elizabeth Macías, who took place six years ago at the northern border of the Tamaulipas.
Her body was found with a note allegedly signed by the Zetas Cartel: "This is how I ended up for my reports."
Next to the severed head was a keyboard and headphones.
Some branches have decided to shut down their activities, such as the El Norte newspaper, based at the northern border of the state of Chihuahua, in response to the March murder of the March correspondent Miroslava Breach.
The others are still going on, just as the El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after the killing of its director in 2004.
In 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez approached the publicly drug cartels with an article on the opening page titled "What do you want from us"?
Some journalists have fled their homes or even across the border.
It's a difficult decision.
Finding work in exile is difficult, as is to get rid of the feeling that you are constantly being haunted.
And journalists are persecuted and killed, such as in the case of Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered in 2015 along with four women in an apartment in Mexico City, three months after fleeing Veracruze.
For those who choose to stay and not give up their work, every day is a major risk.
Ibarra, who wanted to be a poet, admits that writing about drugs scolds him.
"Mexico is heading to hell, that's why I became a journalist," he said.
It's Friday's midnight, and Riodo staff is sitting on the sidewalk in front of the office - the latest edition sent to the printer - drinking beer when the phone suddenly starts ringing.
They learn that 19 people have died in a shootout between gang members and police officers near the beach resort in the town of Mazatlán.
The war is escalating, just as many messages left by the syndicate members promised to do in the area.
Journalists are posting the news from a mobile phone on the Riodotion website.
Not a day goes by and the opening headline is changing again.
The sounds of the police sirens point to another shootout.
Bojorquez gives a glimpse of the police patrol to see if they're paying attention.
If they're scared, they don't show it.
Under the huge portrait of the fallen co-founder of their periodical - whose middle finger is a telling slogan for the whole of Sinaloe - all Riodo staff follow his steps.
"How could we possibly think of leaving," Bojorquez said, "when an intern was asked to take to the streets on the same day that Javier was killed?"
Dinosaurs used camouflage to avoid enemies
At first glance, it looks like a statue, however terrifying.
The researchers have now uncovered the conclusions of the first discovery of an amazing rhino-sized creature whose perfectly preserved remains - which the experts called 'Mon the Lisa of the Dinosaurs' - were found by a Canadian miner.
The remains were preserved to such a high degree that the experts were able to determine the reddish-brown color of his scaly skin and said that the dinosaur had a 'problem past'.
The article in the journal Current Biology stated that it is the 'most savior of the armored dinosaur found and one of the best dinosaur species in the world' found so far.
Pethema is a new kind of Nodosauridae family. The dinosaur lived during the Clay period, about 110 to 112 million years ago.
His perfectly preserved condition shocked the researchers who described him in the words 'reconceiving . . .
The armored white-travee is, according to National Geographic, the best preserved fossil of its kind to date.
The find behind the discovery is Shawn Funk, who uncovered the fossil on March 21, 2011, while drilling at the Suncor Mill mine near Alberta, Canada.
He came across what appeared to be a foreign object and decided to explore it more closely.
The fossil was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
The researchers spent the next six years working to uncover the animal from a huge chunk of the land weighing 1100 kg.
When the works are completed, the dinosaur is ready to be unveiled.
''Just squint a little and you'll believe he's asleep,' said the work manager, Caleb Brown, and the Naturalist of the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the animal is on display.
'It will certainly go down in the history of history as one of the most beautiful and most consecrated species of the dinosaur - the Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs.'
Studying his skin, the researchers found that this herbivore - despite being covered with armor and resembling a walking tank - was very likely to face a serious threat from carnivorous dinosaurs.
The heavily armored dinosaur used a red and white camouflage to protect against predators, and used a cloaking system used by many animals today.
Experts say it has enabled him to better blend in with his surroundings and avoid his enemies. The cloaking system suggests that it was a favorite food for larger dinosaurs.
News of the 110 million-year-old dinosaur of the Nodosauridae family first appeared in newspapers in May. It is currently available for insight at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
The researchers named it Borealopelt markmitchelli after the museum's technician, Mark Mitchell, who, along with the team, spent more than 7,000 hours carefully uncovering the fossil.
Thanks to the amazingly preserved state of the fossil, dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the patterns and the shape of the scales and armor all over the body.
They uncovered the cloaking method normally used by today's animals in defense - the upper part of the animal was darker than its lower part.
Although this camouflage effect is common in nature, the researchers' findings are surprising, because Borealopelta's size far exceeds today's animals using the same technique.
It is therefore possible that the dinosaur was so many predators that evolution preferred to camouflage in survival to confrontation.
Many of the current masked animals - such as deer, zebra and or armadillo - are much smaller and also more vulnerable as prey, suggesting that nosodaurus must have literally fought for its outdated.
'The revelation of the vast and heavily armored dinosaur illustrates the dangers posed by the predators in the Cretaceous period,' said Brown.
Chemical analysis of the organic ingredients contained in the scales also revealed that the dinosaur skin was probably red-brown in colour.
Researchers continue to study the animal, searching for further insights into his life, including preserved stomach contents, to track down his last meal.
He believes the dinosaur fell into the river after death and was carried to the sea, where it sank to the bottom.
The Alberta region was at the same time the climate as in today's Florida, and the rivers and oceans stretched far inland than they are today.
'This nodosaurus is truly remarkable in that it is completely covered in perfectly preserved scaly skin while being preserved in three dimensions and so we can see its original size,' said Brown.
'For these reasons, the animal looks virtually the same as it did in the Cretaceous age.
You don't have to use your imagination to rebuild it; just turn a little to squint your eyes and it seems like he's just sleeping.'
In the Cretaceous period, the Earth was strolled by giant theropods, carnivorous dinosaurs who were on two legs.
Though the king of all the dinosaurs - the Tyrannosaurus rex - lived for several million years after Borealopelta, this armored dinosaur might have been a favorite prey for his equally gruesome ancestors.
These include the Acrocanthosaurus, a 11.5 metre-long monster weighing over 6 tons.
Researchers whose latest findings were published in the journal Current Biology believe that Borealopelt's body was washed into the sea after it was mummified in the mud.
Shawn Funk, who was discovered by the fossil on March 21, 2011, while drilling at a Suncor Millenium mine near Alberta, Canada.
According to the museum, it is the best preserved armored dinosaur in the world, including leather and armour, which is also complete from the snout to the hips.
The animal was 5 metres in diameter and weighed up to 1,300 kg.
From his shoulders protruded two 50 cm spines.
Researchers believe this herbivore was cruising the territory of today's Canada until it ended up in the river that washed it into the sea.
His underwater tomb kept the body in perfect condition.
Fossil remains of this species are also preserved to the extent that armored plates around the skull still cover the remains of the skin.
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, 'finding such a preserved individual can be compared to winning the lottery.
The longer I watch him, the shocking the find seems to me to be.
Fossil remains of this species are also preserved to the extent that armored plates around the skull still cover the remains of the skin.
At his side lies his right fore leg, with his fingers pointing up.
I'll easily count the scales on his foot.'
How did one activist learnt the answer to the question: 'Whose Streets?'
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell rocked her body.
The day after she arrived in New York, the St. Louis sat down on the bed at the Airbnb room and went through the Facebook posts on her phone.
She came across a contribution from a secondary school student.
"Police just shot an 18-year-old man whose body is still lying on the street," he said.
She marveled that no one else had written to her the post, so she closed Facebook and opened up Twitter.
User @ThePharoah kept her wall posts.
Rapper from St. Louis posted on Twitter of his posts about the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old who was shot by a white-skinned police officer in the town of Ferguson, Missouri.
He posted a photograph of Brown's body lying limp in the street from which he was not taken away after four hours.
"That's crazy," Ferrell thought.
But death was nothing new to her and her community.
She put down her phone to return to it in the evening, when she watched the tweets about people gathering on Canfield Drive.
She watched photographs of police tapes and roaring people. One of the men claimed to be the victim's father, holding a sign that said "The Hurrican Police Department killed my unarmed son"!
She watched the live news - one of the officers standing in front of a group of protesters holding a leash and a barking dog at the other end.
In another video, another policeman held, she said, in his hand the gun he was pointing at the crowd, yelling, "I'm going to kill you all . . . animals."
"That's not normal," said Ferrell.
"This isn't the type of murder we've gotten used to and can be called normal.
I could feel the creeps all over my body.
"I was angry and I cried."
She immediately booked her return flight and travelled home the next day.
After landing at 11:00, she picked up her six-year-old daughter from her father and decided to go to Ferguson in the morning.
The story of what happened to Ferrell and the city of Ferguson over the next three years describes the new documentary "Whose Streets?" which will be released in theaters on August 11.
It is a story about survival and protest, love and revulsion, strength and resilience told from the point of view of people living in the community who take to the streets and demand answers.
On her way to Ferguson, Ferrell took a dialogue with her daughter - wearing a floral jersey and the same floral headband - on a topic they had discussed many times before - "about the experience with the black people."
"Do you remember how I taught you about how black people had to fight for what they believed in?" he recalls of the interview.
"We're going to Ferguson right now because the police killed an 18-year-old and that's not right."
"It didn't come to any consideration that I wouldn't take it with me," Ferrell later said.
"Today's events are the climax . . . that occurred in the past.
She must have known and seen it with her own eyes and grow up in it.
She needed to develop not only in activism and organizing, but she also had to see the difference between the different layers of experience with blacks and what we need to do to free ourselves.
While I am able to provide conditions in which she will not experience racism in her own business, she is no different in any way from another black child-woman.
I sense that if I had protected her from this experience, I would have only harmed her."
After arriving in Ferguson, the first stop on the South Florissant Road road across from the police department, which became the base of activists who were awaiting the words of Officer Darren Wilson about his possible involvement in the incident.
Here, Ferrell and her daughter met a local businessman who was preparing meals for the rest of the room.
Together, they prepared food for the bags and helped deliver it to the Protestants.
In Ferrell's eyes, a new type of activism began to be slowly born.
"My activism was turned upside down after August 9th," Ferrell said, adding that while attending college at the University of Missouri-St. Louis was president of the Minority Student Nurses Assn association and sought to introduce health care and food in black communities.
"I had no experience with the organization.
It was only natural."
A few weeks later, during the evening demonstration, Ferrell met the documentary's later co-chassignment, Sabaah Folayan.
Folayan said he and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted to "document" the events underway.
But Ferrell thought, "Are you working on a documentary or trying to find a story to be used?"
Such a type of skepticism penetrated the community through many people, often whites, who wanted to profit from pain and decisiveness.
As Folayan explained in an interview, she would not give: "We have heard that the voices of the people who are born and raised in Ferguson are very often neglected, and we wanted to change that."
Folayan has already established a collaboration with co-director Damon Davis, who is a respected local artist who deals with the subject of prisoners on death row.
He also participated in the project with Ferrell, and with six other local residents watched by the "Whose Streets" team in the years following the assassination of Browne.
"Nobody speaks for us in this document, but it's our statement," Davis said.
"That was important to me - how these people were represented - because I would be represented in the same way."
While the aim of the documentary was not to focus on Ferrell's experiences - in an attempt to depute that the movement is not about a savior leader, but a community-savings approach," Folayan said - it turned out that she was the most open to taking part in filming.
The documentary "Whose Streets?" describes the very personal aspect of Ferrell's life, for example, how she fell in love with her wife.
"I felt naked," Ferrell said with a smile on her face at the thought of the first moment when she saw the final version of the documentary.
"But I understand that in order to do this job and humanise the blacks, I have to open up."
In addition, Ferrell's story highlights the role of an eccentric black woman in the broad side of the Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the movement's three founders - who created the social media campaign under #BlackLivesMatter in response to the killing of teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012 - call themselves the weirdoers.
"The black eccentric women in leadership positions are ultimately behind the preservation of the movement," Ferrell said, "because we are constantly fighting on multiple fronts.
Black eccentric women must endure the weight of these events."
Folayan agrees with this statement, adding that "the move is actually supported by black women and a large number of eccentric black women."
He insists, however, that "this is not a mere affirmative matter" and Ferrell is not the main heroine of the documentary because of her opinions.
"That was the driving force and the source of energy," she said.
"That she, of all alone, was not a coincidence, because life at these intersections in the skin of a black eccentric woman is dangerous.
You can feel that energy rush in front of the screen."
Meanwhile, back in Ferguson, the TV station's cameras have cleared out their positions, but the heavy racial ties between the community and the police remain.
Ferrell is serving two and a half years of probation for blocking the highway in demonstrations.
The socially political atmosphere in the area, which she called home, described as "The mess."
Yet she continues to take up her quest, to which she has pledged since she took to the streets of Ferguson three years ago.
"It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It is our duty to win.
We must love and support each other.
All we have to lose is our chains.'
Fields were on fire in Cologne.
Dozens of firefighters went to the scene, and a helicopter helped.
Nearby Český Brod in Cologne, between Bylany and Liblice, there was a field with an area of about 15 hectares from 14:00.
The fire stopped spreading at about 15:15, with firefighters issuing a third fire alarm out of four possible.
According to firefighter spokesman Ladislav Holomčík, the fire was also helped to extinguish the fire from the air by a helicopter.
At 18:00 firefighters managed to extinguish the fire, the fire caused damage for 700000 crowns.
With the flames at the scene, dozens of professional and volunteer firefighters fought.
The fire was caused by a technical fault in the engine compartment of the harvester.
The fire was also assisted by a helicopter, which carried out a total of six drops of water.
"We handed over the site of the intervention to the owner until 8:00 tomorrow, guarded by a volunteer fire brigade," Holomčík said today.
And Becoming Resemblance: Artist creates portraits using Chelsea Manning's DNA
In the centre of one of the rooms of New York's Fridman Gallery, several faces are placed faces of different skin shades - white, black and dark - suspended from the ceiling on the wires. Each of them was the spitting image of the previous one.
All 30 portraits were made by artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from the oral and hair excursions sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent her samples from Fort Leavenworth Prison, where the former analyst is serving a 35-year sentence for illegally releasing secret cable to WikiLeaks.
The new exhibition, which was launched on August 2, is entitled A Becoming Resemblance.
It is the result of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, which combines its experience with technology, computer science and art, and Manning - a transgender and pioneering dissident whose punishment was reduced by Obama three days before his departure as US president.
An algorithmic analysis of Manning's DNA and using 30 portraits to illustrate what a man with this genotype would look like, was created by Dewey-Hagborg, a razor-shaped, if not intellectual, commentary on the pliopacity of DNA - as well as the many ways in which DNA can be interpreted - and the inherent determinism of these interpretations, as well as identities.
Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward Manning, has spoken since her youth about considering herself a woman. She was convicted in 2013 on the basis of 20 indictments, including violating six espionage laws, computer fraud and theft.
All her photographs were detained by prison staff. Only one, lower-quality black-and-white photo, at which Manning, visibly concerned, sits in the driver's seat in the platinum blond wig with which she is now associated.
In 2015, there were still positive reactions to the 2012 Dewey-Hagborg project Stranger Visions.
As part of this project, Dewey-Hagborg used various forensic items - such as cigarette butts and chewing gum - to create an image of the possible forms of these people.
And it was at this time that she received an e-mail from Paper Magazine.
"They were in for an interview with Chelsea Manning in prison and wanted to complete the article with a portrait," Dewey-Hagborg explained at the opening of the new exhibition.
However, no visits or photography were allowed, so they contacted Chelsea to ask if they would be interested in the DNA portrait.
The artist and her imprisoned muse were made friends within two years through correspondence.
They even created a comic book called Suppressed Images, illustrated by Shoili Kanung, which presented a vision of what would happen if Chelsea were pardoned and could attend the exhibition in person.
Indeed, President Obama asked for Manning's release a few days after the comic was published, a welcome change after several unbearable years in the Kansas military prison.
Indeed, it is interesting that the exhibition takes place at a time when Donald Trump is waging war with people who are seeking to publish government information and transgender soldiers while trying to find new ways to stimulate resentment with his tweets in the areas he should support.
In response to the inquiry about this particular timing, Dewey-Hagborg said that "everything is happening for a reason."
Under the statement of the artist on one of the walls of the gallery, Manning calls with her huge signature (the letter "i" in the surname is heart-written) after the end of the "samoocial factionalism, which is based on gender, race, sexuality and culture."
On the opposite side are the sequences of her mitochondrial DNA - the centipede of the letters C, G and A recorded by the pencil.
By classifying 200 letters (or nucleotides, according to the artist's sophisticated scientific vocabulary), Dewey-Hagborg wanted to illustrate how surprisingly similar, at least in terms of biology, we are all to ourselves.
"I hope that people will take it out of this, that our genome doesn't care who we are, and that the genetic data is subjective and anyone can interpret it in their own way," Dewey-Hagborg said. Her 2007 Spurious Memories' work on the subject of the video is also on display.
"DNA tells many different stories, this is 30 of them."
The last example of the exhibition, located in a separate room, is the only page from the aforementioned graphic novel.
It shows Manning emerging in the manner of King Konga from the United States Disiplinary Barracks with a megaphone in her hand.
"Once they stop you from speaking, they will win," it says.
"Never be forgotten to silence yourself."
"It's a direct transcript from one of the letters," the Philadelphia artist said.
"I think about it, I get goose bumps."
Manning has not yet personally visited the exhibition - which was foretold in a comic - but when she does, she will be greeted in the middle of the room with her masks, her own genomic likenesses, lined up as a crowd of Protestants.
Which was also the purpose of the exhibition, including a nearly 160 cm tall statue of Maning, on which her genetic haplogroups are recorded in pencil.
"They were placed on the walls in the past, but this time I wanted the feeling of the crowd to be shining," Dewey-Hagborg said of the portraits.
"I wanted to give the impression of a mass movement that takes on the form of Chelsea and liberates it."
Northwest University professor and Oxford University employee sought for murder
These days, a nationwide manhunt is underway for a professor at the Northwest University and an employee of the University of Oxford, who are being prosecuted on suspicion of the murder of a man who was found stabbed to death in a luxury Chicago apartment, police said.
On Monday, a warrant was issued for the first-degree murder for a man named Wyndham Lathe (42) and Andrew Warren (56) for their alleged complicity in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, reports the Cook County forensic file.
The paper says that Cornell-Duranleau (26) died from several stab wounds.
Chicago police said the body of the deceased was found on 27. July.
Officers were warned about this by phone. On arrival at the Grand Plaza Apartments, the victim was found in one of the apartments with several lacerations.
Cornell-Duranleau was pronounced dead at the scene and detectives are investigating the case as a homicide. Police are searching for the two suspects, authorities said.
Lathem has worked as an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at the University of Northwest since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, the vice president of the University of Public Relations, said in his e-mail statement that Lathem is now on administrative leave and has been banned from entering the university's school premises.
"The full matter is now being investigated by the relevant authorities and the Northwest University is cooperating fully with them," said Cubbage.
Warren is an executive financial administrator at the University of Oxford.
A spokesman for the University of a Somerville College said in a statement sent by e-mail: "We have been contacted by the British police and we are ready to assist the US police as well."
The statement also states that Warren's colleagues were shocked by the fact and wish he had come forward to the police.
Anthony Guglielmi, the public relations chief of police at the Chicago Police Department, said he was urging the suspects to surrender to the appropriate authorities.
"Police have information about their whereabouts, and efforts to track down the suspects are escalating," Guglielmi said.
Guglielmi added that local, regional and national authorities are assisting the police in the search for the suspects.
According to Guglielmi, police received a call from the Grand Plaza manager, who was alerted to the events that were to take place in apartment No. 1008.
Police described the whole scene as very violent.
Guglielmi said it was unclear if the incident occurred on the 27th. July.
He added that Lathem and Warren had been caught on security cameras.
"We believe Professor Latham knew his victim," Guglielmi said.
The Grand Plaza management issued a statement to all residents: "Police are now working on compiling a time-review and profile of the victim and are investigating various motives, including domestic violence."
"We will complete WADA Plan soon" - Deputy Prime Minister of Russia Mutko
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said it would not be long before the rest of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) criteria and re-determination of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) will be implemented.
"Apart of the criteria of the new plan have now been completed and RUSADA has already acquired the right to plan and test in cooperation with the British Anti-Doping Agency (UKAD).
With this fact, the WADA Plan has been updated," Mutko said on Thursday.
The vice-president commented on the second part of the WADA plan to comply with the Code - which describes the RUSADA renewal criteria - which was recently published on the organization's website.
According to Mutko, the code contains nothing that should be of concern for Russia.
"Everything has been announced and everything will be implemented.
The results will be available to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future," he added.
However, one of the criteria mentioned calls for a public announcement of the results of the WADA investigation under investigation by Richard McLaren to allegedly sponsor Russian athletes' doping by the government.
On this topic, Mutko said: "We are conducting an investigation, as our anti-doping system has clearly failed.
All measures were taken.
However, there were no state programmes in our country and we cannot confess to something that never existed."
Mutko's words were confirmed by Vitaly Smirnov, director of the Russian Independent Public Anti-Doping Commission.
In an interview with Russia's RSport, Smirnov, he admitted the problems of Russian anti-doping officials, but added: "On many occasions, we said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations.
No one is planning to accept the report completely without reservation," Smirnov concluded.
WADA suspected RUSADU of taking doping controls within Russia in November 2015 immediately before the doping scandal.
Nevertheless, the organization allowed the planning and unification of testing under the supervision of international experts and the British Anti-Doping Agency (UKAD) in June this year.
Following a visit to the Moscow headquarters of the organization in July, WADA CEO Olivier Niggli said that RUSADA was "on the right track" to restore validity.
The police charged three people, one being a juvenile.
Police have charged three men with the establishment of Wednesday's fire at a rare wooden church in Třinec-Gutech in Frýdecko-Místeck.
One of the accused is a juvenile, all three are of Czech nationality.
The offence of general endangerment carries up to 15 years in prison.
The journalists were told today by Moravian-Silesian Police Director Tomáš Kužel.
It was a deliberate crime, he said.
"This is a very recent matter and the police are currently working on the motive of the matter," Cone said.
He said the police would discuss the possible take of the accused into custody.
Further information is not available, according to the director.
"I can't say any more yet, because the criminal police and investigation services and the prosecutor who is overseeing the matter are actually working on the matter," Cone said.
The wooden church of the Body of God in Guts dates from the 16th century.
It was a valuable monument with many of its original furnishings and paintings from the first half of the 16th century.
The material damage will run into tens of millions of crowns, according to preliminary estimates, but the historical loss is incalculable.
Soon after the fire, the reconstruction of the church began to be considered.
Most of the costs should be covered by the insurance policy, the Ministry of Culture and the city are to be shared with the additional costs, a public collection is also being prepared and a contribution of the owner of the monument, i.e. the local parishes, is expected.
A similar wooden wooden church of St Catherine from the 16th century in Ostrava-Hrabová was also destroyed by a fire 15 years ago.
It was caused by an electrical fault at the time.
In its place, an exact copy was made.
The state counts on the citizens in defending the state.
Support their training.
With the financial support for the associations usable in the defense of the state, with voluntary shooting training or with the team of training trainers, the substantive intention of the Act on the readiness of citizens to defend the state is foreseen.
The Ministry of Defence, which was tasked with its elaboration by the government, expects him to increase the physical fitness of Czechs as well as their abilities, which the state could then use in crisis situations.
This is clear from the proposal prepared by the Ministry.
If the law were adopted in the future, the state would spend hundreds of millions of crowns to support the conscription.
The basic aim of the proposal, according to its authors, is to create an effective system to help increase the readiness of the population of the Czech Republic to defend the state, in addition to the performance of conscription and on the basis of volunteering.
For example, the state would support associations of amateurs, scorers or cynologists with financial or material, and would make it possible to increase the capabilities of their members.
In return, he would get data on people who are willing to come to the country's aid in a time of crisis if needed, and their skills or material equipment.
Accredited instructors could also be available to help the associations and other candidates in training or training.
It is also expected to organize sessions with war veterans or people who have acted heroically.
One possible option assumes that a new office would be created to administer and coordinate the project.
The authors of the proposal stress that people's participation should be voluntary and the state would use their skills only after the state of emergency has been declared.
"The whole concept must respect the gradual blurring of previously obvious boundaries between the different types of threats," the project reads, referring to the dangers of so-called hybrid threats.
Ministry officials noted that it was therefore necessary to focus on supporting the widest set of capabilities, not just the military capabilities.
"The basic aim of the intention is to create a very broad base that allows each citizen to respond in a qualified way to situations threatening the sovereignty of the state or the lives, health and property of persons, to protect themselves, or to contribute to the protection of others, and to prevent misbeaten the performance of tasks to the Czech Republic's armed forces," the intention states.
Adoption of the law would bring substantial financial claims.
According to the ministry, their amount will depend on the chosen option.
For example, the Office expects financial support for projects to prepare citizens for the defence of the state up to CZK 100 million.
If an administrative and coordination centre were set up, its operation could cost around CZK 60 million per year.
More money would go to salaries or to build an information system.
The proposal also foresees that the remit of the regional military headquarters would have to be expanded, which together would employ an additional 42 soldiers.
Ministry officials have previously said that the law should also help resolve the opposition of some Czech politicians to the introduction of a European Union directive on the possession of weapons.
Its adoption would allow the shooters who will be part of the system to retain some of the weapons that the directive is forbidden.
Startups to help your company not become the next Uber
Amy Errette wanted to measure the satisfaction of her e-commerce startup's employees, but she did not find the appropriate survey.
The answers were often inaccurate, unhelpful, or even deceptive.
And even though she promised to anonymize the survey, some employees expressed their distrust of the process.
"I was looking for consistency and objectivity," said Errette, owner of the e-commerce of the hair care company Madison Reed, a San Francisco-based company that employs 75 people.
So she asked for help from outside.
New startups in the human resources industry are constantly appearing on the market to help companies with employee satisfaction surveys.
By creating and licensing the software with the specific intention of measuring the staff's responsibilities, startups allow companies to vote quickly, target specific teams and demographic groups, offer complete employee anonymity and a hotline for complaint, and in some cases also allow informants to bypass their superiors and contact directors directly.
"There are tools on the market like Strava and Fitbit that track your health, but where is Fitbit for your company?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and CEO of the Reedwood City-based startup Glint.
Errette said that thanks to Glint, she had gained more awareness of what her employees thought and what she felt in three years.
In addition to quick surveys and the voting of specific teams, Glint offers a company's temperature map and a cursory overview of the groups with the highest number of complaints, as well as an overview of low-level managers - allowing the user to work on the correction.
Companies are beginning to realize the need to take care of the work environment's culture - in case they become the next Uber - which is in the throes of scandals after a former employee posted a post on his blog describing the company's environment and harassment of employees who dare to speak outbenchlain.
For startups like Glint, the demand for corporate culture surveys is a lucrative business opportunity.
According to the website of Let's Talk Payments, which deals with technical and financial progress, the value of the global control, regulation and compisation sector can exceed $118.8 billion by 2020.
Startup Convercent from Denver, Colorado, which helps companies prevent and detect inappropriate behavior, saw a small increase in interest and activity at the start of the year, just before Uber scandals.
Nearly 600 Convercent's clients include Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
He also recently adopted Uber under his wing.
Like Glint, Convercent allows companies to send customizable "lightning" surveys, collect confidential information in real time, and display temperature maps of problem areas.
It also offers an anonymous textile hotline that allows employees to report inappropriate behavior.
If the Director-General is involved in the problem, the complaints are sent directly to the Board of Directors.
"The court of public opinion has mandated regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, founder and CEO of the startup Convercent.
If a company is convicted of misreading its employees or unethical behaviour - and if it does not take the reinsurance of regulators - it may face costly consequences as a result of customer boycott, staff exhaustion or court proceedings, Quinlan added.
The Ruby Tuesday restaurant network, which employs over 25,000 people across 500 locations, has been using the Convercent for more than a year to raise employees' awareness of corporate principles and procedures, and to provide an easy way to contact corporate management.
Previously, if an employee wanted to report any problem, he had to trace a phone number or an e-mail to the company's management, officially file a complaint and hope for a successful resolution.
It was often a deterrent and unpleasant experience, said James Vitrano, General Representative Ruby Tuesday, according to whom there was no reliable way of monitoring staff complaints.
Now, as the company uses Convercent, a quick detachment is ensured and a solution to problems that have never previously reached the managers sitting in the offices, miles away from the actual handling of complaints - for example, discrimination, harassment or unfair treatment.
"It's coming to a holistic, overall view of the experience of employees," said Vitrano, who runs the Ruby Tuesday group overseeing the risk management.
"At the same time, we protect shareholders from litigation by the employees."
Companies stopped taking on the aerium, values, and participation of employees in a lightweight in 2002 after the accounting firm, Arthur Andersen, collapsed after Enron's collapse over the abuse of the ethical rights of employees, Quinlan said.
But it wasn't until the social media "shaped the whole thing up" that companies began to realize that they couldn't simply hide their skeletons in the closet in the online world.
"Before people started using technology to track the ethics, they were relying on the faith," Quinlan added.
Both Glint and Convercent offer their software in the form of a service for which the company pays regular fees.
It is a business model and an opportunity that is being approved by courageous capital investors, who have supported both startups.
Convercent raised $10 million in total as part of its February campaign from companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, and eventually took in $47 million in capital.
Glint raised $10 million from Bessemer Venture Partners in November and raised $60 million throughout the campaign.
These investments are hardly surprising given the mutual nature of companies, culture and venture capital.
The growing number of research clearly confirms that today's employees expect more from their workplace than ever.
And in competitive markets, such as this. Silicon Valley, are not the main advantage of high salaries and interesting projects.
Employees want to see that they are being accepted and appreciated and that they devote their time to a company that seeks a positive mission.
"If people are happy in their work, perceive that their voice is heard, and that their work is rewarding, they are striving for the success of society," said Nina McQueen, vice president of global benefits and employee benefits at LinkedIn, which uses both Convercent and Glint.
Investors make money if the company is doing well and the companies are thriving if its employees are happy.
And when an analytical tool emerges in the market to ensure the commitment and commitment of employees to the company, it is no surprise that there will be plenty of investors to support this effort.
According to experts in the work culture, it is important to have data on staff satisfaction.
But the data itself is pointless if the company does not take the necessary steps.
The fact is that once a company requests feedback from its employees, there may be major changes.
And if the change doesn't happen quickly - at worst at all - it can cause disappointment and disinterest from the staff.
"Once you ask for 4,000 opinions, you have to be prepared for 4,000 conversations," said Russell Raath, director of consulting at Kotter International, which has witnessed many companies that relied too heavily on the data itself.
"Because as soon as you don't get things done, the staff start asking themselves, 'They even heard me?
They're interested in me?
And if not, then why would I care?" "
Madison Reed, which now regularly conducts a survey of employees every month, is able to solve the problem by just one day thanks to Glint, Errettová said.
After gathering feedback from staff who were frustrated by slow decision-making and the quality of communication, Errett was able to reorganize several teams within the company and start training for communication to successfully solve the problem.
Ruby Tuesday is gaining a very important view of its staff and hopes to achieve high employment in a field of high employment in a field known for frequent layoffs.
"If you are not seeking to create a transparent working environment, the staff will not believe you," Vitrano added.
"And once you start losing employees, you lose customers.
And with the outflow of customers, the whole company goes bust."
Thursday became the hottest day.
Thursday, with 38.3 degrees recorded in Strážnice na Hodonínsko, is the hottest day of the year in the Czech Republic to date.
It surpassed Tuesday, which was originally the hottest day of the year with 37.3 degrees.
This was reported by the staff of the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute.
Compared to Tuesday on Thursday, however, there were not many temperature records.
The heat hit mainly Moravia, in Bohemia it was mostly cloudy.
On Tuesday, records were broken or a set-up were set at 35 of the 145 weather stations measuring over 30 years.
On Thursday, only nine long-term long-term stations recorded a record.
For example, in Strážnice today's temperature was the same as the previous record from 2013.
In Lednice, Břeclav today's 37.4 degrees, the original best surpassed by four-tenths of a degree and in Pohořelice on Brno the current 37.1 degrees exceeded the record by three tenths.
Both records, as with Strážnice, came from 2013.
High temperatures emerged today mainly in the south and east of Moravia.
After Strážnice was the hottest in Dyjákovice in Znojmo and Brod nad Dyjí on Břeclavsk, where the mercury climbed to 37.8 degrees, but did not break the record.
By contrast, for example, in western and northwestern Bohemia, today's highest temperatures so far were only around 22 degrees Celsius today's highest temperatures.
"Temperatures didn't start growing there until later in the afternoon," the meteorologists said.
The current heat in the Czech Republic will gradually subside according to the ČHMÚ and more significant rains could also come on Sunday.
In most places of Moravia, however, the high temperatures will remain on Friday and in southeast Moravia on Saturday.
We've had such a mischief here.
Billionaires are not satisfied with the same vote in the election as every single person of the country.
They want to make decisions directly, and because not everyone is as brazen as Andrej Babiš, who wants to own the state, they buy political parties.
Penta owner Marek Dospiva, along with other fellow under-water fellows Martin Burda and Antonín Fryč, is sponsoring Robejšk's Realists.
The second life of the Civic Democratic Alliance is funded by the owner of the insurance company and the real estate entrepreneur, Pavel Sehnal, who is also chairman of his party.
Convicted corruptor and king of Czech gambling Ivo Valenta acquired the Private Members Party.
The political movement Agrofert, as the Andrej Babiš project inadvertently named by the Kroměříž mayor Jaroslav Němec, is a chapter for itself.
Their billionaire was also recently caught by the Mayors.
It is Dalibor Dědek, owner of the company for the signalling equipment Jablotron.
In his own words, he enters politics to do good.
Entrée in the mayor's jersey, however, did not go very well for the Grandpa.
"I never dreamed of small goals," he said at a press conference.
This means that my goal is for the Yes movement to get the Mayors' Movement to get 20 percent in the election.
Some smiled a little.
The President's slip-up, however, is rather significant.
Billionaire Dalibor the Old Man is a man of firm views.
While he intends to compete for the votes of the Mayors, he continues to support Andrej Babiš.
The old man had supported Babiš in the last parliamentary elections.
"Babiš is not a seasoned speaker and does not rule the pleasing rhetoric of political snakes," he wrote of him before the 2013 election.
But he certainly does not go into politics because he would like to personally improve.
For me, Babiš will remain a hero.
He's willing to step out of his world, which is in control, and do something for all of us.
Shortly after the Mayors presented him as a new addition, he confessed his admiration for Babiš again.
And he said he wanted the Mayors to learn to present the possible collaboration with Babiš.
Some may appreciate that the Old Man does not change his views and stands by his or her own, no matter what jersey he or she is wearing.
Others can speculate whether Babiš is sending his B to the Mayors to build his B-men for someone this clumsy.
Others may ask whether the head of Jablotron, for example, with the head of Agrofert, has gone wrong in the shop and is not looking for another way to resist his business rival.
The first of the Old Man's public appearances, however, were not just around Babiš.
The grandfather promised to send ten million crowns to the Mayor's campaign.
And if they need more money, they say, he'll send more.
A few years ago, it would have been hard for anyone to question such a statement.
Indeed, the judicially recognized crook, Zdeněk Bakala, was throwing millions at all parties before the 2010 elections.
The political division of the security agency Víta Bárta, TOP 09 and the Civic Democrats came together for nearly thirty million.
But today is a different time.
The law prohibits anyone from giving a political party more than three million.
When the Old Man is entering politics, he could at least have studied the rules of the game.
Perhaps then he would not have to wonder why politics has such a bad reputation with us.
The first days in politics were crowned by the Old Man by proposing a tax credit for families with studied children.
People with a college education come to about fifty thousand a month.
Those with the base at less than 20.
A man with fifty thousand is rich by the standards here.
The one with the 20 poor.
In the Grandfather's vision of society, the poor pay taxes honestly, and the rich enjoy the benefits of the functioning of the welfare state, which they are not very involved in running.
The rich, in short, need to be helped to avoid squandering the misery with the need.
Mayors can congratulate each other on their new acquisition, and Babiš's hands are to be wrubbed up.
The rest of us, thanks to the Grandpa, can confirm that billionaires are not good people.
The question then remains as to who to vote for.
For me, those who know the rules of the game and want to follow them.
Those who do not have their party members or citizens and citizens of the state as their employees and country their property.
And finally, those who want to make a rich country live well for all people, not just some.
No one wanted Trump's paradise.
The villa complex had to be reduced by 234 million.
Selling a property is sometimes not easy.
And often he won't be helped by 11 bedrooms, a gorgeous view of the sea, or the fact that the property is being sold by US President Donald Trump.
At the sale of the Le Chateau des Palmiers's villa complex, the price went down by an a whopping £8 million.
This was reported by the website Mirror.co.uk.
The brochure says of the property: "Happy, Donald J. Trump."
Escape to the site like no other.
But even the real estate company's association with the US president did not defend the extreme price tag.
Donald Trump had to cut the price of his Caribbean residence by an astonishing £8 million.
The original price of the property was £21.5 million, the final price dropped to £13 million.
Even after the discount, the villa complex therefore costs about 76 average flats in the centre of Prague.
And it's not surprising.
The breathtaking 5 acres of the Caribbean island of Saint Martin has 12 full bathrooms, 11 bedrooms, many canteens, gym and other rooms.
It consists of several buildings.
The property also includes a swimming pool and a tennis court.
Dozens of palm trees are planted on the property.
The terrace offers a wonderful view of the sea.
According to real estate experts, the price was reflected in the fact that the merger with the president was not sufficient to attract potential buyers.
Now the property is closer to the normal property prices on the island.
Trump bought the property in 2013.
Speculation says he paid around £15 million.
The property was to be purchased for the purposes of the lease.
Le Chateau des Palmiers was the most expensive property on the island of St. Martin.
With the new award, however, it ranks second.
The property in the neighbourhood was valued at £13.5m.
The NCAA decided to end two training sessions a day. For the Bruins, long days
The 11th morning is approaching, and UCLA's UCLA's American football players are crowding the sidelines of the new school playground.
Some of them take off their jerseys and reveal their sweaty backs, an unmistakable sign of the first day of the training camp.
For most of the team members of this few minutes of doing nothing, the lunch break is supplanting.
Players enrolled in the summer semester will retire to the rooms after three hours of training to study for the final exams before returning to the Wasserman Football Center for the meeting to be held in the upcoming morning at 6:30 a.m.
"There's going to be a lot of work for these guys for the next three days," said Bruins coach Jim Mora moments before Monday went on Tuesday.
By eliminating two training sessions in one day, the NCAA wants to relieve the players - ironically, the training days are even longer - at least until Friday, when the final exams are over.
That's why the first three UCLA training sessions are scheduled for 7:15 p.m. to be squeezed into the already crowded diaries of many students.
For the first time in the six seasons Mora spent coaching at Westwood, the Bruins' training camp starts a week earlier than last year, and training sessions are limited for the summer semester. The decision to limit the number of training sessions from two to one a day also has its effect.
A total of eighteen practice sessions are scheduled for August 20, with formal preparations for the first game against the Texas A&M team, which takes place in September.
Mora has been quoted as saying that he supported the NCAA's decision, even though it added another item to the players' already charged diary.
"Three or four days, the players are under a lot of stress and it's very exhausting for them," Mora said.
"But no one has given up, everyone is trying. They're great.
I think on Saturday, when we have more time, things will calm down."
The UCLA will be closed after the training camp is over, which will not be easy to see the clear lines of the surrounding land from the adjacent car park and the luxurious Luskin Center, which was occupied by the players after the protection net behind the goal pole.
The Bruins players should occupy the hotel from this week, but Mora acknowledges that when the rooms are emptied during the season, there could be a problem.
"The land will be guarded by the security service," Mora added.
"Safe is taken care of, but it's possible that someone can rent a room and record our training sessions.
Such material is well traded.
Fortunately, the hotel will be guarded by security, as will parking lot no. 8.
We will use our resources to the maximum.
I believe everything will be all right.
It's all planned."
Facebook plans to check more thorough facts to limit the number of fake news
Facebook will send more potentially fake articles to inspect third parties and view findings under the original posts in an effort to combat the so-called "fake news," the largest social network said on Thursday.
The company writes in a statement on its website that it will start using updated machine learning to detect possible hoaxes, which it will send to third parties for verification and potentially display the survey results below the original posts.
Facebook has been described as one of the main sources of fake news, and many believe that these unconfirmed reports influenced the presidential election of the United States last year.
There is a political debate about the matter in Europe. French voters are inundated with an avalanche of false news about the presidential election in May, and Germany plans to impose a fine on the social media network in advance of the September elections if it does not promptly remove angry contributions.
Facebook said in a further statement issued in Germany on Thursday that it is preparing to launch a new feature of the Checking of fake news in the US, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
"In addition to displaying messages authenticated by third-party, people are asking for more content to be better informed and to make the right choice to decide what to share," Sara Su, Facebook's product news executive, said on her blog.
It added that Facebook was continuing to test the "related articles" feature and is also working on further changes to reduce the number of fake news.
Creating a graphic novel: a story about A Castle in England
Scotney Castle, the small castle, recently starred in Squeeze's music video, and Margaret Thatcher also found her refuge in it during the 1970s and 1980s.
But Scotney witnessed 700 years of stormy history from his cozy spot by the Bewl River in Kent, Britain, in Kent, Britain, that inspired the curly-haired Jamie Rhodes of York County - known for his penchant for historical documentaries - to create a graphic novel.
"The sight of a man's writing that is 300 years after death fascinates me," Rhodes says with a straight face.
"When I hold the letter in my hands, I feel a personal connection."
The Graphic Recent A Castle in England documents the lives of families who have been staying at the Scotney Castle since the Middle Ages to the Eduardo Quaest. Each story is illustrated by a different British artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
But it is not Rhodes's first book inspired by the archives: he is also the author of the Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories (2014), a collection inspired by the British Library - a project that was very emotional for him.
"I was intrigued by a thumbprint on a letter written by a double agent in the '70s who worked for the Yakobites,' he said.
"That's his thumbprint!
And the letters always smell like smoke, because in those times you had to light a candle to read.
If I sniff the letter now, 300 years later, it's like I'm back in time.
How I love the archives!"
For someone who is so fascinated by old papers, support from the National Trust and Arts Council is the England and the opportunity to dwell in the castle for almost four months almost as a dream. ["To tell you the truth, I've extended my stay a little longer.")
Rhodes spent his time exploring the Victorian "new" castle, browsing archives and studying many treasures and curiosities, such as the head of the hyena on the wall and bottles that had been dumped for centuries in the ditch.
He walked around the property and explored the ruins of the old castle, talking to the gamekeepers, the gardeners, and occasionally with the artists who worked on the illustrations for his book.
At night, he "drinked on whiskey and wrote."
Scotney's confidential history is relatively largely unknown, as the National Trust did not gain access to the documents until 2006 after the death of the last heir, Elizabeth Hussey.
When Rhodes arrived at the post ten years later, the staff was only beginning to infiltrate the archives Rhodes described in words as when "the Arabists of many centuries throw up their hands with their hands, saying, 'Take it to the attic'."
The journals, letters from the time of the British Empire, the maps depicting the fortunes: "Maybe you think the land dispute is boring," Rhodes said, "but I came across a case where two families tusfighted over the birch.
Stop it, people!”
Some of the stories in the book use the castle as a springboard and delve deeper into English history, including a story called The Labourer, which follows the man who will leave the newly built castle to join the English uprising of 1381.
"I found a record of the castle rioting from the 1380 castle, which was called Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex in the book," Rhodes said.
"The English uprising actually started in this area, and it occurred to me that rebellion was a good starting point.
Perhaps they are connected after all."
Other stories are firmly linked to the history of the castle - for example, The Priest, which tells the story of a Jesuit priesthstrated by Darrell's family for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or The Smuggler, about an 18th-century smuggler named Arthur Darrell, who supposedly staged his own funeral when he filled the coffin with stones (which was not discovered until a few years after the coffin was uncovered).
The Rhodes' favourite family is Darrell's: "I was intrigued by the male generation - the men of the time were always in debt and spent money on things they could not afford.
Various generations of the Darrell family dealt with this by marrying rich or old missus - I imagine they were handsome gentlemen who liked to headlist to the heiresses.'
With the end of his stay at the castle, Rhodes is searching for further adventures.
He recently returned from a two-week gig in the Finnish wilderness, where he was taking inspiration for his next book on Elämänmäki, a former sanatorium from the early 20th century that was consumed by nature.
But it is a special place for Scotney.
"I was sad when I left," he said.
"I was like, 'Now get back to the hell of a real life.'"
Washington changes green card awarding conditions
The media has published President Donald Trump's words about a new US immigration plan that will also make a green card change.
This is expected that the number of legal immigrants will fall by 50,000 year-on-year as a result of the stricter rules on the granting of temporary work visas and the reduction of family visas.
The new rules are proposed by Republicans and the president.
The bill will soon be submitted to Congress.
"This law will reduce poverty, raise wages, and save billions of dollars in tax payers. We will achieve this by changing the rules for issuing green cards to the residents of other countries.
The law will limit the number of immigrants and replace the current scheme.
The new application process will be prioritized by English-speaking applicants who are funded and will show skills that will benefit our country," Trump, a quoted media.
Sexual robots are on the rise - we should be on the lookout
Just when it seemed that 2017 could not be more bizarre, news of the technological development of sexual robots will appear online.
Yes.
Sex robots are really popular at the moment.
The Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) recently issued a statement on the development of sexual robots for the next five to 10 years.
In the words of a former professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at Sheffield University and the co-founder of the FRR Noel Sharkey, the rise of sexual robots must be seen seriously.
Customers can choose the color of the eyes, the nipple shape and the appearance of the fingernails of the robot.
"People are making fun of them, but sales are growing and we must be prepared to see them more and more often," said Sharkey on the occasion of the release of the report.
Modern sex aids are transformed from inflatable pan to robotic women with silicone skin, which is pleasantly warm to the touch - of course, the artificial intelligence that mimics a person's behavior.
The user can "adjust" the robot in their own image - from the colour of the eyes and nipple shape to the appearance and colour of the nails.
Very disturbing, however, is the fact that many robots have their own "personality" that would also shame the Stepford missus.
Modern inflatable dolls have evolved into robotic women with silicone skin.
The owner of the RealBotix robot can set his surrogate character traits, among them the shyness.
And then there is the sexual robotic woman Roxxxy Gold of True Companion, which is supplied with pre-programmed personalities, including "frigid Farrah," which is characterized by the shy nature and "wild Wendy" with a "adventative" nature.
"The capacity of the Roxxxxy Gold is set up to suit your personality to the maximum extent possible," reads the True Companion website.
So she likes what you like and vice versa.
It's even moody, just like the people.
She can be tired, talkative or "in the mood."
The rise of sexual robots is alarming for several reasons - not one of whom is not a confusion for actual interpersonal relationships. Rather, the inferior female character traits and forcible innuendo - such as frigid (read the defiant) Farrah - are more disturbing.
On its website, True Companion likens the Roxxxy to a vibrator for men.
"If a woman can have a vibrator, why can't a man have a Roxxxxy?" the page reads.
But sex robots are not just a fetish or a sex aid.
Their emergence and almost perfect sophistication point to something darker and deeply rooted in our culture - a push back from ideal or sexual equality towards a desire for captivating sex with an optional surcharge.
Most men, of course, do not buy a robotic woman, and while FRR talks about their growing popularity, sex robots still remain on the fringes of interest from the general public.
However, this marginal interest may become a mirror set by the modern age.
And most people are not weird or violent until a free market has given them a pretext.
It is no coincidence that these sophisticated sex robots appear at a time when women all over the world are making their rights and the White House is sitting in a president who is often very derogatory to the woman's address.
The most horrific aspect of the series The Toleve of the Handmaid is not what we see - hanged bodies and hollowed out eyes, but rather the reality of these visions.
The book's masterpiece's story represents a step in the right direction, but at the moment it seems to be a small step.
Sex robots should, as far as possible, resemble real women (albeit with the standards of a porn actress).
Their creators design them to be pleasant to the touch and act at first glance as a real woman.
But when it comes to their "personality," a robot cannot replace a real woman.
They can't break up with their partner or just walk away.
They have no job or history. Nothing to stimulate their independence or undermine their devotion to its master.
In other words, they're pleasant slaves.
Speaking of the 21st century: maids.
NBA star on the green arm.
Curry is fighting for a cut in California.
Star basketball player Stephen Curry, despite a botched first-round strike, was not lost in his first start to professional golfers.
The two-time NBA Most Valuable Player Award winner played the lower Web.com Tour in the tournament at the Melens Bargain Tour's tournament, the Web.com Tour, in the California-Arooper, for the 74 round, and will be vying for the cut.
The Golden State quarterback, who won his second NBA NBA title with the Warriors this season, started off nervously, and his first tee shot ended up in a beverage bracket parked at the fairway's.
Even then, he was not as accurate between the holes as he was under the basketball basket, yet he left a dozen professionals with a four-shot record over par.
"It wasn't the ideal way to start, to have to call the referee right after the first tee, but then it kind of sat out," Curry said, noting that he was struck by a huge stage fright.
It was very nervous to hit the first shot in the tournament, but it was all I had hoped for.
"If you'd told me I'd play 74 in the first round, I'd take it immediately," he added.
If Curry manages to fight his way through the cut, which is likely to be set for two shots under par, he will become the first representative of another sport to do it on the Web.com Tour.
"I want to play better next time and now that I've got rid of my stage fright, hopefully it will work," said the enthusiastic golfer, who has played in celebrity tournaments as well as mixed competitions for amateurs and professionals in the past.
In Hayward, he is starting for the first time in a tournament that falls under the PGA.
He received a sponsorship exemption to participate in the Ellie Mae Classic and retained his amateur status.
The Web.com Tour is one category under the elite PGA Tour.
Trump's big victory?
Against this, Mitt Romney is the embodiment of common sense
The unmistakable sign of the Trump era is the political divisions that divide American voters and, on a micro-alspan, break entire families.
Over the Christmas and Thanksgiving season, the American newspapers were teeming with advice on how to deal with the relatives who voted for Trump.
We're supposed to be just waiting for our nerves to get the nerve.
But less attention is paid to Trump's ability to bring families together.
I'm talking about it because my cousin came to see me in New York this week - a poet and a fan of the left who lives in Chicago and who has been paying for a Republican fool in our family for a long time.
She reminded me that the tightness in the face of a common enemy could have a powerful effect.
Now, with Trump in the White House, the whole family - including all the Republican siblings she's bickered about politics for years - is suddenly on the same page.
It's a good thing at a family table dinner; but it strikes me that it poses a significant risk in a broader context.
Trump is strengthening the left, but the negative effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right.
If we're talking about "normalization" and Trump, we're referring to the terrifying possibility that his shenanigans may one day lose their attractiveness.
But there is an even more horrific long-term scenario in which Trump "normalizes" right-wing Republicans who, contrary to his standards, will suddenly emboddle in what might be called rational.
In these today, with nostalgia in my heart, I remember Mitt Romney and his version of the crazy dealings - a dog on the roof of a car, a 14% income tax (at least we were aware of his tax return) - both of which look like very mild offenses compared to Trump.
After Trump's departure, the subsequent Republican nominee is at least normal, which will be an immense improvement.
We used my cousin's visits and took the kids to Central Park for the biggest carousel run by the New York Parks Department - you won't find a better use for your $3, unless you need caffeine.
The horses are immense, the centre roller is covered with fiberglass - clowns and animals are filmed and gazed in horror at their own shoulders - a completely grim view and tinkling music, strangely, resembles public transport.
Many clichés will soon get tired: the view from the high-rise buildings, the panorama is peeked in, instead of breathing on you through the atmosphere, and the reality of the city does not get your ideas.
Thirty-five years later, I still didn't get over the fact that Swiss Cottage is not really Swiss cheese - not counting the Ye Olde Swiss Cottage theme pub - but a London Underground Station.
Nevertheless, the carousel in Central Park evokes a remarkably magical experience, to the extent that two two-year-olds are having a great time, as do two mature women.
If I could judge the carousel, he deserved the maximum of points. Fortunately, no one is asked.
I had a similar experience at the store this week when I was asked to review my "experience" on a scale from one to five when I paid with a credit card.
It's the same in the café on the corner of my street, except I can throw a 15% tip on the evaluation for something I buy behind the counter.
Not only does it slow down the otherwise fast sale, but the waitress is thus forced to wrap in the favor of shoppers when it is not needed.
The woman at the store was smiling at me, smiling, apologetically when I reluctantly rated my credit card for the five-star credit card.
Oscar Pistorius was taken from prison to hospital for chest pain
This is the second time Pistorius has had to be taken to hospital.
Last year, he was treated for cuts to the wrists he had caused himself after falling in a cell, according to the prison.
Pistorius was convicted of murder following an appeal against the original murder sentence.
He killed his girlfriend Steenkamp in the early hours of the morning on Valentine's Day in a couple of rounds of gunning through the toilet cupboard door at his home in Pretoria.
Pistorius claimed he had mistaken her for a thief.
Prosecutors announced their intention to re-release, this time against the six-year sentence of Pistorius, which they say is too lenient.
The National Prosecuting Authority has said it will appeal to South Africa's Supreme Court and the trial will take place later this year.
If successful, Pistorius faces an extension of the sentence to up to 15 years.
In South Africa, the death penalty does not apply.
For the first time in history, a baby was born captive to a bred panda who had coil in the wilderness.
This is a huge success for the panda rescue program.
The center is trying to expand the gene pool of pandas chased in captivity.
The center's worker, Zhang Zhong, told the New China News Agency that the panda breeding was at great risk of kinship of kownership.
In fact, only 471 pandas lived in captivity at the end of last year.
There are only two thousand survivors in the wild.
The attempt to pair captured pandas with the wild ones is thus the first step towards the breeding of pandas helping to protect this species.
Cchao-cchao, 15, was released into the nature reserve at the start of the Panda's mating period on 11 March.
Thanks to the tracking device on their necks, scientists could observe her every move.
She met her chosen one, Cao-cchao, 12 days later.
The sexual intercourse with the male's panda lasted a minute and a half and was successful.
This, too, can be considered a minor miracle, because the Panda males are not considered the most successful lovers of the animal kingdom.
Males are fairly miscalculating the time when the female is ready, plus they are often confused and have no idea what to do.
The cub was born healthy and, even as Chao-chao had an extra appetite during her pregnancy, weighed 216 grams after giving birth.
The average weight of a newborn panda is 70 grams lower.
For illegal camping in Greece, two Bulgarians detained
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced the detention of two Bulgarian tourists in the territory of Greece for illegal camping, the comments quoted by BTV.
A group of tourists, including two Bulgarians, was detained by the Sithonian police in the early hours of August 1.
All were released on the same day, but the investigation continues.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs said for bTV that Bulgarian tourists were later released.
The Greek authorities have tightened the rules on free camping and are imposing strict fines on anyone caught at a place where camping is not allowed.
Checks will take place all season.
The ministry said the court could impose a fine.
Spilková is in 50th place after the first round of the British Open.
Golfer Klára Spilková ranks 50th after the first round of the British Open major.
The playground at the Kingsbarns in Scotland was rounded off with a one-stroke score under par, making three birdies and two bogeys.
The 22-year-old Czech player is thus hopeful of making the cut for the first time at the famous major.
Entering the $3.25 million competition, American star Michelle Wie, who won the first round in a 64-shot field record, eight under par, came out the best.
Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands are pulling millions of toxic eggs from the market.
The Netherlands itself has already temporarily closed 180 poultry farms due to the incident.
The Dutch Food Safety Safety Authority, according to Reuters, the Dutch authority reported that it is investigating 20 percent of all Dutch poultry farms, which it said means that 80 percent of the eggs on the market are safe.
The Authority stressed that the risk was only a limited number of egg types that could be discernible according to specific figures.
According to the German authorities, the amount of the toxic substance in the eggs is small and does not pose a danger to adults, but it is a potential threat to children.
Czech JIS spokesman Petr Majer said that eggs and chicken eggs from the Netherlands and Belgium, where the authorities have also approached the closure of breeds, have not been imported to the Czech Republic in recent times.
However, veterinarians will take random samples of eggs and chicken meat originating in Belgium, the Netherlands, France, Italy, Germany and Poland, with the insecticidal problem marks appearing on the markets.
The eggs from Belgium were on the Czech market for the last time in April and eggs from the Netherlands for the last time in May, according to the veterinary administration.
Chicken meat from Belgium last appeared in the Czech Republic in June.
In the Czech Republic, however, there is a certain amount of chicken meat from the Netherlands.
Fipronil is a substance that is usually part of flea preparations, everything and ticks.
However, it must not be given to animals whose meat is consumed by humans.
The WHO, the World Health Organization, considers the preparation to be slightly toxic.
His high doses lead to a feeling of nausea and dizziness.
Riga is beautiful, I will miss him, says goalkeeper Sedláček and is looking for an engagement.
I'd like to catch ten more years.
"Maybe I'll go back there one day," said 27-year-old Sedláček, who could start the season in the Zlín jersey.
It depends on whether he gets an engagement before the start of the new year.
What were the four years you had in Latvia?
If I had to rate it like I did at school, three.
The first year I didn't catch much, I had an experienced goalkeeper in front of me.
I was studying.
The second year I started catching.
Before the third season, I thought they would give me more space.
But they brought in a new goalkeeper, with whom I took a turn again.
I assumed last year that I would catch all the time.
But we only scored maybe five points during the opening ten games, so the coaches started shooting it.
At the end, my colleague was catching more.
But that's how you do it.
They wanted to play it for next season.
How was life in Riga?
Beautiful.
It's a small Prague.
A beautiful, European, historic city.
I'll miss him.
I found a girlfriend there.
We're together for the third year, we'll be getting married next year.
So I brought something.
How demanding is the KHL for the goalie?
The first ten teams are really good quality.
Then there are the teams like us or the Slav, who have to change their playing style against them.
The skills are on the other side, so you have to replace it with something.
That means playing backwards, fighting more.
In the width of the pitch, I didn't see the problem.
The difference is the Russians want to play to the blanks.
They shoot less, and even though they have a half-empty goal in front of them, they prefer to record.
There are more shots in the Czech Republic.
Didn't you have a problem with travelling and moving over seven time zones?
If you don't have a family, it's not a problem.
He can get some sleep.
The program is usually made so that you play, like, four matches out there and then you have two days off.
How do the Latvians feel about their club in the KHL?
As a national team.
The whole of Latvia watches hockey, along with basketball it is a national sport.
They're all rooting for.
Even when things weren't going well, a lot of people came.
Did Dinamo's KHL play to help Latvia almost advance to the quarterfinals at this year's World Cup?
The KHL has been playing since 2008 and Dinamo has been there since the start.
And from the same time, their World Cup results began to go up.
At the 2014 Olympics in Sochi, they fell to Canada in the quarterfinals with Canada just 1:2.
That was an incredible result for them.
Thanks to the KHL, they reached a higher level.
More and more Latvian players are heading to the Czech Extraliga.
Roberts Bukarts came through in Zlín and is Ralfs Freibergs before signing the contract.
Why is it that so many come here?
They're not B's players, they're really quality.
The teams here are looking for cheaper and younger players from abroad, the Latvians are among them.
It's a natural direction.
The KHL starts in three weeks.
Why are you still without an engagement?
I knew at the beginning of February that I would not continue in Riga.
That's how we started looking for something.
On the table was Sparta.
But because they didn't have a budget for a goalkeeper, we didn't make a deal.
Then it was a classic.
We talked to different teams, but they decided for someone else in the final.
So I'm training at home in Zlín and wait for something to come up.
Aren't you nervous about it?
That's when I left here four years ago, and I didn't know what was going to happen.
The current situation is not the best, on the other hand I am at home after a while.
I caught something in the KHL, so I'm taking it differently.
The only question is when and where I'm going to sign.
How real is the option of starting the new year in Zlín?
Anything can happen.
We'll see what happens in a month, where what emerges.
Now I can only wait to see what the agent says.
Do you prefer a competition?
The past season was not enough to be able to choose.
So I'm waiting for the phone.
The government's fling at Let continues.
In January this year, in an article with the care of a proper housekeeper? I also wrote about the camp at Lety u Orlík.
The essence of the problem remains the same, so I would like to recall the key passages of the article.
The camp at Lety has been talked about for many years.
For readers who don't know exactly what's going on, it's probably best if they look at, for example, the official website of the cultural monument Pietní místo Lety.
There, in the introduction to the historical overview, they learn that the camp stood two kilometres east of the village of Lety, that from 8. 8. 1940 served as a labour camp, from 1. 1. 1942 was a collection camp and from 2. 8. In 1942, he became a Gypsy camp.
The next text describes the course of life in the camp, including inhuman conditions, until March 1943, when the first Leaf prisoners were assigned to the Auschwitz transport.
Day 4. 5. 1943 370 people were transported by the largest transport to the extermination camp.
There were 420 in all.
A very sad history of the immense hardships of human beings, which were again caused by human beings and perverted ideology.
There is no doubt that these events must be constantly remembered.
Nor is there any dispute that the commemoration should take place at the memorial at the site of the experience of these people.
The problem is elsewhere.
Under socialism, the camp was somehow forgotten a bit, and in the 1970s a pig farm was built near and part of the former camp.
The history of the camp was accidentally discovered in 1992 by the American Paul Polansky, and a memorial was unveiled at Lety in 1995.
In the mid-1990s, the government promised to buy and demolish the pig farm, but so far this has not happened.
In 1998 the monument was declared a cultural monument and since 2009 its administration has been under the Lidice Memorial.
In July 2013, the UN Human Rights Committee called on the Czech Republic to close the pig farm.
So much for very briefly the facts of the camp's post-war fate.
It was not until last autumn that the government approved the purchase of the pig farm and decided to have an expert report to determine the price be drawn up.
According to the Minister of Agriculture, the government will then buy the pig farm.
According to the Minister of Culture Herman, "there are some numbers, but I'd probably be wasting those intentions if I went public with them."
We'll see what the expert opinion brings.
According to some unofficial estimates, it may be hundreds of millions, according to others, the price can reach as much as a billion.
Either way, it's not going to be a cheap proposition.
And yet there is almost ten million crowns of the memorial just a few hundred metres from the former camp, in whose modifications the state invested almost ten million crowns in 2010.
Even if the full transaction were funded by the UN Human Rights Committee, which is unlikely to be the case, I think it would be a waste of money anyway.
Doesn't the government have other priorities?
The monument, a dignified reverent place, stands with the will of history practically in the immediate vicinity of the tragedy, and anyone who wants can bow to the memory of the suffering and the murdered.
I see no reason to change this!
Let's leave it to the way it is, and keep the reverent place with the utmost care.
The entrusted property, including the taxpayer's money, should be treated with the care of a proper treasurer by the responsible person, in this case the government of the Czech Republic.
At least with the one, like in your own company!
Of course, the Minister of Finance and the Deputy Prime Minister is not the whole government.
Even so, from the point of view of the above, I see the slogan of the leader of the ANO movement only as an empty pre-election proclamation.
In May this year, I went to see the place.
Very decent driveway, landscaped parking, replicas of wooden camp barracks.
In one exhibit, in the other an integrated toilet with running water.
A small natural amphitheatre with seating and a view of its own memorial site, which is made of stones located on a gentle slope.
Lots of flowers and wreaths.
All attributes appropriate to the meaning of this place as appropriate.
Archaeological research is currently underway at the site of the original camp.
It would be sensible to consider whether it would be possible, for example. a section of the uncovered foundations to be mothballed and at least visually accessible in an appropriate manner.
This is the direction forward by the Minister of Culture, Daniel Herman, to his efforts.
In the event that he succeeds in the government to buy the farm with state money, it will be just another unfortunate step in his already rather problematic tenure as Minister of Culture.
Red meat, dairy products and chocolate may relieve symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
For your digestive system, red meat and dairy products can be a nightmare.
But a new study suggests the opposite: a diet rich in animal protein and dairy products could help relieve the symptoms of inflammatory bowel diseases.
The inheinemally ill-priced disease, which affects up to 1.3 million people in the US and 300,000 patients in the UK, causes abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
Patients are usually reminded not to use meat and dairy products to relieve symptoms. However, University of Washington researchers found that the essential amino acid tryptophan contained in the protein helps to create immune cells that promote bowel resistance.
Head of study dr. Marco Colonna explained that immune cells protect the intestines and ensure the degradation of harmful microbes from food.
The number of inflammatory cells is balanced by the number of cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissue.
Once the scales tilts to the side of the inflammation, there may be an inflammatory bowl disease.
As part of the research, researchers found the presence of immune cells supporting the body's tolerance in the stomach of mice with a particular bacterium.
This bacterium requires the presence of tryptophan to form the cells - one of the building blocks of the proteins.
Professor Colonna said, "We have found a link between one type of bacterium - the Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the intestinal microbiome and the development of cells that promote the tolerance of the body.
The more tryptophan the mice had in their diet, the more these immune cells had."
At the same time, he suggested that if the same thing turned out to be true for humans, then a combination of L. reuterium and tryptophan-rich bacteria would help develop a more tolerant and less inflammatory bowel environment.
Postgraduate researcher dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barraganwas, in the study of a certain type of body-enhancing immune cells that promotes the tolerance of the body, discovered that one group of test mice had these cells, while the other was missing from the same mouse-beharmed group of cells.
It drew from the fact that one group of mice has a different gut microbiome - a community of bacteria, viruses and fungi that normally dwells in the gastrointestinal tract.
The mice shores were tested by the DNA-gear and the researchers found six types of bacteria in mice with immune cells that were missing from the second group of mice.
MMs, which were bred in a sterile environment and lacked the gut microbiome - so they did not develop this type of immune cells - was administered by L. reuteri - and created immune cells.
To understand how bacteria affects the immune system, researchers grew L. reuteri in the liquid and then transferred a small amount of fluid - without a bacterium - to undeveloped immune cells that were stored in isolation.
The immune cells developed into tolerant cells.
After removing the active ingredient from the liquid, it was shown to be a by-product of tryptophan metabolism known as indolyl-3-xic acid.
When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the mice diet, the amount of these cells increased by 50 percent. At the same time, after the doses of tryptophan, the number of cells dropped by half.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that humans have the same tolerant cells as mice, and most of us store L. reuteri in their gastrointestinal tract.
It is not known if the tryptophan by-products from L. reuteri bacteria cause the development of cells in humans in the same way as in mice, but the defects in the tryptophan-related genes were found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan added: "Each of us should probably strive to develop these cells because they control the inflammatoryness of the intestines' inner surface.
Potentially high levels of tryptophan in the presence of L. reuteri can increase the cell population."
Jose Mourinho considers signing a contract with Nemanj Matić and his transfer to Manchester United to be 'genius'
Manchester United have recruited a "genus" in the form of Nemanja Matić to their team - or so Jose Mourinho thinks after the midfielder made his debut in Wednesday's match against Sampdoria.
Matic, who signed a £40m contract, was released in his first match with a 2-1 win at Dublin - the last pre-season match before the UEFA Super Cup, where United will meet with Real Madrid on Tuesday - and impressed in his role as midfielder alongside Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira.
However, as he did not take part in the team's pre-season Asia tour, Matic was in form and played only 45 minutes, which Mourinho said needed to be worked on before the start of the next Premier League season.
'He takes time, but he's experienced, intelligent and he's brilliant thinking - he's thinking football,' Mourinho said.
"We'll help him get fit as soon as possible."
Like Matic, his new teammates Victor Lindelöf and Romelu Lukaku also played their first game at Aviva Stadium and Mourinho is slowly starting to shape his 11th for the next season.
The independent source announced this week that Mourinho still wants to sign with three other players, but insists that the club has done a "fantastic job" and brought three of the four most important players to the team.
"Thank you to the club for helping me recruit three of the four players," he added.
"Four of four would please me more, but I admit they did their best for me."
Life's challenge to the king of chicken skins, Ládi Hruška.
He wants a lesson from Pohlreich!
The multifarious picture began to take shape thanks to a new show on TV Prima's Zdenek Academy.
Pear immediately sniffed the chance.
"Dear Zdenek, I would like to join your cooking academy with this, because I think I can learn a lot from you," he said in a social media video.
And since the two of them have been tiptoeing for several years, Lad forgot to irritate him this time either.
"In return, I can teach you Znojmo from Diet Chicken Chicken, American Cucumber or invite you to the water and show you why the fried cheese is popular," Hruška said.
He is really serious about his participation in Pohlreich's new show.
It is time to move up a level and learn from the master.
"The question is, what the boss says," he told Lightning.
Pohlreich didn't comment because he was filming new episodes of his next show, Chef!.
Only Prima responded to Pear's participation in the culinary academy, saying he took the whole thing as his personal activity, which goes off-TV.
The big blow was dealt a blow by Hruška Pohlreich in December 2004 with his first cookbook.
Within a few days, it sold over 300,000 units!
The new show, presented by Prima at a press conference for the autumn broadcasting scheme, is a genuine cooking school.
Pohlreich selects his pupils from the audience and introduces them to twelve cooking techniques in twelve works.
In the last episode of his show Now, the boss cooks in November 2014, Zdenek had his T-shirt ironed a crossed-out pear on the back of his T-shirt.
If he had my face there, I'd have laughed a lot.
"I just smile over the pear - the pear is a healthy fruit and it has a lot of vitamins," Lada responded.
Lada's culinary arts, he thinks.
"Guoting, according to Ládi Hruška, is not an option even at home, because I don't let my gastropunk go home," the boss is clear.
I respect Zdeněk Pohlreich very much, I even make chicken on honey according to him.
But his recipes will not appear on my show," Hruška said.
He's an asshole!
He's no chef to me, he's a TV clown.
"A gastronomical illiterate or asshole," Pohlreich said of Hruška at a lecture.
"I'm not 20 to be able to wave my hand at them, but I don't deal with them that way anymore," Hruška said in the account of the insults.
The British inventor uses a microchip in his hand to unlock a car and a house with a wave
The British inventor became the first person in the country with a microchip injected into his body. With a simple wave of his hand, he can unlock the door to the house and office and even start the car.
Thinge, 33, Steven Northam, has had the tiny chip implanted between his inch and forefinger, and is currently offering the same service through his company BioTeq to companies and individuals who want to make their lives easier using technology.
The implantation procedure and the follow-up of the treatments are supervised by dr. Geoff Watson, anesthesiologist at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester.
The technology works on the same principle as microchips implanted with dogs and cats, and the entire procedure takes 30 seconds.
Northam's company also offers a microchip-compatible door and lock replacement service. The price of one chateau is £300.
The married one-child father had the technology integrated into his home and his BMW Z4 car, which he starts with a simple wave of his hand.
White House's prop for taxpayers cost the taxpayer $1,000
The White House's decision to arrive at South Lawn to mark last month's celebration of the U.S. manufacturing industry, according to Navy records published by TIME, cost $24,000.
The green white helicopter Sikorsky VH-3D, also called Marine One in the presence of the president on board, was the pinnacle of the program of the 17th. July at the White House, which was a parade of U.S. design programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and several senior White House officials surveyed a product parade from all 50 states.
The Connecticut helicopter was on display next to a yacht from Maine, a Wisconsin fire truck and a forked-shaped lifting cart from the Mississippi.
The White House military officer issued the fragmentary order, or FRAGO, and requested the presence of the helicopter less than 36 hours before the helicopter landed at South Lawn as part of an "extraordinary" event, Marine Helicopter Squadadron One (HMX-1) - the unit responsible for managing the helicopter, said.
"I wanted to make sure you had a known interest in such a major event," the HMX-1 commander wrote in an e-mail to his superior, the assistant Navy Aviation Commander's representative the day before the event began.
The report suggested that the helicopter would arrive at South Lawn 17. July at approximately 7:00 a.m. to mark the parade, which is scheduled to start at 15:00 and will remain in place until the full evacuation of the entire venue, which was planned between 18:00 and 21:00.
The email went on to say that if there was a delay in the departure from the White House, a replacement crew would be sent for a return flight due to the working time regulations.
The original crew remained in place that evening, along with the helicopter, and with them a unit of security personnel.
The records - obtained by TIME - showed not to see if the other crew had been sent.
The Hatch Act prevents civil servants from using government property for political purposes.
The records indicate that the HMX-1 is investigating a possible breach of this Regulation.
"We were wondering if it was a violation of the Hatch Act and we were assured that all was well," the commander wrote.
"It sounds like you've been blocked," the deputy commander wrote back.
This "Made in America" show was designated as an official event by the White House and the Hatch Act would not therefore apply to it.
But even official events have political subtexts.
In his participation in the events, the president pushed for a health reform that passed through the Senate and spoke of an effort to rein in the government's regulations.
The use of air transport vehicles such as Marine One or Air Force One for political purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
Presidents use them when they travel.
However, their presence purely for presentation reasons is unusual.
Trump ordered a check in February after the presidential plane was in the background at his first rally in the campaign in Melbourne, Florida. His Twitter account is overwhelmed with complaints about the use of the presidential plane to his predecessor.
"The White House is pleased with the 'Made in America' parade, which has introduced products from all 50 states made by Americans from American materials," said press secretary's deputy press secretary, Lindsay Walters.
HMX-1 helicopter crews often train landings in the Washington and South Lawn areas, rehearsing possible arrivals with the President of the United States in the White House with maximum precision.
While Trump attended the G-20 summit in Germany in early July, the HMX-1 conducted a 58 practice landing at the White House.
The flight to the Made in America parade was part of the crew's current training, the state official said.
The helicopter's unit flew the helicopter for the next eleven hours as part of the "non-presidential support missions" on the same day.
The White House said that no more props were paid for by taxpayers' money.
A Sikorsky spokesman said the company was not involved in any way in the negotiations to issue the helicopter at South Lawn.
HMX-1 does not keep records of the presidential flight budget, and the exact cost of the parade is difficult to determine, according to the navy.
According to the Ministry of Defence, the hourly price for the fiscal year 2017, the reimbursement of DoD's expenses for VH-3D is $24,380 per flight hour.
The unit's records indicate a time of 30 minutes from the Marine Corps Air Facility Quantico base in and out of Virginia.
The White House argues that the helicopter's actual operating costs are well below that amount.
"Placing taxpayers' costs based on estimates for reimbursement is very misleading," Walters said.
"These estimates include staff, maintenance and many other hidden costs that are included in the annual cost."
According to the 2015 RAND study, reimbursements for expenditure DoD do not include staff costs, but include the cost of fuel, maintenance and contract costs.
The White House press secretary at the time, Sean Spicer, advocated the use of the helicopter for the purpose of the parade.
"The Idea parade this week's show is to present products made in the US," Spicer said.
"I am aware that the Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud of the fact that they contribute to our state's defense, and that they provide work to hundreds, if not thousands, of people.
I think, like most Americans, that we are proud of the helicopter and other military installations, the production of which involves countless American citizens.
This fact is to be recalled.’
It is unclear if Trump, while rounding his rounds on South Lawn, was also seen at the helicopter. The only thing to say is that he sat behind the wheel of one of the fire trucks.
Back in the White House, Trump approached a representative of the company Sikorsky and joked with the media about his own product fleet.
"I know all I'm Scricrarian," the President said, "I own three of them."
The young woman was trapped in a swamp at Mácha Lake, and police waded to her.
The girl set off to the beach at about 2 a.m. on Sunday.
Instead of bathing, however, she remained trapped in the wetlands.
When she decided to ask the police with her cell phone for help, she had the last 12 percent of the battery.
"That's why the officers soon lost contact with her," police spokesperson Ivana Baláková said.
Several police patrols set out to the scene, which she had approximately described, but it was not at all easy to find the young woman.
"Some of the police officers had to wade through reed wetlands hundreds of meters before they smelled solid ground again underfoot," Baláková said.
And so, she was reported missing.
The officers were oriented to the direction her cries of help.
"To avoid at least this connection, they agreed with it to count out loud," the spokesperson said.
Officers did not find the woman until a quarter to five in the swamp in the Borný locality.
She was on the brink of physical and psychological strength and showed signs of hypothermia.
That's why the ambulance called in her was taken to a Czech Chesko hospital.
The connection of the Old Man to STAN?
The in-demand bride becomes a saleable girl.
That's a bit of irony.
With his web project, the prosameslusny.cz as if the billionaire were essentially telling voters that STAN was suffering from a deficit of decent people.
He also affirmed that a politically disparate bunch of lesser-known mayors and independents, in fact, had no national agenda for the House election.
Her election candidate will simply become a decent man after her interview with the Grandpa, whatever his political opinion.
Once, even Vít Bárta started out like this and it didn't work out very well.
With his hunt for decent people and personalities, who will eventually be replaced by some mayors on the ballot, which even Gazdík admitted, and Grandpa also cancels the STAN chief's favorite argument that the greatest value of the movement is precisely politically tested and experienced mayors, traditionally the most popular politicians, according to the polls.
They are now calmly replaced by hastily collected unknown personalities.
The total break with the people, after which STAN changed the logo and the slogan, was also explained by Gazdík by saying that the movement does not want to lose its identity on the candidates' candidates.
But if STAN's identity was suspected by few then, after the arrival of the Old Man, even a mere game of identity ends.
Not only Gazdík has long been outspoken against ANO Andrej Babiš, but at the first joint press conference, Dědek, who publicly praises Babiš, said as follows: "My goal is for the ANO movement, the Mayors to win twenty percent in the upcoming elections."
Let's hope he's not mistaken the movement.
The old man is a successful businessman, and a billionaire is certainly no accident.
He often talks about politics in the same way as Babiš, but unlike him, he does not build his own political brand.
For some time, STAN has been more like a reality show than a real political party, and Grandfather's helping hand seems to be making the in-demand bride even more into a shop-to-end girl.
For a while, STAN went with TOP 09, then with the Peoples, and now for a change it is looking for decent people.
Let's hope someone gets in touch.
Police dogs trained in Most flights by helicopter
Dogs specialized in searching for explosives and search dogs were rehearsed by helicopter crossing at the Lake Most today.
The police dog must not be fazed and afraid of flying, said the head of the police cynologists of the Ústí Region, Petr Tomášek.
The training of a police dog takes about two years.
At Most, both the adult trained dogs and those who are still undergoing training trained trained.
In addition to standard training, in which they were to detect sharp explosive samples around the lake and look for a lost figurehead, all 12 animals had to board a helicopter and fly over the lake.
The main purpose of the exercise is to test the dogs in the helicopter.
So that immediately after the helicopter touch down, the dog can go to work so he doesn't have a problem with the helicopter's journey.
"The helicopter will be delivered, the dog is coming and immediately searches," said Tommy.
The dog, which is restless or after the helicopter journey is unable to start working immediately, is removed from training.
"Most of the time, they are then kept by the dog handlers in the garden, for example," Tommy said.
Police have 76 dogs in the Ústí nad Labem Region with various specializations.
German Shepherds predominate, but there are also more Belgian shepherds.
The dog handler takes care of it from the puppy.
"He is raising it himself, preparing it for the service the dog will do for us," added Tommy.
The animal undergoes repeated veterinary examinations that may reveal possible medical handicaps.
If the dog is healthy and unbreakable, he takes his first exams at 20 months.
"He gets into the sharp hit around two and a half to three years," Tommy added.
The length of service in the police depends on the state of health of the dog.
It is mostly for eight to ten years.
They then mostly live with their dog handlers.
Trailer for season 3 of Narcos: Pablo Escobar is out of the game and Cali Cartel becomes the centerpiece of the Netflix hit series
Despite the end of the second season of Narcos, when the killer of Pablo Escobar is exposed, Netflix's series is far from over.
The confirmation from the streaming service has already been given to the third and fourth seasons - the former has already seen the first trailer and an outline of other negative characters.
In his third season, the DEA is centrifuging the world's richest drug cartel: Cali Cartel.
Under the leadership of four influential godparents, they operate "as a Fortune 500 society," with the only difference being that they escalate violent acts and bribe more government officials.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is the cartel leader, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) plays the brains of surgery, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) is in charge of the merger with Mexico, and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) controls New York.
Pedro Pascal returns in the new trailer as Javier Peña, the character recruiting the American and Colombian enforcers of the rights to fight drugs.
Other actors include Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishé and Arturo Castro.
The third season of Narcos will make his debut on September 1.
According to the UN, Afghan democracy relies on women in politics
Elections can only be credible if all members of society, including women, take part, the UN representative in Afghanistan said on Wednesday.
Nicholas Haysom, the UN Assistance Mission Speaker said hundreds of women are participating in local council elections, three women are competing for vice-president, and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women.
"The role of women cannot be ignored," he said in his statement on Wednesday.
Elections can only be fully representative and credible if women take part, as well as all the relevant processes involved with the election.
The local and presidential elections in Afghanistan are held on 5 April.
The Taliban have made several threats against the electoral process that moves international combat activities to the second track.
In this year's election, for the first time ever, one democratically elected government is handing over its power peacefully to the following government.
Haysom said that the strong role of women would strengthen the democracy of Afghanistan.
The Afghan Independent Electoral Commission said they made up 1.2 million women out of a total of 3.6 million registered voters.
The unique brewery is re-brewing beer.
A good beer for the re-coup brewery.
The enthusiasm and honesty of the new owners brought to life a few years ago a brewery in Lobč u Mšno.
The brewery, first mentioned in 1586, has a Renaissance core and was rebuilt into a steam-rotational operation in the nineteenth century.
It was followed by years of heyday, when the brewery was famous for its dark beers.
Unfortunately, production was halted during World War II and the brewery was nationalized in 1984.
Since then, the buildings have served the state estate.
The work of the destruction was completed by the owners of the brewery after 1989.
The abandoned area was devastated and dismantled into building materials.
In 2007, however, a new hope dawned in the form of new owners, architects Jana and Pavel Prouz.
They began to repair the buildings with the utmost respect for the spirit of the structure and every detail.
They have been careful about studying archival materials, trying to preserve the original materials and building elements.
The brewery takes the same form as it did in the nineteenth century, when its golden era began.
Their work was awarded by the brewery's declaration of a cultural monument by the Ministry of Culture, and the building became part of the European Trails of Industrial Heritage.
In 2015, they inaugurated the tradition of brewing beer.
To taste a great Lobby beer in the picturesque landscape of Kokořínsko, visit the draught in the brewery area.
In brewing beer, they use Kokořín water springing from a protected landscape area, malt from the lobbies and the chateau hops.
In the saloon you will taste the traditional light lager, as well as dark beers and specials.
And don't miss the brewery's tour, it takes place on Saturdays and Sundays at noon and at 1:30 p.m.
The largest artillery fortress of Czechoslovakia?
One of the largest forts of its type on a global scale?
Such a unique building was to be the fortress of Stachelberg between Trutnov and Žacléř, at the top of the terrain ridge above the village of Babí.
It was originally intended to be made up of up to twelve bunkers connected by large underground.
Here was to be headquarters, barracks, ammunition depots, materials, power plant, engine room and hospitals.
However, the construction was terminated by the Munich Agreement.
In less than a year, he managed to build a single massive reinforced-concrete bunker and underground spaces were broken.
Thanks to the enthusiasts of the Society of Stachelberg, who began to reconstruct the unique building in the early 1990s, you can also come to see it.
The underground is now 75 percent accessible!
The area includes, in addition to the T-S 73 infantry cabin with an exhibition and underground and an armed object of light fortification, as well as two built-up infantry chims, trenches and an educational trail of the Opevený Trutnovsko.
Refreshments, a cosy gazebo and breathtaking views of the countryside guaranteed!
This unique and beautiful Czech building has made the list alongside such monuments as the Great Wall of China, Traian's Harbour at Rome or the Assyrian Palace in Ninive and Nimrud.
The Chotěšov monastery originally from the early thirteenth century, which today consists mainly of a massive four-winged convent building above the beautiful garden.
The list he has come to, but unfortunately it belongs to unique buildings that are in danger of extinction.
But the enthusiasts don't want to give up, and they organize a lot of events to support the monastery.
One of them is the next year of the evening for the monastery of Chotěšov this Saturday, the fifth of August, where they will perform, among other things. Vladimír Mišík, Ivan Hlas, you will see fencing performances and look at the places of beautiful large buildings that are usually inaccessible.
Mostly, though, you'll enjoy the atmosphere of this great place.
You want to look the Neanderthals in the face?
The exhibition Welcome to the Neanderthals in the Pavilion of the Anthropos of the Moravian Museum in Brno attracts an unusual excursion to the deepest prehistoric times to the Stone Age, the world of our predecessors.
You will find out how the Neanderthals were able to cope with all sorts of extreme climatic conditions in a perfect way, mainly with alternating ice ages and intergilds.
Despite their simple material culture, the predators of their time were extremely successful predators.
You will also learn what they looked like, what their anatomy, their technological skills and their hunting skills were, but also their aesthetic sensibilities.
That you wouldn't say that to the Neanderthals?
Let yourself be convinced in Brno.
The 14th festival KELT & WORLD MUSIC is being held on Saturday the fifth at Veveří Castle.
In addition to great music, you'll see the building of a Celtic village, try out the Celtic way of life, including crafts, games for children and adults, divination, magic or ritual painting on the body.
There will be no misses La Quadrilla with Irish and Scottish dances, drum jamming, a game of bagpipes and an amazing fire surprise performed by Carpe Nocto.
What does Moravskoslezsko taste like?
The seventh edition of the well-known gastro-festival How to Smakj Moravskoslezsko takes place on Saturday, August 5, 2017 in the area of the Karlova Studánka mountain spa.
The chef will cook with chef Miroslav Kalina, you will taste culinary specialties and regional foods, enjoy musical and dance performances, a rich programme for children such as creative workshops, a theatre, a bouncy castle, a smallest competition pathway and, of course, a number of competitions.
Get to know the plant with one click.
Students with herbarian creation and ordinary plant lovers will be helped by the new free application Pl@ntNet.
When they're interested in what plant they've just come across on a walk, this app will advise them.
All they'll have to do is photograph the plant, and the app itself recognizes what kind it is.
The new app, which is available for both iOS and Android, was presented on Tuesday by representatives of the CEEV Ethics and Environmental Education Centre in Bratislava's Mountain Park as part of the Secret Life of the City project.
The project also involved pupils from 50 Czech and Slovak schools, who photographed and added plants from their surroundings with the app's app's database.
The newly created French app is free to download on the Secret Life of the City website.
The main goal of the French programmers was for as many people as possible to contribute to the app with their images, thus increasing the number of plants that the application can recognize.
"Already children who can hold a tablet or mobile phone in their hand can go to the forest," said this project's coordinator, Ivana Poláčková.
Based on a high-quality photo of the flower, leaf or fetus of the plant, the application can recognize its name in seconds, which in both Czech and Slovak is added under the photo.
The French allowed us to translate the application into Slovak and Czech into the Secret Life of the City project.
It is therefore welcome that users should contribute to the app with a picture of the plant that is not yet found in the database after opening an account.
"The French will evaluate whether it is beneficial and then add it to the database," Poláčková informed.
GMB's concerns about investing in the McVitie's factory in Glasgow
The union is demanding assurances from the crack makers McVitie's about the long-running commitment to be produced at the Glasgow factory.
The Scottish GMB union said the company was silent for the time being about any investment in the Tollcross factory.
The factory employs more than 500 employees who produce, among other products, the Hobnob and Rich Tea biscuits.
The owner of McVitie's, Pladis, said it had invested more than £5 million in the area in the entire area over the previous few years.
It added that the employees and representatives of the trade unions would be "between the first informed" in the event of changes to the operation of the factory.
In a letter to the building company, the GMB, Scotland's GMB unions expressed their fears that McVitie's would "not get its promises to finance and upgrade the production lines."
GMB's main organizer Drew Duffy added: "The fact that we have not received a clear response from the site supervisor about the needs of the company and the future investment plan in Tollcross is very worrying for our members.
Generations of many families have worked here, and employees come mostly from the local community and the Glasgow area, where working at the local factory is a critical pillar of decent employment in the area of high unemployment and social separation.
From a point of view of work, salaries, and utility - and despite the outlook for Brexit, rising cost of living, and falling slow production - the eastern part of Glasgow needs a desperately prosperous producer like McVitie's."
A spokesperson for Pladis said: "The Tollcross manager received a letter from GMB only yesterday and the company will issue a statement as soon as possible, as we appreciate the continuing commitment to the employees and representatives of the unions.
A regular meeting with the staff and GMB representatives in Tollcross took place two months ago and many of the problems were openly discussed at this meeting.
We were talking to employees that, as in all companies operating in extremely competitive and insecure economic conditions, we assess our operations on a regular basis, which is true for all our operations, so that we can continue to successfully compete with others.
To this she added: "In recent years, we have invested £5 million in the Tollcross area, mainly in production lines and streamlining of operations.
We greatly appreciate the heritage of Tollcross and the site and, in the event of any changes in the operation of the factory, the employees and representatives of the trade unions will be informed immediately."
Did PSG warn Barcelona of moving Neymar three years ago?
La Liga may regret his interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain will not allow Neymar to his side in his bid for her side after she put down £189m, the amount needed to buy Neymar out of the contract, but did this French team warn Barcelona of their record-breaking raid three years ago?
This sensational transfer stirred up the summer transfer waters. The Ligue 1 Club is ready to surpass more than twice the previous record-breaking figure for Paul Pogba's transfer to Manchester United, which paid £800m for him last season.
After confirming and completing the transfer, Neymar will become the world's most expensive player and, at the same time, the highest-paid professional athlete in the world - after tax, he will receive over £500,000 a week from the PSG team.
Barcelona is outraged in the way Neymar has emerged from his contract, despite the fact that a confidential source has confirmed that the club has always tried to accommodate Neymar in everything since his arrival from Santos in 2013.
But was the football world alerted to this fact by the PSG president three years ago?
When Manchester City expressed their interest in Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi warned all the club interested in taking over one of the best players from PSG.
"I'm not worried, because as soon as someone tries to get one of our players, we'll certainly reach out to one of their players," Al-Khelaifi said.
"We respect all clubs.
But if they are trying to recruit one of our players, they will face the consequences."
Barcelona appear to have crossed the imaginary line when they expressed interest in PSG midfielder Marco Verratti in the summer.
PSG made it clear that under no circumstances would they authorise the Italian national to leave. It is therefore possible that Barcelona is now swallowing a bitter pill for their daring negotiations with the departure of Neymar.
Who will explain the sanctions?
Does political punishment have broadly understood rules?
Donald Trump has given a nod to anti-Russian sanctions.
The day before, the US had imposed sanctions on Venezuelan President Maduro.
And a day earlier, Trump had written that China was doing nothing about the North Korean threat, and that this would not go on.
It, too, is the idea of sanctions like straw from shoes.
Those things can't be lumped together.
Maduro's Venezuela did embark on a journey to the dictatorship, even totalitarianism.
China is simply not behaving as the US president would like.
Russia is a chapter in itself.
But if someone wanted to summarise all of this in such a way that even a common voter, an American, European or another, understood what the system of rules was about, the policy of sanctions was based on, it would be an almost impossible task.
In the sanctions against Russia, President Trump merely lands on what President Obama has already set, only to be stamped.
So why such a commute?
Last year, Europe was terrified that if Trump won the US election, he would hug Putin and call off the sanctions.
Terrible idea.
But in practice, it is the other way around.
With Trump, sanctions are not loosening, but they are tightening.
But Europe is even more frightened.
German Minister Zypries says the Trump sanctions violate international law.
You mean that kosher is just sanctions approved by the UN Security Council?
But then there are no kosher or anti-Russian EU sanctions.
For his part, European Commission chief Juncker complains that Trump's sanctions threaten the EU's energy security.
You mean that sanctions are to be used just enough to not endanger anyone?
The regular voter is fumbling.
He has heard for three years that the fate of the anti-Russian sanctions depends only on the implementation of the Minsk ceasefire agreements in Ukraine.
Now he learns that this is about the EU's energy security.
The voter is also fumbling more broadly.
There are sanctions for Russia for being too assembled where it shouldn't be.
China is being scolded for being assembled in little.
The Venezuelan president is being punished for building a dictatorship within the borders of his country.
All the punishments or just considerations have their rationality.
But does anyone see it as a system, an order or a rule?
Andrej Babiš: I am not considering working with Okamura.
Andrej Babiš has married, criss-crosses the republic with his visionary book and is finalizing the election program.
In addition to the Pardubice Region, it has already completed all the candidates.
According to his words, he did not interfere significantly with them.
He even agreed to have the Moravian-Silesian Governor and shadow education minister, YES Ivo Vondrák.
"But if he succeeds, he will have to choose whether he wants to be an MP or a governor," Babiš confirmed his earlier opinion.
You have been annoyed by a lot of incumbents and national politicians by their thesis that directly elected mayors and mayors should run municipalities and towns on their own, with only managers.
Are you serious?
It wasn't like that.
I am a supporter of direct democracy, we elect the President directly, and I believe that we should also elect mayors and mayors.
In my book I don't talk about the dismantling of the incumbents, they might as well be there.
The question is how many there will be.
Presenting your book What I Dream About When I Accidentally Saints, I heard with my own ears that you were talking about the abolition of the councils.
I don't remember.
I was talking about the direct election and the reduction of the number of incumbents.
New York, with a population of nine million, has five districts and 51 incumbents.
Prague, with 1.2 million citizens, has 1171 representatives.
And the mayor is blamed for not building enough and not preparing major projects, but she has no competence for it.
The same is true of a government run by only two people in our history, Klaus and Zeman.
Which is not to say they did it well.
But the current prime minister is not driving anything, he is just hosting the debate.
That's not how it works.
Is that why you want to push through the majority system?
It would be ideal, but it's hard to get through.
In the program, we only have a change to a one-round election for the Senate.
We have also proposed a sliding mandate for ministers and an amendment to the House Rules to avoid unnecessary exhibitions by Members who are to work mainly in committees and committees, not to show off at the House meetings.
It is certainly not true that I want to destroy the parliamentary system.
But that's exactly what your opponents fear.
That as a dictator you will govern the government, control the House with 101 Members, abolish the counties and the Senate, and take over the country through grateful mayors and mayors.
It's definitely not that.
There is nothing wrong with debating the number of Members.
French President Macron has announced a reduction of the legislature by a third, while there are 57,000 French to one legislator, while in our country it comes to 17,000 Czechs.
But no one accuses Macron of endangering democracy.
Even if someone in the Czech Republic wins the election by a majority, we have mechanisms to prevent them from making any dramatic changes.
But the consorts are great for those who have a parliamentary majority, just look to Poland or Hungary.
There is no such threat in the case of the Yes movement.
We just need a team that works for the people in the government, not for its parties or resorts.
I do not understand, for example, why we have not been able to agree that only the salaries of teachers, staff in culture and social services will be increased.
Why did they overrule me and add 21 per cent to the GIBS members, who are already taking 60,000?
Would you like to step on that as prime minister?
The prime minister is to intervene when ministers behave uneconomically, mistake the government for a travel agency, and, with the state's money, they would like to do business as Marian Jurečka, who wanted to buy forests in Romania and land in Africa.
Ministers are not supposed to argue in the government, the contradictions are to be said outside of it.
The finished material has to go to the cabinet, there is no place for coalition rifts, force voting and business, where the decision is to be made.
How do you want to have a cohesive team when ministers are mainly acting in a partisan way?
There is a constitutional law over the parties.
When it came to the breaking of bread, Sobotka said the coalition agreement did not apply and set Babiš out of the government.
Any Prime Minister can do that.
But if he is a personality and has control abilities, he has no need for such idle gestures.
It measures everyone the same and requires a perfect performance from everyone.
Do you know who you would propose as Chancellor of the Exchequer?
I don't think about it at all, we probably won't be in that government, no one wants to work with us, although I don't know what terrible I did.
So much skepticism is misplaced.
The mayors have acquired the entrepreneur Dědek, who would like to cooperate with you, with the Peoples' wing of the inclined Jiří Čunk.
I don't think so.
The ČSSD is led by Lubomír Zaorálek, who does not rule out a coalition with ANO, and Václav Klaus Jr., who will also not oppose it, will succeed in the ODS.
I'd leave it to the voters.
Deputy Prime Minister and Vice-President of ANO Richard Brabec said you have many common points with Tomio Okamura's SPD, for example in the area of economics.
So the Okamuras come to the cocksucker as a coalition partner?
Mr. Brabec says he didn't say that.
Mr. Okamura has his political history, ran as a puppet by Vít Bárta for VV, then he got money from the Dawn for his company, there was some coup.
He is, of course, a prominent figure.
But a bit brownish.
If I take his program, he has a broad involvement of the people in the management of society, direct democracy, that's what I agree with.
I'm not asking you that at all.
I wonder if a man who has xenophobic views, is speaking to you at the gallows demonstrations and wants to leave the EU?
We are not considering working with Mr Okamura's party, I can't imagine it.
It is obvious that he went into politics to profit from it.
What about the tacit support of the communists to your minority government?
I can't even imagine it, but the voters will decide.
It will be about negotiating the winner with the second in the order, but God knows who will be the winner and who will be the two.
Of course, it is important that they are able to agree on a coalition government programme.
Let's go back to your efforts to run the state as a business.
But the government just has to follow, Prime Minister Sobotka let everything be banished, never decided.
Coalition affairs such as CEB or EGAP did not work.
After all, Sobotka is his puppet, and I think that was also the reason he fired me.
As soon as he did this, CEZ took control of the Czech government.
After all, it is unbelievable that the Prime Minister brought a resolution written by the management of ČEZ, which he instructs the Minister of Finance on how to vote at the general meeting of CEZ.
If you become prime minister, change the staffing situation in the supervisory board and replace the top management of CEZ?
Jesus, if I'm the Prime Minister, we'll see.
I'm not yet.
There are whispers that ČEZ has already sent out signals in your direction.
He would like to trade good cooperation with the ČSSD for an even better one with ANO.
So maybe after the election, everything will go on again.
I don't know about it.
I have no lobbyist Pokorny or Růžička, I am a separate unit and this is not the matter at all.
Then respond directly.
If you head a government, will you seek to replace the management of ČEZ, Czech Television or the General Health Insurance Company, the institutions you criticize?
I would like CEZ to be a transparent company.
So far, he's done what he wanted for years, thanks to commissions for traditional political parties.
All you have to do is find out Mr. Schwarzenberg's remarks.
Although the state is to be in the ČEZ majority, he never ran it, it was only there for the count, which is wrong.
For me, it's a trivial matter.
ČEZ is to take Dukovany, to apprise them, to put them in a subsidiary, arrange financing, to do a supply competition or to get a co-vestor and build a new nuclear block.
The concept that the state is to finance and build new nuclear blocks is absurd.
And Czech Television?
Some of her shows are conducting a permanent purpose campaign against me, but I don't have, and I don't have any competence to fire anyone.
But control it, yes.
I don't want to control anyone.
I'm just saying that citizens pay fees of around 7.2 billion a year for public radio and television, but they don't really know how these institutions run.
How come they don't know?
After all, the House approves a report on their management, which has a direct influence on the positions of the CEO of ČT and ČRo.
Look at the news being discussed, the super power pact of Sobotka Kalousek, which has always worked.
This is true both of the current parliamentary commission for leaks from the investigation files and at the lex Babiš.
And Sobotka was so stupid that he allowed himself to be pushed by Kalousek to get me out of the government, which passed a percentage of TOP 09, but the CSSD took them off.
They are afraid of disrupting their corrupt system, they are talking about threatening democracy with Babiš.
No one is immune.
What do you say to the articles describing how ANO First Vice-President Jaroslav Faltýnek is building a position of power by installing his son on the supervisory board of Tepláren Brno and arranging the related lawyer Květoslav Hlín's contracts with city and state-owned companies such as the Prague Transport Company or Czech Railways?
That's where we have a permanent dispute.
I don't like it, and I reproached him a few times.
The Falloon argues that the lawyer in question works at significantly lower rates and is reliable.
I wouldn't do it that way.
As Treasury Secretary, I had no one.
We, unlike the socans, have never had a corruption scandal, no Pelta, Kratochvilova, Brezina.
If there was any sign of patronage in our country, we immediately fired such a person.
In this respect, I am uncompromising.
If something like this happened, we'll get rid of anyone, it doesn't really matter who it is.
